Many Hindus focus upon impersonal Absolute (Brahman) which is genderless. Other Hindu traditions conceive God as androgynous (both female and male), alternatively as either male or female, while cherishing gender henotheism, that is without denying the existence of other Gods in either gender.John Renard (1999), Responses to 101 Questions on Hinduism, Paulist, , pages 74-76, Hinduism Today, Hawaii The Shakti tradition conceives of God as a female. Other Bhakti traditions of Hinduism have both male and female gods. In ancient and medieval Indian mythology, each masculine deva of the Hindu pantheon is partnered with a feminine who is often a devi.The Concept of Shakti: Hinduism as a Liberating Force for Women by Frank Morales History Male and female deities are extensively mentioned in the Vedas. The earliest mandalas (\\"Books\\"; the authorship of each mandala is traditionally ascribed to a particular rishi or that rishi's family) of the Rigveda, estimated to have been composed sometime in the 2nd millennium BCE, invoke and praise both gods and goddesses. Ushas (\\"Goddess of Dawns\\") is praised in twenty Hymns of Chapters VI.64, VI.65, VII.78 and X.172, with Hymn VI.64.5 declaring goddess Ushas as the one who must be worshipped first.Rigveda Hymn VI.64.5, HH Wilson (Translator), Trubner & Co London, page 7 Goddesses, other than Ushas, mentioned in early Vedic literature include Prthivi (earth), Aditi (mother of gods, abundance), Sarasvati (river, nourishment), Vac (sound and speech), and Nirrti (death, destruction). Similarly male gods feature prominently in the Vedas, with Indra (rain, lightning), Agni (fire), Varuna (rta, law), Dyaus (sky, virility), Savitr (Surya, sun), and Soma (drink) some of the most mentioned. The two deities most mentioned in Rigveda are Indra and Agni, both male.David R. Kinsley (1986), Hindu Goddesses: Visions of the Divine Feminine in the Hindu Religious Tradition, University of California Press, , pages 6-8 Surya is the third most revered god, again a male.William Joseph Wilkins, , London Missionary Society, Calcutta Each is mentioned, anywhere rain and fire is evoked. They are profusely praised, with ceremonies and prayers to all gods and goddesses symbolically organized around fire (Agni yajna). The hymns seek strengthening of fire, and it is god Indra who increases the energy of the fire, while god Surya increases his brightness. Max Muller states that, while there are difference in frequency of mentions, gods and goddesses in Rig veda are \\"neither superior nor inferior; almost every one is represented as supreme and absolute\\". Gross states that ancient and medieval Hindu literature is richly endowed with gods, goddesses and androgynous representations of God.RM Gross (1978), Hindu Female Deities as a Resource for the Contemporary Rediscovery of the Goddess, Journal of the American Academy of Religion, Vol. 46, No. 3 (Sep., 1978), pages 269-291 This, states Gross, is in contrast with several monotheistic religions, where God is often synonymous with \\"He\\" and theism is replete with male anthropomorphisms. In Hinduism, goddess-imagery does not mean loss of male-god, rather the ancient literature presents the two genders as balancing each other and complementary. The Goddesses in Hinduism, states Gross, are strong, beautiful and confident, symbolizing their vitality in cycle of life. While masculine Gods are symbolically represented as those who act, the feminine Goddesses are symbolically portrayed as those who inspire action. Goddesses in Hinduism are envisioned as the patrons of arts, culture, nurture, learning, arts, joys, spirituality and liberation.David R. Kinsley (1986), Hindu Goddesses: Visions of the Divine Feminine in the Hindu Religious Tradition, University of California Press, God is not either male or female concept in ancient Indian literature. Androgynous concepts of god are common place as well. =Brahman= Most major schools of Hindu philosophy focus their philosophical discourse on the Universal Absolute, called Brahman, which is a grammatically genderless noun.Heinrich Robert Zimmer (1972), Myths and Symbols in Indian Art and Civilization, Princeton University Press, , pages 123-128 This Universal Absolute, states Zimmer, is \\"beyond the differentiating qualifications of sex, beyond any and all limitations, individualizing characteristics whatsoever\\". The Brahman is the Great Cosmic Spirit, the Ultimate True Reality, the Supreme Self. It is a transcendental concept that includes all virtues, forms, genders, characteristics, capacities, knowledge and being-ness. The history of the genderless concept of Brahman, as the omnipresent Absolute Spirit and Supreme Self, can be traced back to Vedas, and extensively in the earliest Upanishads, such as hymns 1.4.10 and 4.4.5 of Brihadaranyaka Upanishad,Original Sanskrit: ‡§¨‡•É‡§π‡§¶‡§æ‡§∞‡§£‡•ç‡§Ø‡§ï‡•ã‡§™‡§®‡§ø‡§∑‡§¶‡•ç Wikisource; English Translation Hymn 1.4.10: Brihadaranyaka Upanishad - 1.4.10 pages 145-146; English Translation Hymn 4.4.5: Brihadaranyaka Upanishad - 4.4.5 pages 712-713; and hymn 6.2.1 of Chandogya Upanishad 6.2.1.Original Sanskrit: ‡§∏‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ‡§Ç ‡§ñ‡§≤‡•ç‡§µ‡§ø‡§¶‡§Ç ‡§¨‡•ç‡§∞‡§π‡•ç‡§Æ ‡§§‡§ú‡•ç‡§ú‡§≤‡§æ‡§®‡§ø‡§§‡§ø ‡§∂‡§æ‡§®‡•ç‡§§ ‡§â‡§™‡§æ‡§∏‡•Ä‡§§ ‡•§ ‡§Ö‡§• ‡§ñ‡§≤‡•Å ‡§ï‡•ç‡§∞‡§§‡•Å‡§Æ‡§Ø‡§É ‡§™‡•Å‡§∞‡•Å‡§∑‡•ã ‡§Ø‡§•‡§æ‡§ï‡•ç‡§∞‡§§‡•Å‡§∞‡§∏‡•ç‡§Æ‡§ø‡§Å‡§≤‡•ç‡§≤‡•ã‡§ï‡•á ‡§™‡•Å‡§∞‡•Å‡§∑‡•ã ‡§≠‡§µ‡§§‡§ø ‡§§‡§•‡•á‡§§‡§É ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡•á‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø ‡§≠‡§µ‡§§‡§ø ‡§∏ ‡§ï‡•ç‡§∞‡§§‡•Å‡§Ç ‡§ï‡•Å‡§∞‡•ç‡§µ‡•Ä‡§§ ‡•• ‡•ß ‡•• (‡§õ‡§æ‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡•ã‡§ó‡•ç‡§Ø‡•ã‡§™‡§®‡§ø‡§∑‡§¶‡•ç Wikisource); English Translation 1: All this indeed is Brahman. From It the universe comes forth, in It the universe merges, and in It the universe breathes. Therefore a man should meditate on Brahman with a calm mind. Now, a man consists of free will. As he wills in this world, so does he become. Let him, with this knowledge in mind, form his free will. (Chandogya Upanishad The Sandilya Doctrine - 3.14.1); English Translation 2: Chandogya Upanishad III.xiv.1 GN Jha (Translator), page 151 Zimmer clarifies the notion of gender in Sanskrit language and its relation to the concepts of Brahman and God in Hinduism, as follows: Mythology Hindu mythology incorporates numerous devas (gods) and devis (goddesses). These are symbolic stories that synthesize God and gender, with ideas and values. The Vishnu Purana, for example, recites one such myth describes gods and goddesses with names that are loaded with symbolism. An excerpt of the story is as follows, Examples = Smarta and Advaita = The Smarta tradition, which by and large, follows Advaita philosophy believes all forms, male and female, to be different forms of the impersonal Absolute, Brahman which is of neuter gender and can never be defined. Brahman is viewed as without personal attributes (Nirguna Brahman) or with attributes (Saguna Brahman, equated with Ishvara) as God. In Advaita Vedanta, Ishvara is Brahman. Thus according to Smarta views, the divine can be with attributes, Saguna Brahman, and also be viewed with whatever attributes, (e.g., a goddess) a devotee conceives. =Siva and Vishnu= In Vaishnavism and Shaivism,Dvaita Documentation: Vaishnava FAQShaivam - An Introduction God, Vishnu or Shiva respectively, is personified as male. God, however, transcends gender in these sub-schools, and the male form is used as an icon to help focus the Puja (worship). The use of icons is not restricted to male forms. It takes various forms and shapes. The Shaivites and Vaishnavites worship God in non- anthropomorphic, symbolic male-female images as well, such as the linga-yoni and Saligram respectively. In their literature, the principle of God's true nature as sexless is emphasized as in the Vishnu sahasranama. Thus, the first few names, of Vishnu sahasranama, in particular, do not describe features of Vishnu in detail and hence are not anthropomorphic. = Shakti = Shaktism, on the other hand, is a denomination of Hinduism that worships Shakti, or Devi Mata‚Äîthe Hindu name for the Great Divine Mother‚Äîin all of her forms whilst not rejecting the importance of masculine and neuter divinity (which are however deemed to be inactive in the absence of the Shakti). In pure Shaktism, the Great Goddess, or Devi, is worshiped. N. N. Bhattacharyya explained that \\"[those] who worship the Supreme Deity exclusively as a Female Principle are called Shakta. Alternative interpretations of Shaktism, however‚Äîprimarily those of Shaivite scholars, such as Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami‚Äîargue that the feminine manifest is ultimately only the vehicle through which the masculine Un-manifest Parasiva is ultimately reached. = Radha Krishna = The common separation of Sakti and Saktiman, i.e. Female and Male principle in god arrives at the conclusion Sakti and Saktiman are the same.Surendranath Dasgupta, A History of Indian Philosophy (1991) p. 31 Each and every god has its partner, 'better-half' or Sakti and without this Sakti he is sometimes viewed being without essential power.Santilata Dei, Del Santilata, Vaisnavism in Orissa (1988) p. 167 In some Bhakti schools, devotees of Hinduism worship both genders as a God-pair, rather than a specific gender.Kakoli Basak, (1991) Rabindranath Tagore, a Humanist - p. 11 From the Vaishnava point of view the divine feminine energy (Shakti) implies a divine source of energy, i.e. God as shaktiman. \\"Sita relates to Rama; Lakshmi belongs to Narayana; Radha has Her Krishna.\\" The female, in these pairs, is viewed as the source of energy and essence of the male.Dave Symmons (1998), This is Hinduism, Nelson Thornes, , page 20Stella Kramrisch (1975), The Indian Great Goddess, History of Religions, Vol. 14, No. 4, pages 260-263 One of the prominent features of Vaishnavism in Manipur, for example, is the worship of the two genders together. Devotees do not worship Krishna alone, or Radha alone, but Radha- Krishna.Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature - p. 4290, Amaresh Datta, Mohan Lal,1994 Rasa and other dances are a feature of the regional folk and religious tradition and often, for example, a female dancer will portray both 'male' Krishna and his consort, Radha, in the same piece.

He was drafted by the Arizona Cardinals in the 2004 NFL Draft and played for the Cardinals in 2004 and 2005. Early years Navarre was born in Cudahy, Wisconsin, a Milwaukee suburb, in 1980. He attended Cudahy High School where he had a record of 33-4 as the starting quarterback for the football team. University of Michigan Navarre enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1999 and played college football for head coach Lloyd Carr's Michigan Wolverines football teams from 2000 to 2003. With Tom Brady and Drew Henson as the two leading quarterbacks in 1999, Navarre redshirted. On that year's roster, Navarre was listed at 6'6\\" and weighed 220 pounds. To begin the 2000 season, Henson sustained an injury in practice that required redshirt-freshman Navarre to start under center against Michigan's first opponent, Bowling Green. In his first career start, Navarre threw for four touchdowns, a school record for a first-time starting quarterback and the most ever in a season opener. The four touchdown passes also tied a school record at the time. Navarre's play in the opener earned him Big Ten Conference Offensive Player of the Week. Navarre continued his role as starting quarterback as Henson continued to be sidelined by injury, getting his second start against Rice. Michigan went on the road against #14 UCLA and lost, 23-20\\\\. The following week, Michigan began Big Ten play against #19 Illinois. While Navarre started his fourth game in a row, Henson replaced him late in the first half. Navarre saw limited action at quarterback the rest of the season, ending the season with 583 passing yards and 8 touchdowns in 10 games. Shortly after Michigan's win against Auburn in the 2001 Citrus Bowl, Henson announced he would come back for his senior season and forgo entering the 2001 NFL Draft. In 1998, Henson was drafted by the Major League Baseball's New York Yankees in the amateur draft and although he had already told Michigan he was returning for his senior season, he left to begin his pursuit of a Major League career. Navarre began the 2001 season as Michigan's starting quarterback, a role he kept until his last year of eligibility in 2003. In his first full season as Michigan's starting quarterback, Navarre threw for 2,345 yards and 19 touchdowns. Michigan ended the regular season 8-3 before going on to lose their Citrus Bowl match-up with Tennessee, snapping the school's four- game bowl win streak. In the loss, Navarre threw for 240 yards and two touchdowns. In his junior season, Navarre led Michigan to a 9-3 regular season record before a showcase performance in the Outback Bowl, where he threw for a career-high 319 yards and one touchdown en route to 38-30 win over Florida and a 10-3 record to end the season. On October 4, 2003, at Kinnick Stadium, he established the school single-game record for most passing yards: 389 vs. Iowa. The record stood until Devin Gardner totaled 503 yards on October 19, 2013 against Indiana. In his senior campaign, Navarre again led Michigan to a 10-3 overall record, and the team's first Rose Bowl appearance since the 1997 season. During the regular season, Navarre amassed 3,331 passing yards and 24 touchdowns, posting wins over Michigan rivals, Notre Dame, 38-0, and Ohio State, 35-21. The Wolverines finished the season against USC, ranked #1 in both polls, in the Rose Bowl. In the 28-14 loss, Navarre had played his last game as a quarterback at Michigan, gaining 271 passing yards and one touchdown on 27 completions in 46 attempts. =Michigan records= Navarre holds the following Michigan football records: * Most pass attempts in a season: 456 (2003) * Most pass completions in a season: 270 (2003) * Most passing yards in a season: 3,331 (2003) * Most touchdown passes in a game: 4 (tied for second, broken by Jake Ruddock with 6 TDs in 2015), three occasions (2000, vs. Bowling Green; 2002, vs. Western Michigan and vs. Illinois) * Most total offensive plays in a season: 504 (2003) Navarre held several Michigan career passing records including those for attempts, completions, and passing yards before Chad Henne surpassed those marks in 2007. He also held the records for most total offensive yards gained in a game (368 vs. Iowa in 2003) and in a season (3,240 in 2003) before being surpassed by Denard Robinson in 2010. In 2003, Navarre led the Wolverines to their largest comeback in school history, overcoming a 21-point deficit as they defeated Minnesota, 38‚Äì35. Professional career Navarre was drafted in the seventh round of the 2004 NFL Draft by the Arizona Cardinals and served as their third-string quarterback for the 2004 through 2005 seasons. He started one game for the Cardinals in 2004, throwing four interceptions and one touchdown in a losing effort against the Detroit Lions. Navarre appeared in five games in his three- year NFL career; his debut was December 5, 2004.

The Four-Step Impact Assessment: # To what extent does the proposed policy or program represent ‚Äúgood public health‚Äù? # Is the proposed policy or program respectful and protective of human rights? # How can we achieve the best possible combination of public health and human rights quality? ## How serious is the public health problem? ## Is the proposed response likely to be effective? ## What are the severity, scope and duration of the burdens on human rights resulting from the proposed policy or program? ## To what extent is the proposed policy or program restrictive and intrusive? ## Is the proposed policy or program over inclusive or under inclusive? ## What procedural safeguards are included in the proposed policy or program? ## Will the proposed policy or program be periodically reviewed to assess both its public health effectiveness and its impact on human rights? Identify specific changes to the proposed policy or program that increase its human rights and/or public health quality while maintaining (or even strengthening) its public health effectiveness. # Finally, does the proposed policy or program (as revised) still appear to be the optimal approach to the public health problem? As a way to visualize the intersection of both health and human rights, this table places Human Rights Quality on the Y-axis, and Public Health Quality on the X-axis. The levels or rank of both measures are graphically displayed at some point in the cartesian plane. The organizations that jointly supported this framework consisted of Mann‚Äôs Francois Xavier Bagnoud Center for Health and Human Rights, the International Federation of Red Cross, and Red Crescent Societies.  Background and development  Mann was a central advocate of combining the synergistic forces of public health, ethics and human rights. He theorized and actively promoted the idea that human health and human rights are integrally and inextricably connected, arguing that these fields overlap in their respective philosophies and objectives to improve health, well-being, and to prevent premature death.Gostin LO. Public Health, Ethics, and Human Rights: A Tribute to the late Jonathan Mann. Journal of Law, Medicine & Ethics. 2001. 28:121-130. In his work, Mann proposed a three-pronged approach that has appropriately acted as a fundamental explanation of the relationship between health and human rights. First, health is a human rights issue. Secondly (and conversely), human rights are a health issue. Human rights violations result in adverse health effects.Schusky RW. Jonathan's Mantle. Lancet. 1998. 352(9145):2025. Thirdly, linkages exist between health and human rights (a hypothesis to be rigorously tested).Mann JM, Gruskin S, Grodin MA and Annas GJ, eds., Health and Human Rights: A Reader New York: Routledge. 1999:11‚Äì18. Literature substantiates the effects of the first two points, but Mann and colleagues proceeded to call for the validation of the third point and challenged the world to practice it.Mann JM, Gruskin S, Grodin MA and Annas GJ, eds., Health and Human Rights: A Reader New York: Routledge, 1999:7. With this framework, Mann attempted to bridge a perceived gap of philosophies, correspondence and vocabulary, education and training, recruitment, and work methods between the disciplines of bioethics, jurisprudence, public health law and epidemiology. Furthermore, Mann knew that the history of ‚Äúconflictual relationships‚Äù between officials of public health and civil liberties workers presented challenges to the pursuit of what he called a ‚Äúpowerful‚Äù confluence of health and human rights ‚Äì a positive approach.4 While conflict between disciplines exists, Mann thought it important to first raise awareness of these challenges. In the spirit of negotiation and acting as mediator, Mann pointed out that such an intersection of fields can only benefit if a common ground in philosophies is uncovered and planted with a flag of cooperation.

Until October 2013, she served as weekday morning anchor at KNBC-TV in Los Angeles. From September, 2003 until January, 2008, she was co-anchor of the weekday evening newscasts on KYW-TV in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Lane's contract with KYW-TV was terminated shortly after being arrested for allegedly striking a New York police officer and calling her a homophobic slur. Background Lane, a native of Lake Grove, New York, is of Puerto Rican descent on her mother's side and Welsh descent on her father's. She has a master's degree in Broadcast Journalism from the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University, and an undergraduate degree from the State University of New York at Albany, where she graduated with honors. She is a member of the National Association of Hispanic Journalists and speaks fluent Spanish. Lane has been married twice and gave birth to a daughter in June 2014. Career Lane's television career began while completing her master's degree at Northwestern University, serving as a Washington, D.C.-based reporter for KSNT in Topeka, Kansas. After completing her studies, she returned to her native New York and joined Cablevision-owned News 12 the Bronx, where she served as an anchor and reporter. Among the stories she covered there was the 1999 shooting of African immigrant Amadou Diallo, who was shot to death by four New York City police officers. In 2000, Lane moved to Miami, after being hired as a reporter for Fox affiliate WSVN. She joined a rival station, NBC-owned WTVJ a year later, and spent two years there before moving to Philadelphia and CBS-owned KYW-TV in September 2003. KYW-TV paired her with Larry Mendte on their 11 o'clock newscast. Mendte had been wooed away from rival WCAU-TV where he led the station to #1 in the ratings in some newscast slots for the first time in 30 years. By early 2004 KYW-TV had experienced \\"an amazing 61%\\" rise in the show's ratings. In 2005, she was awarded a local Emmy Award for co-hosting the annual \\"Holiday Traditions\\" special. After her stint at KYW-TV, Lane moved to Los Angeles in July 2009 and was hired by NBC affiliate KNBC on August 18. She debuted on the air August 29 in the weekend evening anchor chair, replacing Kim Baldonado. In February 2010, Lane became co-anchor of Today in LA on KNBC. In 2011, Lane received a National Edward R. Murrow Award for Writing on a special story about a mysterious disorder called 'Angelman Syndrome'. In addition, she has won multiple Emmy Awards at KNBC, along with two Golden Mic Awards. In October 2013, KNBC announced that Lane was no longer employed by the station. Scandals =Bikini pictures= In May 2007, Lane became the center of a national media story when reports surfaced that she emailed pictures of herself and friends, in bikinis, to the NFL Network's Rich Eisen, via an account that he shared with his wife, Suzy Shuster. Shuster's email response became public. Lane insisted that the pictures were harmless and that she and Eisen have been \\"purely platonic\\" friends \\"for almost 10 years\\", and that they \\"regularly exchange e-mail and photos\\". In June 2010, CBS released emails between Lane and Eisen that suggested something more than a friendly relationship. The emails were released as part of a pre-trial motion in Lane's wrongful termination suit against CBS. =Assault charges= Lane was arrested in the early morning hours of December 16, 2007, in New York City, accused of physically and verbally assaulting a female police officer, as well as making homophobic comments, calling the officer a \\"fucking dyke\\". Lane was charged with one felony count of assault on a police officer. The criminal case was effectively closed on February 25, 2008, when a New York judge dropped the felony assault charges against her and reduced Lane's charges to misdemeanors. The case was then adjourned, with an additional provision that the charges against Lane would be dropped on the condition that she is not arrested, at any time, over the next six months. A New York City Police Association expressed \\"outrage\\" over the reduction and dismissal of charges against Lane.name=\\"New York Newsday\\" Dismissal from KYW-TV  On January 7, 2008, while suspended from KYW-TV for the assault on a New York police officer, the station announced that Lane had been released from her contract. In a statement, the station explained that the decision to terminate Lane, stating: > After assessing the overall impact of a series of incidents resulting from > judgments she has made ... we have concluded that it would be impossible for > Alycia to continue to report the news as she, herself, has become the focus > of so many news stories. Lane's legal counsel, Paul Rosen, subsequently released a statement which challenged the station's reasoning: > The termination comes at a time when there has been absolutely no > determination that Alycia is guilty of any wrongful conduct, and after KYW- > TV has aired her categorical denial of the alleged charge that is pending > against her. The termination is unfair because Alycia has never had an > opportunity to defend against this charge, and tell her side of the story > publicly, before KYW-TV has taken this unusual and unwarranted step to > terminate her employment. On January 30, 2008, Lane's lawyers filed a writ of summons on her behalf, a preemptive move towards a lawsuit against KYW-TV in connection with her dismissal.Lane v. CBS Broadcasting, Inc. On February 19, 2008, lawyers for CBS, KYW-TV's parent company, sought to move Lane's state court writ to the U.S. District Court in Philadelphia, though a provision in Lane's contract which stated that employment disputes were to be handled in New York, where the network is headquartered. On June 19, 2008, Lane filed suit against KYW-TV and station manager Michael Colleran alleging that she was exploited and defamed. On December 12, 2013, Lane's lawsuit against CBS was dismissed after a hearing determined that Lane purposely destroyed evidence in the case. Philadelphia Common Pleas Court Judge Alan Tereshko found that Lane \\"intentionally\\" disposed of her laptop computer, the single most important piece of evidence in the case, and then \\"invented a story\\" which was a \\"wholesale fabrication\\" to cover her actions. Tereshko ruled that it would be impossible for CBS to defend itself without Lane's laptop. In March, Tereshko also dismissed Lane's lawsuit against Mendte for the same reason.  E-mail incident  On May 31, 2008, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that Larry Mendte, Alycia Lane's former co-anchor, was under investigation by the FBI for allegedly reading Lane's private e-mail, and for feeding her private information to gossip columnists over the years including Dan Gross of the Philadelphia Daily News. On July 21, 2008, Mendte was charged with one felony count of intentionally accessing a protected computer without authorization. In August 2008 Mendte pleaded guilty and in November 2008 he was sentenced to three years probation, six months home confinement. Alycia Lane sued Larry Mendte, CBS, and the former general manager of KYW-TV over the incident. In December 2012 the suit against CBS was thrown out after the judge found that Alycia Lane had destroyed evidence.https://nypost.com/2012/12/14/philadelphia- anchorwomans-lawsuit-tossed-out/ The suit against Mendte was settled in 2016.https://www.inquirer.com/philly/news/alycia-lane-cbs-lawsuit-settled- over-email-snooping.html References Category:Television anchors from Los Angeles Category:Television anchors from Philadelphia Category:American people of Puerto Rican descent Category:American people of Welsh descent Category:Medill School of Journalism alumni Category:People from Suffolk County, New York Category:University at Albany, SUNY alumni Category:1972 births Category:Living people Category:Journalists from New York (state) Category:20th-century American journalists Category:21st-century American journalists ","title":"Alycia Lane"},{"id":"3424315","text":"Lisa Thomas-Laury (born July 19, 1954) is a retired news presenter in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States. Ms. Thomas-Laury started at WPVI-TV in Philadelphia on February 20, 1978, as noon co-anchor and reporter. In 1983, she was promoted to the 5 p.m. newscast, co-anchoring it until 2003 with now- retired news anchor Marc Howard. At the same time, she frequently substituted for Jim Gardner when he was unable to anchor the 6 and 11 p.m. newscasts. She also has done the monthly Fast Forward series, a show geared toward teenagers; it is currently hosted by Rick Williams. She has taken over the African- American-oriented, locally produced Visions program (now named New Visions) from Vernon Odom. Thomas-Laury is also theorized to have been the inspiration for the character \\"Maria\\" from the Guess Who? board game. Although she denies this rumor, she has admitted to sitting as a model for the illustrator of the popular game. The connection, she claims, is purely coincidental. Thomas-Laury is one of a few African American women to anchor in the Philadelphia market, a group that currently includes WPVI anchor Tamala Edwards, former WCAU anchor Renee Chenault-Fattah, KYW anchor Natasha Brown, and WTXF anchor Joyce Evans. She retired on Wednesday, May 25, 2016. In 2017, she wrote a memoir is titled: \\"On Camera and Off, When the News is Good and When it's Not\\". She spent most of 2017 on a regional book tour.http://6abc.com/entertainment/-lisa-thomas- laury-pens-memoir-/2556200/  Medical leave  In 2002, Thomas-Laury began to experience health problems. Her first symptoms were tingling in her feet, which she assumed was from too much power walking. Her problem was initially misdiagnosed. According to a WPVI special report from November, 2005, Lisa finally ended up at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, where she got the right diagnosis: she was suffering from POEMS Syndrome, which can cause nerve damage, organ enlargement, hormonal imbalances, and skin changes. She went on medical leave from Action News for almost a year and returned to work on September 11, 2003. She was scheduled to return to hosting the annual Thanksgiving Day parade, which she had missed in 2002, but her health problems returned, causing her to miss the parade again and return to medical leave. In May 2004, Jim Gardner announced on the air that Lisa Thomas-Laury would be permanently leaving her anchor duties (but not leaving WPVI altogether, as Gardner said that the door would be open for her to return when her health permitted) in order to have more time to focus on her recovery. In 2016, she retired from WPVI after a 38-year career at the station. Announced return to broadcasting During WPVI's 11:00 p.m. newscast on November 22, 2006, Lisa Thomas-Laury made a guest appearance and announced that she would return to the station in the next few weeks. She appeared the following day, November 23, 2006, during the broadcast of Philadelphia's annual Thanksgiving Day parade, the parade she once co-hosted. She returned to Action News on January 2, 2007, with a report on the opening of Oprah Winfrey's school for girls in South Africa. Since that time, Thomas-Laury has frequently filed reports for the noon, 5 p.m., 6 p.m., and 11 p.m. newscasts and has also filled in on them as anchor. The Broadcast Pioneers of Philadelphia inducted Thomas-Laury into their Hall of Fame in 2009.

Bowsher High School was constructed in the early 1960s at the intersection of Glanzman and Detroit in Toledo, Ohio. Its replacement (opened 2009) is at the corner of Arlington and Detroit, north of the original site. It is part of the Toledo Public Schools. Background Bowsher High School's original building opened in September 1962 at 3548 S. Detroit Avenue, just north of Glanzman Road. It was named for Edward Leslie Bowsher (1890‚Äì1974), Superintendent of the Toledo Public Schools from the late 1930s until his retirement in 1958. A new structure was built as a replacement at the corner of Detroit and Arlington, about 1.5 miles north of the original location, opening for students at the start of the 2008/2009 school year. It is home to the Rebels and has about one thousand four hundred students. The construction of the new school is part of Toledo Public Schools' \\"Building for Success\\" program, which aims to renovate the majority of Toledo Public's schools by 2010. The class of 2009 became the first graduating class of the new building. The current Athletic Stadium will stay and not be moved to the new location. As of October 2010 the student population of Bowsher is now at around 1,400 students, the jump in enrollment is mainly due to the closing of Libbey High School. Marching Band Bowsher High School's band is known as the TBA. They perform at the football games (pregame, halftime, and during the game), the basketball games, known as the Pep Band. Their uniform colors are the same of the school colors, red and Columbia blue. The colors changed slightly, putting the color black in the uniform. The Pep Band has been canceled due to the budget cuts from Toledo Public Schools. Clubs and activities Bowsher offers several after school activities: Bible Study, Knitting club, Language clubs, dancing, etc. The school's Latin Club functions as a local chapter of both the Ohio Junior Classical League (OJCL) The school's German Club, run by teacher Anthony Dodge, has been a wide growing part of the school.

The station's morning show, hosted by shock jock Johnny Dare, is regularly ranked atop the local Arbitron ratings. Its studios are located in Mission, Kansas, and the transmitter site is in South Kansas City. The station, with the brand name 98.9 The Rock, broadcasts a Mainstream Rock format consisting of Hard rock and Heavy metal acts. They tend to play heavier rock than modern rock/alternative rock sister station KRBZ with such artists as Disturbed, Godsmack, Staind and Shinedown mixed with older rock acts like Black Sabbath, Guns N' Roses, AC/DC, Def Leppard and Van Halen. Metallica is frequently played, including a featured \\"Mandatory Metallica\\" with three consecutive songs by the band. The station plays \\"The Pit,\\" which is an hour of heavy metal and death metal. The Rock airs two nationally syndicated shows on Sundays--The House of Hair with Dee Snider, & the rock news show HardDrive with Lou Brutus. The rest of the station's schedule features normal airplay. Every summer KQRC hosts Rockfest, currently the largest single-day music festival in North America. Past headliners include Disturbed, Godsmack, Staind, Seether, Stone Temple Pilots, and Korn. On September 26, 2010, KQRC was the first FM radio station in the country to release an app for the iOS operating system (Apple mobile devices) that offered an events list with Google Mapping, and push messaging. History The 98.9 MHz frequency shuffled between formats when it first went on the air in 1962. Licensed to Leavenworth, the station began as KCLO-FM, a religious/MOR outlet simulcasting with its AM sister station on 1410. In 1979, it became a country station as KTRO. In December 1982, KTRO became \\"ZZ 99\\", KZZC. They competed heavily against the city's already existing Top 40 outlet KBEQ-FM by emphasizing on newer music in comparison to KBEQ's oldies lean. The station also was home to Kansas City legendary DJ Randy Miller in morning drive. On August 25, 1986, due to financial trouble, the station flipped to an automated oldies outlet as \\"98.9 Gold\\" with the KZZC call letters still in place.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1980s/1986/RR-1986-08-08.pdf On September 24, 1987, at Noon, \\"98.9 The Wave\\" debuted with a new age (a precursor to the smooth jazz format) and easy listening format, competing with a multitude of AC stations.

He was a member of the Sanderson family of Orangeville, Ontario, which has produced a number of lacrosse players and coaches. Sanderson began his NLL coaching career in 2000 with the Albany Attack. He coached the Attack for two seasons, compiling an 11-15 record. After the 2001 season, Sanderson resigned in order to take the head coach and GM position for the expansion Montreal Express. The Express only lasted a single season before folding. In 2002, Sanderson replaced his brother Lindsay as head coach of the Ottawa Rebel. The Rebel finished the 2003 season dead last in the NLL at 4-12, and folded after the season. Sanderson was inducted into the Canadian Lacrosse Hall of Fame as a builder in 2015. The Toronto Rock Before the 2004 season began, Toronto Rock head coach and GM Les Bartley announced that he would not be behind the bench for the upcoming season due to his battle with colon cancer, and assistant coaches Ed Comeau and Derek Keenan were promoted to interim head coach and GM respectively. However, after beginning the season 2-4, Comeau and Keenan were fired, and Terry Sanderson was hired as the new GM and head coach. Sanderson turned the Rock around, guiding them to a 10-6 record and first place in the Eastern Division. They lost to Buffalo 19-10 in the division finals. During the off- season, Sanderson made a blockbuster trade with GM Johnny Mouradian of the San Jose Stealth (himself a former Rock GM), acquiring his son Josh, nephew Phil, and Rusty Kruger for fan favourite Steve Toll, Darryl Gibson, two draft picks, and a player to be named later, who ended up being goaltender Anthony Cosmo. Any cries of \\"nepotism\\" were silenced during the next season, as Josh set a new single-season assists record with 71, and the Rock finished 12-4 and in first place in the Eastern division for the seventh straight year. They defeated the Rochester Knighthawks in the division finals, and then beat the Arizona Sting in the Championship game, held in Toronto, to win their fifth NLL championship in seven years. Former coach and GM Les Bartley died the day after the Championship game. 2006 was a disappointing season for the Rock, finishing with their worst record ever, 8-8, and losing to Rochester in the division semi-finals. Less than two weeks after the end of the regular season, Sanderson was fired. 2007 and beyond Sanderson worked with his brother Lindsay once again during the 2007 season. Lindsay, the head coach and GM of the Philadelphia Wings, hired Terry as an assistant coach. Both were relieved of their coaching duties after the season as the Wings missed the playoffs for the fifth consecutive year. On July 17, 2007, Sanderson was hired by the Calgary Roughnecks to be their defensive coach for the 2008 NLL season. On June 10, 2009, after two seasons in Calgary, including the 2009 championship season, Sanderson was re-hired by the Rock as their new GM and assistant coach.http://www.torontorock.com/page/terry-sanderson On November 13, 2014, Toronto Rock owner, Jamie Dawick, announced that Sanderson would be taking an indefinite leave of absence from his role as General Manager, with Dawick serving as the interim General Manager in his place.http://www.torontorock.com/article/statement-from-jamie-dawick- regarding-terry-sanderson Death On November 27, 2014, Toronto Rock owner, Jamie Dawick, confirmed, via Twitter, that Sanderson had died due to health issues.http://www.cbc.ca/sports/terry-sanderson-toronto-rock-gm-dies- at-62-1.2853095 Personal life Sanderson owned and operated Sanderson's Source for Sports, a hockey and lacrosse equipment store located in Orangeville.

The Fourmile narrow gauge track was active from the 1880s until 1919.  2010 wildfire  Fourmile Canyon fire smoke plume as seen from Longmont, Colorado on Monday, September 6. = Timeline =  Day One: Monday, September 6, 2010  An improperly extinguished fire pit reignited at approx. 10:00 a.m. on the property of a volunteer firefighter, who had been burning brush in the pit a few days earlier. Within minutes, a wildfire started consuming the canyon forest near Emerson Gulch. Winds of 15 mph with gusts to 41 mph, combined with very low humidity of 7 percent and decreasing, enabled 20 to high flames to spread quickly. Multiple Fire Protection Districts responded to the area, as well as units from the Colorado State Forest Service, U.S. Forest Service, Boulder County, and the City of Boulder. Residents were evacuated and all roads into the fire zone were closed. At Rocky Mountain Metropolitan Airport in Broomfield, two aircraft tankers each with 2,000 gallons of fire retardant took off at 5:20 p.m., beginning a multi-day aerial firefighting campaign. Winds eased in the late afternoon, making it possible for the airplanes to drop the retardant on the periphery of the fire zone in an attempt to contain the flames. Smoke was visible across the entire Front Range northwest of Boulder. By the end of September 6, the fire had burned approximately 5,733 acres ‚Äî 93 percent of the total burn area.  Day Two: Tuesday, September 7, 2010  The fire increased by only 375 acres on September 7, bringing the total burn size to 6,108 acres. Colorado's governor, Bill Ritter, declared a state of emergency and dedicated $5 million to help the effort. 3,500 people had been evacuated and 200 firefighters from more than 35 agencies had responded. More than 92 homes had been reported destroyed by the end of the second night. Nine of the destroyed homes belonged to firefighters who were fighting the fire. An accident involving a propane tank was reported to have started the fire, but that was later determined to be hearsay.  Day Three: Wednesday, September 8, 2010  Higher relative humidity and cooler temperatures allowed firefighters to build additional fire control lines and strengthen existing ones. Fire size remained at 6,108 acres. Earlier in the day 20 people in the area were reported missing; by night fall the number had fallen to 5. The number of homes reported destroyed went up to 150, making it the second worst wildfire in Colorado history at the time.  Day Four: Thursday, September 9, 2010  The number of firefighters grew to 430. All persons reported missing had been accounted for. At 10 a.m. some residents of the affected area were allowed to return to their homes, but were forced to move back out at 2 p.m. due to high winds. Boulder County estimated the number of homes burned at 169. By 3 p.m., sustained winds of 40 miles per hour with gusts up to 64 mph were reported and relative humidity dropped below 30 percent. These conditions caused surface fuels and trees that had not previously burned within the interior of the fire to ignite. End-of-day infrared mapping calculated the fire size at 6,131 acres.  Day Five: Friday, September 10, 2010  Firefighters continued to fight the blaze. In spite of low humidity and wind gusts in the mid to high 20s (mph), no significant fire growth occurred and infrared mapping recorded the final fire size at 6,181 acres burned.  Days Six through Eleven: Saturday, September 11, to Friday, September 17, 2010  Although dry air and strong winds continued, the fire did not increase in size after September 10. The fire was declared 100% contained on September 13, and crews shifted their attention to locating and extinguishing hot spots until September 17. \\"The Boulder County Sheriff's Office has lifted evacuation orders on all subdivisions within the fire perimeter. The fire area is open to residents only. Utilities and public works continue to repair damage to infrastructure. Residents are reminded to use caution within the fire area due to the heavy fire and utility traffic in the fire area.\\" A grand total of 6,181 acres (approximately 10 square miles) burned during the Fourmile Fire. The final burned acreage was lower than what was reported during the fire as a result of better GPS mapping. = Aftermath and Long-Term Impact = Of the 474 homes inside or within 100 feet of the final wildfire perimeter, 168 (35%) were destroyed. The number of homes destroyed was the most by any wildfire in Colorado history until that total was surpassed by the High Park fire in June 2012 and then by the Waldo Canyon fire later in June 2012. Insurance claims for the fire totaled an estimated $217 million, making it the most expensive wildfire in Colorado history, as measured by insurance claims, to 2010. Total fire management costs (suppression, emergency management, and post-fire rehabilitation) are estimated at $14.1 million.

Schwartzberg (February 5, 1928 ‚Äì September 19, 2018) was an American writer, peace activist, and a world federalist, who was a tenured professor at the University of Minnesota. Author of numerous books, he was the editor and principal author of the Historical Atlas of South Asia, which in 1980 won the Watumull Prize of the American Historical Association. In 1984 the American Association of Geographers honored him with their annual award.Honors of the American Association of Geographers from American Association of Geographers His several substantial chapters in Book One of Volume Two of The History of Cartography were instrumental in that work receiving the R. R. Hawkins Award for Best Scholarly Book for 1992 from the Association of American Publishers. He served on the board of directors of the World Federalist Association, has chaired its Policy and Issues Commission, and is President of the Minnesota chapter of Citizens for Global Solutions.  Biography  = Early life = Born in Brooklyn, New York on February 5, 1928, Schwartzberg was the second of four children of Philip and Frances Schwartzberg. He, his older brother and two younger sisters were born within a span of less than six years. All six members of the family participated in the operation of their small clothing store. They lived in two rooms behind the store during the bad years of the depression and in an apartment immediately above it when times were good. Schwartzberg graduated from Erasmus Hall High School in 1945 and in 1949 from Brooklyn College (cum laude), where he majored in geology. For parts of three summers during his high school years he worked on farms to aid the war effort; but, as the war drew to a close in the summer of 1945, he hitchhiked to and through Mexico, as far as the Pacific coast town of Acapulco. In college he joined and ultimately became president of a then rare inter-racial service fraternity.J.E. Schwartzberg Autobiography (in third person) at the American Association of Geographers Shortly after earning his B.A, Schwartzberg took a position as a geographer with the Map Intelligence Branch of the U.S. Army Map Service in a suburb of Washington, D.C. and simultaneously worked for his M.A. at the University of Maryland. His master‚Äôs thesis, Old Order Amish and Stauffer Mennonite Communities in Southern Maryland, was based on field research among the communities named. This work instilled in him a love of fieldwork and an abiding interest in \\"plain people\\" and, more generally, in communities with life styles deviating from established norms. Around the same time, through Washington‚Äôs First Unitarian Church, he became familiar with the then burgeoning World Federalist movement. He has maintained his allegiance to the \\"one world\\" ideal ever since. Following the outbreak of war in Korea, Schwartzberg was drafted into the U.S. Army. Although he anticipated that he would be sent to Korea immediately on conclusion of his infantry basic training, he was assigned instead to a topographic engineering battalion headquartered in the Presidio of San Francisco. After nine months in that unit he accepted a commission as a 2nd lieutenant and was transferred to Fort Belvoir, Virginia, where he trained for work in a newly created terrain intelligence unit that was dispatched to Heidelberg, Germany in December 1952. His duties entailed extensive travel in Germany and many opportunities to improve his language skills. Conclusion of the Korean War led to a major reduction of the pool of junior army officers, enabling Schwartzberg, by then a 1st lieutenant, to accept an early overseas discharge. Thus began a period of nearly three additional years of foreign travel and residence. This period included four months in Seville, Spain (then still under the rule of Franco) in early 1953; eight months in Paris in 1953-54, studying French language and civilization at the Sorbonne (courtesy of the G.I. Bill of Rights); travels in many other parts of Europe; a month in Israel; brief sojourns in many Islamic nations in North Africa and the Middle East; a half-year touring India and other countries of South Asia (marked by visits at a number of Gandhian ashrams and government-managed community development projects; and by the start of a decades-long friendship with an itinerant holy man [sadhu]); several months in Southeast Asia; and a month in Japan. During his stay in Paris, Schwartzberg drew up a rough draft of a World Constitution, many of whose ideas were incorporated in articles and books published decades later. His federalist thinking was reinforced by his experience in India, the world‚Äôs most populous federal polity. Considering that, despite its many serious problems, meager resources and incredibly diverse population, India was able to maintain a viable democracy convinced him that a federalized world, with vastly greater resources, could do so as well. In September 1956 Schwartzberg embarked on study for a doctoral degree at the University of Wisconsin. He had by then decided to specialize in either South or Southeast Asia, and chose as his advisor the renowned geographer, Richard Hartshorne, notwithstanding the fact that Hartshorne had no Asian experience. That somehow didn‚Äôt matter. In 1958 Schwartzberg was awarded the first of two year-long fellowships from the Social Science Research Council, the first for field work in India, the second for support while writing his dissertation His field work entailed thousands of miles of travel by bicycle (accompanied by Indian interpreters) to 200 villages throughout India. His dissertation, Occupational Structure and Level of Economic Development in India: A Regional Analysis, completed in 1960, was later published as monograph no. 4 of the 1961 Census of India. = Professional Life = In 1960, Schwartzberg accepted a dual appointment at the University of Pennsylvania, joining the Wharton School‚Äôs Department of Geography and Industry and the Department of South Asia Regional Studies, the first such regionally specialized program in the United States. His contacts in the latter department greatly expanded his multi-disciplinary understanding, not only of South Asia, but also of regional studies in general. Several relevant papers on regionalism ensued, as did two seminal papers on the geography of the Indian caste system. In 1962 Schwartzberg was appointed to train, at the University of Pennsylvania, the first group of Peace Corps volunteers to be sent to Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). He accompanied that group to Ceylon for a final month of training, following which he spent almost a year in India as a Fellow of the American Institute of Indian Studies. For most of this period he expanded his research of the year 1958-59. He also worked, pro bono, for the Indian Census, drawing up detailed templates for the series of national and state atlases that thereafter formed components of the nation‚Äôs decennial censuses. During this year he met Monique Ribaux, a Swiss medical lab technician working for the malaria eradication program of the World Health Organization. They were married in Geneva in December 1963, subsequently had two sons, Philip (b. 1964) and Paul (b. 1966). They were divorced in 1998. In the spring of 1964, Schwartzberg learned of a proposal to create a Historical Atlas of South Asia at the University of Minnesota, following the bequest to that institution of the magnificent Ames Library of South Asia. Excited by that challenging initiative, he wrote a lengthy memorandum to its two principal faculty supporters specifying what he thought such an atlas should contain. This resulted in an invitation for him to come to Minnesota to join the Geography Department and edit the work. He accepted the offer, effective that December. The atlas project took much longer than anticipated, entailing numerous research grants, and requiring roughly 85 person-years of work from a multi-disciplinary team of specialists. First published by the University of Chicago Press in 1978, the work was reissued in an updated edition by the Oxford University Press in 1992, and in a digitized edition by the University of Chicago in 2006. It won the Watumull Prize of the American Historical Association, as the best work on Indian history of the 1978-79 biennium and an outstanding achievement award from the Association of American Geographers. In 1981 David Watumull observed: > ‚ÄúOver the years, since 1946 when this Prize was instituted, I can ‚Ä¶ say, > without a doubt, that this is the finest and most worthwhile book to be > selected.‚Äù What makes the work unique is its presentation, not only of the findings of modern historians of South Asia, but also its recreations of the ways in which aspects of that region were made known by numerous actors ‚Äì both South Asian and outsiders ‚Äìover more than three millennia. Publication of the atlas led to Schwartzberg‚Äôs role in what was to become an even larger (and still on-going) project, the preparation of a multi-volume History of Cartography, prepared by the History of Cartography Project at the University of Wisconsin in Madison. Apart from offering advice in planning the work, he was asked to write an article on the traditional cartographies of South Asia, a subject on which there was then virtually no extant literature. However, years of research in South Asia and neighboring regions ‚Äì in libraries, museums and private art collections, as well as in the field ‚Äì uncovered a vastly larger corpus of cartographic and cosmographic artifacts than one might have anticipated. Schwartzberg was to become the principal author and an associate editor of two volumes of the history: the award winning Cartography in the Traditional Islamic and South Asian Societies, and Cartography in the Traditional East and Southeast Asian Societies (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1992 and 1994 respectively). Both volumes are available for free access at History of Cartography Online. Schwartzberg‚Äôs additional writing in his years at Minnesota (1964-2000) took numerous forms: scores of book reviews, essays in political geography, editorials on contemporary issues and events, numerous articles on the Kashmir dispute, work on folk regions in South Asia, a short monograph relating to the history of exploration, various spin-offs from his work on the history of cartography, and major contributions to several encyclopedias, including the lengthy article on the ‚ÄúPhysical and Human Geography [of India]‚Äù for the 15th edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica on whose advisory board he subsequently served. Schwartzberg‚Äôs writings on Kashmir were focused on promoting a peaceful resolution of the multi-partite disputes over that region. They were based largely on his visits ‚Äì in 1993, 1994 and 1997 ‚Äì to all parts of that contested, ethnically diverse state. He conducted interviews, on both sides of the Indo-Pakistani line of control, with a wide range of political actors (UN personnel, civil administrators, military officers, party leaders, dissidents [some in hiding], businessmen, journalists, victims of violence, and others). While his tours in 1993 and 1994 were largely self-financed, that of 1997 was as part of a fact-finding team sponsored by and drawn from the Kashmir Study Group (KSG), a think tank made up mainly of scholars and retired diplomats, established in 1996 by Farooq Kathwari, a wealthy Kashmir-American businessman. Though the published findings and recommendations of the KSG (to which Schwartzberg was a principal contributor), were widely discussed in diplomatic circles in South Asia, North America and Europe, hawkish nationalistic spoilers ultimately prevented their adoption. The KSG still exists, but is less active than in its early years. Along with writing, Schwartzberg taught thousands of students in a variety of courses and seminars. His most popular courses were introductory human geography (a sweeping overview of how the world is constituted) and political geography (wherein one is challenged ‚Äì as in the real world ‚Äì by the necessity of striking a credible balance between idealism and realpolitik). More specialized were his offerings on South and Southeast Asia and on historical cartography. Of particular relevance for his on-going work were his seminars on ‚ÄúThe Geography of Federalism,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Law of the Sea‚Äù and ‚ÄúA Charter for the New Millennium.‚Äù In 1979-80, he held a visiting Fulbright professorship at the Center for the Study of Regional Development at Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi, during which he offered a course in population geography and a seminar on field methods. Attendance at conferences has provided Schwartzberg with abundant opportunities for travel, either en route to or returning from the conference venue. His participation at the 1992 Rio Summit Conference on the Environment and Development, for example, was followed by extensive travel in South America; and his atlas presentation at the Canberra meeting of the International Congress of Orientalists in 1971 was combined with visits to a number of Pacific Island nations. In all, Schwartzberg has traveled to approximately a hundred countries. Intermittently, Schwartzberg served as a consultant to numerous governmental and scholarly agencies in India, the United States and Canada and as a member of selection committees for various academic awards. His previously noted work for the Indian Census was instrumental in his consulting with the Mandal Commission tasked with devising a quota system for allocating jobs and educational seats for members of so- called ‚Äúother backward castes.‚Äù For three years (1985‚Äì88) Schwartzberg was the elected Secretary of the US National Commission of the International Geographic Union. In recognition of his scholarly achievements the Department of Geography nominated Schwartzberg in 1995 and in 1996 for a highly competitive Regents Professorship, the highest academic honor that the University of Minnesota can bestow. However, neither nomination resulted in success. Apart from scholarship, Schwartzberg was also heavily engaged in service activities on and off campus. On campus, he served as Chair of the Department of South Asian and Middle Eastern Studies, as an elected representative in the University Senate and in the Assembly of the College of Liberal Arts, and as a member of innumerable committees. For three years (1984‚Äì87) he directed the Minnesota Studies in International Development program, providing unpaid student internships in a number of countries of the global South. He established several programs in India and headed a delegation to Colombia, which led to a program with that nation‚Äôs Fundaci√≥n Social a business conglomerate guided by the Jesuit teachings of ‚Äúliberation theology‚Äù. For several years following the Colombia visit, Schwartzberg was among a group of activists that tried (unsuccessfully) to establish an inner-city cooperative bank based on the Fundaci√≥n model. In 2009 the University bestowed on him its annual ‚ÄúAward for Global Engagement ‚Äúand the title ‚ÄúDistinguished International Emeritus Professor.‚Äù In the public arena, Schwartzberg was also quite active. He served in various capacities in the Minnesota Chapter of the World Federalist Association (later Citizens for Global Solutions), including 14 years as its President. He was also active in several roles in the governance of WFA/CGS at the national level. He chaired WFA‚Äôs Policy and Recommendations Committee for several years prior to the establishment of CGS in 2004 and for the following decade was especially active in the World Federalist Institute, a CGS-affiliated think tank. For several decades he served as a member either of the Board, or of the Advisory Council, of the Minnesota Chapter of the United Nations Association. In 1996 Schwartzberg was one of the handful of activists who founded the Minnesota Alliance of Peacemakers, which has since grown into an umbrella institution with roughly eighty peace and justice organizational members. In the following year he was a co-founder of the aforementioned Kashmir Study Group. In 1999, he was the annual honoree of the Vincent J. Hawkinson Foundation, an entity promoting peace and justice activism in five states of the Upper Midwest of the United States. = After Retirement = Following his formal retirement from the University of Minnesota, in 2000, Schwartzberg focused more heavily on issues of global governance, working largely with several organizations already named ‚Äì writing scores of op-ed essays for their respective journals ‚Äì and with the Academic Council on the United Nations System in whose journal he published papers on UN peacekeeping and weighted voting. He expanded his advocacy of the latter idea in a monograph published in 2004 by the World Federalist Movement ‚Äì Institute for Global Policy, Revitalizing the United Nations System: Reform through Weighted Voting. A related monograph, Creating a World Parliamentary Assembly: An Evolutionary Journey, was published by the Berlin-based Committee for a Democratic United Nations in 2012. The ideas in these two monographs and in many previous articles were brought together ‚Äì along with many others ‚Äì in a book, Transforming the United Nations System: Designs for a Workable World, published by the United Nations University Press in 2013.Alexander B. Murphy (2013) Review: Transforming the United Nations System: Designs for a Workable World, WileyAndreas Bummel (2018) Joe Swartzberg: advocate of a workable world, from Democracy Without BordersRene Wadlow (2018) Review: Transforming the United Nations System from OM Times That work provides a comprehensive set of proposals for moving away from the Westphalian paradigm of unfettered state sovereignty on which the present system of global governance is predicated. Despite ‚Äì or perhaps because of ‚Äì its radical nature, Schwartzberg‚Äôs most recent book has been warmly endorsed by leading global thinkers, including Boutros Boutros-Ghali, Thomas Pickering, Brian Urquhart, Thomas Weiss, Johan Galtung, Alfred de Zayas and many others. Schwartzberg‚Äôs editor at the United Nations University Press wrote to him shortly before publication: > I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôve ever had a book with so much praise and backing from > such a prestigious group of endorsers. The Press then made Schwartzberg its first nominee ever for the prestigious Grawemeyer Award for Ideas Improving World Order. (He did not win, however.) In 2001, Schwartzberg and his fellow peace and justice activist, Louise Pardee, entered into a domestic partnership and he moved from his cramped apartment in Minneapolis to Louise‚Äôs spacious lakeside home in suburban White Bear Lake. Since then, Louise has contributed to Schwartzberg‚Äôs work in many ways. = The Workable World Trust = In December 2014, Schwartzberg established The Workable World Trust, the principal purpose of which is to disseminate and promote the many global governance proposals in his most recent book, with provision to carry on that work after his demise. The Trust has negotiated translations of the book into Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Japanese, Russian and Spanish, thereby facilitating virtually worldwide discussion of its reform recommendations. Additionally a much shorter, less academic Study and Discussion Guide has been prepared for each translation. All but the Japanese have already been published as of 2018. The Trust has supported many projects in addition to those noted above, with beneficiaries in every continent. It has sponsored major conferences, such as the ‚ÄúCreating a Workable World‚Äù conference (University of Minnesota, 2015), the ‚ÄúSeminar on Security Council Reform‚Äù (UN Church Center, New York, 2016), and the ‚ÄúCommonwealth of Nations as a Vehicle for Sustainable Peace & Development‚Äù conference (Brisbane, Australia, 2018). It has also contributed substantial funds in support of conferences and reform advocacy by like-minded groups (e.g. The World Federalist Movement, the Berlin-based Democracy Without Borders, the Brussels-based Center for United Nations Constitutional Research), and provided travel support for youth participation at the Ventotene Seminar in Italy and a Model UN program in Mexico City. It is also the principal financial backer of the ‚ÄúUN2020‚Äù initiative for a General Assembly-backed effort to institute a major reform process to mark the 75th anniversary of the UN‚Äôs founding. The Trust has also endowed a Workable World lecture series through the year 2025 in conjunction with the prestigious Nobel Peace Prize Forum, held each year at Augsburg University in Minneapolis. Further, Schwartzberg has bequeathed to Augsburg his personal global governance book collection, along with a fund for the enlargement of his bequest. Management of the Trust is shared mainly with the extraordinarily efficient Nancy Dunlavy, who took over the Directorship in December 2017, when Schwartzberg formally assumed the title of Director Emeritus. Schwartzberg has had a remarkably rich and rewarding life. He has sought to lead that life as a World Citizen, in both word and deed. He has demonstrated his willingness to tackle big projects and his ability to bring many of them to successful conclusions, at times independently and at times as part of a team. He has been recognized for the rigor, originality, and social value of his scholarship. He has put forward detailed and practicable proposals for improving global governance through peaceful evolutionary processes. He recognizes that humans are fallible and that utopia is not attainable. But a workable world is. He hopes that his work and that of the Workable Word Trust ‚Äì which will outlive him‚Äîwill contribute significantly toward the achievement of that goal and encourage others to join in the struggle to bring it to fruition.

Haunted Windyville  Windyville, Missouri has been said to be haunted. There are many rundown businesses and multiple cemeteries that all have creepy things said about them. In the 1800s there were multiple child deaths and now It has been reported that there is children's laughter that comes from one of the cemeteries. In the lone rock cemetery, there is known to be a horseback rider that watches over the cemetery. There is also a bridge that crosses a creek. It has been told that there is a woman who walks the bridge looking for her child. Many say that there are eerie things that go on in Windyville and you might think twice about making a visit there.  Windyville Cozy Cottage  In 1916, the Windyville general store was built. Healey Bennett was the go-to man when people needed supplies and would always pick up extra when he went into town. The general store was only in Bennett's possession for a short amount of time before he sold it. The general store has had multiple owners and was shut down in the late 1900s. Recently, Katie Heflin has reopened the old Windyville general store and has turned it into a bed and breakfast. The Windyville Cozy Cottage opened in 2018 and now people can stay in Windyville anytime they want.

Scleral lenses are designed to treat a variety of eye conditions, many of which do not respond to other forms of treatment.  Uses  = Medical uses = Scleral lenses may be used to improve vision and reduce pain and light sensitivity for people suffering from a growing number of disorders or injuries to the eye, such as severe dry eye syndrome, microphthalmia, keratoconus, corneal ectasia, Stevens‚ÄìJohnson syndrome, Sj√∂gren's syndrome, aniridia, neurotrophic keratitis (aneasthetic corneas), complications post- LASIK, higher order Aberrations of the eye, complications post-corneal transplant and pellucid degeneration. Injuries to the eye such as surgical complications, distorted corneal implants, as well as chemical and burn injuries also may be treated by the use of scleral lenses. Sclerals may also be used in people with eyes that are too sensitive for other smaller corneal- type lenses, but require a more rigid lens for vision correction conditions such as astigmatism. = Special effects = Scleral lenses are not to be confused with \\"sclera\\" lenses, which are soft lenses and do not contain a fluid reservoir. \\"Sclera\\" contacts are used in movies such as the whited-out eyes of the monsters in Evil Dead, or blacked-out eyes in Underworld and Underworld: Evolution, or the Star Trek episode Where No Man Has Gone Before. These lenses tend to be uncomfortable and sometimes impede the actors' vision, but the visual effects produced can be striking. These lenses can be custom- painted, although most companies only sell lenses with a pre-designed look. = Eye movement measurement = In experiments in ophthalmology or cognitive science, scleral lenses with embedded mirrors or with embedded magnetic field sensors in form of wire coils (called scleral coils) are commonly used for measuring eye movements.  Design  Scleral lens, with visible outer edge resting on the sclera of a patient with chronic severe dry eye syndrome. Modern scleral lenses are made of a highly oxygen permeable polymer. They are unique in their design in that they fit onto and are supported by the sclera, the white portion of the eye. The cause of this unique positioning is usually relevant to a specific patient, whose cornea may be too sensitive to support the lens directly. In comparison to corneal contact lenses, scleral lenses bulge outward considerably more. The space between the cornea and the lens is filled with artificial tears. The liquid, which is contained in a thin elastic reservoir, conforms to the irregularities of the deformed cornea, allowing vision to be restored comfortably. This helps to give the patient BCVA, or Best Corrected Visual Acuity. Scleral lenses differ from corneal contact lenses in that they create a space between the cornea and the lens, which is filled with fluid. The prosthetic application of the lenses is to cover or \\"bandage\\" the ocular surface, providing a therapeutic environment for managing severe ocular surface disease. The outward bulge of scleral lenses and the liquid-filled space between the cornea and the lens also conforms to irregular corneas and may neutralize corneal surface irregularities.  Usage  = Insertion = Scleral lenses may be inserted into the eye directly from the fingers, from a hand held plunger, or from a stationary lighted plunger on a stand. Prior to inserting the scleral, the lens is over-filled with a sterile saline or other prescribed solution mixture. Some fluid is allowed to drip from the lens as it is inserted in order to ensure no bubbles become trapped under the lens after it is seated on the eye. The lens can then be rotated to the correct orientation, often denoted by a mark at the \\"top\\" of the lens, with a finger. A \\"left\\" scleral lens is often marked with two dots, and a \\"right\\" is marked with one dot. = Removal and storage = Scleral lens prescribed for dry eye, on a removal plunger Scleral lenses are removed using the fingers, or a small lens removal plunger. Lenses are then cleaned and sanitized before reinsertion. Scleral lenses cannot be worn while sleeping, so many wearers sanitize their lenses overnight. Unlike regular contact lenses, many sclerals can be stored dry when unused for longer periods of time.  History  A scleral lens is a prototypical lens dating back to the early 1880s. Originally these lenses were designed by using a substance to take a mold of the eye. Lenses would then be shaped to conform to the mould, initially using blown glass and then ground glass in the 1920s and polymethyl methacrylate in the 1940s. Early sclerals were not oxygen permeable, which severely restricted the amount of oxygen provided to the cornea of the wearer. As such, early lenses fell into disuse until the 1970s.

Cementum covers the roots of teeth and serves to anchor gingival and periodontal fibers of the periodontal ligament by the fibers to the alveolar bone (some types of cementum may also form on the surface of the enamel of the crown at the cementoenamel junction (CEJ)). Process For cementogenesis to begin, Hertwig epithelial root sheath (HERS) must fragment. HERS is a collar of epithelial cells derived from the apical prolongation of the enamel organ. Once the root sheath disintegrates, the newly formed surface of root dentin comes into contact with the undifferentiated cells of the dental sac (dental follicle). This then stimulates the activation of cementoblasts to begin cementogenesis. The external shape of each root is fully determined by the position of the surrounding Hertwig epithelial root sheath. It is believed that either 1) HERS becomes interrupted; 2) infiltrating dental sac cells receive a reciprocal inductive signal from the dentin; or 3) HERS cells transform into cementoblasts. The cementoblasts then disperse to cover the root dentin area and undergo cementogenesis, laying down cementoid. During the later steps within the stage of apposition, many of the cementoblasts become entrapped by the cementum they produce, becoming cementocytes. When the cementoid reaches the full thickness needed, the cementoid surrounding the cementocytes becomes mineralized, or matured, and is then considered cementum. Because of the apposition of cementum over the dentin, the dentinocemental junction (DCJ) is formed.Illustrated Dental Embryology, Histology, and Anatomy, Bath-Balogh and Fehrenbach, Elsevier, 2011, page 170-171 After the apposition of cementum in layers, the cementoblasts that do not become entrapped in cementum line up along the cemental surface along the length of the outer covering of the periodontal ligament. These cementoblasts can form subsequent layers of cementum if the tooth is injured. Cementum grows slowly, by surface apposition, throughout life.Cementum, Max A.

Production and rediscovery Ed Wood produced, wrote, and directed the film under the pseudonym \\"Don Miller\\".Craig (2009), pp. 242‚Äì251 The title seems to imply necrophilia, but the content implies an obsession with Death. The film was based on the novel The Only House (1970), also written by Wood. Rob Craig observes that certain elements of the original story were \\"slavishly\\" adapted, while others were altered or removed in their entirety. For example, in the novel the rituals of sex magic are depicted in detail, and the Carpenters are not lovers posing as a married couple. They are in fact married. The film was shot on a budget of US$7,000. According to Charles Anderson, a Wood collaborator, the director himself played a role in the film. Anderson recalled this role to be a wizard or an evil doctor. However, no such role appears in the finished film. Craig suspects it was in a deleted scene. The film was an early entry to the new subgenre of hardcore pornographic film. The pioneers of the subgenre were films such as Mona the Virgin Nymph (1970) by Howard Ziehm and Sex USA (1970) by Gerard Damiano. The subgenre went on to enter the mainstream with Deep Throat (1972). The idea of graphic sex as an integral part of an adult-oriented narrative was further explored in Last Tango in Paris (1972) by Bernardo Bertolucci, Sodom and Gomorrah: The Last Seven Days (1974) by Artie Mitchell, and The Opening of Misty Beethoven (1976) by Radley Metzger. As a narrative-driven film, Rob Craig argues that Necromania can also be considered part of the Golden Age of Porn, along with these films. Thought lost for years, it resurfaced in edited form on Mike Vraney's Something Weird imprint in the late 1980s, then was re- released on DVD by Fleshbot Films in 2005. Opening titles indicate \\"Produced & directed by Don Miller. Our cast wish to remain anonymous.\\" Plot Before the credits, the film opens to an image seen through a prism. It depicts a group of naked, writhing bodies in the process of group sex. The prism replicates the image, so several versions are seen in a single frame. The credits are followed by a scene opening in a suburban area of California. A car is seen driving around, the passengers presumably looking for something. They stop before an old mansion, then the camera shifts to the image of a door knocker depicting a lion's head. The young couple knocks first, then enters through the unlocked door. They bicker over the decision to enter unannounced. The young man then jokes about the creepy location, saying that \\"Any minute, I expect Bela Lugosi as Dracula\\" to appear. They next enter a room decorated with occult-related items and containing a coffin. There, the young couple is greeted by Tanya, and identified as Danny and Shirley Carpenter. Tanya herself is dressed only in a red negligee. They are there to see necromancer Madame Heles (pronounced \\"heals\\") for a witchcraft solution to Danny's erectile dysfunction. Tanya leads them to a room prepared for their stay. A dildo serves as the ringer of the room. When left alone, the Carpenters resume bickering over their sexual dysfunction. They fail to notice feminine eyes watching them through the holes in a nearby painting‚ÄîTanya's eyes. Tanya ends her surveillance and returns to the room with the coffin. She picks up a skull and uses it to rub her body. Besides achieving sexual stimulation, this is implied to be a ritual of sex magic. Speaking to the coffin, Tanya informs someone that their suspicions were correct. The Carpenters are not married. The significance of this information is not explained. Tanya leaves the room and encounters a man called Carl, who demands to have sex with her, claiming that he paid plenty to be the first to have her. Tanya makes clear that she does not have to service him, but out of pity for his need, she chooses to do so anyway. An explicit sex scene follows. Back in their room, the Carpenters have their own sexual session, perhaps in an attempt at self-healing. Danny fails to have a full erection, though, leaving Shirley unsatisfied. She wears her own negligee and leaves the room, going in search of something to satisfy her needs. She is startled by the presence of a stuffed wolf in the corridor and admits to nearly peeing herself from fright. At this point, another young woman in a nightgown approaches Shirley and explains that this wolf died of rabies. The woman introduces herself as Barb, an \\"inmate\\" of Madame Heles. She compliments the beauty of Shirley and starts petting her. This petting opens a scene of lesbian sex between the two young women. In the bedroom, Danny wakes up from a nap to find himself alone and his penis at rest. He decides to head out to search for Shirley. Elsewhere, Barb and Shirley have moved their lovemaking to another bedroom. Danny instead meets Tanya, who leads him to yet another bedroom and seduces him. Two parallel sex scenes follow. The lesbian one is depicted as mutually satisfying, while the heterosexual only manages to benefit the male partner. Following that, Tanya leads Danny to a window. Once again, group sex is seen through a prism. Tanya explains that not all people react to \\"the treatment\\" successfully. The people depicted through the window are those who will never find satisfaction in their sexual lives, as some want too much and others too little. Suddenly self-conscious, Danny realizes that his own reaction to the treatment was not the proper one. Tanya assures him that he is not like them, since they are lost forever. They can never return to a world which will reject them. Next, Tanya and Barb lead their lovers to the room with the coffin. Danny and Shirley seem hostile to each other, implying that their relationship is doomed. Tanya and Barb kneel before the coffin and then strip each other. They engage in sex before their audience. In reaction, Shirley swoons, while Danny groans in displeasure. The sexual ritual summons Madame Heles from her coffin. Heles asks about the progress of her two newest students. Barb praises the learning of Shirley in sex, in response, Heles proclaims that Shirley will henceforth live for sex alone. Barb explains that Shirley has graduated. As Shirley walks away with Barb, Danny is left behind. Tanya declares that they still have some work to do on him. In response, Heles proclaims that he needs her personal sex teachings. While she waits in her coffin, Barb and Karl enter the room. They help Tanya restrain Danny and strip off his clothes. They force the young man to enter the coffin of Heles and then depart. At first, Danny screams, but then he is seen enjoying his healing session with the attractive Heles. The film ends. Cast * Maria Arnold as Madame Heles * Rene Bond as Shirley * Ric Lutze as Danny Analysis Wood probably included the reference to Bela Lugosi as a tribute to an old friend. The front door is decorated with the image of a trident. Rob Craig suggests that it can also be seen as the pitchfork of a devil. The spying eyes, seen through a painting are part of a trope derived from films featuring haunted houses. Craig sees the group sex sessions seen through the prism as a depiction of the then-ongoing sexual revolution. Behind the scenes A coffin owned by The Amazing Criswell is seen in the film, the second of Wood's films (after Night of the Ghouls) in which such a coffin appears. Criswell's family was in the mortician business. The coffin used in Necromania, however, looks antique. According to cinematographer Ted Gorley, this was the result of a misunderstanding. Criswell had meant to donate his own coffin, but the crew of the film borrowed the wrong coffin. The one used in the film was a relic dating to the presidency of Abraham Lincoln (1861‚Äì1865). In Nightmare of Ecstasy: The Life and Art of Edward D. Wood, Jr. (p. 135), Maila Nurmi, who played Vampira on TV and in Plan 9 from Outer Space, tells how she declined Wood's request for her to do a nude scene sitting up in a coffin in the role of Madame Heles. Rediscovery The film magazine Cult Movies (issue #36) printed a detailed article about the rediscovery of Wood's Necromania and The Only House in Town. The piece was written by Rudolph Grey, author of the Wood biography Nightmare of Ecstasy. References  Sources  * * Rudolph Grey, Nightmare of Ecstasy: The Life and Art of Edward D.

Especially for smaller, simpler objects, annealing may be incidental to the process of manufacture, but in larger or more complex products it commonly demands a special process of annealing in a temperature- controlled kiln known as a lehr.E. F. Collins (1921) Electrically heated glass annealing lehr. Journal of the American Ceramic Society 4 (5), pp. 335‚Äì349 Annealing of glass is critical to its durability. Glass that has not been properly annealed retains thermal stresses caused by quenching, which indefinitely decrease the strength and reliability of the product. Inadequately annealed glass is likely to crack or shatter when subjected to relatively small temperature changes or to mechanical shock or stress. It even may fail spontaneously. To anneal glass, it is necessary to heat it to its annealing temperature, at which its viscosity, Œ∑, drops to 1013 Poise (\\"Poise\\" viscosity; 1 poise = 1 dyne-second/cm¬≤). For most kinds of glass, this annealing temperature is in the range of 454‚Äì482 ¬∞C (850‚Äì900 ¬∞F), and is the so-called stress-relief point or annealing point of the glass. At such a viscosity, the glass is still too hard for significant external deformation without breaking, but it is soft enough to relax internal strains by microscopic flow in response to the intense stresses they introduce internally. The piece then heat-soaks until its temperature is even throughout and the stress relaxation is adequate. The time necessary for this step varies depending on the type of glass and its maximum thickness. The glass then is permitted to cool at a predetermined rate until its temperature passes the strain point (Œ∑ = 1014.5 Poise), below which even microscopic internal flow effectively stops and annealing stops with it. It then is safe to cool the product to room temperature at a rate limited by the heat capacity, thickness, thermal conductivity, and thermal expansion coefficient of the glass. After annealing is complete the material can be cut to size, drilled, or polished without risk of its internal stresses shattering it. At the annealing point (Œ∑ = 1013 Poise), stresses relax within several minutes, while at the strain point (Œ∑ = 1014.5 Poise) stresses relax within several hours.Werner Vogel: \\"Glass Chemistry\\"; Springer-Verlag Berlin and Heidelberg GmbH & Co. K; 2nd revised edition (November 1994), Stresses acquired at temperatures above the strain point, and not relaxed by annealing, remain in the glass indefinitely and may cause either short-term or much delayed failure. Stresses resulting from cooling too rapidly below the strain point largely are considered temporary, although they may be adequate to promote short-term failure.

It allows the Council to \\"determine the existence of any threat to the peace, breach of the peace, or act of aggression\\" and to take military and nonmilitary action to \\"restore international peace and security\\". Chapter VII also gives the Military Staff Committee responsibility for strategic coordination of forces placed at the disposal of the UN Security Council. It is made up of the chiefs of staff of the five permanent members of the Council. The UN Charter's prohibition of member states of the UN attacking other UN member states is central to the purpose for which the UN was founded in the wake of the destruction of World War II: to prevent war. This overriding concern is also reflected in the Nuremberg Trials' concept of a crime against peace \\"starting or waging a war against the territorial integrity, political independence or sovereignty of a state, or in violation of international treaties or agreements\\" (crime against peace), which was held to be the crime that makes all war crimes possible. Historical background The United Nations was established after World War II and the ultimate failure of diplomacy despite the existence of the League of Nations in the years between the First and Second World War. The Security Council was thus granted broad powers through Chapter VII as a reaction to the failure of the League.Krisch, Nico, and Frowein. The Charter Of The United Nations ‚Äì A Commentary. New York, NY: C.H. Beck Verlag, 2002. These broad powers allow it to enjoy greater power than any other international organization in history. It can be argued that the strong executive powers granted to it give it the role of 'executive of the international community'Dupuy,P.-M.,'the Constitutional Dimension of the Charter of the United Nations Revisited',Max Planck UNYB 1 (1997), pp.21‚Äì4. or even of an 'international government'.Morgenthau, H., Politics among nations (1948), p.380. The covenant of the League of Nations provided, for the first time in history, enforcement of international responsibilities (i.e. adhering to the Covenant of the League of Nations) through economic and military sanctions. Member states were also obliged, even without prior decision by the council to take action against states that acted unlawfully in the eyes of the League's Covenant.Sch√ºkling, W./Wehberg, H., Die Satzung des V√∂lkerbundes (2nd edn., 1924), Art. 16, pp. 623‚Äì7; Ruzi√©, pp. 63‚Äì5; Cavar√© RGDIP, p. 650. This meant that the peace process was largely dependent on the willingness of member states, because the Covenant of the League of Nations did not provide binding decisions; The Council of the League was only responsible for recommending military force. As well as this, Article 11 paragraph 1 of the Covenant states: This can be seen as an authorization of the use of force and other enforcement measures, however, states repeatedly insisted that this did not make decisions by the League binding.Sch√ºckling/Wehberg, supra, fn. 3, p. 469; Yepes, J.M./da Silva, P. Commentaire th√©orique et pratique du Pacte de la Soci√©t√© des Nations et des statuts de l'Union Panam√©ricaine, ii (1935), Art. XI, pp. 9, 41‚Äì5. This resulted in an unprecedented will by both the powers at the Dumbarton Oaks Conference and the states present at the San Francisco Conference to submit to a central organ like that of the Security Council. Despite long debate over whether the General Assembly should also have power over decisions made by the Security Council, it was eventually decided by a large majority voteCommn. III, Cttee. C, Session of May 15, 1945, UNCIO XII, pp. 325‚Äì7, Doc. 355 III/3/17: the proposal of New Zealand with 22:4 votes, of Mexico with 23:7, and of Egypt with 18:12 that the Security Council should maintain its executive power because, as the major powers emphasized, a strong executive organ would be needed for the maintenance of world peace. This emphasis was advocated in particular by the Chinese representative, recalling the powerlessness of the League during the Manchuria Crisis.cf. Commn. III, Cttee. 3, Session of May 14, 1945, UNCIO XII, pp. 316‚Äì17, Doc. 320 III/3/15. Article 42 Article 51 Article 51 provides for the right of countries to engage in self-defence, including collective self-defence, against an armed attack (including cyber attacks). This article was the impetus for much international pact-making and has been cited by the United States as support for the Nicaragua case and the legality of the Vietnam War. According to that argument, \\"although South Vietnam is not an independent sovereign State or a member of the United Nations, it nevertheless enjoys the right of self- defense, and the United States is entitled to participate in its collective defense\\".War Crimes Law And The Vietnam War, Benjamin B. Ferencz, The American University Law Review, Volume 17, Number 3, June 1968. Article 51 has been described as difficult to adjudicate with any certainty in real-life.  Chapter VII Resolutions  Most Chapter VII resolutions (1) determine the existence of a threat to the peace, a breach of the peace, or an act of aggression in accordance with Article 39, and (2) make a decision explicitly under Chapter VII. However, not all resolutions are that explicit, there is disagreement about the Chapter VII status of a small number of resolutions. As a reaction to this ambiguity, a formal definition of Chapter VII resolutions has recently been proposed: Chapter VII resolutions are very rarely isolated measures. Often the first response to a crisis is a resolution demanding the crisis be ended. This is only later followed by an actual Chapter VII resolution detailing the measures required to secure compliance with the first resolution. Sometimes dozens of resolutions are passed in subsequent years to modify and extend the mandate of the first Chapter VII resolution as the situation evolves. The list of Chapter VII interventions includes: * United Nations Security Council Resolution 82 (Korea) * United Nations Security Council Resolution 1267 (Afghanistan) * United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor * United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo * International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda * United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone * United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda * United Nations Angola Verification Mission II * United Nations Operation in Somalia II * United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission * United Nations Protection Force (former Yugoslavia) * Oil-for-Food Programme (Iraq) * United Nations Stabilisation Mission in Haiti * United Nations Security Council Resolution 678 (Gulf War) * United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973 (Libya) * United Nations Security Council Resolution 502 (Argentina) * Special Tribunal for Lebanon See also Timeline of United Nations peacekeeping missions, some of which were created under the authority of Chapter VI rather than VII.

He was the last person to duel in Newfoundland, and caused the loss of life to Ensign John Philpot of the Royal Veteran Companies also stationed at St. John's. Rudkin, an Irish native a 22-year veteran of the British Army who had served in the Peninsular War in the Low Countries and in America was no stranger to combat, having been wounded various times and had also been a prisoner of war, was considered by many a good officer and a perfect gentleman.  The conflict  Rumour has it that both Rudkin and Philpot were adversaries for some time and they both were vying for the affections of the daughter of a prominent citizen of St. John's who lived at Quidi Vidi Village. On one occasion during a social function Philpot was goaded into insulting Rudkin but soon afterwards apologized. On Wednesday, March 29, 1826 most of the officers of the Royal Veteran Companies gathered at the quarters of Captain Matthew Henry Willock for a party and friendly game of lanscolet. A controversy arose to the ownership of a ¬£2.8/6 pot that resulted in some exchange of words and Philpot tossing water in Rudkin's face. After repeated attempts to resolve the matter by gentlemanly means Rudkin, according to the Laws of Honour, felt obliged to call out Philpot.  The duel  In the early afternoon of March 30, 1826 they proceeded to a site about a mile from St. John's at West's Farm near Brine's Tavern at the foot of Robinson's Hill adjacent to Brine's River. Rudkin's second was Dr. James Coulter Strachan (1794 - 1827), assistant surgeon of the Royal Veteran Company while Captain George Farquhar Morice (of ) acted as Philpot's second. Wallis and Banks pistols were used, but while Philpot was considered a good shot, Rudkin was an expert marksman. Strachan give the signal to fire, while Philpot's shot missed its intended target it grazed Rudkin's collar, Rudkin had fired aimlessly into the air in hope that the disagreement would be settled amicably. Philpot refused and thus a second round was prepared. This time Morice gave the signal to fire to which Philpot was mortally wounded and died soon afterwards on the field. Rudkin, agitated and confused, ran to Fort Townshend and reported the incident to his commanding officer.  The trial  On April 17, 1826 the trial began with Chief Justice Richard Alexander Tucker presiding. Rudkin was charged with murder in the first degree, while Strachan and Morice were charged as accessories in the second degree. At the conclusion of the trial the Chief Justice addressed the jury began to give his personal feeling of the Laws of England and there was no Law of Honour in the British court system and had admonished the accused prisoners. The jury returned with a verdict of Guilty -- but without malice. The Chief Justice was furious, and refused to accept the verdict and sent the jury back to deliberate further. Twenty minutes later the jury returned with a Not guilty verdict.

It involves heating a material above its recrystallization temperature, maintaining a suitable temperature for an appropriate amount of time and then cooling. In annealing, atoms migrate in the crystal lattice and the number of dislocations decreases, leading to a change in ductility and hardness. As the material cools it recrystallizes. For many alloys, including carbon steel, the crystal grain size and phase composition, which ultimately determine the material properties, are dependent on the heating rate and cooling rate. Hot working or cold working after the annealing process alters the metal structure, so further heat treatments may be used to achieve the properties required. With knowledge of the composition and phase diagram, heat treatment can be used to adjust from harder and more brittle to softer and more ductile. In the case of ferrous metals, such as steel, annealing is performed by heating the material (generally until glowing) for a while and then slowly letting it cool to room temperature in still air. Copper, silver and brass can be either cooled slowly in air, or quickly by quenching in water. In this fashion, the metal is softened and prepared for further work such as shaping, stamping, or forming. Thermodynamics Annealing occurs by the diffusion of atoms within a solid material, so that the material progresses towards its equilibrium state. Heat increases the rate of diffusion by providing the energy needed to break bonds. The movement of atoms has the effect of redistributing and eradicating the dislocations in metals and (to a lesser extent) in ceramics. This alteration to existing dislocations allows a metal object to deform more easily, increasing its ductility. The amount of process-initiating Gibbs free energy in a deformed metal is also reduced by the annealing process. In practice and industry, this reduction of Gibbs free energy is termed stress relief. The relief of internal stresses is a thermodynamically spontaneous process; however, at room temperatures, it is a very slow process. The high temperatures at which annealing occurs serve to accelerate this process. The reaction that facilitates returning the cold-worked metal to its stress-free state has many reaction pathways, mostly involving the elimination of lattice vacancy gradients within the body of the metal. The creation of lattice vacancies is governed by the Arrhenius equation, and the migration/diffusion of lattice vacancies are governed by Fick's laws of diffusion. In steel, there is a decarburation mechanism that can be described as three distinct events: the reaction at the steel surface, the interstitial diffusion of carbon atoms and the dissolution of carbides within the steel. =Stages= The three stages of the annealing process that proceed as the temperature of the material is increased are: recovery, recrystallization, and grain growth. The first stage is recovery, and it results in softening of the metal through removal of primarily linear defects called dislocations and the internal stresses they cause. Recovery occurs at the lower temperature stage of all annealing processes and before the appearance of new strain-free grains. The grain size and shape do not change.Verhoeven, J.D. Fundamentals of Physical Metallurgy, Wiley, New York, 1975, p. 326 The second stage is recrystallization, where new strain-free grains nucleate and grow to replace those deformed by internal stresses. If annealing is allowed to continue once recrystallization has completed, then grain growth (the third stage) occurs. In grain growth, the microstructure starts to coarsen and may cause the metal to lose a substantial part of its original strength. This can however be regained with hardening. Controlled atmospheres The high temperature of annealing may result in oxidation of the metal's surface, resulting in scale. If scale must be avoided, annealing is carried out in a special atmosphere, such as with endothermic gas (a mixture of carbon monoxide, hydrogen gas, and nitrogen gas). Annealing is also done in forming gas, a mixture of hydrogen and nitrogen. The magnetic properties of mu-metal (Espey cores) are introduced by annealing the alloy in a hydrogen atmosphere. Setup and equipment Typically, large ovens are used for the annealing process. The inside of the oven is large enough to place the workpiece in a position to receive maximum exposure to the circulating heated air. For high volume process annealing, gas fired conveyor furnaces are often used. For large workpieces or high quantity parts, car-bottom furnaces are used so workers can easily move the parts in and out. Once the annealing process is successfully completed, workpieces are sometimes left in the oven so the parts cool in a controllable way. While some workpieces are left in the oven to cool in a controlled fashion, other materials and alloys are removed from the oven. Once removed from the oven, the workpieces are often quickly cooled off in a process known as quench hardening. Typical methods of quench hardening materials involve media such as air, water, oil, or salt. Salt is used as a medium for quenching usually in the form of brine (salt water). Brine provides faster cooling rates than water. This is because when an object is quenched in water steam bubbles form on the surface of the object reducing the surface area the water is in contact with. The salt in the brine reduces the formation of steam bubbles on the object's surface, meaning there is a larger surface area of the object in contact with the water, providing faster cooling rates. Quench hardening is generally applicable to some ferrous alloys, but not copper alloys. Diffusion annealing of semiconductors In the semiconductor industry, silicon wafers are annealed, so that dopant atoms, usually boron, phosphorus or arsenic, can diffuse into substitutional positions in the crystal lattice, resulting in drastic changes in the electrical properties of the semiconducting material. Specialized cycles =Normalization= Normalization is an annealing process applied to ferrous alloys to give the material a uniform fine-grained structure and to avoid excess softening in steel. It involves heating the steel to 20‚Äì50 ¬∞C above its upper critical point, soaking it for a short period at that temperature and then allowing it to cool in air. Heating the steel just above its upper critical point creates austenitic grains (much smaller than the previous ferritic grains), which during cooling, form new ferritic grains with a further refined grain size. The process produces a tougher, more ductile material, and eliminates columnar grains and dendritic segregation that sometimes occurs during casting. Normalizing improves machinability of a component and provides dimensional stability if subjected to further heat treatment processes. =Process annealing= Process annealing, also called intermediate annealing, subcritical annealing, or in-process annealing, is a heat treatment cycle that restores some of the ductility to a product being cold-worked so it can be cold-worked further without breaking. The temperature range for process annealing ranges from 260 ¬∞C (500 ¬∞F) to 760 ¬∞C (1400 ¬∞F), depending on the alloy in question. This process is mainly suited for low-carbon steel. The material is heated up to a temperature just below the lower critical temperature of steel. Cold-worked steel normally tends to possess increased hardness and decreased ductility, making it difficult to work. Process annealing tends to improve these characteristics. This is mainly carried out on cold-rolled steel like wire-drawn steel, centrifugally cast ductile iron pipe etc. =Full anneal= Full annealing temperature ranges A full anneal typically results in the second most ductile state a metal can assume for metal alloy. Its purpose is to originate a uniform and stable microstructure that most closely resembles the metal's phase diagram equilibrium microstructure, thus letting the metal attain relatively low levels of hardness, yield strength and ultimate strength with high plasticity and toughness. To perform a full anneal on a steel for example, steel is heated to slightly above the austenitic temperature and held for sufficient time to allow the material to fully form austenite or austenite-cementite grain structure. The material is then allowed to cool very slowly so that the equilibrium microstructure is obtained. In most cases this means the material is allowed to furnace cool (the furnace is turned off and the steel is let cool down inside) but in some cases it is air cooled. The cooling rate of the steel has to be sufficiently slow so as to not let the austenite transform into bainite or martensite, but rather have it completely transform to pearlite and ferrite or cementite. This means that steels that are very hardenable (i.e. tend to form martensite under moderately low cooling rates) have to be furnace cooled. The details of the process depend on the type of metal and the precise alloy involved. In any case the result is a more ductile material but a lower yield strength and a lower tensile strength. This process is also called LP annealing for lamellar pearlite in the steel industry as opposed to a process anneal, which does not specify a microstructure and only has the goal of softening the material. Often the material to be machined is annealed, and then subject to further heat treatment to achieve the final desired properties. =Short cycle anneal= Short cycle annealing is used for turning normal ferrite into malleable ferrite. It consists of heating, cooling and then heating again from 4 to 8 hours. Resistive heating Resistive heating can be used to efficiently anneal copper wire; the heating system employs a controlled electrical short circuit. It can be advantageous because it does not require a temperature-regulated furnace like other methods of annealing. The process consists of two conductive pulleys (step pulleys), which the wire passes across after it is drawn. The two pulleys have an electrical potential across them, which causes the wire to form a short circuit. The Joule effect causes the temperature of the wire to rise to approximately 400 ¬∞C. This temperature is affected by the rotational speed of the pulleys, the ambient temperature, and the voltage applied. Where t is the temperature of the wire, K is a constant, V is the voltage applied, r is the number of rotations of the pulleys per minute, and ta is the ambient temperature, :t = \\\\frac{1}{r} KV^2 + t_a. The constant K depends on the diameter of the pulleys and the resistivity of the copper. Purely in terms of the temperature of the copper wire, an increase in the speed of the wire through the pulley system has the same effect as a decrease in resistance.

Taylor, in which he hit .315, .317 and .344, he was picked up by Hilldale when the Eastern Colored League was organized in 1923. Mackey pictured on a Cuban baseball card, circa 1923 In his first season with Hilldale, he batted .423, winning the ECL batting title and pacing the team to the pennant, and followed with eight consecutive seasons batting .308 or better. In 1924, he finished third in the batting race as Hilldale repeated as champions, but lost to the Kansas City Monarchs 5 games to 4 in the first Negro League World Series with Mackey playing third base. At first platooning behind the plate with the aging Louis Santop, while also sharing time at shortstop with Pop Lloyd and Jake Stephens, he took over the full-time catching job in 1925. In that year's Negro League World Series, Mackey helped Hilldale to the title over the Monarchs with a .360 average. He drove in the lead run in the 11th inning of the first game, which Hilldale won in 12 innings; after scoring the winning run in a 2‚Äì1 victory in Game 5, his three hits in the deciding Game 6 clinched the title. His barnstorming tours included a highly successful trip to Japan in 1927, during which he became the first player to hit a home run out of Meiji Shrine Stadium, doing so in three straight games. He was particularly well received on the tour and made later trips to Japan in 1934 and 1935. In 1931, he won his second batting title with a .359 average, as Hilldale also finished with the best record among eastern teams. In voting for the first East-West All-Star Game in 1933, he was selected at catcher over the young Josh Gibson, batting cleanup. He would play in three more All-Star Games by 1938. In 1934, he batted only .299, as the Philadelphia Stars' won the NNL second-half pennant, but had a good postseason, batting .368 and driving in the first run of a 2‚Äì0 victory in Game 7 to defeat the Chicago American Giants 4 games to 3. By 1937, he was managing the Baltimore Elite Giants, where he began mentoring 15-year-old Roy Campanella in the fine points of catching. Campanella later recalled: :\\"In my opinion, Biz Mackey was the master of defense of all catchers. When I was a kid in Philadelphia, I saw both Mackey and Mickey Cochrane in their primes, but for real catching skills, I don't think Cochrane was the master of defense that Mackey was. When I went under his direction in Baltimore, I was 15 years old. I gathered quite a bit from Mackey, watching how he did things, how he blocked low pitches, how he shifted his feet for an outside pitch, how he threw with a short, quick, accurate throw without drawing back. I got all this from Mackey at a young age.\\" Mackey joined the Newark Eagles in 1939, replacing Dick Lundy as manager a year later, and continued his work with young players such as Monte Irvin, Larry Doby and Don Newcombe. When Doby joined the Cleveland Indians of the American League in 1947, it was Mackey who recommended moving him from second base to center field. Mackey at the 1924 Colored World Series. Personality conflicts with Newark owner Effa Manley led to Mackey's departure from play after the 1941 season, but he returned to the field in 1945, and managed the team in 1946 as the Eagles won the Negro League World Series 4 games to 3, again over the Monarchs, who featured pitcher Satchel Paige. Even in his 40s, Mackey was still an effective player ‚Äì he batted .307 in 1945, and appeared in the 1947 All-Star Game at age 50. When the Eagles moved to Houston in 1950, he retired from baseball following the season. Life after baseball In the 1950s, he moved to Los Angeles and began working as a forklift operator. In 1952, he was selected by a Pittsburgh Courier poll as the Negro leagues' greatest catcher, ahead of Josh Gibson. Mackey received more attention on May 7, 1959, when Campanella was honored at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum following his paralysis from a car accident. Mackey was introduced to the crowd of over 93,000 for an exhibition game between the Dodgers and the New York Yankees. Mackey lived in Los Angeles until his death in 1965. He is buried in that city's Evergreen Cemetery.Biz Mackey's Grave. Thedeadballera.com. Retrieved November 3, 2013. Through the 1990s, reference sources widely reported his death as having occurred in 1959; this seems to have resulted from Campanella's recollection in John B. Holway's 1988 book Blackball Stars that Mackey \\"passed away right after\\" the Coliseum event, an apparent error that Campanella repeated in other interviews. Mackey's grandson Riley Odoms played 12 seasons for the NFL's Denver Broncos. References * Holway, John B. (1988). Blackball Stars: Negro League Pioneers.

Through the development of satellites and SECAM, controlled broadcasting was initialized as the main frequency for distributing information and entertainment. Under the control of the Soviet Union, censorship and limitation on information was filtered for the citizens to ensure the common culture and socialist ideals were maintained. The USSR State Committee for Television and Radio Broadcasting (; abbreviated as Gosteleradio SSSR [] or simply Gosteleradio []), the Soviet Union's governing body of broadcasting, was in charge both of television networks and radio stations. During this time of political propaganda and war, controlling the large and spread out population meant censorship and lock downs on the freedom of public speaking. Soviet Russia did not tolerate \\"a slip of the tongue.\\" Broadcasting Problems Size, geography, time, and censorship attributed many issues to the development of broadcasting. The Soviet Union's size caused several problems to overcome. The first was geography; the European area of the Soviet Union was typical East European. At its peak, almost of land mass belonged to the U.S.S.R. Then there were the mountains such as the Urals. There were also the taiga and steppes of the east and the north. Another problem was time; the Soviet Union encompassed 11 different time zones, and thus what would be shown at 18:00 in Moscow would be different from 18:00 in Frunze, Kirghizia. The population too was unevenly spread out, the overwhelming majority being west of the Urals. In addition, the Soviet Union also relayed their programming to other Warsaw Pact states. Each population was then characterized by different economic and cultural elements. There was exclusively agricultural regions or industrial regions, needing their own satellite systems from broadcasting services. As a result, Soviet television and Soviet radio required ingenuity to overcome the aforementioned problems as well as to transmit programming to the Eastern bloc.  Overview  \\"With the entire apparatus of cultural and artistic practice under centralized control, and production across all media generated by one officially endorsed methodology, the Soviet leadership was in an ideal position to saturate the marketplace with their product. The nature of this product was complex and all-encompassing, and was marketed as a new form of civilization. In order for fundamental changes in behavior and massive transformation of the landscape to occur, the population had to be engaged and mobilized to adopt the ideology (and goals and vision) of the leadership as their own\\" Broadcasting owned by the governing body ensured the right information and propaganda would be distributed in order to keep that vision intact. Soviet standards =Broadcast radio= thumb Soviet domestic stations broadcast on shortwave, MW, LW and VHF wavebands, though the majority of stations were on medium and long wave. Neither the transmission sites nor the frequencies of domestic FM, MW, LW or SW stations were ever disclosed, thus leaving listeners having to memorize the frequencies. =Television= thumb thumb The Soviet Union used SECAM D (VHF) and K (UHF) (also known as CIS-SECAM). The Soviet Union also used the OIRT VHF band (the \\"R\\" channels ranging from chs. R1 to R12) and the pan-European/African UHF band. SECAM (Sequential Color with Memory) was initiated in 1956. Soviets involvement began with the NIR which was covered by the Nautchno-Issledovatelski research institute. Non-linear in which a process analogous to gamma correction is used and SECAM IV that omits this process were the standards utilized initially. Radio services =Home services= There were four national radio channels. The first was the All-Union First Programme. It broadcast items of national interest along with local opt-out programmes in each of the Republics. The second channel was called Radio Mayak (Radio Beacon in Russian) and was a music and speech entertainment channel intended to be the \\"beacon\\" of Soviet culture, similar to BBC Radio 2 in the UK or Radio National in Australia. And the All-Union Third Programme carried the programme strands Radio Yunost and Radio Orfey. =External services= Most people who have listened to shortwave are familiar with Radio Moscow, the main Soviet shortwave radio station. However, that's only part of the picture. Soviet radio also had Radio Station Peace and Progress, officially called the \\"Voice of Soviet Public Opinion\\". Most republics also had an external service, relayed by Radio Moscow's transmitters. Radio Moscow also relayed other radio stations from their satellite states, such as Radio Afghanistan. Television services =National television channels= Generally there were five channels (called \\"programmes\\" in the typical European fashion then) under the banner of the unified brand of Soviet Central Television. The first channel (1st Programme) was the main channel. It was also the most adaptable for the republics to utilize (see \\"Regional services\\" below). Other channels were the All Union Programme (the second channel), the Moscow Programme (the third channel aimed mostly at Moscow), the Fourth Programme (the fourth channel) and the \\"Leningrad Programme\\" (the 5th channel aimed at Leningrad viewers). =Television programming= Soap operas and TV series of original cast were rare until the last decade; a notable example is Seventeen Moments of Spring which quickly became a cult film. It involved the exploits of Stierlitz, a Soviet super-spy in Nazi Germany, who inspired many jokes (see Russian humour). However, in the later years quite a few of soap operas were brought in from the West (United States, Brazil, etc.), and a number of detective series were cast locally.  Soviet Programs  During this period, the state used programs, films, and animations to redraw its citizens to the Soviet culture and away from the western ideas that were brought home during the war. Short animations were introduced that negatively portrayed western culture and reiterated the ideas of old Russia, such as The Stranger's Voice, which aired in 1949. Specifically, this segment targeted American Jazz, comparing it to a magpie's call. Comparing jazz and a magpie's lack of musical ability meant there was no true art as there was in Soviet music, and that this American music was all for show with no actual talent required. With the initial release of filming worldwide, exciting American movies had almost no competition, which citizens of all classes in the Soviet State flocked into. In this period, external influences began to shape the union. from its initial introduction, the Soviet take on films opposed western. In its creation, its prime focus was to maintain the socialist ideals and culture. In most of these cases the films encompassed these socialists values through fact-based films and documentary footage montage with exciting story lines and stunts. Regional services Chechen-Ingush ASSR In addition to the national radio and television channels, each SSR and ASSR had its own state radio and television company or state broadcasting committees, although other regions were allowed regional state broadcasting companies/committees. Taking the Chechen-Ingush ASSR as an example, one would see that there was a lot of flexibility in the Soviet radio and television system. Like other areas of the Soviet Union, the four national television channels, Radio Mayak, the All- Union First and Third Programmes, and (if equipped with appropriate transmitters) Radio Moscow would be broadcast by either a Television and Radio Company of the Chechen-Ingush Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic or by a State Committee on Radio and Television Broadcasting.citation needed However, in the First Programme (TV) and in the All-Union First Programme (radio), the Company/Committee was allowed to broadcast regional programming alongside the official First Programme/All-Union First Programme schedule. Depending on the political status of an administrative division, the Company/Committee would broadcast the regional programming in either Russian or the local language. In the Chechen-Ingush ASSR's case, the regional programmes would be broadcast in Russian, Chechen, or Ingush. The Company/Committee would also broadcast additional channels for their coverage area only. Such cases were usually a second programme, known by a special name, in the main language of the SSR/ASSR. Other districts had their own local programming, and cities such as Moscow and Leningrad had special programs, broadcasting only in the evening and on FM. Satellite services Aside from Canada's ANIK satellite system and the U.S.'s satellite system, the Soviet Union had the largest domestic satellite system in the world. The Soviet Union time-shifted programmes in order to cover its 11 time zones. This involved several solutions to the Soviet Union's geography and time zone problems: *\\"Schedule. The national television channels were only on the air for part of the day. This would make it easy for transmitting the channels throughout the country. For instance, the Fourth Programme aired from 1300-1740 GMT. This would make it easy for the Fourth Programme to be aired by satellite. *Time-shifting. This is the heart of the programming aspect of the Soviet television system. By time-shifting programmes, this allowed the Soviet Union and countries that relayed Soviet television (such as Warsaw Pact states) to broadcast programming in their own time zone.\\" =The timeshift grid= There were two types of timeshifting in the Soviet Union. The first was used by both the All-Union First Programme and the First Programme (TV). For simplicity, this system is denoted as the \\"Radio/TV Orbita\\" system (named after the editions of these 1st programmes when they are time-shifted). All other national television channels (the All- Union, Moscow, Fourth, Leningrad and Sixth Programmes), including Radio Mayak and the Third Programme, used the \\"Double program\\" composite time-shifting format. The Radio/TV Orbita system *Radio/TV Orbita-1 (UTC +11, +12, and +13 time zones or MSK +7, MSK +8, and MSK +9) *Radio/TV Orbita-2 (UTC +9 and +10 time zones or MSK +6 and MSK +7) *Radio/TV Orbita-3 (UTC +7 and +8 time zones or MSK +4 and MSK +5) *Radio/TV Orbita-4 (UTC +5 and +6 time zones or MSK +2 and MSK +3) *All-Union First Programme/First Programme (UTC +2, +3, and +4 time zones or MSK -1, MSK, and MSK +1) The \\"Double Program\\" system The \\"double program\\" system was the other system used for time- shifting programmes. Like the \\"Radio/TV Orbita\\" system, identical content would be broadcast on the time-shifted versions, and, in the case of the Third Programme (radio), followed the same type of editions as the All-Union First Programme. However, it was different in that, especially on TV, it was a composite time-shifting system. This means that multiple services could be broadcast on the same edition and thus reduce the cost of broadcasting several different editions of the channels. Editions of the Third Programme (radio): *Third Double-1 (UTC +11 and +12 time zones) *Third Double-2 (UTC +9 and +10 time zones) *Third Double-3 (UTC +7 and +8 time zones) *Third Double-4 (UTC +5 and +6 time zones) *Third Programme (UTC +2, +3, and +4 time zones) Composite editions of the All-Union, Moscow, and Fourth Programmes (TV): *Double 2 (UTC +9 and +10 time zones) *Double 3 (UTC +7 and +8 time zones) *Double 4 (UTC +5 and +6 time zones) =The satellites= The Soviet Union set up the great space race that would lead to international technological, political, cultural, and scientific exploration. The Soviet domestic satellite system was also known as Orbita - in 1990 there were 90 Orbita satellites, supplying programming to 900 main transmitters and over 4,000 relay stations. The most famous Soviet satellites were the Molniya satellites; other satellite groups were the Gorizont, Ekran, and Stasionar satellites. With the right equipment, people outside the Soviet Union who used TVRO satellite television could receive Soviet television programming. Since the 1970s, Russia has implemented the newer geostationary orbit \\"Horizont\\" satellites utilized by the Russian Space Television system. New satellites are released into orbit as older versions deteriorate and new technology becomes available. Operated by the State Enterprise \\"Kosmicheskaya Svyaz\\" there was constant maintenance of satellites as well as revision, censorship, and management performed through this main facility. At its peak, the Soviet Space program, in competition with the United States, pushed for newer advancements and technologies, leading to the Space race. ITAR-TASS Broadcasting The Soviet Union's radio news and television news was provided almost entirely by the Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union, commonly known as TASS until 1991. Under the rule of Emperor Nikolai II, the first broadcasting system began in 1904, and evolved into TASS in 1925. TASS still exists today, transformed into the Information Telegraph Agency of Russia (ITAR-TASS). It occupies a Joseph Stalin-era building in Moscow, characterised by a bas-relief sculpture above the main entrance. However, much like its counterparts in cinema and the press, it has suffered since the break-up of Soviet Union. ITAR now broadcasts domestic news, while TASS reports the world news and events abroad. Broadcasting post-Soviet Union With the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the broadcasting landscape also changed. Instead of one uniform system for radio and television broadcasting, there are now multiple systems, one for each country. Nowhere is this more obvious than in the republics themselves. Below is an incomplete list of the changes to the television system in the republics, in alphabetical order: =Armenia= 1990 Broadcasters: Radio Yerevan (radio), Public Television company of Armenia (TV) 2005 Main broadcasters: Hayastani Azgain Radio (Armenian National Radio), Armenian National Television, Armenia TV =Azerbaijan= 1990 Broadcasters: Radio Baku (radio), AzTV (TV) 2005 Main broadcaster: Az√§rbaycan D√∂vl√§t Teleradio Verilisl√§ri Sirk√§ti (State Radio and Television Company of Azerbaijan) =Belarus= 1990 Broadcasters: Radio Minsk (radio), Minskaja studija televidenija (TV) 2005 Main broadcaster: Nacyjanalnaja Dzjarza√∫naja Teleradyjokampanija Respubliki Belarus (State Television and Radio Company of Belarus) =Estonia= 1990 Broadcasters: Eesti Raadio (radio), Eesti Televisioon (TV) 2005 Main broadcasters: Eesti Raadio, Eesti Televisioon, Kanal 2, TV3 ViaSat =Georgia= 1990 Broadcasters: Radio Tbilisi (radio), Tbiliskaja studija televidenija (TV) 2005 Main broadcaster: Saqartvelos Teleradio Korporacia (Georgian National Broadcasting Corporation) =Russia= =Tajikistan= 1990 Broadcaster: State Committee for Broadcasting and Television of the Republic of Tajikistan :*Radio Dushanbe 2005 Main broadcaster: Tajik Radio See also *Radio in the Soviet Union *Television in the Soviet Union *Eastern Bloc information dissemination *Censorship in the Soviet Union *Propaganda in the Soviet Union References Sources :NB: Some of the information in this article is from the 1990 edition of the World Radio TV Handbook).

He was head coach at Florida State, Georgia, and Jacksonville. He is the only head coach to have led two different programs to their first Final Four appearances. Early life A native of Louisville, Kentucky, Durham was a highly recruited three-sport star at Eastern High School, where his teammate was the actor Ned Beatty. He was an all-state quarterback and all-region in basketball. He chose to play basketball in college and accepted a scholarship offer from Florida State University. College career At Florida State University, Durham is one of the most prolific scorers in Seminole basketball history. He appears prominently in the Florida State record book as both a player and head coach. Durham was a guard for FSU head coach Bud Kennedy. Over fifty years after his FSU career ended, Durham's career average of 18.9 points per game is still the ninth best in school history. His 21.9 points per game in 1958-59 remains the seventh best single season average in FSU history. On January 19, 1957 Durham scored 43 points against Stetson University. It is still the second-best single game scoring mark in school history. For his three-year varsity career, Durham scored 1,381 points. Durham played prior to college basketball adopting the three-point shot. In 1999 Florida State renamed its Most Valuable Player award the \\"Hugh Durham Most Valuable Player\\" award in his honor. In 1959, Durham graduated from Florida State with a B.A. in business administration. He was a member of the Phi Delta Theta fraternity. In 1961, he earned an M.B.A. from Florida State. Coaching career =Florida State Seminoles= After Durham received his undergraduate degree from Florida State in 1959, FSU head coach Bud Kennedy hired him as an assistant coach. Durham served as Kennedy's assistant for seven seasons. Prior to the 1966-67 season, Kennedy was diagnosed with stomach cancer and died shortly thereafter. Durham was elevated to head coach at Florida State at the age of 29. He is one of the youngest head coaches in NCAA Division I basketball history. Durham was head coach at his alma mater for 12 seasons, is the school's all-time most successful coach, led the Seminoles to the 1972 NCAA Championship game and three NCAA Tournaments. In 1966-67 season, Durham recruited and coached the first African-American basketball player in Florida State sports history. As an assistant coach, Durham recruited Lenny Hall. Hall was a native of Camden, NJ, who was playing for St. Petersburg Junior College. Both Bud Kennedy and Durham signed Hall. However, Kennedy died of cancer before Hall played his first game at FSU. As a 29-year-old first-year head coach, Durham was the subject of intense criticism. Five seasons later, Durham would take a team with five African-American starters to the NCAA Championship game. There would only be one white player on the 13-man Seminole roster, John Amick, who played in 11 games and sported a lengthy ponytail. In the 1967-68 season, only his second as head coach at FSU, Durham led the Seminoles to only their second NCAA Tournament in school history. FSU received an NCAA Tournament at-large bid as an Independent at a time when only 25 teams were invited to play in the NCAA Tournament. Dave Cowens was a sophomore and the catalyst of the 1968 team. Cowens had been a part of Durham's first recruiting class as the head coach at FSU that had also included Lenny Hall. In 1972, Durham led Florida State to the greatest basketball season in school history. The team went 27-6 and earned another at-large berth to the NCAA Tournament. The Seminoles shocked the basketball world by advancing to the NCAA Championship game. To reach the 1972 NCAA Championship game, Florida State played in the NCAA Mideast Region in Dayton, OH. Durham's talented, defensive- oriented but underrated squad was led by Ron King, Reggie Royals, Rowland Garrett and diminutive point guard Otto Petty. In the Mideast Region Semifinals, the Seminoles defeated Big Ten Champion, University of Minnesota, 70-56. In the Mideast Region Finals, Florida State defeated the University of Kentucky, 73-54. Kentucky was the SEC Champion. The game was legendary head coach Adolph Rupp's last game at Kentucky where he won four NCAA titles. The 1972 NCAA Final Four was held in Los Angeles, CA. In the NCAA Semifinals, FSU upset the heavily favored University of North Carolina Tar Heels, 79-75. The Tar Heels, coached by Dean Smith and led by future NBA stars Bob McAdoo and Bobby Jones were the Atlantic Coast Conference Champions. In the NCAA Championship game, FSU lost to UCLA, 81-76.Brian Landman. \\"'72 Seminoles stand proud of their legacy\\". St. Petersburg Times. January 20, 2007. Retrieved on July 24, 2010. The Bruins were led by future NBA stars Bill Walton and Henry Bibby. It was UCLA's closest championship game during UCLA's remarkable stretch of 10 NCAA championships under legendary head coach John Wooden. Florida State was not a member of a conference for the first ten seasons Durham was head coach in Tallahassee. In 1976-77, Florida State joined the Metro Conference. In 1977-78, only their second in the Metro, Durham led the Seminoles to the Conference title. As a result, FSU was one of 32 teams to earn a 1978 NCAA Tournament bid. It was Florida State's third trip the NCAA Tournament under Durham. Durham was also named Metro Conference Coach of the Year. After the 1977-78 season, Durham was lured away from FSU to become the head coach at the University of Georgia. His overall record at FSU was 230-95 (.708). Over thirty years later, his .708 winning percentage is still the highest in Florida State history. Durham remains the only coach to ever lead Florida State to the NCAA Final Four. =Georgia Bulldogs= Prior to the 1978-79 season, Durham was named head coach at the University of Georgia. Before Durham arrived in Athens, Georgia had never been to either the NCAA or NIT Tournaments, never won an SEC regular season title and never won an SEC Tournament championship. Durham immediately embarked on a remarkable transformation project that produced the most prolific era of Georgia basketball still to this date. Durham's efforts produced virtual overnight success as from 1981 to 1991, he led Georgia to five NCAA Tournaments, four NIT Tournaments, the 1983 NCAA Final Four, the 1982 NIT Final Four, the 1983 SEC Tournament Championship and the 1990 SEC Championship. In that same span, Durham was named SEC Coach of the Year four times. In 1980-81, only his third season at Georgia, Durham was voted his first of four SEC Coach of the Year awards. That season, Durham led Georgia to the school's first ever post-season tournament as the Bulldogs received an NIT bid. UGA also reached the 1981 SEC Tournament Championship Game behind the electric play of Dominique Wilkins, Terry Fair, Vern Fleming and James Banks. In 1981-82, the Bulldogs advanced to the NIT Final Four by defeating Temple, Maryland and Virginia Tech. The Bulldogs lost to Purdue, 61-60, in the NIT Semifinals at Madison Square Garden in New York. Again, Wilkins, Fair, Fleming, and Banks led the Bulldogs. After the 1981-82 season, All-American and future National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame inductee and Naismith Hall of Fame inductee, Dominique Wilkins, entered the NBA Draft after his junior year at UGA. As a result, not much was expected of the 1982-83 Georgia basketball team and the Dawgs were picked to finish near the bottom of the SEC going into the season. However, in 1982-83 behind one of the finest coaching performances in NCAA history with a starting lineup measuring only 6-7, 6-6, 6-5, 6-5 and 6-2, Durham led the Bulldogs to without question the greatest single season in Georgia basketball history. The Bulldogs won the 1983 SEC Tournament championship, the first SEC basketball championship in school history. As a result of the title, Georgia earned its first NCAA Tournament bid in school history on the way to a 24-10 record. In the 48 team NCAA field, the Bulldogs were seeded fourth in the NCAA East Region. Durham again shocked the basketball world by leading the Bulldogs to the 1983 NCAA Final Four. Georgia became one of the few teams since the NCAA Tournament began in 1939 to reach the NCAA Final Four in its first ever NCAA Tournament appearance. Georgia beat VCU by two points in its first game in Greensboro to advance to the NCAA East Region in Syracuse, NY. This Georgia squad was another of Durham's patented formula of talent, intensity and defensive focus. As with his 1972 FSU team, Durham's squad was given little chance in the Tournament. The starters were Vern Fleming, Terry Fair, James Banks, Lamar Heard and Gerald Crosby with Richard Corhen, Donald Hartry, Derrick Floyd and Horace McMillan coming off the bench. In the East Region Semifinals, Georgia upset the Big East Champion and #3 ranked St. John's University, 70-67. The Redmen were coached by Lou Carnesecca and led by Chris Mullin and Bill Wennington. The Redmen had been #1 seed in the East Region and were dubbed 'The Beast of the East.' In the East Region Finals, the Bulldogs upset defending NCAA champion North Carolina, 82-77. UNC, the champion of the ACC, was led by Michael Jordan, Sam Perkins and Brad Daugherty. UNC was coached by Dean Smith. Remember UGA front line was 6-7, 6-6, and 6-5. UNC's front line was 7-0, 6-11, and 6-8. With just over 90 second left in the game, Georgia led by 15 points and the Tar Heel Radio Network crew had to cancel the reservations to the Final Four in Albuquerque it had made prior to the start of the game against Georgia. The 1983 NCAA Final Four was in Albuquerque, NM. The Bulldogs lost in the NCAA Semifinals to eventual champion North Carolina State, 67-60. The Wolfpack was coached by the late Jim Valvano and led by Derrick Wittenberg, Sidney Lowe, Thurl Bailey, and Lorenzo Charles. Georgia's 6-7 center Terry Fair suffered a knee injury at Friday's practice and was severely limited against NC State's 6-11, 6-10, 6-7 front line. Fair, a senior and former McDonald's All-American in high school, had scored 27 points in Georgia' NCAA Regional Semifinal win against St. John's. In 1984-85, the Bulldogs returned to the NCAA Tournament finishing the season with a 22-9 record. In another milestone for Durham, Georgia defeated Kentucky in Lexington, 79-77. It was the first win for Georgia over Kentucky in Lexington since 1923. The Bulldogs were led by Joe Ward, Cedric Henderson, Gerald Crosby, Donald Hartry, Horace McMillan, and Richard Corhen. In 1985-86, Durham was again named SEC Coach of the Year. In 1986-87, Durham was voted SEC Coach of the Year for the second consecutive year as Georgia earned its third NCAA Tournament bid in five seasons behind the play of Willie Anderson, Chad Kessler, Derrick Kirce, Eric Burdette, Dennis Williams, and Patrick Hamilton. In 1989-90, Durham led Georgia to the school's first ever SEC regular season Championship and another trip to the NCAA Tournament. Georgia outlasted LSU and Shaquille O'Neal to clinch the SEC title in a heart pounding game in Athens that was nationally televised. A free throw by Neville Austin with five seconds left in overtime gave Georgia the 85-84 win. Alec Kessler scored 30 points. Durham was voted SEC Coach of the Year for the fourth time in ten seasons. The 20-9 Bulldogs were led by the late Alec Kessler, Litterial Green, Marshall Wilson, Antonio Harvey, and Neville Austin. In 1990-91, Georgia advanced to the NCAA Tournament for the fifth time in nine seasons behind the play of Litterial Green, Rod Cole, Jody Patton, Marshall Wilson, Antonio Harvey, and Neville Austin. In 1994-95, Durham finished his career at Georgia by leading the Bulldogs to their 12th post-season tournament appearance in his 17 seasons as head coach. He is the most successful coach in Georgia history with a record of 297-215. Durham remains the only coach to ever lead Georgia to the NCAA Final Four. =Jacksonville Dolphins= In 1997, Durham came out of retirement at the age of 60 to try to help rebuild the struggling basketball program at Jacksonville University. JU is a private school in Jacksonville, FL, with an enrollment of less than 3,500 students. In 1970, the Dolphins led by Artis Gilmore reached the NCAA Championship game before losing to UCLA. JU went to five NCAA Tournaments between 1970 and 1986. However, the program had since fallen on hard times. Once again, Durham engineered a remarkable turnaround. The Dolphins quickly went from the doormat of the Atlantic Sun Conference to one of the top programs in the league. Durham's signature rugged defense set the tone. Over his last five seasons, Jacksonville won 78 games, averaged 10 conference wins a season, and held opponents to an average of only 69.5 points per game. In that span, JU was 49-19 at home. In 2000, Durham was named athletic director in addition to his basketball head coaching duties. He served in the dual roles from 2000 through 2004. He coached at Jacksonville for eight seasons, retiring in 2005 as the most successful coach in Jacksonville history with 106 victories. His record at JU was 106-119. Recognition Durham was inducted into the Florida State University Hall of Fame in 1980, the Kentucky High School Hall of Fame in 1994, the Florida Sports Hall of Fame in 1999, the Georgia Sports Hall of Fame in 2009, the Kentucky Sports Hall of Fame in 2012, and the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame in 2016.

The general task of pattern analysis is to find and study general types of relations (for example clusters, rankings, principal components, correlations, classifications) in datasets. For many algorithms that solve these tasks, the data in raw representation have to be explicitly transformed into feature vector representations via a user-specified feature map: in contrast, kernel methods require only a user-specified kernel, i.e., a similarity function over pairs of data points in raw representation. Kernel methods owe their name to the use of kernel functions, which enable them to operate in a high- dimensional, implicit feature space without ever computing the coordinates of the data in that space, but rather by simply computing the inner products between the images of all pairs of data in the feature space. This operation is often computationally cheaper than the explicit computation of the coordinates. This approach is called the \\"kernel trick\\". Kernel functions have been introduced for sequence data, graphs, text, images, as well as vectors. Algorithms capable of operating with kernels include the kernel perceptron, support vector machines (SVM), Gaussian processes, principal components analysis (PCA), canonical correlation analysis, ridge regression, spectral clustering, linear adaptive filters and many others. Any linear model can be turned into a non-linear model by applying the kernel trick to the model: replacing its features (predictors) by a kernel function. Most kernel algorithms are based on convex optimization or eigenproblems and are statistically well-founded. Typically, their statistical properties are analyzed using statistical learning theory (for example, using Rademacher complexity). Motivation and informal explanation Kernel methods can be thought of as instance-based learners: rather than learning some fixed set of parameters corresponding to the features of their inputs, they instead \\"remember\\" the i-th training example (\\\\mathbf{x}_i, y_i) and learn for it a corresponding weight w_i. Prediction for unlabeled inputs, i.e., those not in the training set, is treated by the application of a similarity function k, called a kernel, between the unlabeled input \\\\mathbf{x'} and each of the training inputs \\\\mathbf{x}_i. For instance, a kernelized binary classifier typically computes a weighted sum of similarities :\\\\hat{y} = \\\\sgn \\\\sum_{i=1}^n w_i y_i k(\\\\mathbf{x}_i, \\\\mathbf{x'}), where * \\\\hat{y} \\\\in \\\\\\\\{-1, +1\\\\\\\\} is the kernelized binary classifier's predicted label for the unlabeled input \\\\mathbf{x'} whose hidden true label y is of interest; * k \\\\colon \\\\mathcal{X} \\\\times \\\\mathcal{X} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R} is the kernel function that measures similarity between any pair of inputs \\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\mathbf{x'} \\\\in \\\\mathcal{X}; * the sum ranges over the labeled examples \\\\\\\\{(\\\\mathbf{x}_i, y_i)\\\\\\\\}_{i=1}^n in the classifier's training set, with y_i \\\\in \\\\\\\\{-1, +1\\\\\\\\}; * the w_i \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R} are the weights for the training examples, as determined by the learning algorithm; * the sign function \\\\sgn determines whether the predicted classification \\\\hat{y} comes out positive or negative. Kernel classifiers were described as early as the 1960s, with the invention of the kernel perceptron. Cited in They rose to great prominence with the popularity of the support vector machine (SVM) in the 1990s, when the SVM was found to be competitive with neural networks on tasks such as handwriting recognition. Mathematics: the kernel trick ^2 . The training points are mapped to a 3-dimensional space where a separating hyperplane can be easily found. The kernel trick avoids the explicit mapping that is needed to get linear learning algorithms to learn a nonlinear function or decision boundary. For all \\\\mathbf{x} and \\\\mathbf{x'} in the input space \\\\mathcal{X}, certain functions k(\\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\mathbf{x'}) can be expressed as an inner product in another space \\\\mathcal{V}. The function k \\\\colon \\\\mathcal{X} \\\\times \\\\mathcal{X} \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R} is often referred to as a kernel or a kernel function. The word \\"kernel\\" is used in mathematics to denote a weighting function for a weighted sum or integral. Certain problems in machine learning have more structure than an arbitrary weighting function k. The computation is made much simpler if the kernel can be written in the form of a \\"feature map\\" \\\\varphi\\\\colon \\\\mathcal{X} \\\\to \\\\mathcal{V} which satisfies :k(\\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\mathbf{x'}) = \\\\langle \\\\varphi(\\\\mathbf{x}), \\\\varphi(\\\\mathbf{x'}) \\\\rangle_\\\\mathcal{V}. The key restriction is that \\\\langle \\\\cdot, \\\\cdot \\\\rangle_\\\\mathcal{V} must be a proper inner product. On the other hand, an explicit representation for \\\\varphi is not necessary, as long as \\\\mathcal{V} is an inner product space. The alternative follows from Mercer's theorem: an implicitly defined function \\\\varphi exists whenever the space \\\\mathcal{X} can be equipped with a suitable measure ensuring the function k satisfies Mercer's condition. Mercer's theorem is similar to a generalization of the result from linear algebra that associates an inner product to any positive-definite matrix. In fact, Mercer's condition can be reduced to this simpler case. If we choose as our measure the counting measure \\\\mu(T) = T for all T \\\\subset X , which counts the number of points inside the set T, then the integral in Mercer's theorem reduces to a summation : \\\\sum_{i=1}^n\\\\sum_{j=1}^n k(\\\\mathbf{x}_i, \\\\mathbf{x}_j) c_i c_j \\\\geq 0. If this summation holds for all finite sequences of points (\\\\mathbf{x}_1, \\\\dotsc, \\\\mathbf{x}_n) in \\\\mathcal{X} and all choices of n real- valued coefficients (c_1, \\\\dots, c_n) (cf. positive definite kernel), then the function k satisfies Mercer's condition. Some algorithms that depend on arbitrary relationships in the native space \\\\mathcal{X} would, in fact, have a linear interpretation in a different setting: the range space of \\\\varphi. The linear interpretation gives us insight about the algorithm. Furthermore, there is often no need to compute \\\\varphi directly during computation, as is the case with support vector machines. Some cite this running time shortcut as the primary benefit. Researchers also use it to justify the meanings and properties of existing algorithms. Theoretically, a Gram matrix \\\\mathbf{K} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{n \\\\times n} with respect to \\\\\\\\{\\\\mathbf{x}_1, \\\\dotsc, \\\\mathbf{x}_n\\\\\\\\} (sometimes also called a \\"kernel matrix\\"), where K_{ij} = k(\\\\mathbf{x}_i, \\\\mathbf{x}_j), must be positive semi-definite (PSD). Empirically, for machine learning heuristics, choices of a function k that do not satisfy Mercer's condition may still perform reasonably if k at least approximates the intuitive idea of similarity. Regardless of whether k is a Mercer kernel, k may still be referred to as a \\"kernel\\". If the kernel function k is also a covariance function as used in Gaussian processes, then the Gram matrix \\\\mathbf{K} can also be called a covariance matrix. Applications Application areas of kernel methods are diverse and include geostatistics, kriging, inverse distance weighting, 3D reconstruction, bioinformatics, chemoinformatics, information extraction and handwriting recognition.

It was fought between the Allied forces advancing into northern Italy and the dug-in German defenders. The battle marked the Brazilian Expeditionary Force's entry into the land war in Europe. Starting in November 1944, fierce combat dragged on for three months, ending on 21 February 1945. Six Allied attacks were mounted against the German forces, four of which were tactical failures. Location Monte Castello is a hill located about north of Pistoia (Tuscany) and southwest of Bologna (Emilia-Romagna), via Localit√† Abetaia (SP623), near Abetaia di Gaggio Montano, coordinates 44.221799, 10.954227, at altitude, in the Northern Apennines. on the border between Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna regions. Operation In November 1944, the 1st Expeditionary Division of the Brazilian Army (DIE) deviated from the battle front Serchio River, where it had been fighting for two months ahead of the Rino River, on the Northern Apennine Mountains. General Mascarenhas de Moraes had established his forward headquarters in the town of Porretta Terme, which was in front of the mountains under German control. This perimeter had a radius of approximately . German artillery positions were considered privileged, subjecting the Allies to constant vigilance, hindering any progress towards Bologna and Po Valley. Estimates were that the winter would be harsh, complicating the situation that had already degenerated due to the rains and bombing, turning the roads into quagmires. Despite the situation, General Mark Clark, Commander of Allied Forces in Italy, through the troops of IV Corps (of which the Brazilian division was part), had planned to free the 8th British Army's path towards Bologna, before the first snows began to fall. German forces The Italian front was under the responsibility of Army Group C, under the command of General Oberst Heinrich von Vietinghoff. He controlled the German 10th and 14th armies and the \\"Army of Liguria,\\" the latter defending the border with France. The 14th was composed of the 14th Panzer Corps and the 51st Mountain Corps. Within the 51st Corps was the 232nd Grenadier Division (Infantry), under General Eccard von Gablenz, a veteran of Stalingrad. The 232nd was activated on 22 June 1944 and was formed of veterans who were wounded convalescents from the Russian front; it was classified as a \\"Static Division.\\" It consisted of three infantry regiments (1043¬∞, 1044¬∞ and 1045¬∞), each with only two battalions, plus a battalion of marines (reconnaissance battalion) and an artillery regiment with four groups, and smaller units. This totaled about 9,000 men. The age of the troops ranged between 17 and 40 years, with the younger and abler soldiers concentrated in the marine battalion. During the final battle, it was reinforced by the 4th Mountain Battalion (Mittenwald), which was kept in reserve. The veterans who defended this position did not have the same enthusiasm they had when the war began, but were still willing to fulfill their duty. The attack It was the responsibility of the Brazilians to win the most combative sectors of the entire Apennine front, but the 1st DIE was too inexperienced a troop to face a fight of that magnitude. Therefore, as Clark's goal was to take Bologna before Christmas, training had to be accomplished in practice, that is, in combat. Accordingly, on 24 November, the Reconnaissance Squadron and the 3rd Battalion, 6th Infantry Regiment of the 1st DIE joined U.S. Task Force 45 for a first foray to Monte Castello. On the second day of attacks, it appeared that the operation would be successful. U.S. troops reached the crest of Monte Castello after capturing neighboring Mount Belvedere. However, in a powerful counteroffensive, the men of the German 232nd Infantry Division, responsible for defending Monte Castello and Monte Della Torraca, regained the lost positions, forcing the Brazilian and American soldiers to abandon the positions already won - with the exception of Mount Belvedere. On 29 November, a second attack was planned on the hill. This counter-offensive attacking formation was almost entirely the work of the 1st DIE - with three battalions - with only the support of three platoons of American tanks. Meanwhile, an unexpected event occurred on the eve of the attack which undermined Allied plans: on the night of the 28th, the Germans made a counter-attack on Mount Belvedere, taking the Americans' position and leaving the left Allied flank uncovered. DIE initially considered postponing the attack, but as the troops had occupied their positions and the strategy had been maintained, at 7 o'clock a new attempt was made. The weather proved extremely severe: rain and overcast skies prevented any support by the Air Force and mud practically precluded the participation of tanks. The grouping of General Zen√≥bio da Costa at first got a good head start, but the German counter-attack was violent. German soldiers of the 1,043rd, 1044th and 1045th Infantry Regiments blocked the advances of the soldiers. By late afternoon, the two Brazilian battalions were back to square one. On 5 December, Gen. Mascarenhas received an order from the 4th Corps: \\"The 1st DIE is to capture and hold the summit of Monte Della Torraca - Monte Belvedere.\\" That is, after two unsuccessful attempts, Monte Castello was still the main goal of the next offensive of the Brazilians, which had been postponed for a week. But on 12 December 1944, the transaction was effected, which date would be remembered by the FEB as one of the most violent faced by Brazilian troops in the theater of operations in Italy. With the same weather conditions prevailing as before the onslaught, the 2nd and 3rd battalions of the 1st Infantry Regiment needed help. Some positions were won, but with losses caused by German artillery fire. Again the attempt at conquest proved fruitless, and caused 150 casualties, leaving 20 Brazilian soldiers dead. The lesson served to reinforce Mascarenhas' conviction that Monte Castello could only be taken if the entire division was used in the attack - and not just a few battalions, as the 5th Army had ordered. Only on 18 February 1945, after the winter weather improved, did the command of the 5th Army determine a new offensive, called Operation Encore to defeat the compound of defensive positions, formed by the Germans around mounts and locations of Monte Castello, Belvedere, Della Toraccia, Castelnuovo (di Vergato), Torre di Nerone and Castel D'Aiano, which had proved extremely resistant. It would use troops of the 1st Brazilian Division, and of the newly arrived US 10th Mountain Division.Brooks, 2003. Pages 305-06.Bohmler, 1964. Chapter IX The final attack The final attack, dubbed Operation Encore, employed the Brazilians to win the Mount and consequently expel the Germans. The tactics used were to be the same as those devised by Mascarenhas de Moraes in November. On 20 February the troops of the Brazilian Expeditionary Force were in battle position, with its three regiments ready to depart for Castello. Advancing to the left of the Brazilians was the elite American 10th Mountain Division, which had the responsibility of taking Monte della Torraca and so protecting the most vulnerable flank of the sector. The final attack on Castello began at 6 am, 21 February, with the Uzeda Battalion followed on the right, the Franklin Battalion toward the front, with Sizeno Sarmento Mountain Battalion waiting in the privileged positions they had achieved during the night to join the other two battalions. As outlined in the plans for Encore, the Brazilians were to reach the top of Monte Castello by 18.00 hours at most - one hour after the Monte della Torraca was won for the 10th Mountain Division, an event scheduled for 17.00 hours. The 4th Corps was confident that Monte Castello would not be taken before Della Torraca. However, at 17.30, when the first Battalion of the 1st Regiment Franklin conquered the summit of Monte Castello, the Americans had not overcome the German resistance. They would only accomplish this during the night, when the pracinhas had long completed their mission and begun to take up a position in the newly conquered trenches and bunkers. Much of the success of the offensive was credited to the Artillery Division commanded by General Cordeiro de Farias that between 16.00 and 17.00 on the 22nd had made a perfect barrage against the summit of Monte Castello, allowing the movement of Brazilian troops.

WHTP is powered in the daytime at 5,000 watts, using a non-directional antenna. But at night, to avoid interfering with other stations on AM 1280, it reduces power to 400 watts. The transmitter is located off Northern Avenue in Farmingdale, Maine, near the Maine Turnpike.Radio-Locator.com/WHTP WHTP is also simulcast on an FM translator station, 100.3 W262DP in Gardiner. History =Early years as WABK= The station first signed on the air on September 1, 1968. Its original call sign was WABK, owned by Abenaki Company. The station had a middle of the road format by 1971. It later moved to a full service adult contemporary sound. An FM sister station, WKME 104.3 FM, was added in 1974. Two years later, WABK shifted to a talk/MOR format. In 1977, the station was sold to Tryon Communications, and talk programming was dropped. WABK became a network affiliate of ABC Radio. WABK began simulcasting with WABK-FM, which previously aired the Drake-Chenault syndicated format known as \\"Hit Parade.\\" WABK returned to its own programming by 1984. =WQZN and WFAU= The station's call letters were changed to WQZN on January 1, 1987. The WABK call sign returned one year later, on January 31, 1988. WABK switched to an adult contemporary format that was largely simulcast with WABK-FM, although the AM station incorporated some of its own news programming. On September 8, 1994, the station took the WFAU call sign and adult standards format, moved over from 1340 AM, which then became WMDR. WFAU had broadcast at 1340 AM since October 2, 1946. =Cumulus and Clear Channel ownership= Tryon sold its Central Maine stations to Cumulus Media in 1998. Cumulus, in turn, sold the stations to Clear Channel Communications in 2000. Clear Channel dropped the standards format in 2001 in favor of a simulcast of Skowhegan-based sports radio station WSKW 1160 AM. A local marketing agreement between Clear Channel and WSKW owner Mountain Wireless ended in 2003. The simulcast was ended. WFAU, along with WIGY 97.5 FM in Madison (now WQSK), dropped ESPN Radio in favor of Fox Sports Radio. WSKW kept its ESPN Radio affiliation. The programming of WFAU and WIGY were eventually be combined with WRKD 1450 AM in Rockland (now WVOM) to form Fox Sports Maine. =Blueberry Broadcasting= Clear Channel announced on November 16, 2006 that it would sell its Central Maine stations after being bought by private equity firms. The stations were sold to Blueberry Broadcasting in 2008. Blueberry took WFAU off the air on July 1, 2013 to facilitate repairs to its antenna switching system. =Bob Bittner and MaineInvests ownership= Shortly afterward, the station was purchased for $16,200 by Blue Jey Broadcasting, owned by Bob Bittner. Bittner assumed control on September 27, 2013. The station returned to the air on October 16. It began airing an adult standards/oldies format similar to Bittner's other stations, AM 730 WJTO in Bath and AM 740 WJIB in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The call letters were changed to WJYE on October 22, 2014. On February 9, 2015, WJYE changed its format to classic country, branded as \\"Country Memories 1280.\\" On July 29, 2019, MaineInvests LLC completed its purchase of WJYE from Blue Jey Broadcasting and switched the station to a 1960s-1970s oldies format as \\"Fun Oldies 1280\\".https://radioinsight.com/headlines/179278/fun-oldies- debuts-in-central-maine/ Fun Oldies Maine logo 2019-2020 rbr.com On January 9, 2020, WJYE dropped its oldies format and began stunting as 207 Hotline Bling Radio, with a loop of Drake's \\"Hotline Bling\\". The stunt was also being simulcast on WCYR in Veazie, which dropped its classic country format. It was announced that a new format would launch on the morning of January 13. On that day, WJYE and WCYR began a trimulcast branded as Hot Radio Maine with sister station WHTP from Kennebunkport, which serves York County, southern Cumberland County (including Portland), and WCYR, which serves Bangor.

The method works by creating a command signal that cancels its own vibration. That is, vibration excited by previous parts of the command signal is cancelled by vibration excited by latter parts of the command. Input shaping is implemented by convolving a sequence of impulses, known as an input shaper, with any arbitrary command. The shaped command that results from the convolution is then used to drive the system. If the impulses in the shaper are chosen correctly, then the shaped command will excite less residual vibration than the unshaped command. The amplitudes and time locations of the impulses are obtained from the system's natural frequencies and damping ratios. Shaping can be made very robust to errors in the system parameters.

Esperanza is one of several musical/performing arts programs incorporated under its parent organization, the Esperanza Performing Arts Association, Inc. Along with a winter guard and an indoor percussion ensemble, the Esperanza Drum & Bugle Corps has established itself as San Diego's premier performing pageantry arts program. During its history the organization has included the Esperanza de Luz winterguards (Open and World), Esperanza Winter Percussion Ensemble and the San Diego Brass and Percussion Ensemble (a community band). The Esperanza Organization has produced top quality national caliber championship and finalist programs in drum corps, winter guard and winter percussion.  History  Esperanza made its debut performance in June 2000 at the Esperanza Experience held at Southwestern College in Chula Vista, CA. In its first year the corps toured Southern and Northern California ending its season in mid- July. During its second year in 2001 the corps traveled out of California for the first time by competing in the DCI Southwestern Regional at San Antonio. In 2002 the corps attended DCI Championships for the time and finished 6th in Division II. Esperanza is a one-time DCI Division II/III (Now Open Class) Champion, in 2003 with a score of 95.6. In only its fourth year the corps won the DCI Division II Championships in Orlando, Florida. This was the first time any corps from Southern California had won any DCI Championship title since 1972. After winning the 2003 Drum Corps International Division II Championship, the Corps promptly moved up the ranks by entering the Drum Corps International Regional Division I Class. The Corps is the first DCI Division I drum corps from San Diego County. Their highest finish in Division I is 20th, in the 2005 season. Esperanza Drum Majors have been:2000-Dannie Baker, 2001-2003-Rich Chavez, 2004-Michael Wojcik, 2005-2006-Sean Zanganeh.

He was born Harry Haley McClaskey and used Henry Burr as one of his many pseudonyms, in addition to Irving Gillette, Henry Gillette, Alfred Alexander, Robert Rice, Carl Ely, Harry Barr, Frank Knapp, Al King, and Shamus McClaskey. He produced more than 12,000 recordings, by his own estimate, and some of his most popular recordings included \\"Just a Baby's Prayer at Twilight\\", \\"Till We Meet Again\\" with Albert Campbell, \\"Beautiful Ohio\\", \\"I Wonder Who's Kissing Her Now\\" \\"When I Lost You\\" and \\"In The Shade Of The Old Apple Tree\\". A tenor, he performed as a soloist and in duets, trios and quartets.  Early years  Burr's childhood home in St. Stephen, New Brunswick. Born in the border town of St. Stephen, New Brunswick, Canada, Harry McClaskey was the son of a candy and tobacco store owner, A. A. McClaskey. His mother was the former Ida Connors and he was the youngest of four children.Doug Dougherty, St. Stephen - Yesteryear, n. d. (ca 2000), St Stephen: Parsons Publishing company. His vocal talents were recognized early and by the age of 5 he was performing publicly in St. Stephen. At age 10 he was the mascot for the Saint John Bicycle and Athletic Club in the nearby city of Saint John, singing \\"Her Eyes Don't Shine Like Diamonds\\" and at age 13 he was performing onstage as a boy tenor with the Artillery Band in Saint John. The family had moved to Saint John by this time. Perhaps doubting that he could make a career in music, he later attended Mt. Allison Academy in Sackville, New Brunswick, and afterwards worked for his father. On April 14, 1901, he appeared at the opera house in Saint John in his first notable concert with the Scottish soprano Jessie MacLachlan. On September 30, 1901 he was discovered by the Metropolitan Opera baritone Giuseppe Campanari who was in Saint John to perform at the St. John Opera House. Campanari insisted that McClaskey go to New York for musical training.  Recording artist  Henry Burr and the Peerless Quartet, about 1923. From left to right: John H. Meyer, Burr, Frank Croxton, Albert Campbell. Emboldened by Campanari's endorsement, McClaskey ventured to New York in 1902, where he began lessons and sang with the Grace Methodist Episcopal Church choir. He eventually rose to tenor soloist for the choir. His teachers included John Dennis Meehan (or Mehan) and Kate Stella Burr, from whom he would adopt his stage name in her honor. It was around 1902 that he started to make recordings with Columbia Records and he used the name Henry Burr at that time. He arrived at a particularly opportune time for Columbia, as their star tenor, George J. Gaskin, was in the final years of his career. Burr started recording for Edison Records in November 1904 under the name Irving Gillette. Disagreements with company executives resulted in his no longer recording for Edison after October 1914. He first recorded with Victor on January 4, 1905, and the recordings were released that March. On April 7, 1905 he recorded Egbert Van Alstyne's \\"In the Shade of the Old Apple Tree\\" which proved to be popular. It was also recorded by Billy Murray the same year. Burr proved to be a successful artist, recording thousands of songs for various labels under various names. In particular, he was very popular in the 1910s, as he had the most #1 hits in the decade, according to Joel Whitburn's research. His most successful recording was of \\"Just a Baby's Prayer at Twilight\\", which eventually sold a million copies. His total recordings were estimated to have sold around 240 million records. He would record with Leeds Talk-O-Phone, Angelophone and the American Record Company as well. His recordings also appear on International Record Company and department store labels such as Vim Records. = Collaborations = In 1906, Burr joined the Columbia Male Quartet, which was recording for the Columbia Record Company, as second tenor under the management of Frank C. Stanley. They were later renamed the Peerless Quartet when they moved to the Victor label. When Stanley died in 1910, Burr took over management of the group. It continued on as a popular recording and live group (with various personnel and name changes over the years) until 1928, when it disbanded. Burr was also a member of the Metropolitan Trio and the Manhattan Mixed Trio, both of which featured him with Frank C. Stanley and Elise Stevenson. In 1921, he contributed music to a summertime review called The Broadway Whirl.Playbill Vault, Henry Burr Broadway Theater credits Burr recorded in a duo with Albert Campbell. The pair had a succession of hits between 1911 and 1925, including \\"The Trail of the Lonesome Pine\\" (1913), \\"Somebody's Waiting for Someone\\" (1919), \\"Till We Meet Again\\" (1919), and \\"I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles\\" (1919).  As a businessman  By 1915, he was in a comfortable position financially, and he began to seek ways to invest his money. That year, he formed the Paroquette Record Manufacturing Company with Fred Van Eps, based in New York City. The Paroquette system used vertical cut records and featured his own recordings and those of several other performers. As a novel introduction in a highly competitive market, the Paroquette recording technique was an early failure, and the company was out of business by 1917. Burr also tried music publishing, and he also shared ownership in a banjo factory with Van Eps for a short while.  Early radio  Burr with microphone.Burr performed live on the radio while broadcasting technology was still in its infancy. He made his first appearance in 1920 in Denver, Colorado using a microphone improvised from a wooden bowl with an inverted telephone transmitter. The broadcast was heard as far west as San Francisco. Burr is also credited with making the first transcontinental 'broadcast' by singing into the telephone in New York and being heard by diners wearing headphones at a Rotary dinner in California. Also in 1920, he signed an exclusive contract with Victor that lasted seven years. A lucrative contract, it made him (for a time) a wealthy man. By the late 1920s, Burr's recording career was over. Electrical recording technologies had encouraged the crooner style of tenor vocals, as in the singing of Gene Austin and Al Bowlly. The commercial potential of radio continued to interest Burr. He became involved in programming, forming Henry Burr, Inc. in 1928 as a producer. He produced numerous programs for commercial radio networks into the 1930s. He originated the Cities Service broadcast, which he produced for two years. In October 1929, he reportedly lost a substantial portion of his wealth in the Wall Street Crash of 1929. Within a month, however, he was appointed Director of the Artist's Bureau at CBS which had just been organized under the ownership of William S. Paley. Around 1935, he returned to performing on the radio as a member of the WLS Chicago National Barn Dance troupe, which was broadcast over NBC on Saturday evenings. He soon became a featured performer on the show, which he stayed with for five years until shortly before his death. Death He suffered from throat cancer and died in Chicago, Illinois on April 6, 1941. Buried near his stepdaughter Marguarite in Mount Vernon, New York, where he had lived, he was survived by his wife, Cecilia. His widow died of a heart ailment in 1954 in Arlington Heights, Illinois. Cultural references Although Burr is rarely heard today in mainstream musical culture, his 1922 rendition of \\"My Buddy\\" was used on the soundtrack of a Boardwalk Empire episode, originally broadcast on October 8, 2012 (Season 3, Episode 4, \\"Blue Bell Boy\\"). Notably, in the 1960s, the famous ukulele-playing singer Tiny Tim frequently played Burr songs on stage and on such programs as The Johnny Carson Show.

The Rugged Man, Tragedy Khadafi, Wordsworth, Vast Aire, Afu-Ra, Guru, M.O.P., Inspectah Deck, Cormega, Ghostface Killah as well as many others. R.A. the Rugged Man had said in an interview that he was the first person to ever buy a beat from Ayatollah. Broadly speaking Ayatollah's production encompasses a soulful, authentic east coast hip-hop sound which has brought him steady success and acclaim since the late 1990s. Biography Ayatollah first received mainstream recognition after producing Rawkus rapper Mos Def's hit \\"Ms. Fat Booty\\", the first single off his Black on Both Sides album;Strock, Owen (2005) \\"Ayatollah Now Playing\\", CMJ New Music Monthly, Issue 137, 2005, p. 40, retrieved 2010-02-05 whilst subsequently receiving a gold plaque for probably his most well-known track to date, Styles P's hit \\"The Life\\", featuring Pharoahe Monch of Organized Konfusion, which appeared on the Rawkus Records compilation Soundbombing III. Ayatollah is a favoured producer of many Queensbridge MCs in particular, and after working with Cormega on Rap's a Hustle on his debut The Realness, the latter spoke of working on a subsequent album produced solely by Ayatollah, an eagerly awaited project which has since failed to transpire. He has released instrumental albums, 2003's unofficial debut So Many Reasons to Rhyme and since then in 2006, Listen, on Nomadic Wax, Now Playing on Nature Sounds, and The Quixotic. He worked with Rakim on \\"A Cold Feeling\\", an unreleased song for The Wash soundtrack. Ayatollah's production has been featured on many releases. Brooklyn newcomer Okai's 2006 debut album Dekonstruktion of the Mind was entirely produced by Ayatollah. He became the producer for the group T.H.U.G. Angelz, with Wu-Tang Clan affiliates Hell Razah and Shabazz the Disciple. In 2015, Ayatollah began working with the hip hop production team Widowmaker to form the trio COLOSSUS. Their debut instrumental album, Ayatollah Presents: COLOSSUS, was released digitally on June 7, 2015. A limited vinyl pressing was released in mid-August, 2015.

It was one of the first major engagements of the Korean War. An army of 140,000 UN troops, having been pushed to the brink of defeat, were rallied to make a final stand against the invading Korean People's Army (KPA), 98,000 men strong. UN forces, having been repeatedly defeated by the advancing KPA, were forced back to the \\"Pusan Perimeter\\", a defensive line around an area on the southeastern tip of South Korea that included the port of Busan. The UN troops, consisting mostly of forces from the Republic of Korea Army (ROK), United States, and United Kingdom, mounted a last stand around the perimeter, fighting off repeated KPA attacks for six weeks as they were engaged around the cities of Daegu, Masan, and Pohang and the Nakdong River. The massive KPA assaults were unsuccessful in forcing the UN troops back further from the perimeter, despite two major pushes in August and September. North Korean troops, hampered by supply shortages and massive losses, continually staged attacks on UN forces in an attempt to penetrate the perimeter and collapse the line. The UN forces, however, used the port to amass an overwhelming advantage in troops, equipment, and logistics, and its navy and air forces remained unchallenged by the KPA during the fight. After six weeks, the KPA force collapsed and retreated in defeat after the UN force launched a counterattack at Inchon on September 15 and the UN forces in the perimeter broke out from the perimeter the following day. The battle would be the furthest the KPA would advance in the war, as subsequent fighting ground the war into a stalemate.  Background  left = Outbreak of war = Following the outbreak of the Korean War, the United Nations decided to commit troops in support of South Korea, which had been invaded by the neighboring North Korea. The United States subsequently sent ground forces to the Korean Peninsula with the goal of fighting back the North Korean invasion and to prevent South Korea from collapsing. However, US forces in the Far East had been steadily decreasing since the end of World War II, five years earlier, and at the time the closest forces were the 24th Infantry Division of the Eighth United States Army, which was headquartered in Japan. The division was understrength, and most of its equipment was antiquated due to reductions in military spending. Regardless, the 24th Infantry Division was ordered into South Korea. The KPA, 89,000 men strong, had advanced into South Korea in six columns, catching the ROKA by surprise and completely routing it. The smaller ROK suffered from widespread lack of organization and equipment, and was unprepared for war. Numerically superior, KPA forces destroyed isolated resistance from the 38,000 ROK soldiers on the front before moving steadily south. Most of South Korea's forces retreated in the face of the advance. By June 28, the KPA had captured South Korea's capital Seoul, forcing the government and its shattered forces to retreat further south. Though it was steadily pushed back, ROK forces increased their resistance further south, hoping to delay KPA units as much as possible. North and South Korean units sparred for control of several cities, inflicting heavy casualties on one another. The ROK defended Yeongdeok fiercely before being forced back, and managed to repel KPA forces in the Battle of Andong. Outnumbered and under- equipped US forces‚Äîcommitted in piecemeal fashion as rapidly as they could be deployed‚Äîwere repeatedly defeated and pushed south. The 24th Division, the first US division committed, took heavy losses in the Battle of Taejon in mid- July, which they were driven from after heavy fighting. Elements of the 3rd Battalion, 29th Infantry Regiment, newly arrived in the country, were wiped out at Hadong in a coordinated ambush by KPA forces on July 27, leaving open a pass to the Pusan area. Soon after, Chinju to the west was taken, pushing back the 19th Infantry Regiment and leaving open routes to Pusan. US units were subsequently able to defeat and push back the KPA on the flank in the Battle of the Notch on August 2. Suffering mounting losses, the KPA force on the west flank withdrew for several days to re-equip and receive reinforcements. This granted both sides several days of reprieve to prepare for the attack on the Pusan Perimeter.  Prelude  = Forces involved = The KPA was organized into a mechanized combined arms force of ten divisions, originally numbering some 90,000 well-trained and well-equipped troops in July, with hundreds of T-34 tanks. However, defensive actions by US and ROK forces had delayed the KPA significantly in their invasion of South Korea, costing them 58,000 of their troops and a large number of tanks. In order to recoup these losses, the KPA had to rely on less-experienced replacements and conscripts, many of whom had been taken from the conquered regions of South Korea. During the course of the battle, the KPA raised a total of 13 infantry divisions and one armored division to fight at the Pusan Perimeter. The UN forces were organized under the command of the Eighth United States Army, which served and was headquartered at Taegu. Under it were three weak US divisions; the 24th Infantry Division was brought to the country early in July, while the 1st Cavalry Division and 25th Infantry Division arrived between July 14 and 18. These forces occupied the western segment of the perimeter, along the Naktong River. The ROK, a force of 58,000, was organized into two corps and five divisions; from east to west, I Corps controlled the 8th Infantry Division and Capital Divisions, while II Corps controlled the 1st Infantry Division and 6th Infantry Division. A reconstituted ROK 3rd Infantry Division was placed under direct ROK control. Morale among the UN units was low due to the large number of defeats incurred to that point in the war. US forces had suffered over 6,000 casualties over the past month, while the ROK had lost an estimated 70,000. Troop numbers for each side have been difficult to estimate. The KPA had around 70,000 combat troops committed to the Pusan Perimeter on August 5, with most of its divisions far understrength. It likely had less than 3,000 personnel in mechanized units, and around 40 T-34 tanks at the front, due to extensive losses so far in the war. UN commander General Douglas MacArthur reported 141,808 UN troops in Korea on August 4, of which 47,000 were in US ground combat units and 45,000 in ROK combat units. Thus the UN ground combat force outnumbered the KPA 92,000 to 70,000. UN forces had complete control of the air and sea throughout the fight as well, and US Air Force and US Navy elements provided support for the ground units throughout the battle virtually unopposed. Overall command of the naval force was taken by the US Seventh Fleet, and the bulk of the naval power provided was also from the US. The United Kingdom also provided a small naval task force including an aircraft carrier and several cruisers. Eventually, Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, and New Zealand provided ships as well. Several hundred fighter-bombers of the Fifth Air Force were positioned within the perimeter and in Japan, and just off the coast were US Navy aircraft aboard the and the . By the end of the battle the Eighth Army had more air support than General Omar Bradley's Twelfth United States Army Group in Europe during World War II. From south to northeast, the KPA units positioned opposite the UN units were the 83rd Motorized Regiment of the 105th Armored Division and then the 6th, 4th, 3rd, 2nd, 15th, 1st, 13th, 8th, 12th, and 5th Divisions and the 766th Independent Infantry Regiment. Throughout September 1950, as the battle raged, more UN forces arrived from the US and other locations. The 2nd Infantry Division, 5th Regimental Combat Team, 1st Provisional Marine Brigade, and British 27th Commonwealth Brigade arrived in Pusan later in the fighting, along with large numbers of fresh troops and equipment, including over 500 tanks. By the end of the battle, Eighth Army's force had gone from three under-strength, under- prepared divisions to four formations that were well-equipped and ready for war.UN troops unload in KoreaAn M4 Sherman tank being loaded onto a barge at the port of Oakland, California, prior to shipment to Pusan, 1950. = Logistics =  UN logistics  On July 1, the US Far East Command directed the Eighth Army to assume responsibility for all logistical support of the US and UN forces in Korea, including the ROKA. Support for the American and South Korean armies came through the United States and Japan. The re- equipping of the ROK presented the UN forces with major logistical problems in July. The biggest challenge was a shortage of ammunition. Though logistics situations improved over time, ammunition was short for much of the war. Consumption of supplies differed among the various units and a lack of a previously drafted plan forced UN logisticians to create a system on the fly. The majority of resupply by sea was conducted by cargo ships of the US Army and US Navy. The massive demand for ships forced the UN to charter private ships and bring ships out of the reserve fleet to increase the number of military vessels in service. Pusan was the only port in South Korea that had dock facilities large enough to handle a sizable amount of cargo. An emergency airlift of critically needed items began almost immediately from the United States to Japan. Although it did not fly into Korea, the Military Air Transport Service (MATS), Pacific Division, expanded rapidly after the outbreak of the war. The consumption of aviation gasoline thanks to both combat and transport aircraft was so great in the early phase of the war, taxing the very limited supply available in the Far East, that it became one of the serious logistical problems. From Pusan a good railroad system built by the Japanese extended northward. The railroads were the backbone of the UN transportation system in Korea. The of Korean vehicular roads were all of a secondary nature, as measured by American or European standards.  North Korean logistics  The North Koreans relied on a logistical system which was very lean and substantially smaller than the UN system. This logistics network was therefore capable of moving far fewer supplies, and this caused considerable difficulty for front-line troops. Based on the efficient Soviet Army model, this ground-based network relied primarily on railroads to transport supplies to the front while troops transported those items to the individual units on foot, trucks, or carts. This second effort, though more versatile, was also a substantial disadvantage because it was less efficient and often too slow to follow the moving front-line units. US aircraft attack a North Korean train with rockets and napalm, 1950. North Korea's lack of large airstrips and aircraft meant it conducted only minimal air resupply, mostly critical items being imported from China. Other than this, however, aircraft played almost no role in North Korean logistics. The North Koreans were also unable to effectively use sea transport. Ports in Wonsan and Hungnam could be used for the transport of some troops and supplies, but they remained far too underdeveloped to support any large-scale logistical movements, and the port of Inchon in the south was difficult to navigate with large numbers of ships. In mid-July, the UN Far East Air Force Bomber Command began a steady and increasing campaign against strategic North Korean logistics targets. The first of these targets was Wonsan on the east coast. Wonsan was important as a communications center that linked Vladivostok, Siberia, with North Korea by rail and sea. From it, rail lines ran to all the KPA build-up centers. The great bulk of Russian supplies for North Korea in the early part of the war came in at Wonsan, and from the beginning it was considered a major military target. By July 27, the FEAF Bomber Command had a comprehensive rail interdiction plan ready. This plan sought to cut the flow of KPA troops and materiel from North Korea to the combat area. Two cut points, the Pyongyang railroad bridge and marshaling yards and the Hamhung bridge and Hamhung and Wonsan marshaling yards, would almost completely sever North Korea's rail logistics network. Destruction of the rail bridges over the Han River near Seoul would cut rail communication to the Pusan Perimeter area. On August 4, FEAF began B-29 interdiction attacks against all key bridges north of the 37th Parallel in Korea and, on August 15, light bombers and fighter-bombers joined in the interdiction campaign. The supremacy of the Fifth Air Force in the skies over Korea forced the North Koreans in the first month of the war to resort to night movement of supplies to the battle area. They relied primarily on railroads to move supplies to the front, however a shortage of trucks posed the most serious problem of getting supplies from the trains to individual units, forcing them to rely on carts and pack animals. The KPA was able to maintain transport to its front lines over long lines of communications despite heavy and constant air attacks. The UN air effort failed to completely halt military rail transport. Ammunition and motor fuel, which took precedence over all other types of supply, continued to arrive at the front, though in smaller amounts than before. At best there were rations for only one or two meals a day. Most units had to live at least partially off the South Korean populace, scavenging for food and supplies at night. By September 1 the food situation was so bad in the KPA at the front that most of the soldiers showed a loss of stamina with resulting impaired combat effectiveness. The inefficiency of its logistics remained a fatal weakness of the KPA, costing it crucial defeats after an initial success with combat forces. The KPA's communications and supply were not capable of exploiting a breakthrough and of supporting a continuing attack in the face of massive air, armor, and artillery fire that could be concentrated against its troops at critical points. = Terrain = The main Seoul-Pusan railway and road was integral in bringing supplies to the front The UN forces established a perimeter around the port city of Pusan throughout July and August 1950. Roughly long, the perimeter stretched from the Korea Strait to the Sea of Japan west and north of Pusan. To the west the perimeter was roughly outlined by the Naktong River where it curved at the city of Taegu, except for the southernmost where the Naktong turned eastward after its confluence with the Nam River. The northern boundary was an irregular line that ran through the mountains from above Waegwan and Andong to Yongdok. With the exception of the Naktong delta to the south, and the valley between Taegu and P'ohang-dong, the terrain is extremely rough and mountainous. Northeast of P'ohang-dong along the South Korean line the terrain was especially treacherous, and movement in the region was extremely difficult. Thus, the UN established the Pusan Perimeter in a location outlined by the Sea of Japan to the south and east, the Naktong River to the west, and extremely mountainous terrain to the north, using the terrain as a natural defense. However the rough terrain also made communication difficult, particularly for the ROK forces in the P'ohang-dong area. Forces in this region also suffered from casualties related to the heat of the summer, as the Naktong region has little vegetation and clean water. Korea suffered from a severe drought in the summer of 1950, receiving only of rain as opposed to the normal during the months of July and August. Combined with temperatures of , the hot and dry weather contributed to a large number of heat and exertion casualties, particularly for the unconditioned American forces.  August push  left = Defensive position = alt=A mountain range in the distance, with one peak prominent On August 1, the Eighth Army issued an operational directive to all UN ground forces in Korea for their planned withdrawal east of the Naktong River. UN units would then establish a Main line of resistance behind what was to be called the Pusan Perimeter. The intent was to draw the line on retreating and hold off the KPA while the UN built up its forces and launched a counteroffensive. The US 25th Infantry Division held the southernmost flank at Masan, while the 24th Infantry Division withdrew to Koch'ang. The 1st Cavalry Division withdrew to Waegwan. US forces demolished all bridges over the Naktong River in the retreat. At one bridge in the 1st Cavalry Division sector, the division commander attempted several times to clear refugees from the bridge but they continued to cross it despite warnings and several attempts to clear the bridge. Eventually the commander was forced to demolish the bridge, taking several hundred refugees with it. Central to the UN defensive plan was to hold the port of Pusan, where vital ground supplies and reinforcements were arriving from Japan and the US. Pusan possessed airfields where US combat and cargo aircraft were streaming into Korea with more supplies. A system similar to the Red Ball Express in World War II was employed to get supplies from Pusan to the front lines. Hundreds of ships arrived in Pusan each month, starting with 230 in July and increasing steadily thereafter. On July 24, the UN established its highest command under MacArthur in Tokyo, Japan. KPA forces in the meantime were suffering from overextended supply lines which severely reduced their fighting capacity. KPA forces had four possible routes in the perimeter: to the south, the pass through the city of Masan around the confluence of the Nam and Naktong rivers; another southerly route through the Naktong Bulge and into the railroad lines at Miryang; through the route into Taegu in the north; and through Kyongju in the eastern corridor. The KPA mounted a large offensive in August, simultaneously attacking all four entries into the perimeter. As a result, the Battle of Pusan Perimeter was not one single engagement, but a series of large battles fought between the UN and KPA divisions all along the perimeter. = UN Counteroffensive = Troops of the 24th Infantry move to the Masan battleground The Eighth Army, commanded by Lieutenant General Walton Walker, began preparing a counteroffensive, the first conducted by the UN in the war, for August. It would kick off with an attack by the US reserve units on the Masan area to secure Chinju, followed by a larger general push to the Kum River in the middle of the month. One of Walker's goals was to break up a suspected massing of KPA troops near the Taegu area by forcing the diversion of some KPA units southward. On August 6, the Eighth Army issued the operational directive for the attack by Task Force Kean, named for the US 25th Infantry Division commander, William B. Kean. Task Force Kean consisted of the 25th Division, less the 27th Infantry Regiment and a field artillery battalion, plus the 5th Regimental Combat Team and the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade attached ‚Äî a force of about 20,000 men. The plan of attack required the force to move west from positions held near Masan, seize the Chinju Pass, and secure the line as far as the Nam River. However, the offensive relied on the arrival of the entire 2nd Infantry Division, as well as three more battalions of American tanks. Task Force Kean launched its attack on August 7, moving out from Masan, but Kean's attack resulted in a meeting engagement with one being simultaneously delivered by the KPA. Heavy fighting continued in the area for three days. By August 9, Task Force Kean was poised to retake Chinju. The Americans initially advanced quickly though heavy KPA resistance. On August 10, the Marines picked up the advance. However, the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade was withdrawn from the force on August 12 to be redeployed elsewhere on the perimeter. Task Force Kean continued forward, capturing the area around Chondong-ni. Eighth Army requested several of its units to redeploy to Taegu to be used elsewhere on the front, particularly at the Naktong Bulge. alt=A tank advances up a hill followed by men in military uniform An attempt to move the 25th Infantry Division's division trains through the valley became mired in the mud through the night of August 10‚Äì11 and was attacked in the morning by KPA forces who had driven American forces from the high ground. In the confusion, KPA armor was able to penetrate roadblocks and assault the supporting US artillery positions. The surprise attack was successful in wiping out most of the 555th and 90th Field Artillery Battalions, with much of their equipment. Both KPA and American armor swarmed to the scene and US Marine aircraft continued to provide cover, but neither side was able to make appreciable gains despite inflicting massive numbers of casualties on one another. Upon later inspection, the bodies of 75 men, 55 from the 555th Field Artillery and 20 from the 90th Field Artillery, were found executed when the area again came under American control. Task Force Kean was forced to withdraw back to Masan, unable to hold its gains, and by August 14 it was in approximately the same position it had been in when it started the offensive. Task Force Kean had failed in its objective of diverting KPA troops from the north, and also failed in its objective of reaching the Chinju Pass. However, the offensive was considered to have significantly increased morale among the troops of the 25th Infantry Division, which performed extremely well in subsequent engagements. The KPA 6th Division had been reduced to 3,000-4,000 and had to replenish its ranks with South Korean conscripts from Andong. Fighting in the region continued for the rest of the month. = Naktong Bulge = About north of the confluence of the Naktong and Nam Rivers, the Naktong curves westward opposite Yongsan in a wide semicircular loop. For most of this span, the Naktong river is around wide and deep, allowing infantry to wade across with some difficulty, but preventing vehicles from crossing without assistance. This perimeter was manned by a network of observation posts on the high ground where forces from the 24th Infantry Division monitored the river area. Forces in reserve would counterattack any attempted crossings by KPA forces. The division was spread extremely thinly; already understrength, it presented a very weak line.

A second force attempted to cross the river further north but met with resistance and fell back. On the morning of August 6, the KPA attacked in an attempt to penetrate the lines to Yongsan. This caught the Americans, who were expecting an attack from further north, by surprise and drove them back. Subsequently, the KPA were able to capture a large amount of American equipment. The attack threatened to split the American lines and disrupt supply lines to the north. Despite American counterattacks, the KPA were able to continue pressing forward and take Cloverleaf Hill and Oblong-ni Ridge, critical terrain astride the main road in the bulge area. By August 10 the entire KPA 4th Division was across the river and beginning to move south, outflanking the American lines. The next day, scattered KPA elements attacked Yongsan. The KPA forces repeatedly attacked US lines at night, when American soldiers were resting and had greater difficulty resisting.  North Korean defeat  The 1st Marine Provisional Brigade, in conjunction with Task Force Hill, mounted a massive offensive on Cloverleaf Hill and Obong-ni on August 17. At first tenacious KPA defense halted the Marines' push. The KPA then mounted a counterattack following this in hopes of pushing the Marines back, but this failed disastrously. By nightfall on August 18, the KPA 4th Division had been nearly annihilated and Obong-ni and Cloverleaf Hill had been retaken by US forces. The next day, the remains of the 4th Division withdrew completely across the river. In their hasty retreat, they left a large number of artillery pieces and equipment behind which the Americans used. = Eastern corridor = The terrain along the ROK front on the eastern corridor made movement extremely difficult. A major road ran from Taegu east, to P'ohang- dong on Korea's east coast. The only major north-south road intersecting this line moved south from Andong through Yongch'on, midway between Taegu and P'ohang-dong. The only other natural entry through the line was at the town of An'gang-ni, west of P'ohang-dong, situated near a valley through the natural rugged terrain to the major rail hub of Kyongju, which was a staging post for moving supplies to Taegu. Walker chose not to heavily reinforce the area as he felt the terrain made meaningful attack impossible, preferring to respond to attack with reinforcements from the transportation routes and air cover from Yongil Airfield, which was south of P'ohang-dong. 315x315px  Triple offensive  In early August, three KPA divisions mounted offensives against the three passes through the area, with the 8th Division attacking Yongch'on, 12th Division attacking P'ohang-dong and 5th Division, in conjunction with the 766th Independent Infantry Regiment, attacking An'gang-ni. The 8th Division drove for Yongch'on from Uiseong, but its attack failed to reach the Taegu-P'ohang corridor after being surprised and outflanked by the ROK 8th Division. This fighting was so heavy that the KPA 8th Division was forced to hold its ground for a week before trying to advance. Stalled again by ROK resistance, it halted to wait for reinforcements. However the other two attacks were more successful, catching the UN forces by surprise. East of the KPA and ROK 8th Divisions, the KPA 12th Division crossed the Naktong River at Andong, moving through the mountains in small groups to reach P'ohang-dong. UN planners had not anticipated that the 12th Division would be able to cross the river effectively, and thus were unprepared. In the meantime, the ROK 3rd Division was heavily engaged with the KPA 5th Division along the coastal road to P'ohang-dong. The divisions' clashes centered on the town of Yongdok, with each side capturing and recapturing the town several times. On August 5, the KPA attacked, again taking the town from the ROK and pushing them south. On August 6, the ROK launched a counteroffensive to retake the town. However, KPA 5th Division forces were able to infiltrate the coastal road south of Yongdok at Hunghae. This effectively surrounded the ROK 3rd Division, trapping it several miles above P'ohang-dong. The KPA 766th Independent Regiment advanced around the ROK 3rd Division and took the area around P'ohang-dong. 277x277px On August 10, the Eighth Army organized Task Force P'ohang ‚Äî the ROK 17th, 25th, and 26th Regiments as well as the ROK 1st Anti-Guerrilla Battalion, Marine Battalion and a battery from the US 18th Field Artillery Regiment. This task force was given the mission to clear out KPA forces in the mountainous region. At the same time, Eighth Army formed Task Force Bradley, consisting of elements of the 8th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Infantry Division. Task Force Bradley was tasked with defending P'ohang-dong. What followed was a complicated series of fights throughout the region around P'ohang-dong and An'gang-ni as ROK forces, aided by US air forces, engaged groups of KPA in the area. The KPA 12th Division was operating in the valley west of P'ohang-dong and was able to push back Task Force P'ohang and the ROK Capital Division, which was along the line to the east. At the same time, the KPA 766th Infantry Regiment and elements of the KPA 5th Division fought Task Force Bradley at and south of P'ohang-dong. US naval fire drove the KPA troops from the town, but it became a bitterly contested no man's land as fighting moved to the surrounding hills.235x235px  Fight for P'ohang-dong  By August 13, KPA troops were operating in the mountains west and southwest of Yongil Airfield. USAF commanders, wary of KPA attacks, evacuated the 39th Fighter Squadron and 40th Fighter Squadron from the airstrip, against the wishes of General MacArthur. In the event, the airstrip remained under the protection of UN ground forces and never came under direct fire. The squadrons were moved to Tsuiki Air Field on the island of Kyushu, Japan. In the meantime, the ROK 3rd Division, surrounded earlier in the month, was forced further south to the village of Changsa-dong, where US Navy craft amphibiously withdrew the division. The division would sail south to Yongil Bay to join the other UN forces in a coordinated attack to push the KPA out of the region. This evacuation was carried out on the night of August 16. By August 14, large KPA forces were focused entirely on taking P'ohang-dong. However they were unable to hold it because of US air superiority and naval bombardment on the town. The KPA supply chain had completely broken down and more food, ammunition, and supplies were not available. UN forces began their final counteroffensive against the stalled KPA forces on August 15. Intense fighting around P'ohang- dong ensued for several days as each side suffered large numbers of casualties in back-and-forth battles. By August 17, UN forces were able to push KPA troops out of the Kyongju and An'gang-ni areas, putting the supply road to Taegu out of immediate danger. By August 19 the KPA forces had completely withdrawn from the offensive. = Taegu = Shortly before the Pusan Perimeter battles began, Walker established Taegu as the Eighth Army's headquarters. Right at the center of the Pusan Perimeter, Taegu stood at the entrance to the Naktong River valley, an area where KPA forces could advance in large numbers in close support. The natural barriers provided by the Naktong River to the south and the mountainous terrain to the north converged around Taegu, which was also the major transportation hub and last major South Korean city aside from Pusan itself to remain in UN hands. From south to north, the city was defended by the US 1st Cavalry Division, and the ROK 1st and 6th Divisions of ROK II Corps. 1st Cavalry Division was spread out along a long line along the Naktong River to the south, with its 5th and 8th Cavalry Regiments holding a line along the river and the 7th Cavalry Regiment in reserve along with artillery forces, ready to reinforce anywhere a crossing could be attempted.  Taegu advance  Five KPA divisions amassed to oppose the UN at Taegu; from south to north, the 10th, 3rd, 15th, 13th, and 1st Divisions occupied a line from Tuksong-dong and around Waegwan to Kunwi. The KPA planned to use the natural corridor of the Naktong valley from Sangju to Taegu as their main axis of attack for the next push south. Elements of the 105th Armored Division were also supporting the attack. By August 7, the KPA 13th Division had crossed the Naktong River at Naktong-ni, northwest of Taegu. ROK troops attacked the 13th Division immediately after it completed its crossing, forcing the KPA troops to scatter into the mountains. The division reassembled to the east and launched a concerted night attack, broke the ROK defenses, and began an advance that carried it twenty miles (32 km) southeast of Naktong-ni on the main road to Taegu. Within a week, the KPA 1st and 13th divisions were converging on the Tabu-dong area, about north of Taegu. US artillery near Waegwan fires at North Korean troops attempting to cross the Naktong River During August 12‚Äì16, the KPA 15th Division formed up on the east side of the Naktong River in the vicinity of Yuhak-san, northwest of Tabu-dong. It was quickly locked in combat on Yuhak-san with the ROK 1st Division.  Triangulation Hill  South of Waegwan, two more KPA divisions stood ready to cross the Naktong River in a coordinated attack with the divisions to the north. The experienced KPA 3rd Division was concentrated in the vicinity of Songju, while the untested KPA 10th Division was concentrated in the Koryong area. These two divisions crossed in the US 1st Cavalry Division's line. The KPA 3rd Division's 7th Regiment started crossing the Naktong on August 9. Despite being spotted and taking fire, the bulk of it reached the east bank safely and moved inland into the hills. The 5th Cavalry Regiment and its supporting artillery, now fully alerted, spotted the other two regiments and forced them back to the west bank. Only a small number of KPA reached the east side where either they were captured, or hid until recrossing the river the following night. At dawn on August 9, 1st Cavalry Division learned of the North Korean crossing. KPA infantry had gathered on Hill 268, also known as Triangulation Hill, which was southeast of Waegwan and northwest of Taegu. The hill was important for its proximity to lines of communication, as the main Korean north-south highway and the main double-track Seoul-Pusan railroad skirted its base. 1st Cavalry Division counterattacked the KPA gathering to force them back across the river, but their initial assault was repelled. The next morning, August 10, air strikes and artillery barrages rocked Hill 268, devastating the KPA, who withdrew back behind the river.  Yongp'o  The KPA plan for the attack against Taegu from the west and southwest demanded the KPA 3rd and 10th Divisions make a coordinated attack. Elements of the 10th Division began crossing the Naktong early on August 12, in the vicinity of Tuksong-dong, on the Koryong-Taegu road, but were driven back. A more determined KPA crossing began early in the morning on August 14. This attack also stalled and was driven back to the river. By nightfall, the bridgehead at Yongp'o was eliminated.  Carpet bombing  US Air Force post-strike picture of a area near Waegwan, in which 99 bombers dropped 3500, 500lb bombs In the mountains northeast of Waegwan, the ROK 1st Division continued to suffer from KPA attacks throughout mid-August. KPA pressure against the division never ceased for long. US planners believed the main KPA attack would come from the west, and so it massed its forces to the west of Taegu. It mistakenly believed up to 40,000 KPA troops were near Taegu. This number was above the actual troop numbers for the KPA, which had only 70,000 men along the entire perimeter. On August 14, General MacArthur ordered the carpet bombing of a rectangular area on the west side of the Naktong River opposite the ROK 1st Division. On August 16, bombers dropped approximately 960 tons of bombs on the area. The attack required the entire FEAF bombing component, and comprised the largest USAF operation since the Battle of Normandy in World War II. Information obtained later from KPA prisoners revealed the divisions the Far East Command thought to be still west of the Naktong had already crossed to the east side and were not in the bombed area. No evidence was found that the bombing killed a single North Korean soldier. However, the bombing appeared to have destroyed a significant number of KPA artillery batteries, as artillery fire on UN positions waned substantially following the mission. The UN ground and air commanders opposed future massive carpet bombing attacks unless there was precise information on an enemy concentration and the situation was critical. Instead, they recommended fighter-bombers and dive bombers would better support ground forces.  September push  alt=A map of troop movements against a defensive line on the southeastern tip of a landmass The KPA had been pushed to its limits and many of the original units were at much reduced strength and effectiveness by the end of August. Logistical problems wracked the KPA, with shortages of food, weapons, equipment and replacement soldiers common. By late August, the UN command had more combat soldiers in Korea than the KPA, and the UN had near-total superiority over the air and sea. KPA tank losses had been in the hundreds, and it had fewer than 100 tanks by September 1, compared to the Americans' 600 tanks. By the end of August the KPA's only remaining advantage was their initiative, as the KPA troops retained a high morale and enough supplies to allow for a large-scale offensive. Fed by intelligence from the Soviet Union, the North Koreans were aware the UN forces were building up along the Pusan Perimeter and that they had to conduct an offensive soon or else forfeit the battle. In planning its new offensive, the KPA commanders decided that any attempt to flank the UN force was impossible thanks to the support of UN naval forces. Instead, they opted to use frontal attacks to breach the perimeter and collapse it. A secondary objective was to surround Taegu and destroy the UN units in that city. As part of this mission, the KPA would first cut the supply lines to Taegu. North Korean planners enlarged their force in anticipation of a new offensive. The KPA, originally numbering 10 divisions in two corps, was enlarged to 14 divisions with several independent brigades. The new troops were brought in from reserve forces based in North Korea. Marshal Choe Yong Gun served as deputy commander of the KPA, with General Kim Chaek in charge of the Front Headquarters. Beneath them were the II Corps in the east and I Corps in the west. II Corps controlled the KPA 10th, 2nd, 4th, 9th, 7th, and 6th Divisions as well as the 105th Armored Division, with the 16th Armored Brigade and 104th Security Brigade in support. I Corps commanded the 3rd, 13th, 1st, 8th, 15th, 12th, and 5th Divisions with the 17th Armored Brigade in support. This force numbered approximately 97,850 men, although a third of it comprised raw recruits or forced conscripts from South Korea, and lacked weapons and equipment. By August 31 they were facing a UN force of 120,000 combat troops plus 60,000 support troops. On August 20, the KPA commands distributed operations orders to their subordinate units. These orders called for a simultaneous five-prong attack against the UN lines. This would overwhelm the UN defenders and allow the KPA to break through the lines in at least one place to push the UN forces back. Five battle groupings were ordered as follows: # 6th and 7th Divisions to break through the US 25th Infantry Division at Masan. # 9th, 4th, 2nd, and 10th Divisions to break through the US 2nd Infantry Division at the Naktong Bulge to Miryang and Yongsan. # 3rd, 13th, and 1st Divisions to break through the US 1st Cavalry Division and ROK 1st Division to Taegu. # 8th and 15th Divisions to break through the ROKA 8th Division and ROKA 6th Division to Hayang and Yongch'on. # 12th and 5th Divisions to break through the ROKA Capital Division and ROKA 3rd Division to P'ohang-dong and Kyongju. On August 22, North Korean Premier Kim Il Sung ordered the war to be over by September 1, but the scale of the offensive did not allow for this. Groups 1 and 2 were to begin their attack at 23:30 on August 31 and Groups 3, 4, and 5 would begin their attacks at 18:00 on September 2. The attacks were to closely connect in order to overwhelm UN troops at each point simultaneously, forcing breakthroughs in multiple places that the UN would be unable to reinforce. The KPA also relied primarily on night attacks to counter the UN's major advantages in air superiority and naval firepower. KPA generals thought such night attacks would prevent UN forces from firing effectively and result in large numbers of UN friendly fire casualties. The attacks caught UN planners and troops by surprise. By August 26, the UN troops believed they had destroyed the last serious threats to the perimeter, and anticipated the war ending by late November. ROK units, in the meantime, suffered from low morale thanks to their failures to defend effectively thus far in the conflict. UN troops were looking ahead to Operation Chromite, their amphibious assault far behind North Korean lines at the port of Inchon on September 15, and did not anticipate the KPA would mount a serious offensive before then. The Great Naktong Offensive was one of the most brutal fights of the Korean War. The five-prong offensive led to heavy fighting around Haman, Kyongju, Naktong Bulge, Nam River, Yongsan, Tabu-Dong and Ka-san. The KPA attacks made appreciable gains and forced the UN troops along the Pusan Perimeter to form a thin line of defense, relying on mobile reserves for the strength to push back KPA attackers. From September 18 this fighting was intense and the battle was a very costly deadlock for the two overextended armies. The KPA were initially successful in breaking through UN lines in multiple places and made substantial gains in surrounding and pushing back UN units. On September 4‚Äì5 the situation was so dire for the UN troops that the Eighth Army and ROK moved their headquarters elements from Taegu to Pusan to prevent them from being overrun, though Walker remained in Taegu with a small forward detachment. They also prepared their logistics systems for a retreat to a smaller defensive perimeter called the Davidson Line. By September 6, however, Walker decided another retreat would not be necessary. On September 15, exhausted KPA troops were caught unaware by the landings at Inchon, far behind their lines. Those forces that remained after 15 days of fighting were forced to retreat in a total rout or risk being completely cut off. Isolated KPA resistance continued until September 18, but on that date UN troops were mounting a full-scale breakout offensive and pursuing retreating KPA units to the north, ending the fighting around the Pusan Perimeter.  Aftermath  The Pusan Perimeter on September 15. The blue arrow indicated the Battle of Inchon, which had ended the attack on the perimeter Medals of Honor were awarded to 17 US servicemen in the fight. USAF Major Louis J. Sebille was the only person from his branch to receive the medal. US Army recipients include Master Sergeant Melvin O. Handrich, Private First Class Melvin L. Brown, Corporal Gordon M. Craig, Private First Class Joseph R. Ouellette, Sergeant First Class Ernest R. Kouma, Master Sergeant Travis E. Watkins, First Lieutenant Frederick F. Henry, Private First Class Luther H. Story, Sergeant First Class Charles W. Turner, Private First Class David M. Smith, Sergeant First Class Loren R. Kaufman, and Private First Class William Thompson. Sergeant William R. Jecelin and Corporal John W. Collier were also awarded the medal during the breakout offensive. One Commonwealth serviceman was awarded the Victoria Cross during the breakout offensive, Major Kenneth Muir. = Casualties = Both the UN and KPA forces suffered massive casualties. The US 5th Regimental Combat Team had 269 killed, 574 wounded and four captured during the battle. The US 1st Cavalry Division suffered 770 killed, 2,613 wounded and 62 captured. The 2nd Infantry Division suffered 1,120 killed, 2,563 wounded, 67 captured and 69 missing. The 24th Infantry Division suffered 402 killed, 1,086 wounded, five captured and 29 missing. The 29th Infantry Regimental Combat Team suffered 86 killed, 341 wounded, 1 captured and 7 missing. The 25th Infantry Division suffered 650 killed, 1,866 wounded, four captured and 10 missing. With other non-divisional units, the US Army's total casualty count for the battle was 3,390 killed, 9,326 wounded, 97 captured (9 of whom died in captivity) and 174 missing, adding up to 12,987 casualties. The US Marine Corps suffered 185 killed, the US Navy suffered 14 killed and the USAF suffered 53 killed. Another 736 were killed, 2,919 wounded and 12 missing during the breakout offensive from the perimeter. The official count for US casualties was 4,599 killed, 12,058 wounded, 2,701 missing, 401 captured. South Korean casualty numbers are nearly impossible to estimate, but are known to be at least twice the total UN casualty count, or at least 40,000. The US also lost 60 tanks in the fight, bringing the total number lost in the war to that date to 136. There were also a small number of British casualties in the campaign, including five soldiers killed. Naval rating J.W. Addison was the first casualty in Pusan, killed August 23 aboard when the ship was attacked by a North Korean aircraft. On August 29, Lieutenant Commander I. M. MacLachlan, commander of 800 Naval Air Squadron, was killed in an aircraft accident aboard . Additionally, three British troops of the 27th Brigade were killed near Taegu; Private Reginald Streeter was killed September 4, and Captain C. N. A. Buchanan and Private T. Taylor died September 6. Another 17 British soldiers were wounded in the area. Two war correspondents were killed in the campaign, Ian Morrison, a reporter for The Times, and Christopher Buckley, a reporter for The Daily Telegraph, were killed August 13 near Waegwan when their vehicle struck a landmine. One Indian Armed Forces officer was also killed in the incident, Colonel Manakampat Kesavan Unni Nayar, a representative from the United Nations Commission on Korea. North Korean casualties for the battle are almost impossible to estimate precisely due to a lack of records. It is difficult to determine how many South Korean citizens were forcibly conscripted during the battle and how many deserted as opposed to being killed. Larger engagements destroyed entire regiments and even divisions of KPA troops, and their strength had to be estimated based on accounts of KPA captured by the UN. On September 1, the KPA numbered approximately 97,850 in South Korea, and up to one third of this number is suspected to have been conscripts from South Korea. In the aftermath of the Pusan Perimeter battle, only 25,000 or 30,000 of these soldiers returned to North Korea by the end of the month. Upwards of one third of the attacking force became casualties in the fighting. This would mean KPA casualties from September 1 to 15 could range from roughly 41,000 to 36,000 killed and captured, with an unknown number of wounded. With the addition of the 5,690 killed in the Bowling Alley, 3,500 at the Naktong Bulge, at least 3,700 at Taegu and an unknown number at P'ohang-dong before September 1, KPA casualties likely topped 50,000 to 60,000 by the end of the battle. They also lost 239 T-34 tanks and 74 SU-76 self-propelled guns; virtually all of the armor they possessed. = War crimes = Bodies of Hill 303 massacre victims gathered near Waegwan, South Korea, many with their hands still bound. Instances of war crimes were alleged to have occurred mainly by the North Korean side. The KPA troops, in occupying South Korea, were accused of many instances of abuse of prisoners of war captured during the fighting. Among these were accusations that some captured UN prisoners were tortured and executed. Isolated incidents of prisoners being beaten, castrated, burned to death, and used for bayonet practice arose. In the Taegu region, groups of captured soldiers were found executed with their hands bound. This was also known to have occurred at Masan, where isolated instances of prisoners being used as human shields against other UN troops were known to have taken place. Critically wounded UN troops were known to have been killed, and in at least one instance, unarmed chaplains and medics were attacked despite wearing proper identification. The KPA were also known to have forcibly conscripted South Korean civilians into their armies on a large scale, killing any who attempted to desert. The most infamous North Korean war crime was the Hill 303 massacre on August 17, when 41 US prisoners of war were killed by KPA driving on Taegu. The crime led UN Commander Douglas MacArthur to warn the North Koreans via leaflets and broadcasts that they would be held responsible for such crimes. KPA commanders are known to have issued more stern orders regarding treatment of prisoners of war after these incidents, though such atrocities continued. UN troops, particularly South Korean, were also accused of killing or attempting to kill captured KPA soldiers. South Korean civilians, some of whom were leftist or communist sympathizers, were known to have been systematically imprisoned or killed in the Bodo League massacres, some of which have taken place during the battle.Shortly before the Pusan Perimeter fighting, retreating 1st Cavalry Division troops and U.S. warplanes killed an estimated 250-300 South Korean civilians, mostly women and children, in the No Gun Ri massacre. U.S. commanders had adopted a policy of firing on approaching refugee groups, for fear of North Korean infiltrators. Such killings continued during the Naktong River fighting, when commanders declared refugees \\"fair game\\" and issued such orders as \\"shoot all refugees coming across river.\\" = Implications = Some historians contend the goals of the North Koreans at the Pusan Perimeter were unattainable from the beginning. According to historian T. R. Fehrenbach, the Americans, who had been better equipped than the KPA, were easily able to defeat their opponents once they had the chance to form a continuous line. At the same time, the KPA did break through the perimeter at several points and were able to exploit their gains for a short time. Within a week, though, the momentum of the offensive had been slowed and the KPA could not keep up the strength of their attacks. Most of the front saw only probing actions for the remainder of the battle. North Korean T-34 tanks destroyed by US Air Force bombs near Waegwan The Inchon landings were a crushing blow for the KPA, catching it completely unprepared and breaking the already weak forces along the perimeter. With virtually no equipment, exhausted manpower and low morale, the KPA were at a severe disadvantage and were not able to continue to pressure on the Pusan Perimeter while attempting to repel the landings at Inchon. By September 23, the KPA were in full retreat from the Pusan Perimeter, with UN forces rapidly pursuing them north and recapturing lost ground along the way. The destruction of the KPA at Pusan made communist continuation of the war impossible with North Korean troops alone. The massive equipment and manpower losses rivaled those of the ROK in the first stages of the war. The North Koreans totally collapsed as a fighting force, and the remainder of their routed military retreated into North Korea offering very weak resistance against the UN force, which was now on the offensive with overwhelming superiority by land, air and sea. Many of the outmaneuvered KPA units simply surrendered, having been reduced from units of thousands to just a few hundred men. With the successful Pusan Perimeter holding action, the victory set in motion the moves which would shape the remainder of the war. MacArthur and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, pushed by US leaders in Washington, decided to aggressively pursue the shattered KPA into North Korea. The Eighth Army was ordered to advance as far north as possible to Manchuria and North Korea's border with China, with the primary objective of destroying what remained of the KPA and the secondary objective of uniting all of Korea under President of South Korea Syngman Rhee. This agitated China, which threatened that it would \\"not stand aside should the imperialists wantonly invade the territory of their neighbor.\\" Warnings from other nations not to cross the 38th Parallel went unheeded and MacArthur began the offensive into the country when North Korea refused to surrender. This would eventually result in Chinese intervention once the UN troops approached the Yalu River, and what was originally known as the \\"Home By Christmas Offensive\\" turned into a war that would continue for another two-and-a-half years.

Woolworths Limited also owns BWS and Woolworths Liquor, another liquor chain with smaller stores. Dan Murphy's competes principally with Wesfarmers brands 1st Choice Liquor Superstore, Vintage Cellars and Liquorland. The business offers a \\"lowest liquor price guarantee\\" and promises to beat any competitor's advertised price. History Daniel Francis Murphy, a winemaker, journalist and founder of the first wine club in Australia, learned the trade working in a liquor store owned by his father Timothy Murphy. In 1952, Dan Murphy opened his first liquor store. Located on Prahran's Chapel Street, it was just a few hundred metres away from his father's store. Murphy was heavily involved in the Australian wine industry, and he was a friend to influential winemakers, including Maurice O'Shea and Max Schubert. After growing his business to five stores across Victoria, Murphy sold his business to Woolworths in 1998. The business has since contributed to the formation of an oligopoly in the Australian liquor market, with concerns about the ability of smaller liquor retailers to compete.  Stores  As of 2020, there are 241 Dan Murphy's stores operating across Australia: 74 in Victoria, 69 in New South Wales, 50 in Queensland, 23 in Western Australia, 18 in South Australia, 5 in the Australian Capital Territory, and 2 in Tasmania. In addition to its physical stores, Dan Murphy's also operates danmurphys.com.au, which is responsible for more than 50% of online sales of alcohol in Australia. In 2016, Woolworths opened The Dan Murphy's Cellar. Located in the cellar of Dan Murphy's original Prahran store, The Cellar focusses on boutique and premium liquor products.  Services  My Dan Murphy's Dan Murphy's launched My Dan Murphy's, its customer rewards program, in 2014. As of October 2016, the program has more than 1.7 million members. Connections In 2014, Dan Murphy's introduced its online Connections service. This allows small or international producers to sell their products directly to customers through the Dan Murphy's website. Lowest Liquor Price Guarantee Dan Murphy's offers its customers a \\"lowest liquor price guarantee\\" and promises to beat any competitor's advertised price ‚Äì provided the competitor's store is located within 10 kilometres. Criticism Dan Murphy's pricing strategy sparked an anti-competition problem in 2003, with industry analysts claiming that Woolworths and Coles were seeking to bankrupt rival liquor retailers, mostly by lowering prices of wine. The business has admitted to selling liquor at times below cost to \\"aggressively drive sales\\". Furthermore, the original Dan Murphy had a similar strategy with his below cost marketing being cross subsidised by fraudulent avoidance of Sales Tax to the detriment of his competitors who could not match his prices. Another major concern amongst rival liquor retailers has been Woolworths' aggressive acquisition strategy, buying up small independent stores to increase market share against main rival Coles Group, or opening up new stores, placing pressure on existing retailers by taking away sales. In Woolworths' 2006 Annual Report, the company reported 15 new Dan Murphy's stores had opened in the reported financial year, taking the total to 56, and that the company had the sites and licences to have more than 100 stores open within the next two to three years.

These environments include, but are not limited to: science platform aircraft and aircraft- deployable systems; space vehicles, space stations, habitats and lunar and planetary surface construction bases; and Earth-based control, experiment, launch, logistics, payload, simulation and test facilities. Earth analogs to space applications may include Antarctic, desert, high altitude, underground, undersea environments and closed ecological systems. The American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) Design Engineering Technical Committee (DETC) meets several times a year to discuss policy, education, standards, and practice issues pertaining to aerospace architecture. See http://www.spacearchitect.org/  The role of Appearance in Aerospace architecture  \\"The role of design creates and develops concepts and specifications that seek to simultaneously and synergistically optimize function, production, value and appearance.\\" In connection with, and with respect to, human presence and interactions, appearance is a component of human factors and includes considerations of human characteristics, needs and interests. Appearance in this context refers to all visual aspects ‚Äì the statics and dynamics of form(s), color(s), patterns, and textures in respect to all products, systems, services, and experiences. Appearance/esthetics affects humans both psychologically and physiologically and can effect/improving both human efficiency, attitude, and well-being. In reference to non-habitable design the influence of appearance is minimal if not non- existent. However, as the industry of aerospace continues to rapidly grow, and missions to put humans on Mars and back to the Moon are being announced. The role that appearance/esthetics to maintain crew well-being and health of multi-month or year missions becomes a monumental factor in mission success. Habitable Structures within Earth's Atmosphere =Appearance/esthetics= Appearance/esthetics in aerospace design must at least co-exist, if not be synergistic, with the overall/societal fundamentals/metrics of aerospace engineering design. These metrics, for atmospheric flight consist of overall/societal factors directed toward productivity, safety, environmental issues such as noise/emissions and accessibly/ affordability. Furthermore, technological parameters such as space, weight and drag minimization and propulsion efficiency highly dictate and restrain the boundaries of appearance/esthetic design. Major factors that need to be considered in atmospheric flight design include producability, maintainability, reliability, flyability, inspectability, flexibility, repairability, operability, durability, and airport compatibility. Habitable Structures outside of Low- Earth Orbit (LEO) What is different concerning space in reference to human- centered design thinking is the nearly complete lack of human presence. Human- centered design influence wholly operates within the context of human interactions; how operations/ missions are ran (operability) or how products, systems, services, or experiences (PSSE‚Äôs) affect end users (usability). Currently the human presence involves the space station and the relatively few international rocket systems. =Human-Centered Design= Due to the large space boom and technological advancements, over the past decade numerous countries and companies have released statements that human expeditions to our solar system are far from done. With long duration confinement in limited interior space in micro-g with little-to-no real variability in environment, attention towards user [crew] subjects well-being, and mental alertness will pose complex human-centered design issues. Mars transit vehicles and surface habitats will constitute highly confined, technical settings characterized by social, emotional and physical deprivation while affording little opportunity to experience privacy and environmental variation. And esthetic/appearance measures for human exploration will emphasize upon ‚Äúnaturalistic countermeasures‚Äù to the innate/multitudinous stresses of such expeditions. Although human wants, needs, and limitations both physically and mentally need to be evaluated and address when designing for space. Design decisions must at least co-exist, if not be synergistic, with the overall metrics of aerospace engineering design. Ex. The International Space Station Toilet. =Past Examples= A study conducted in 1989 (reference 2) found that when given multiple photographs and paintings as potential decoration of the international space station. Test (crew) subjects all individually preferred those with naturalistic, irrespective themes, and a large depth of field. Other examples of human-centered design is using pastel paints on the International Space Station (ISS) to contrast and provide ‚Äúup/down‚Äù cues in micro-g environments or the concept of dynamically and spatially adjusting lighting color and intensities to conform to daily and even seasonal biorhythms similar to earth to mitigate the societal separation effects experienced in space.

Paley, who was based in London. Nachtsender 1212 broadcast from the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg using the former commercial radio facilities known as Radio Luxembourg, which had been occupied and then liberated from German control during World War II. History of the station Location of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg (shown in red circle), home of the Radio Luxembourg transmitters, illustrating its relationship to listeners on the continent of Europe and within the British Isles Radio Luxembourg, a commercial, English- language station that broadcast to the United Kingdom, closed down on September 21, 1939, on the instructions of the government of the Grand Duchy to protect the neutrality of Luxembourg during World War II. =Era of \\"Lord Haw-Haw\\"= On May 10, 1940, the Nazi government of Germany ordered the occupation of Luxembourg, and the Wehrmacht turned over the facilities of Radio Luxembourg to Gro√üdeutscher Rundfunk . The Nazis also used the station to reach the British Isles. It featured the Irish presenter William Joyce, whose propaganda broadcasts became dubbed by disbelieving listeners in the UK as the stilted voice of \\"Lord Haw-Haw\\". =Era of OWI= On May 24, 1944, the Luxembourg government in exile in Washington, D.C., agreed that, following the liberation of the Grand Duchy, they would turn over the facilities of Radio Luxembourg to U.S. Army control. More specifically, this control would be given to SHAEF where the station would serve as \\"the voice of the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force\\" acting on behalf of America, Britain, France, Belgium and Luxembourg. On September 10, 1944, the German armies fled Luxembourg following the Allied invasion on D-Day and the approach of a special task force of the American 12th Army. The Luxembourg transmitters were then turned over to SHAEF. During the withdrawal some German soldiers had been ordered to dynamite the station, but a station engineer persuaded them to shoot holes in the transmitter tubes instead. When the US troops arrived, the engineer dug up a set of spare tubes which he had buried in the grounds of the station four years earlier. Also using these facilities was the Psychological Warfare Branch of the United States Office of War Information (OWI) under the management of CBS radio chief William S. Paley. The OWI used the facility to create Nachtsender 1212, a black propaganda station that identified itself as broadcasting from within Nazi Germany. The purpose of Nachtsender 1212 was to gain a loyal Nazi audience by broadcasting information favourable to the German interpretation of the War, but as the battle advanced against the borders of Germany itself, Nachtsender 1212 began to intersperse misleading and totally false information within its broadcasts. This included a fictitious story about a German city that rebelled against the Nazi regime, pretending to relay messages from the burgomaster asking for help. The station had a similar mission to the British-operated Soldatensender Calais, which attempted to undermine German military morale and provide misinformation under the cover of entertaining Germans. Nachtsender 1212 signed off the air by pretending that the Allies had captured this make-believe German station by overrunning it. =Era of transition= Following the occupation of Germany in May 1945, the future of Radio Luxembourg was debated in the United Kingdom. The BBC did not welcome the idea of renewed commercial competition if the facilities were turned back to commercial control. In conjunction with Winston Churchill, a plan was devised to redirect the station towards communist Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union by linking the Luxembourg transmitters via landline to BBC World Service studios in London. This plan fell apart when Churchill's Conservative Party lost to the Labour Party in the postwar British General Election on July 5, 1945. For a time the Luxembourg transmitters remained under American control and were used both to relay programs for the Voice of America and originating programming under the call sign identifier of the \\"United Nations Station\\". Radio Luxembourg was handed back to the Grand Duchy in November 1945.

Pink ivory was the royal tree of the Zulu people and only members of the royal family were allowed to possess it until the Anglo-Zulu War of 1879. Before the Anglo-Zulu War, the Zulu king (and prior to 1818, Zulu chiefs) would possess a pink ivory knob kerry, a stick with one end a knob, and wear jewelry that were also made from pink ivory. According to rumor, non-royals who possessed the wood would summarily be put to death. After Zululand fell to the British and was separated into 13 separate \\"kinglets\\" in 1883, all vying to retake control of what was once theirs precedent to the onset of apartheid, the pink ivory wood became much less important a sign of control than genuine control could be. The pink ivory tree produces a yellow, brownish, reddish, or purplish drupe fruit that is delicious to taste. Other parts of the tree have been used traditionally as remedies and medicines.

In the US, Cognitive Madisonianism is in keeping with Article One of the United States Constitution, and the principle of separation of powers under the United States Constitution.

Voters might vote in this way because they do not want any of the above institutions to exercise too much power individually, as this might lead to tyranny. Voting due to Cognitive Madisonianism has potential to create weak government and negatively impact on the administration of the country, because it creates split ticket voting, which in turn can create legislative gridlock.

Exemplifications can only be attested and executed by either the authority holding the record or the issuing authority. Exemplified copies are also usually an extract or transcript made directly from the original. They can be contrasted with certified copies which are attested by a public authority who does not necessarily execute the copy; are signed and sealed by the certifier, not necessarily the issuing authority or recorder; and are a facsimile, made from the original or not, and vary as to faithfulness, for example, fair copy, imitative copy, and so forth. Certified copies of birth and death records from New York City, Los Angeles, Georgia, and in certain other locations in the US can, if requested, be accompanied by a letter of exemplification. This is the first step in a process leading to authentication or an apostille. In Canada and Australia and certain other common-law jurisdictions, exemplifications may be made of any official document by a notary public. More specifically, the term refers to an attested copy of a legal pleading in its entirety. In this sense it is also known as a triple certificate or three-way certificate. Its authenticity is sworn to by the clerk of the court where the judgment was rendered and counter- authenticated by the presiding judicial officer of that Court. The clerk then swears to the authenticity of the judge's signature, incumbency, and authority. The certificate page with the triple authentication is called the exemplification.

Founded in 1784 and incorporated as a town in 1889, Sydney Mines has a rich history in coal production, although mining activity has now ceased. Prior to a permanent settlement being established, there was significant activity along the shore. Sydney Mines was also home to a large steel company that was named SCOTIA it was the modern to its day between the Sydney Steel Plant (DISCO) and the Sydney Mines Steel Plant (SCOTIA) they produced 50% of Canada's steel during World War I. History During the American Revolution, the British used the coal mines of Sydney Mines to supply the British loyalists in Boston and Halifax. American and French ships made great efforts to interrupt this vital supply line. On November 1, 1776, John Paul Jones - the father of the American Navy - set sail in command of Alfred to free hundreds of American prisoners working in the area's coal mines. Although winter conditions prevented the freeing of the prisoners, the mission did result in the capture of Mellish, a vessel carrying a vital supply of winter clothing intended for John Burgoyne's troops in Canada. Major Timothy Hierlihy and his regiment on board HMS Hope worked in and protected from privateer attacks on the coal mines at Sydney Cape Breton.C. J. MacGillivray. Timothy Hierlihy and his Times: The story of the Founder of Antigonish, N.S. Nova Scotia Historical Society., p.40 Sydney Cape Breton provided a vital supply of coal for Halifax throughout the war. The British began developing the mining site at Sydney Mines in 1777. On 14 May 1778, Major Hierlihy arrived at Cape Breton. While there, Hierlihy reported that he ‚Äúbeat off many piratical attacks, killed some and took other prisoners.‚ÄùC. J. MacGillivray. Timothy Hierlihy and his Times: The story of the Founder of Antigonish, N.S. Nova Scotia Historical Society., p.42 Maj.-Gen. Eyre Massey to General Sir Henry Clinton. 13 June 1778 A few years into the war there was also a naval engagement between French ships and a British convoy off Sydney, Nova Scotia, near Spanish River (1781), Cape Breton.Thomas B. Akins. (1895) History of Halifax. Dartmouth: Brook House Press.p. 82 Six French sailors were killed and 17 British, with many more wounded. Sydney Mines lies immediately northeast of North Sydney and faces Sydney across Sydney Harbour. Sydney Mines was once a major coal-producing community. Mining began locally in 1766, and in 1830 systematic operations were undertaken. One of the area mines extended about 5 miles (8 km) out under the sea. The last mine was closed in 1975. Sydney Mines is on the northern side of Sydney Harbor, near the mouth. It was earlier known as the Mines due to the coal mines abundant nearby. Although mining has been carried on since 1724, the first shaft for the General Mining Association in Sydney Mines was sunk in 1830. Manufacturing enterprises included corrugated steel culverts and the British Canadian Co-operative Society Limited, operating a dairy and a bakery. Sydney Mines was the filming location for the 1981 horror movie My Bloody Valentine. Climate Sydney Mines experiences cool summers. The summer can be very cool at times due to the fact Sydney Mines borders the cool North Atlantic Ocean. Day time highs rarely exceed 20 degrees Celsius. During Summer nights temperatures can become very cold with the average lows being around 10 degrees Celsius, although cold winds can make it seem much colder. Sydney Mines experiences cold, windy, wet, snowy and very stormy winters. Although low in latitude compared to the rest of Canada and bordering the ocean. Sydney Mines borders the very cold Labrador ocean current. This causes for a cold and very snowy winter. Daytime highs during the winter usually stick around minus 2 degrees Celsius but the fact Sydney Mines lies around the polar jet stream causes it to experience arctic outbreaks and very warm thaws. Sydney Mines, much like the rest of Atlantic Canada, is one of the warmest areas in Canada during the winter but they receives the most snowstorms in Canada. Cold arctic temperatures meet up with the warm Gulf Stream and form one of the most powerful storms in the world. Many people who live in Eastern Canada know the term Nor'easter, which can dump huge amounts of snow to Sydney Mines and the rest of Atlantic Canada. Education Sydney Mines has one elementary school, Jubilee Elementary (home to the Johnny Miles Gym), one middle school, Sydney Mines Middle School, one high school, Memorial Composite High School. Landmarks In front of Jubilee Elementary on Main Street, there is a bronze statue of Johnny Miles in a running pose. There is a script on it with a small quote and the dates Johnny Miles won the Boston Marathon. In front of the John J.

The song began as an instrumental track called \\"Working and Waiting\\". It is sometimes called \\"Working for the Clampdown\\" which is the main lyric of the song, and also the title provided on the album's lyric sheet. Its lyrics concern those who have forsaken the idealism of youth and urges young people to fight the status quo. The word 'clampdown' is a neat cover-all term the writers adopted to define the oppressive Establishment, notably its more reactionary voices who were to be heard throughout the 1970s calling alarmingly for 'clampdowns' by government and law enforcement on strikers, agitators, benefits claimants, football hooligans, punks and other perceived threats to the social, economic and moral wellbeing of the UK. The 'clampdown' can therefore be read as a figure of dread for the Clash's generation ‚Äì and the song stands as a warning to the youth to beware being part of the problem rather than of the solution. In 1980 \\"Clampdown\\" was released as a single backed with \\"The Guns of Brixton\\" in Australia. The single was not released in any other territories, with the exception of US promos. Analysis of lyrics \\"Clampdown\\" was written by Joe Strummer and Mick Jones. The song's lyrics, written by Joe Strummer, refers to the failures of capitalist society. The wearing of the \\"blue and brown\\" refers to the color of the uniforms that are mostly worn by workers. This idea goes along with lyrics that refer to \\"young believers\\" who are brought and bought into the capital system by those \\"working for the clampdown\\" who will \\"teach our twisted speech.\\" Alternatively it could be suggested that the blue and brown refer to shirt colours, the fascist Blueshirts of 1930s Ireland and the Brownshirts of the early Nazis in Germany. Strummer wrote, :The men in the factory are old and cunning :You don't owe nothing, so boy get running! :It's the best years of your life they want to steal! :You grow up and you calm down and you're working for the clampdown. :You start wearing the blue and brown and you're working for the clampdown. :So you got someone to boss around. It makes you feel big now... These lyrics are seen to refer to how one gets caught by the capital economic system and its ethos of work, debt, power, position and conformist lifestyle. Related news articles: * Strummer, who was a proud and loud socialist, also uses the song's closing refrain to highlight this mindset and potential trap and offers a warning not to give oneself over to \\"the clampdown\\". This is emphasized in the coda by Jones' repetition of the words \\"work\\" and \\"more work\\" on the beat over Strummers breathy repetition of the phrase \\"working for the clampdown\\". This reaffirms the idea that Strummer saw \\"the clampdown\\" as a threat to all who get caught up in the modern economic wage-hour system. Bass player and Clash co-founder Paul Simonon, in an interview with the LA Times, spoke about the opportunities available to him after he finished his education, Strummer, like Simonon, spent time on the dole, but Strummer did not come from a lower-class family. In the same interview with the LA Times Strummer said, Strummer's father was a British diplomat, and Joe was sent away to boarding school where he detested \\"the thick rich people‚Äôs thick rich kids\\". Strummer said, Later verses suggest an alternative in revolution, a theme common throughout Joe Strummer's songwriting. This point of view also points to the lyric \\"You start wearing the blue and brown\\" as supporting their cause. The barely audible lyrics at the beginning of the song were deciphered by Clash fan Ade Marks, and first published in Q magazine's Clash special : :The kingdom is ransacked, the jewels all taken back :And the chopper descends :They're hidden in the back, with a message on a half-baked tape :With the spool going round, saying I'm back here in this place :And I could cry :And there's smoke you could click on :What are we going to do now? Analysis of music The song is mostly in the key of A major, with a key change to E major in the bridge. The coda features a bouncing dance, alternating between G and F# chords as the riff slowly fades, featuring Strummer's ad libs and the repeated lyric based on \\"work\\". Cover versions \\"Clampdown\\" was later covered by Rage Against the Machine at their first live show in 1991, as well as their more recent show in Antwerp, Belgium on 2 June 2008. It was also covered by Indigo Girls and can be heard on Rarities (2005) as well as the Clash tribute album Burning London: The Clash Tribute (1999). The song was also covered by The Strokes (at their Oxegen and T in the Park appearances in July 2004), Poster Children on their 2004 release, On the Offensive, and James Dean Bradfield (of the Manic Street Preachers) on his solo tour in October 2006. Another band that covered this song was Hot Water Music, on their B sides and rarities compilation album called Till the Wheels Fall Off. The song was also covered by The National on the album A Tribute to The Clash, and by Inward Eye, which they released through a video on their YouTube channel. Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band covered the song a few times on their 2014 High Hopes Tour. Metallica played the song at the 2016 Bridge School Benefit. Popular reference The song was featured in the Futurama episode, \\"The Silence of the Clamps\\", where the song is played over a montage of Clamps and Fry spending time together. The song was also used in the US television show Malcolm in the Middle during an episode where Malcolm and some misfits organize an anti-prom called \\"Morp\\". In September 2018, during one of the debates between incumbent United States senator Ted Cruz and United States congressman Beto O'Rourke held as part of the campaign for that year's United States Senate election in Texas, O'Rourke claimed that Cruz was \\"working for the clampdown\\". O'Rourke would later use the song in his official campaign launch in El Paso.

It was a common practice for the early caucasian settlers to free their children by their slave mistresses. Their mistresses however, were not all enslaved, some were free women of color whose families had been free for several generations. The novel takes place in the 1840s, at which time there was a large population of free people of color living in New Orleans. The story centers on Marcel, a young man who has one white parent and one parent who is half white and half black. His mother, Cecile, is the mistress of Philippe Ferronaire, a rich French plantation owner. Cecile has borne Ferronaire two children, Marcel and his sister Marie. Marie is very light skinned and able to pass as white, but Marcel, who is blonde and blue eyed, but with ethnic hair, features, and slightly darker skin, cannot. The other two major characters in this novel are Christophe, a famous author who returns from Paris to start a school for the young gens, and Anna Bella, Marcel's childhood friend. Anna Bella loves Marcel, but as he is unprepared to offer her marriage (and too young) she becomes the mistress of Vincent Dazincourt, who is the brother of Philippe Ferronaire's white wife. They have a child together, but split after Marcel, who had been expecting to be sent to Paris, learns that his father has betrayed him and wanders to his father's plantation to confront him. There, his father beats him and repudiates him. In disgrace, Marcel is sent to live with his aunt among many Creole planters on the Cane River. It is here that Marcel learns some of his (African Diasporan) history, including the Haitian Slave Revolt and the fact that his mother was stolen off the street by his adopted aunt during that time. While Marcel is learning history, his father is in New Orleans drinking himself to death, which he eventually does, depriving the family of their source of income. Marie, who was set to marry Marcel's best friend Richard, is now told that she will follow in her mother's footsteps and take a white protector in order to get money for the family and send Marcel to Paris (Marcel is unaware of all of this). Marie confides this to her slave maid and half-sister, Lisette. Lisette is also Phillipe Ferronaire's daughter (which Marie does not know) and was promised her freedom by him, but as he did to Marcel, he reneged on his promise to her. In revenge, Lisette takes Marie to the house of a voodooiene, where she is drugged and raped by five men. Marcel comes home to find that his sister has been raped, Richard has been locked in the family attic (to prevent him from taking revenge on the men, and then, certainly, being tried and convicted of murder and executed) and Vincent Dazincourt has already confronted two of the men, challenged them to duels, and killed them. The issue from Dazincourt's perspective is that the five men knew Marie's identity, and therefore knew that she was related by blood to the Ferronaire/Dazincourt family, but raped her anyway. The gens de couleur libre members of the extended family cannot avenge Marie's rape, but he can. Marie takes refuge with a local madam, Dolly Rose. Lisette commits suicide to avoid Dazincourt's vengeance. Dazincourt finds and kills a third man in a duel, but the other two escape from New Orleans before he can call them out and kill them. Richard, who is finally let out of the attic, tells his family that he will marry Marie or face exile with her. The novel ends with Marie and Richard sailing to France (where they will stay until the gossip dies down) and Marcel deciding to become a photographer in order to earn his living (with the implication that once he has some success he will marry Anna Bella).

(2009). Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife, Pietermaritzburg, 106pp. and 7 maps (4 x A4, 3 x A3). South African game reserve located in the far northeast district of KwaZulu-Natal known as Maputaland. It is situated on the border with Mozambique where the Pongola River joins the Great Usutu River. It is adjacent to the Tembe Elephant Park. Ndumo is relatively remote, being over 400 km from Durban. The town of Mkuze is 110 km away. Ndumo hosts a diverse range of habitats including sand forest, dense riverine forest, floodplains, alluvial plains, reedbeds, grassland, broad-leaved and acacia woodlands and extremely dense thornveld. Ndumo is popular for its birdlife and despite its small size, the reserve has recorded in excess of 430 bird species including residents and seasonal migrants. The park's abundance of pans, floodplains and rivers (Pongola & Usutu) provide suitable habitat for many aquatic species. The Maputaland area in general is relatively rich in birdlife due to ecosystem diversity as well as its geographical location: the area forms the southernmost range for a great many eastern and north-eastern African bird species. The area receives a high annual rainfall. A short list of sought-after bird species resident to Ndumo: *Pel's fishing owl *Narina trogon *African broadbill *Eastern nicator (formerly \\"yellow-spotted nicator\\" but this name is now given to another bird, the western nicator) *African cuckoo-hawk Large mammals found in Ndumo include nyala, hippopotamus, Nile crocodile, impala and Cape buffalo. Big cats are absent from the park. Elephants are prolific at the neighbouring Tembe Elephant Park. As with all parts of Maputaland, malaria is endemic and visitors are advised to take the proper precautions. There is an Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife campsite and hutted camp. This park is to be included into the: Usuthu-Tembe-Futi Transfrontier Conservation Area.  Displacement of Indigenous Peoples  In 1924, the area surrounding the Ndumo Game Reserve was declared to be a protected area by South Africa. Over the next few decades, the indigenous inhabitants were forcibly evicted from their native lands. Although the Ndumo communities legally contested their right to the land, they were denied ownership and the right to resettle the land, instead given financial restitution. One resident says of this period of time: > There we were rich; we ate sweet potatoes, bananas, madumbe [root > vegetable], cassava and pumpkins. We drank from the Usuthu River. Today that > river is reserved for the hippos and crocodiles while our children die from > drought. The wild fruits are left to fatten the monkeys, and the rhinos > graze on the graves of our ancestors. References * Weso≈Çowska, W. & Haddad, Ch.R. 2009.

At above sea level, the upper spire is visible from a great distance in all directions. It is particularly noticeable from the Sea-to-Sky Highway just south of Whistler, British Columbia. Distinctive and immediately identifiable, The Black Tusk is among the best known mountains in the Garibaldi Ranges of the Coast Mountains. The volcano is part of the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt which is a segment of the Canadian Cascade Arc, but it is not within the geographic boundary of the Cascade Range. Indigenous To Squamish people, this mountain is known as t'a _k_ 't'a _k_ mu'yin tl'a in7in'a'xe7en. In their language it means \\"Landing Place of the Thunderbird\\", speaking of the supernatural in7in'a'xe7en or Thunderbird. The jagged shape of the mountain and its black colouring are said to come from the Thunderbird's lightning. The same is true for the Mount Cayley massif, another stratovolcano farther north. Geology The Black Tusk is considered to be the remnant of an extinct andesitic stratovolcano which formed between about 1.3 and 1.1 million years ago. Following glacial dissection, renewed volcanism produced the lava dome and flow forming its summit about 170,000 years ago. According to Natural Resources Canada, The Black Tusk was \\"perhaps the conduit for lava within a cinder-rich volcano. The loose cinder has eroded, leaving only the hard lava core.\\" The exposed lava rock of the core is loose and friable. It is also black, giving the mountain its name and character. Cinder Cone, to the east of The Black Tusk, produced a long lava flow during the late Pleistocene or early Holocene. The mountain currently hosts two significant glaciers, in large cirques carved into the northeastern and northwestern flanks of the broad cone below the lava pinnacle. Both glaciers start from about and flow northwards to below . The glaciers are heavily covered in rocky debris due to the crumbling nature of the Tusk's rock. The Black Tusk is a member of the chain of volcanic peaks that run from southwestern British Columbia to northern California. The peaks formed in the past 35 million years as the Juan de Fuca, Gorda and Explorer plates to its west have been subducting under the North American Plate at the Cascadia subduction zone. Recreation Part of the trail from Garibaldi Lake to The Black Tusk. The Black Tusk's lower flanks and south summit are a popular backcountry hiking and scrambling destination. Most hikers approach from the Taylor Meadows campground to the south near Garibaldi Lake, although there is a second route from the north that travels by way of Helm Lake. The upper summit area at the top of the lava column can only be reached by scrambling up a short but exposed rock chimney to reach the south summit. The true summit, only about a metre higher, lies just to the north across a precipitous drop. It is rarely climbed, requiring a rappel of about into a notch followed by a loose and dangerous reascent up the crumbling lava. On the northern side of the north summit stands an isolated and intimidating rock formation known as the \\"Bishop's Mitre\\", which is rumoured to be unclimbed. Close-up view of The Black Tusk.

Specimen is wide. Various theories of ore genesis explain how the various types of mineral deposits form within the Earth's crust. Ore-genesis theories vary depending on the mineral or commodity examined. Ore-genesis theories generally involve three components: source, transport or conduit, and trap. (This also applies to the petroleum industry: petroleum geologists originated this analysis.) *Source is required because metal must come from somewhere, and be liberated by some process. *Transport is required first to move the metal-bearing fluids or solid minerals into their current position, and refers to the act of physically moving the metal, as well as to chemical or physical phenomenon which encourage movement. *Trapping is required to concentrate the metal via some physical, chemical, or geological mechanism into a concentration which forms mineable ore. The biggest deposits form when the source is large, the transport mechanism is efficient, and the trap is active and ready at the right time. Ore genesis processes =Endogenous= Magmatic processes *Fractional crystallization: separates ore and non-ore minerals according to their crystallization temperature. As early crystallizing minerals form from magma, they incorporate certain elements, some of which are metals. These crystals may settle onto the bottom of the intrusion, concentrating ore minerals there. Chromite and magnetite are ore minerals that form in this way. *Liquid immiscibility: sulfide ores containing copper, nickel, or platinum may form from this process. As a magma changes, parts of it may separate from the main body of magma. Two liquids that will not mix are called immiscible; oil and water are an example. In magmas, sulfides may separate and sink below the silicate-rich part of the intrusion or be injected into the rock surrounding it. These deposits are found in mafic and ultramafic rocks. Hydrothermal processes These processes are the physicochemical phenomena and reactions caused by movement of hydrothermal water within the crust, often as a consequence of magmatic intrusion or tectonic upheavals. The foundations of hydrothermal processes are the source-transport-trap mechanism. Sources of hydrothermal solutions include seawater and meteoric water circulating through fractured rock, formational brines (water trapped within sediments at deposition), and metamorphic fluids created by dehydration of hydrous minerals during metamorphism. Metal sources may include a plethora of rocks. However most metals of economic importance are carried as trace elements within rock-forming minerals, and so may be liberated by hydrothermal processes. This happens because of: *incompatibility of the metal with its host mineral, for example zinc in calcite, which favours aqueous fluids in contact with the host mineral during diagenesis. *solubility of the host mineral within nascent hydrothermal solutions in the source rocks, for example mineral salts (halite), carbonates (cerussite), phosphates (monazite and thorianite), and sulfates (barite) *elevated temperatures causing decomposition reactions of minerals Transport by hydrothermal solutions usually requires a salt or other soluble species which can form a metal- bearing complex. These metal-bearing complexes facilitate transport of metals within aqueous solutions, generally as hydroxides, but also by processes similar to chelation. This process is especially well understood in gold metallogeny where various thiosulfate, chloride, and other gold-carrying chemical complexes (notably tellurium-chloride/sulfate or antimony- chloride/sulfate). The majority of metal deposits formed by hydrothermal processes include sulfide minerals, indicating sulfur is an important metal- carrying complex. Sulfide deposition: Sulfide deposition within the trap zone occurs when metal-carrying sulfate, sulfide, or other complexes become chemically unstable due to one or more of the following processes; *falling temperature, which renders the complex unstable or metal insoluble *loss of pressure, which has the same effect *reaction with chemically reactive wall rocks, usually of reduced oxidation state, such as iron-bearing rocks, mafic or ultramafic rocks, or carbonate rocks *degassing of the hydrothermal fluid into a gas and water system, or boiling, which alters the metal carrying capacity of the solution and even destroys metal-carrying chemical complexes Metal can also precipitate when temperature and pressure or oxidation state favour different ionic complexes in the water, for instance the change from sulfide to sulfate, oxygen fugacity, exchange of metals between sulfide and chloride complexes, et cetera. Metamorphic processes Lateral secretion: Ore deposits formed by lateral secretion are formed by metamorphic reactions during shearing, which liberate mineral constituents such as quartz, sulfides, gold, carbonates, and oxides from deforming rocks, and focus these constituents into zones of reduced pressure or dilation such as faults. This may occur without much hydrothermal fluid flow, and this is typical of podiform chromite deposits. Metamorphic processes also control many physical processes which form the source of hydrothermal fluids, outlined above. =Sedimentary or surficial processes (exogenous)= Surficial processes are the physical and chemical phenomena which cause concentration of ore material within the regolith, generally by the action of the environment. This includes placer deposits, laterite deposits, and residual or eluvial deposits. The physical processes of ore deposit formation in the surficial realm include; *erosion *deposition by sedimentary processes, including winnowing, density separation (e.g.; gold placers) *weathering via oxidation or chemical attack of a rock, either liberating rock fragments or creating chemically deposited clays, laterites, or supergene enrichment *Deposition in low-energy environments in beach environments Classification of ore deposits Classification of hydrothermal ore deposits is also achieved by classifying according to the temperature of formation, which roughly also correlates with particular mineralising fluids, mineral associations and structural styles. This scheme, proposed by Waldemar Lindgren (1933) classified hydrothermal deposits as hypothermal, mesothermal, epithermal, and telethermal. * Hypothermal hydrothermal rocks and minerals ore deposits are formed at great depth under conditions of high temperature.Hypothermal. * Mesothermal mineral deposits are formed at moderate temperature and pressure, in and along fissures or other openings in rocks, by deposition at intermediate depths, from hydrothermal fluids.Mesothermal. * Epithermal mineral ore deposits are formed at low temperatures (50-200 ¬∞C) near the Earth's surface (<1500 m), that fill veins, breccias, and stockworks. * Telethermal mineral ore deposit are formed at shallow depth and relatively low temperatures, with little or no wall-rock alteration, presumably far from the source of hydrothermal solutions.Teletherma. Ore deposits are usually classified by ore formation processes and geological setting. For example, sedimentary exhalative deposits (SEDEX), are a class of ore deposit formed on the sea floor (sedimentary) by exhalation of brines into seawater (exhalative), causing chemical precipitation of ore minerals when the brine cools, mixes with sea water, and loses its metal carrying capacity. Ore deposits rarely fit neatly into the categories in which geologists wish to place them. Many may be formed by one or more of the basic genesis processes above, creating ambiguous classifications and much argument and conjecture. Often ore deposits are classified after examples of their type, for instance Broken Hill type lead- zinc-silver deposits or Carlin‚Äìtype gold deposits. Genesis of common ores As they require the conjunction of specific environmental conditions to form, particular mineral deposit types tend to occupy specific geodynamic niches, Abstract therefore, this page has been organised by metal commodity. It is also possible to organise theories the other way, namely according to geological criteria of formation. Often ores of the same metal can be formed by multiple processes, and this is described here under each metal or metal complex. =Iron= Iron ores are overwhelmingly derived from ancient sediments known as banded iron formations (BIFs). These sediments are composed of iron oxide minerals deposited on the sea floor. Particular environmental conditions are needed to transport enough iron in sea water to form these deposits, such as acidic and oxygen-poor atmospheres within the Proterozoic Era. Often, more recent weathering is required to convert the usual magnetite minerals into more easily processed hematite. Some iron deposits within the Pilbara of Western Australia are placer deposits, formed by accumulation of hematite gravels called pisolites which form channel-iron deposits. These are preferred because they are cheap to mine. =Lead zinc silver= Lead-zinc deposits are generally accompanied by silver, hosted within the lead sulfide mineral galena or within the zinc sulfide mineral sphalerite. Lead and zinc deposits are formed by discharge of deep sedimentary brine onto the sea floor (termed sedimentary exhalative or SEDEX), or by replacement of limestone, in skarn deposits, some associated with submarine volcanoes (called volcanogenic massive sulfide ore deposits or VMS), or in the aureole of subvolcanic intrusions of granite. The vast majority of SEDEX lead and zinc deposits are Proterozoic in age, although there are significant Jurassic examples in Canada and Alaska. The carbonate replacement type deposit is exemplified by the Mississippi valley type (MVT) ore deposits. MVT and similar styles occur by replacement and degradation of carbonate sequences by hydrocarbons, which are thought important for transporting lead. =Gold= High-grade (bonanza) gold ore, brecciated quartz-adularia rhyolite. Native gold (Au) occurs in this rock as colloform bands, partially replaces breccia clasts, and is also disseminated in the matrix. Published research indicates that Sleeper Mine rocks represent an ancient epithermal gold deposit (hot springs gold deposit), formed by volcanism during Basin & Range extensional tectonics.Geology and geochemistry of the Sleeper Gold Mine , USGS Open File Report 89-476, 1989 Sleeper Mine, Humboldt County, Nevada. Gold deposits are formed via a very wide variety of geological processes. Deposits are classified as primary, alluvial or placer deposits, or residual or laterite deposits. Often a deposit will contain a mixture of all three types of ore. Plate tectonics is the underlying mechanism for generating gold deposits. The majority of primary gold deposits fall into two main categories: lode gold deposits or intrusion- related deposits. Lode gold deposits, also referred to as orogenic gold are generally high-grade, thin, vein and fault hosted. They are primarily made up of quartz veins also known as lodes or reefs, which contain either native gold or gold sulfides and tellurides. Lode gold deposits are usually hosted in basalt or in sediments known as turbidite, although when in faults, they may occupy intrusive igneous rocks such as granite. Lode-gold deposits are intimately associated with orogeny and other plate collision events within geologic history. It is thought that most lode gold deposits are sourced from metamorphic rocks by the dehydration of basalt during metamorphism. The gold is transported up faults by hydrothermal waters and deposited when the water cools too much to retain gold in solution. Intrusive related gold (Lang & Baker, 2001) is generally hosted in granites, porphyry, or rarely dikes. Intrusive related gold usually also contains copper, and is often associated with tin and tungsten, and rarely molybdenum, antimony, and uranium. Intrusive-related gold deposits rely on gold existing in the fluids associated with the magma (White, 2001), and the inevitable discharge of these hydrothermal fluids into the wall-rocks (Lowenstern, 2001). Skarn deposits are another manifestation of intrusive-related deposits. Placer deposits are sourced from pre-existing gold deposits and are secondary deposits. Placer deposits are formed by alluvial processes within rivers and streams, and on beaches. Placer gold deposits form via gravity, with the density of gold causing it to sink into trap sites within the river bed, or where water velocity drops, such as bends in rivers and behind boulders. Often placer deposits are found within sedimentary rocks and can be billions of years old, for instance the Witwatersrand deposits in South Africa. Sedimentary placer deposits are known as 'leads' or 'deep leads'. Placer deposits are often worked by fossicking, and panning for gold is a popular pastime. Laterite gold deposits are formed from pre-existing gold deposits (including some placer deposits) during prolonged weathering of the bedrock. Gold is deposited within iron oxides in the weathered rock or regolith, and may be further enriched by reworking by erosion. Some laterite deposits are formed by wind erosion of the bedrock leaving a residuum of native gold metal at surface. A bacterium, Cupriavidus metallidurans plays a vital role in the formation of gold nuggets, by precipitating metallic gold from a solution of gold (III) tetrachloride, a compound highly toxic to most other microorganisms. Similarly, Delftia acidovorans can form gold nuggets. =Platinum= Platinum and palladium are precious metals generally found in ultramafic rocks. The source of platinum and palladium deposits is ultramafic rocks which have enough sulfur to form a sulfide mineral while the magma is still liquid. This sulfide mineral (usually pentlandite, pyrite, chalcopyrite, or pyrrhotite) gains platinum by mixing with the bulk of the magma because platinum is chalcophile and is concentrated in sulfides. Alternatively, platinum occurs in association with chromite either within the chromite mineral itself or within sulfides associated with it. Sulfide phases only form in ultramafic magmas when the magma reaches sulfur saturation. This is generally thought to be nearly impossible by pure fractional crystallisation, so other processes are usually required in ore genesis models to explain sulfur saturation. These include contamination of the magma with crustal material, especially sulfur-rich wall-rocks or sediments; magma mixing; volatile gain or loss. Often platinum is associated with nickel, copper, chromium, and cobalt deposits. =Nickel= Nickel deposits are generally found in two forms, either as sulfide or laterite. Sulfide type nickel deposits are formed in essentially the same manner as platinum deposits. Nickel is a chalcophile element which prefers sulfides, so an ultramafic or mafic rock which has a sulfide phase in the magma may form nickel sulfides. The best nickel deposits are formed where sulfide accumulates in the base of lava tubes or volcanic flows -- especially komatiite lavas. Komatiitic nickel-copper sulfide deposits are considered to be formed by a mixture of sulfide segregation, immiscibility, and thermal erosion of sulfidic sediments. The sediments are considered to be necessary to promote sulfur saturation. Some subvolcanic sills in the Thompson Belt of Canada host nickel sulfide deposits formed by deposition of sulfides near the feeder vent. Sulfide was accumulated near the vent due to the loss of magma velocity at the vent interface. The massive Voisey's Bay nickel deposit is considered to have formed via a similar process. The process of forming nickel laterite deposits is essentially similar to the formation of gold laterite deposits, except that ultramafic or mafic rocks are required. Generally nickel laterites require very large olivine-bearing ultramafic intrusions. Minerals formed in laterite nickel deposits include gibbsite. =Copper= Copper is found in association with many other metals and deposit styles. Commonly, copper is either formed within sedimentary rocks, or associated with igneous rocks. The world's major copper deposits are formed within the granitic porphyry copper style. Copper is enriched by processes during crystallisation of the granite and forms as chalcopyrite -- a sulfide mineral, which is carried up with the granite. Sometimes granites erupt to surface as volcanoes, and copper mineralisation forms during this phase when the granite and volcanic rocks cool via hydrothermal circulation. Sedimentary copper forms within ocean basins in sedimentary rocks. Generally this forms by brine from deeply buried sediments discharging into the deep sea, and precipitating copper and often lead and zinc sulfides directly onto the sea floor. This is then buried by further sediment. This is a process similar to SEDEX zinc and lead, although some carbonate-hosted examples exist. Often copper is associated with gold, lead, zinc, and nickel deposits. =Uranium= alt=Five cylinder-like bodies on a flat surface: four in a group and one separate. Uranium deposits are usually sourced from radioactive granites, where certain minerals such as monazite are leached during hydrothermal activity or during circulation of groundwater. The uranium is brought into solution by acidic conditions and is deposited when this acidity is neutralised. Generally this occurs in certain carbon-bearing sediments, within an unconformity in sedimentary strata. The majority of the world's nuclear power is sourced from uranium in such deposits. Uranium is also found in nearly all coal at several parts per million, and in all granites. Radon is a common problem during mining of uranium as it is a radioactive gas. Uranium is also found associated with certain igneous rocks, such as granite and porphyry. The Olympic Dam deposit in Australia is an example of this type of uranium deposit. It contains 70% of Australia's share of 40% of the known global low-cost recoverable uranium inventory. =Titanium and zirconium= Mineral sands are the predominant type of titanium, zirconium, and thorium deposit. They are formed by accumulation of such heavy minerals within beach systems, and are a type of placer deposits. The minerals which contain titanium are ilmenite, rutile, and leucoxene, zirconium is contained within zircon, and thorium is generally contained within monazite. These minerals are sourced from primarily granite bedrock by erosion and transported to the sea by rivers where they accumulate within beach sands. Rarely, but importantly, gold, tin, and platinum deposits can form in beach placer deposits. =Tin, tungsten, and molybdenum= These three metals generally form in a certain type of granite, via a similar mechanism to intrusive-related gold and copper. They are considered together because the process of forming these deposits is essentially the same. Skarn type mineralisation related to these granites is a very important type of tin, tungsten, and molybdenum deposit. Skarn deposits form by reaction of mineralised fluids from the granite reacting with wall rocks such as limestone. Skarn mineralisation is also important in lead, zinc, copper, gold, and occasionally uranium mineralisation. Greisen granite is another related tin-molybdenum and topaz mineralisation style. =Rare earth elements, niobium, tantalum, lithium= The overwhelming majority of rare earth elements, tantalum, and lithium are found within pegmatite. Ore genesis theories for these ores are wide and varied, but most involve metamorphism and igneous activity. Lithium is present as spodumene or lepidolite within pegmatite. Carbonatite intrusions are an important source of these elements. Ore minerals are essentially part of the unusual mineralogy of carbonatite. =Phosphate= Phosphate is used in fertilisers. Immense quantities of phosphate rock or phosphorite occur in sedimentary shelf deposits, ranging in age from the Proterozoic to currently forming environments.Guilbert, John M. and Charles F. Park, The Geology of Ore Deposits, 1986, Freeman, pp. 715-720, Phosphate deposits are thought to be sourced from the skeletons of dead sea creatures which accumulated on the seafloor. Similar to iron ore deposits and oil, particular conditions in the ocean and environment are thought to have contributed to these deposits within the geological past. Phosphate deposits are also formed from alkaline igneous rocks such as nepheline syenites, carbonatites, and associated rock types. The phosphate is, in this case, contained within magmatic apatite, monazite, or other rare-earth phosphates. =Vanadium= Tunicates such as this bluebell tunicate contain vanadium as vanabin. Due to the presence of vanabins, concentration of vanadium found in the blood cells of Ascidia gemmata belonging to the suborder Phlebobranchia is 10,000,000 times higher than that in the surrounding seawater. A similar biological process might have played a role in the formation of vanadium ores. Vanadium is also present in fossil fuel deposits such as crude oil, coal, oil shale, and oil sands. In crude oil, concentrations up to 1200 ppm have been reported. See also   * References  *Evans, A.M., 1993.

It offers a vibrant nightlife, attracting visitors from nearby towns like Las Pedro√±eras for 'Las Fiestas'. It has kept much of its medieval heritage and is on the newly planted trail that marks the route followed by the title character Miguel de Cervantes's novel Don Quixote. El Provencio sits in the extreme southern area of Cuenca, bordering both Albacete and Ciudad Real. The major highway linking the town to the rest of Spain is the National 301 Madrid - Cartagena, and it is about 81 kilometers south of Cuenca, the city. History The reason for the foundation of El Provencio, by Infante Don Juan Manuel, is attributed to the existence of the Zancara River as a source of water. El Provencio could have been founded as early as 1318, the earliest date available which refers to the foundation of the town. Don Juan Manuel was at the time Lord of Alarc√≥n and was regent of Murcia, and was related in many ways to various kings on the Iberian peninsula. He is considered one of the Spanish warriors of the Reconquista and is known for his campaigns of terror, and was also known for the foundation of settlements throughout the area. One of these came to be known as El Provencio, which was situated between Murcia and the regions owned by Spanish religious orders. Don Juan Manuel married the daughter of King James II of Aragon, which linked the kingdom of Aragon to El Provencio. Don Alfonso of Aragon became the first count of this Castilian area.

The FIC is a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization in the United States. Activities The FIC publishes Communities magazine, the Communities Directory, Journal of Cooperative Living, FIC Newsletter and the Intentional Communities web site. It also sponsors and presents periodic Community gatherings, including annual gatherings at Twin Oaks and Art of Community events in various locations around the US. Organizational history The history of FIC began in 1937 in Ann Arbor, Michigan, which still has one of the largest concentration of intentional communities per capita. The group/network of 19 student-run houses in Ann Arbor had formed The International Cooperative Council (ICC), a forerunner of FIC. The Fellowship of Intentional Communities was founded as Inter-Community Exchange in 1940 by Arthur E. Morgan (1878‚Äì1976) for communication and exchange of goods between intentional communities. During World War II, some of these communities served as refuge for pacifists. Alongside the aforementioned co-sponsorship with Twin Oaks Community, Virginia, some of the members of the \\"Inter-Community Exchange\\" were Hidden Springs in New Jersey; Tangy Homesteads in Philadelphia; Tuolumne Co-operative Farms near Modesto, California; Skyview Acres at Pomona, New York; Parisfield near Brighton, Michigan; Kingwood in New Jersey; Quest near Royal Ark, Michigan; Canterbury outside Concord, New Hampshire; May Valley near Seattle; The Valley near Yellow Springs, Ohio; St. Francis Acres/Glen Gardener in New Jersey; Koinonia Partners near Americus, Georgia; and the Bruderhof (Society of Brothers). In 1952, FIC created the Homer Morris Loan Fund -- which has subsequently provided over $200,000 in small loans to intentional community businesses and associated enterprises. When the FIC's activities decreased in the 1960s, the loan fund continued separately as the non-profit Community Educational Service Council, Inc. (CESCI), and the FIC held annual gatherings of communitarians in conjunction with CESCI's board meetings. In 1954, FIC began holding annual conferences at Yellow Springs, Ohio and the Pendle Hill Quaker Center for Study and Contemplation in Pennsylvania. Then \\"Inter-Community Exchange\\" gradually weakened and was dissolved in 1961; a major reason for this was withdrawal of the Bruderhof (largest and most prosperous member). The Bruderhof is still listed on the FIC website. It was revived under the name Fellowship for Intentional Community and incorporated as non-profit organization in 1986. In the mid 1980s, inspired by the earlier FIC and other regional community networks, a number of community activists sensed that the time was ripe to organize a continental communities network. The FIC is a nonprofit, tax-exempt charitable educational organization. Participation has been expanded to include most of North America -- the Fellowship now includes a wide range of individuals, well over a hundred intentional communities, and various support organizations. In 2018, at the Fall Meeting at the Twin Oaks Community in Virginia, FIC rebranded itself as the Foundation for Intentional Community because the aversion to the traditional masculine connotation of \\"Fellowship\\".

The conference took place in Washington, D.C. from January 29 to March 27, 1941 and concluded with a report entitled \\"ABC-1\\" which was tacitly approved by President Franklin D. Roosevelt two days later. Agreements reached at the conference The US-British Staff Conference Report of 1941 established the general military principles, resources, and deployment strategies for a joint Allied military strategy. The British approach to the Nazi problem varied from the initial US plan. The British initially called for a Sun Tsu approach of attacking the flanks and periphery of the Nazi interests (North Africa, middle east, etc.). By contrast, the US, following a Jomini-based approach sought a sledge-hammer, mass on mass battle with Nazi Germany. The plan assumed that if the U.S. went to war with Nazi Germany, it would likely go to war with both Fascist Italy and Imperial Japan as well. The general principles of agreement stated that: * America's territorial interest was in the Western Hemisphere; * The security of the British Commonwealth must be maintained in all circumstances, including the retention of a Far East position; * Security of sea communications between Allied Powers was essential. Offensive policies included: * The \\"early elimination\\" of Italy as an Axis partner; * Support of neutrals and underground groups in resisting the Axis; * Sustained air offensives to destroy Axis military power; * Build-up of forces for the eventual offensive against Germany and the capture of positions from which to launch that offensive; * The Atlantic and European areas were the \\"decisive theater\\" and as such would be the primary focus of US military efforts, although the \\"great importance\\" of the Middle East and Africa were noted. Finally, if Japan entered the war, military strategy in the Far East would be defensive. Although the ABC-1 agreement was not a military alliance, it nevertheless signified that the United States was preparing to enter the war on the side of the Allied powers, that the United States would make every effort to maintain the security of the British Commonwealth, and that the United States military was modifying existing war plans (e.g., the RAINBOW plans) to incorporate military integration and cooperation with other nations.

He presented a wide variety of shows from the 1960s onwards, most notably his coverage of major snooker tournaments for the BBC. Early life Born in Newton Abbot, Devon, he grew up in the north-west of the county, attending Barnstaple Grammar School on Park Lane in Barnstaple. His father was a carpenter. Career He worked for the North Devon Journal Herald from the age of 17 and various newspapers, becoming the Sports Editor of the Western Morning News in Plymouth. He joined Westward Television in 1961, though he worked for the BBC for the majority of his broadcasting career. He joined the BBC, to work on BBC2, in 1966. He was working at BBC2 even though Westward Television were not aware of this because at the time BBC2 could not be received in the South West.

It grows wild in North, Central, and South America, Asia, Africa, and Oceania, and is considered a particularly serious weed in many places. It has a long- standing history of confusion with Senna tora and that taxon in many sources actually refers to the present species. The green leaves of the plant are fermented to produce a high-protein food product called \\"kawal\\" which is eaten by many people in Sudan as a meat substitute. Its leaves, seeds, and root are also used in folk medicine, primarily in Asia. It is believed to possess a laxative effect, as well as to be beneficial for the eyes. As a folk remedy, the seeds are often roasted, then boiled in water to produce a tea. The plant's seeds are a commercial source of cassia gum, a food additive usually used as a thickener and named for the Chinese Senna's former placement in the genus Cassia. Roasted and ground, the seeds have also been used as a substitute for coffee. In traditional Korean medicine, they are called gyeolmyeongja (Í≤∞Î™ÖÏûê) and usually prepared as tea. They are also used in Kamp≈ç (traditional Chinese medicine in Japan), where they are called ketsumei-shi („Ç±„ÉÑ„É°„Ç§„Ç∑, Ê±∫ÊòéÂ≠ê) or by their Chinese name ju√© m√≠ng z«ê (traditional: Ê±∫ÊòéÂ≠ê, simplified: ÂÜ≥ÊòéÂ≠ê).  Names, taxonomy and identifier  Apart from \\"sicklepod\\" and \\"Chinese senna\\", S. obtusifolia has a wide range of common names. It is also known in English as foetid sassia (or \\"cassia\\"), sickle senna, coffeeweed or Arsenic weed, and somewhat ambiguously as \\"blunt-leaved senna\\", \\"coffee pod\\" or \\"java bean\\". The scientific name means \\"blunt-leaved senna\\", with obtusifolia coming from Latin obtusus (\\"dull\\", \\"blunt\\") + folium (\\"leaf\\"). Names in its native range are also: * Chinese: pinyin: ju√© m√≠ng zi () * Japanese: ebisu-gusa (\\"Ebisu grass\\": „Ç®„Éì„Çπ„Ç∞„Çµ; ËÉ°Ëçâ; ÊÅµÊØîÈ†àËçâ) * Korean: gyeolmyeongja (hangul: ; hanja: ) * Vietnamese: quy·∫øt minh t·ª≠ (from H√°n t·ª±: Ê±∫ÊòéÂ≠ê) * Portuguese: fedegoso (also used for Senna macranthera and others) * Hindi: chirauta chokad = Synonyms = Dried seeds of Senna obtusifolia Chinese senna has been treated under a wide range of scientific names. Some are synonyms of Senna obtusifolia, others are names that have been applied to it in error. In addition, several of these names may also refer to related plants. In particular, the distinction between this species and Senna tora was fraught with errors and misunderstandings:ILDIS (2005), USDA (2007) * Cassia humilis Collad. :Cassia humilis Steud. is a synonym of Chamaecrista kunthiana :Cassia numilis Collad. is apparently a misprint and refers to Senna tora * Cassia obtusifolia L. * Cassia tora auct. non L. :Cassia tora L. is a synonym of Senna tora * Cassia tora L. var. b Wight & Arn. * Cassia tora L. var. humilis (Collad.)

Meat substitute  Kawal, a protein-rich meat substitute eaten in Sudan, is produced by crushing the leaves of the plant into a paste which is then traditionally fermented in an earthenware jar, buried in a cool place. The jar is dug up every three days and the contents mixed. After two weeks, the paste is removed and rolled into balls which are left to dry in the sun. They are usually cooked in stews with onions and okra.  In literature  This plant is a conspicuous member of the flora of its native home.

Its colour is variable, from deep red to brown or purplish, with green spots and darker tentacles. Dahlia anemones live attached to rock on the seabed from the lower tidal limit down to a depth of 100 m and also attached to other organisms. Their diet comprises small fish and crustaceans, which they immobilize by firing groups of stinging cells (cnidae) into them. Dahlia anemones are closely related to mottled anemones, and both species are usually referred to as northern red anemones. Description The base is up to 120 mm across and firmly adherent to the rock. Deep sea specimens are usually larger than inshore ones. The column is usually shorter than its diameter and its surface is covered in verrucae. There is a parapet at the top where the verrucae tend to be organised into rows. The verrucae usually have bits of gravel and debris attached to them and the contracted anemone has the appearance of a rounded hummock of gravel. The disc is not broader than the parapet and has up to 160 short tentacles arranged in multiples of ten. The colour is very variable; some individuals have a red column with green blotches, grey verrucae and greyish banded tentacles; others have a red column and disc with grey verrucae and white tentacles. The tentacles are often banded and in many individuals there are thin red lines on the disc visible between the tentacles.Urticina felina Marine Species Identification Portal. Retrieved 2011-09-01. Distribution Dahlia anemones are found in the Arctic Ocean, the Baltic Sea, the North Sea and the northern Atlantic Ocean as far south as the Bay of Biscay and the Gulf of Maine.

The actual title of the treatise is never given in the stories; Holmes simply refers to \\"a treatise upon the Binomial Theorem\\". The treatise is mentioned in the 1893 short story \\"The Final Problem\\", when Holmes, speaking of Professor Moriarty, states: Moriarty was a versatile mathematician as well as a criminal mastermind. In addition to the Treatise, he wrote the book The Dynamics of an Asteroid, containing mathematics so esoteric that no one could even review it. This is a very different branch of mathematics from the Binomial Theorem, further reflecting Moriarty's impressive intellectual prowess.  Review and discussion  Doyle, in his works, never describes the contents of the treatise. This has not stopped people from speculating on what it might have contained. Mathematician Harold Davis, in the book The Summation of Series, attributes certain binomial identities to Moriarty., p 71. These have been expanded on in further work, tying the Treatise into the standard mathematical literature. Less formal depictions of the content are also available. For example, in 1955 science fiction writer Poul Anderson wrote about the treatise for The Baker Street Journal.Anderson, Poul. A Treatise on the Binomial Theorem, Baker Street Journal, 5, No. 1 (January 1955), 13-18. The Treatise is sometimes used when a reference is needed to a non-specific example of a scientific paper.This is the case in an example review of a computer science paper (in PDF format). In cryptography papers, the users and attackers of a cryptosystem are often given names suggestive of their roles. \\"Eve\\", for example, is most often the eavesdropper, listening in on an exchange. Malicious attackers are typically \\"Mallory\\", but in at least one cryptographic paper, the malicious attacker is \\"Moriarty\\". However, there are real academics named Moriarty, so to avoid confusion the paper distinguished the hypothetical attacker as \\"the author of A Treatise on the Binomial Theorem\\".  Other references  In The Seven-Per-Cent Solution, a 1974 Holmes pastiche by Nicholas Meyer, Moriarty in conversation with Watson denies having written any treatise on the binomial theorem, saying: \\"Certainly not. Who has anything new to say about the binomial theorem at this late date? At any rate, I am certainly not the man to know.\\" In this novel, Moriarty is no evil genius, but a harmless maths teacher who became a monster in Holmes' fantasies because he was involved in certain traumatic childhood experiences of his.

The arena was built in 1956. It seated up to 12,732 spectators and featured four locker rooms and a press room. On June 13, 1972, it hosted a concert by Elvis Presley. He then again played Roberts, for the second and last time on Oct. 24, 1976, breaking all existing attendance records, by drawing a crowd of 13,500. Roberts Stadium hosted concerts by musicians such as Alice Cooper, Bon Jovi, Bob Dylan, and Tool. The arena received a $16 million upgrade in 1990. In 2007, the city of Evansville hired a professional consultant to examine whether the stadium should be renovated or replaced with a new downtown arena. In December 2008, the Evansville city council approved plans to construct the new arena, which opened in the fall of 2011 as the Ford Center. It was co-managed with Mesker Amphitheatre, The Centre, and Victory Theatre. The building was demolished in 2013. Sporting events The sports arena seated 12,500 for basketball. It was the home of the University of Evansville's Purple Aces basketball program from its opening in 1956 until the Aces moved downtown into the new Ford Center in 2011. From 1957 to 1977, Roberts Stadium served as the host site for the NCAA College Division (now referred to as Division II) Men's Basketball National Championship. It again hosted the \\"Elite 8\\" in 2002. In addition, it regularly hosted a variety of other sporting events, most notably the Great Lakes Valley Conference (NCAA Division II) men's and women's basketball tournaments in early March of every year. It also hosted the 1980 and 1983 Midwestern City Conference (now Horizon League) men's basketball conference tournament. It also hosted multiple IHSAA regional and semistate basketball games in the single-class tournament. Defunct professional teams From 1984 to 1986, Roberts Stadium was home to the Evansville Thunder of the Continental Basketball Association, who were slated to be coached in 1984 by future Utah Jazz coach and University of Evansville alumnus Jerry Sloan, who actually wound up accepting a position that season as an assistant coach for the Jazz instead. From 2003 to 2007 Roberts was also home to the Evansville BlueCats of the National Indoor Football League in 2003 and 2004 and United Indoor Football from 2005 to 2007.

Origins  Bernard was the son of Bernard I, count of Poitou (814-844), and Bilichilde, daughter of Rorgon I, count of Maine. He was the paternal cousin of Emeno, Count of Angoul√™me (839-863), who died fighting the Vikings. On his mother's side he was a nephew of Rorgon II of Maine and of the royal Chancellor Gauzlin, Abbot of Saint-Germain-des-Pr√©s.  End of Rebellion  Bernard was loyal to King Charles the Bald in the civil war that erupted in 851. After the flight of Humfrid in 864 and the death of the other rebels, Charles redistributed the counties and marches of North-East Iberia and Languedoc (March of Gotia). In 864, Bernard was installed in the counties of Auvergne and Autun in central France after Bernard Plantapilosa (son of Bernard of Septimania) was dispossessed of them for rebellion. At that time Auxerre and Nevers were given to Robert the Strong who also received Autun in 865. In 865, Toulouse, Limousin, Pallars, and Ribagorza were entrusted to Bernard, son of Raymond I of Toulouse. Raymond had been dispossessed by Humfrid three years before. Ermengol, Count of Albi, received Rouergue, and Oliba received Carcassonne and probably Raz√®s. In 865, however, the king redistributed the Counties of Auvergne and Autun from Bernard and instead gave him the more strategically important Counties of Barcelona, Ausona, Roussillon, Narbonne, Agde, B√©ziers, Melgueil, and N√Æmes. The young King Charles the Child, son of Charles the Bald and thus grandson of Louis the Pious, died 29 September 866, creating a crisis of succession in Aquitaine. There were many vacancies to be filled in Aquitaine: Ranulph of Poitou, Landri of Saintonge, Emeno of P√©rigord and Angoul√™me, Bishop Ralph of Bourges, and Bernard of Auvergne were all either dead or had rebelled.  Government Reforms  Wulgrin, a relative of Charles the Bald was given the Counties of Angoul√™me, P√©rigord, Agen, and Saintogne, while other family members received their own newly vacated lands: Wullfadus was named Bishop of Bourges, Effroi (who had been a rebel from 862 to 864, but was now loyal to the king) was made Count of Poitou (however he died very soon afterwards). The nominal independence of the Aquitainian kingdom was restored with the proclamation of Charles' son Louis the Stammerer as King, although real power was retained by a Council of Nobles loyal to Charles. Upon the death of Effroi of Poitiers, the County was given to Bernard of Gothia. At this time, the County of Autun, whose Countship had been vacant since the death of Robert the Strong, was returned to Bernard Plantapilosa who had been reconciled to the king. Auvergne was given to Gari. Towards 869, Solomon, Count of Urgell, Cerdanya, and Conflent, died and within the year so had Otger, Count of Girona and Besal√∫. In 870, the King assigned Otger's counties to the County of Barcelona (and hence to Bernard of Gothia). Solomon's titles in Urgell and Cerdanya were given to Wilfred the Hairy, eldest son of Sunifred I. The County of Conflent was given to the second son of Sunifred, Mir√≥ the Old. The other three sons of Sunifred ‚Äì Radulf, Sunifred, and Riculf ‚Äì were not given any titles. In 872, Charles the Bald gave the Government of Aquitaine to his brother-in-law Boso, Count of Lyon and Vienne, and showered him with titles and territories: the County of Berry, Royal Chamberlain, and Magister Ostiariorum. However, Bernard of Gothia and Bernard Plantapilosa were asked to assist in the government of the Empire. The County of Auvergne was also given to Plantapilosa. Bernard of Toulouse was compensated for not being given greater power by being granted the lands of his enemy Oliba II in Carcassonne and Raz√®s. Shortly after, however, Bernard was assassinated by a vassal of (Oliba's former ally) Bernard Plantapilosa, in August 872. Oliba II was restored to his old possessions and Plantapilosa was given Toulouse and Limousin, but Pallars and Ribagorza escaped his control.  876 Reforms  In 876 Charles the Bald reformed his government in the south of the kingdom again. He placed Provence and Italy under the command of Boso and gave the County of Berry to Bernard of Gothia. A year later, Count Ekhard, who had many lands in M√¢con and Chaunois, died and his domains were also added to those of Boso, who had Provence taken away but retained Italy and his own counties. Autun was given for the second time to Bernard. On 8 October 876 Bernard Plantapilosa was captured by Louis the Younger, King of Saxony, at the Battle of Andernach and was as a result not given any new lands. Bishop Wullfadus died on 1 April 876 and Frotario was named his successor by Charles. However Bernard opposed the elevation of the new bishop, who would have been a counterweight to the immense power and holdings which Bernard had attained. He did not take arms directly against the King, but sought to oppose the King's directions.  877 Rebellion  877 finally saw an open rebellion with Boso, Hugh the Abbot, Bernard Plantapilosa, and Bernard of Gothia all taking up arms against the King. King Charles however died on 6 October 877 in the middle of the rebellion. The death of the king did not stop the conflict. They fought Charles' appointed successor, Louis the Stammerer, former King of Aquitaine where he had been their overlord. Hincmar, Archbishop of Rheims, subdued Boso, Plantapilosa, and Hugh, leaving Bernard, his brother Emeno, uncle Abbot Gauzlin of Saint Denis, and other uncle Count Gosfrid of Maine to fight alone. Louis was crowned on 8 December 877. Pope John VIII invoked the Council of Troyes to condemn the rebels for their actions against Bishop Frotario and for the taking of ecclesiastic property. On 11 September 878, Louis dispossessed Bernard of his honours. Theodoric, his Chamberlain, was given Autun; Plantapilosa received Berry and Septimania; Wilfred the Hairy received Barcelona, Ausona, Girona, and Besal√∫; and Mir√≥ the Old received Roussillon. Bernard continued to resist in Autun until 879 after which he died.

Many independent films are made on low budgets, but films made on the mainstream circuit with inexperienced or unknown filmmakers can also have low budgets. Many young or first time filmmakers shoot low-budget films to prove their talent before doing bigger productions. Most low-budget films that do not gain some form of attention or acclaim are never released in theatres and are often sent straight to retail because of their lack of marketability, look, story, or premise. There is no precise number to define a low budget production, and it is relative to both genre and country. What might be a low-budget film in one country may be a big budget in another. Modern-day young filmmakers rely on film festivals for pre promotion. They use this to gain acclaim and attention for their films, which often leads to a limited release in theatres. Films that acquire a cult following may be given a wide release. Low-budget films can be either professional productions or amateur. They are either shot using professional or consumer equipment. Some genres are more conducive to low- budget filmmaking than others. Horror films are a very popular genre for low- budget directorial debuts. Jeremy Gardner, director of The Battery says that horror fans are more attracted to how the films affect them than seeing movie stars. This allows horror films to focus more on provoking a reaction than on expensive casting choices. Thriller films are also a popular choice for low- budget films, as they focus on narrative. Science fiction films, which were once the domain of B movies, frequently require a big budget to accommodate their special effects, but low-cost do-it-yourself computer-generated imagery can make them affordable, especially when they focus on story and characterization. Plot devices like shooting as found footage can lower production costs, and scripts that rely on extended dialogue, such as Reservoir Dogs or Sex, Lies, and Videotape, can entertain audiences without many sets. The money flow in filmmaking is a unique system because of the uncertainty of demand. The makers of the film do not know how well the film they release will be received. They may predict a film will do very well and pay back the cost of production, but only get a portion back. Or the opposite may happen where a project that few think will go far can bring in more profit than imaginable. A big gambling variable that is also involved is the use of stars. Frequently stars are brought on to a project to gain the film publicity and fame. This process can be profitable, but it is not a foolproof mechanism to successful funding.Mckenzie, Jordi. \\"The Economics Of Movies: A Literature Survey.\\" Journal of Economic Surveys 26.1 (2012): 42-70. EBSCO. Web. 14 Apr. 2015. Well-known actors may join a low-budget film for a portion of the gross. Notable low-budget films Wayne Wang directs actors in an early indie film (Dim Sum: A Little Bit of Heart) in San Francisco, California 1983. Photos by Nancy Wong. Bruce Lee's low-budget 1970s Hong Kong martial arts films were some of the most commercially successful and profitable films of all time. The Way of the Dragon (1972) grossed worldwide against a $130,000 budget (a % return on investment), while Enter the Dragon (1973) grossed worldwide against a $850,000 budget (a % return on investment). Another example of a very successful low-budget Asian film from the same decade was the 1975 Bollywood \\"Dacoit Western\\" film Sholay, which cost ($400,000) to produce and grossed ($67 million), making it Indian cinema's highest-grossing film ever up until then. Wayne Wang's film Chan Is Missing, set on the streets of San Francisco's Chinatown, was made for $20,000 in 1982. San Francisco Chronicle columnist Herb Caen wrote that the budget would not have paid for the shoe laces in the film, \\"Annie\\". One of the most successful low-budget films was 1999's The Blair Witch Project. It had a budget of around $60,000 but grossed almost $249 million worldwide. It spawned books, a trilogy of video games, and a less- popular sequel. Another successful low-budget film was 2007's Paranormal Activity, with a budget of only $15,000, the film went on to gross more than $190 million. Possibly an even more successful low-budget film was the 1972 film Deep Throat which cost only $22,500 to produce, yet was rumored to have grossed over $600 million, though this figure is often disputed. Rocky was shot on a budget of $1 million and eventually grossed $225 million worldwide, making Sylvester Stallone a star. Halloween was produced on a budget of $325,000 and grossed $70 million worldwide. Napoleon Dynamite cost less than $400,000 to make but its gross revenue was $46 million. Divisions of major film studios that specialize in such films, such as Fox Searchlight Pictures, Miramax, and New Line Cinema, have made the distribution of low budget films competitive. The UK film Monsters is a recent successful example of bringing what was once considered the exclusive preserve of the big studios‚Äîthe expensive, special effects blockbuster‚Äîto independent, low-budget cinema. The film's budget was reported to be approximately $500,000, but it grossed $4,188,738 at the box office. A considerable number of low- and modest-budget films have been forgotten by their makers and fallen into the public domain. This has been especially true of low-budget films made in the United States from 1923 to 1978 (films and other works made in the US during this period fell into public domain if their copyrights weren't renewed 28 years after the original production). Examples include a number of films made by Ed Wood or Roger Corman. Some low-budget films have failed miserably at the box office and been quickly forgotten, only to increase in popularity decades later. A number of cheaply made movies have attained cult-film status after being considered some of the worst features ever made for many years. The most famous examples of this later-day popularity of low-budget box-office failures include Plan 9 from Outer Space and Manos: The Hands of Fate. Additionally, some low-cost films that have had little (or modest) success upon their initial release have later been considered classics. The Last Man on Earth was the first adaptation of the novel I Am Legend by Richard Matheson. Due to budgetary constraints, the vampires in the film were zombie-like creatures instead of fast and agile monsters portrayed in the novel. This approach (and film) was not considered a success at the time, but it inspired George A. Romero's work in his film Night of the Living Dead. Thus The Last Man on Earth became a precursor to numerous zombie films, and fans of those films later re- discovered the original, making it a cult classic.

Micro budget Preparing to record the 1976 Wendy Yoshimura documentary, \\"Wendy...uh...What's Her Name\\" in Fresno, California,1976. A micro budget film is that which is made on an extremely low budget, sometimes as little as a few thousand dollars. An example of such would be the popular 1992 film El Mariachi, in which the director Robert Rodriguez was unable to afford second takes due to the $7000 budget. Despite this, it was a success both critically and commercially, and started the young director's career. Some of the most critically acclaimed micro-budget films were by the Bengali film director Satyajit Ray, his most famous being The Apu Trilogy (1955‚Äì1959). The first film in the trilogy, Pather Panchali (1955), was produced on a shoestring budget of Rs.200,000 ($3000) using an amateur cast and crew. The three films are now frequently listed among the greatest films of all time.\\"The Best 1,000 Movies Ever Made\\" By the film critics of The New York Times, The New York Times, 2002. All his other films that followed also had micro-budgets or low-budgets, with his most expensive films being The Adventures of Goopy and Bagha (1968) at Rs.600,000 ($12,000) and Shatranj Ke Khilari (1977) at Rs.2 million ($40,000). Another example would be the 1977 cult film Eraserhead, which cost only $10,000 to produce. Director David Lynch had so much trouble securing funds that the film had to be made over a six- year period, whenever Lynch could afford to shoot scenes. In 2014, journalist Kyle Smith estimated the film has grossed over $7 million. Slacker, a 1991 comedy-drama film written and directed by Richard Linklater, was produced for $23,000. The film was inducted into the National Film Registry in 2012. Influenced by the success of Slacker, Clerks was written and directed by Kevin Smith for $27,575 in 1994 which he paid for on his credit card and grossed $3.2 million in theatres. Clerks launched Smith's career as a director and he has made several considerable higher budget films.

It was created under the Carter administration by order of the Secretary of the Interior on January 25, 1978. HCRS, a non-land managing agency, was responsible for assuring the identification, protection, and beneficial use of important cultural, natural, and recreational American resources. HCRS offered grant assistance, technical information and guidance to those in the public and private sectors involved in conservation or recreation projects. Under the Reagan administration the HCRS was abolished by Secretarial Order 3060 on February 19, 1981, and absorbed into the National Park Service. During its brief tenure, HCRS revolutionized the integration of natural resource based planning and cultural and historic preservation. HCRS was involved with a number of important achievements during its relatively short existence including: # Publication of the Third Outdoor Recreation Plan (P.L. 88-29) in 1978 and its 1979 Nationwide Recreation Action Program; # Support for the passage and implementation of the Urban Parks and Recreation Recovery Act (P.L. 95-625); # Creation of a one million acre Pinelands National Reserve in New Jersey; # Support for addition of twenty-one units to the National Park System; # Support for enlargement of the National Wilderness System; # Addition of eight units to the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System; # Tripling of mileage in the National Trails System (P.L. 95-625); # Acceleration of National Recreation trails designations; # Authorization of the use of abandoned highway lands for bikeway and recreation development through the 1978 Surface Transportation Assistance Act; # Launching the nationwide \\"rails to trails\\" program through authorization of an initial demonstration grant program to convert abandoned railroad rights-of-way to conservation and recreation purposes through the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act; # helping to justify Executive Action to set aside 120 million acres of outstanding natural, cultural and recreation resources in Alaska; # Preparation of the National Heritage Policy Act to establish a national heritage policy and provide a basis for a State-based partnership program to identify, select, and protect special natural areas and historic places; # Support for issuance of three Executive Orders which: #* (a) protect Federal lands from degradation by off-road vehicles, #* (b) ensure that Federal agencies protect natural, cultural, and recreation values of wetlands by minimizing their loss or degradation, & #* (c) mandating access for the handicapped in all Federal or federally assisted programs and facilities through Federal agency guidelines issued by the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare; # Completion of the 1978 the National Urban Recreation Study, the first comprehensive assessment of the Nation's urban recreation problems and options for local, State and Federal action; & # Reducing paperwork and shortening project approval time for the States through new consolidated grant applications for the Land and Water Conservation Fund (P.L. 95-42), increasing its funding to $900 million for FY1978, and increasing public participation in the Statewide Comprehensive Outdoor Recreation Plan process. HCRS also played a major role in advocating for passage of legislation to protect the biodiversity and other natural resources found on Barrier Islands which passed the U.S. Congress in 1982 as the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (P.L. 97-348). These and other actions of HCRS were detailed in the Third Outdoor Recreation Plan transmitted to the Congress of the United States by President Jimmy Carter on December 11, 1979. The Secretary of the Interior was Cecil D. Andrus and the Assistant Secretary for Fish and Wildlife and Parks Robert L. Herbst. The senior management of HCRS during the period of 1977-1980 consisted of: Chris Therral Delaporte, Director; Meg Maguire, Deputy Director; and Paul C. Pritchard, Deputy Director. During this agency's existence, a number of important publications and research on historic preservation issues were completed. Within the HCRS was a \\"Policy on Disposition of Human Remains\\" that was a standard for federal agencies within the Department of the Interior interested in studying bones and handling human remains. The policy was an early attempt at relieving tensions between Native Americans and the U.S. government. The HCRS called for the reburial of all remains that were in deliberate burials whose direct relation to modern relatives could be proven. Before the reburial, however, the U.S. government was permitted to study and document the remains.  References  * Pauketat, Timothy R. North American Archaeology 2005.

They were born in New York state to parents who performed on Broadway and from an early age the girls sang together. The family moved to New Smyrna Beach, Florida, in 1989 and, by the end of the 1990s, they had formed an a cappella act. Desmond Child, a noted songwriter, noticed the sisters and helped them to sign a contract with S-Curve Records. First album In 2002, the Beu Sisters' first album, Decisions, was released. Nine of the thirteen tracks on the album were co-written by them. The album includes the lead single \\"I Was Only (Seventeen)\\", for which a music video was filmed. To promote their album, the Beu Sisters toured as the opening act on Kelly Clarkson and Clay Aiken's 2004 Independent Tour. Soundtrack contributions The Beu Sisters can also be heard on various soundtracks, including Disney productions the Ella Enchanted, Home on the Range, Disney Girlz Rock, Radio Disney Jingle Jams, Radio Disney Ultimate Jams, The Lizzie McGuire Movie soundtrack and DisneyMania 2. They appeared on the Because of Winn-Dixie movie soundtrack and also contributed to the movie How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days, featuring Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey, in 2003. Looking ahead In 2012, the sisters created an album titled Beu- tiful. It has many music videos dedicated to the songs on the album, such as \\"Definition of a Lady\\" and \\"Everything Will be Alright\\". A new song, \\"What Do You Do in the Summer (When It's Raining?)\\", was released to radio in summer 2004. The group still performs at venues in Florida, although they took a break when Christie Beu gave birth to a boy in December 2004. At some point, Jillian Beu left the group, resulting in the quartet becoming a trio.

These ideas are created with the goal of extending and strengthening civil society. Social innovation includes the social processes of innovation, such as open source methods and techniques and also the innovations which have a social purpose‚Äîlike activism, virtual volunteering, microcredit, or distance learning. There are many definitions of social innovation, however, they usually include the broad criteria about social objectives, social interaction between actors or actor diversity, social outputs, and innovativeness (The innovation should be at least ‚Äùnew‚Äù to the beneficiaries it targets, but it does not have to be new to the world). Different definitions include different combinations and different number of these criteria (e.g. EU is using definition stressing out social objectives and actors interaction). Transformative social innovation not only introduces new approaches to seemingly intractable problems, but is successful in changing the social institutions that created the problem in the first place.Westley,F/Zimmerman,B/Patton, M. 2006 Prominent innovators associated with the term include Pakistani Akhter Hameed Khan, Bangladeshi Muhammad Yunus, the founder of Grameen Bank which pioneered the concept of microcredit for supporting innovations in many developing countries such as Asia, Africa and Latin America, and inspired programs like the Jindal Centre for Social Innovation & Entrepreneurship and Infolady Social Entrepreneurship Programme of Dnet (A Social Enterprise). Focus and application Social Innovation has an inter-sectoral approach and is universally applicable. Social Innovations are launched by a variety of actors, including research institutions, companies and independent organizations, which tend to use their respective definitions of Social Innovation. Therefore, it is worth discussing what distinguishes it from other forms of social work or innovation. Social Innovation focuses on the process of innovation, how innovation and change take shape (as opposed to the more traditional definition of innovation, giving priority to the internal organization of firms and their productivity). It likewise centers on new work and new forms of cooperation (business models),Klievink, B., & Janssen, M. (2014). \\"Developing multi-layer information infrastructures: advancing social innovation through public- private governance\\" \\"Information Systems Management\\" 31:240‚Äì249 especially on those that work towards the attainment of a sustainable society. Social innovation can take place within government; the for-profit sector, the nonprofit sector (also known as the third sector), or in the spaces between them. Higher education institutions, such as the Cambridge Centre for Social Innovation, Cambridge Judge Business School, University of Cambridge, leverage the power of research to support this aim. Research has focused on the types of platforms needed to facilitate such cross-sector collaborative social innovation. Historical studies suggest that transforming any system may take many years, and requires not only the capacity for multiple partnerships, but also for engaging policy, legal and economic institutions.Westley, F., McGowan,K and Tjornbo, O. 2017 Social entrepreneurship, like social enterprise, is typically in the nonprofit sector excluding both for-profit and public organizations. Both social entrepreneurship and social enterprise are important contributions to social innovation by creating social value and introducing new ways of achieving goals. Social entrepreneurship brings \\"new patterns and possibilities for innovation\\" and are willing to do things that existing organizations are not willing to do.James A. Phills Jr., Kriss Deiglmeier, & Dale T. Miller \\"Rediscovering Social Innovation\\", Stanford Social Innovation Review Fall 2008. Social innovation is often an effort of mental creativity which involves fluency and flexibility from a wide range of disciplines. The act of social innovation in a sector is mostly connected with diverse disciplines within the society. The social innovation theory of 'connected difference' emphasizes three key dimensions to social innovation.Mulgan. Geoff. \\"Social Innovation: What it is, why it matters and how it can be accelerated: Skoll Centre for Social Entrepreneurship, University of Oxford\\" First, innovations are usually new combinations or hybrids of existing elements, rather than completely new. Second, their practice involves cutting across organizational or disciplinary boundaries. Lastly, they leave behind compelling new relationships between previously separate individuals and groups.Nambisan, S. \\"Platforms for Collaboration\\", Stanford Social Innovation Review, Summer 2009. Social innovation is also gaining visibility within academia.Howaldt, J./ Schwarz, M. \\"Social Innovation: Concepts, research fields and international trends\\", IMO international monitoring, 2010. Since 2014, a subdomain of social innovation has been defined in relation to the introduction of digital technologies. The subdomain is called digital social innovation and refers to \\"a type of social and collaborative innovation in which innovators, users and communities collaborate using digital technologies to co-create knowledge and solutions for a wide range of social needs and at a scale and speed that was unimaginable before the rise of the Internet\\".F. Bria, DSI4EU final report, 2015, available at: http://www.nesta.org.uk/sites/default/files/dsireport.pdf History Social innovation was discussed in the writings of figures such as Peter Drucker and Michael Young (founder of the Open University and dozens of other organizations) in the 1960s.see for example Gavron, Dench e ds Young at 80, Carcanet Press, London, 1995 for a comprehensive overview of one of the world's most successful social innovators It also appeared in the work of French writers in the 1970s, such as Pierre Rosanvallon, Jacques Fournier, and Jacques Attali.Chambon, J.-L, David, A. and Devevey, J.-M (1982), Les Innovations Sociales, Presses Universitaires de France, Paris However, the themes and concepts in social innovation existed long before. Benjamin Franklin, for example, talked about small modifications within the social organization of communities that could help to solve everyday problems. Many radical 19th century reformers like Robert Owen, founder of the cooperative movement, promoted innovation in the social field and all of the great sociologists including Karl Marx, Max Weber and √âmile Durkheim focused attention on broader processes of social change. In recent years, the work of Gabriel Tarde on the concept of imitation has been rediscovered by social scientists in order to better understand social innovation and its relation to social change. Other theories of innovation became prominent in the 20th century, many of which had social implications, without putting social progress at the center of the theory. Joseph Schumpeter, for example, addressed the process of innovation directly with his theory of creative destruction and his definition of entrepreneurs as people who combined existing elements in new ways to create a new product or service. Beginning in the 1980s, writers on technological change increasingly addressed how social factors affect technology diffusion.notably in the writings of Christopher Freeman, Carlotta Perez, Ian Miles and others The article \\"Rediscovering Social Innovation\\" mentions how social innovations are dependent on history and the change in institutions. The article discusses the ten recent social innovations reflecting current change to include: * Charter Schools: Charter schools are a social innovation that provides an alternative avenue for students to continue to develop and build upon their educational foundation without many of the issues prominent in the public school system. These primary and secondary schools are publicly funded and operate independently, which allows the teachers and parents to collaboratively develop alternative teaching methods for their students as related regulations are less stringent for Charter Schools.\\"Charter School.\\" Wikipedia. Wikimedia Foundation, n.d. Web. Feb. 2015. * Community-Centered Planning: This social innovation allows communities to plan and develop systems that cater solutions to their specific local needs by using their historical knowledge and other local resources. * Emissions Trading: The Emissions Trading program was designed to address issues associated with the continuous increase in pollution. The program provides solutions such as setting a cap on the amount that certain pollutants can be emitted, and implementing a permit system to control the amount of pollution produced by each participating business. If a business needs to use more pollution than permitted, it can purchase credits from a business that has not emitted its maximum permitted amount. The goal of the Emissions Trading program is that, over time and with increased awareness, society will limit the types and the numbers of pollutants emitted to what is only necessary. * Fair Trade: Products including coffee, sugar, and chocolate are currently being traded without high standards that result in tough conditions for farmers and a less sustainable environment. Fair trade is a movement that certifies traders to exchange with the farmers that produce these products. The idea behind this movement is that by being paid a living-wage, being able to meet social and environmental standards and promoting \\"environmental sustainability, the lives of these farmers will be improved. * Habitat Conservation Plans: Habitat Conservation Plans is an effort by the US Fish and Wild Life Service and the Environmental Protection Agency to protect species and their endangerment by providing economical incentives to conserve their habitats and protect these species from endangerment. * Individual Development Accounts: This social innovation is made to support the working poor with saving decisions that they have made to better enhance their lives. This initiative will give $2 per every $1 saved by the working poor for College tuition, purchasing a home, starting a business, and other similar and productive initiatives. This is made possible by philanthropic, government and corporate sponsors that donate to this cause. * International Labor Standards: Labor standards differ country-to-country, with some agreeably better than others. In effort to internationally align these, the International Labor Organization, participating governments, and employees contributed to the development of standards that protect workers‚Äô rights to freedom, equity, security, and human dignity\\". * Microfinance: This social innovation is created to support those financially unable to gain access to financial services such as banking, lending, and insurance. The ultimate goal of Microfinance is to enable an escape from poverty by helping to improve the living conditions and financial viability among the impoverished program participants. * Socially Responsible Investing: \\"An investment strategy that attempts to maximize both financial and social returns. Investors generally favor businesses and other organizations whose practices support environmental sustainability, human rights, and consumer protection.\\" * Supported Employment: Supported Employment is a social innovation geared towards helping disabled or disadvantaged workers who are un- or under-employed due to their condition obtain suitable employment. The Support Employment service provides access to job coaches, transportation, assistive technology, specialized job training, and individual tailored supervision in effort to help program participants become more competitive applicants and better prepared overall for the job market.  Developments since 2000  Academic research, blogs and websites feature social innovation, along with organizations working on the boundaries of research and practical action. Topics include: * Innovation in public services was pioneered particularly in some Scandinavian and Asian countries. Governments are increasingly recognizing that innovation requires healthcare, schooling and democracy.Innovation in the Public Sector an overview of thinking about innovation in the public sector, published by the UK government's Strategy Unit in 2003Ready or Not? published by The Young Foundation in 2007 about the need for public sector organizations to innovate * Social entrepreneurship, which is the practice of creating new organizations focusing on non-market activities.Nichols; Social Entrepreneurship, Oxford University Press 2007 * Responsible Research and Innovation, which takes into account effects and potential impacts on the environment and society.

How to Generate Innovation in the Public Sector. The Young Foundation and Center for American Progress In 2010, the US government listed 11 investments made by its 'Social Innovation Fund', with public funding more than matched by philanthropic organizations. This fund focuses on partnerships with charities, social enterprises, and business. Moreover, educational institutions are now increasingly supporting teaching and research in the area of social innovation. In addition to pioneered efforts by institutions such as the Harvard Business School's Initiative on Social Enterprise (launched 1993) and Said Business School's Skoll Centre for Social Entrepreneurship (launched 2003), INSEAD and other universities now offer short-term programs in Social Innovation, and a few such as Cambridge Centre for Social Innovation, Cambridge Judge Business School, University of Cambridge, and Goldsmiths, University of London offer Masters courses dedicated entirely to the study of theory and practice in relation to social entrepreneurship and innovation. The Cambridge Centre for Social Innovation's aim is to build best practices across business, civil society, policy and academia for a more equitable, inclusive and sustainable world. Public policy makers support social innovation in the UK, Australia, China and Denmark, as well.Mulgan, Ali, Tucker; Social innovation: what it is, why it matters, how it can be accelerated, published by Said Business School, Oxford, 2007 The European Union's innovation strategy was the first well-funded research and development strategy to emphasize social innovation.Murray, R., Caulier- Grice and Geoff Mulgan (2010) The Open Book of Social Innovation . The Young Foundation and NESTA In 2002, the South Australian government, led by Premier and Social Inclusion Minister Mike Rann, embraced a ten-year social innovation strategy with big investments and a focus on reform in areas such as homelessness, school retention, mental health and disability services. The Common Ground and Street to Home homelessness initiatives and the Australian Centre for Social Innovationhttp://www.tacsi.org,au were established in Adelaide and many reforms trialed in South Australia have been adopted nationally throughout Australia. This initiative, headed by Monsignor David Cappo, South Australia's Social Inclusion Commissioner, was advised by 'Thinkers in Residence' Geoff Mulgan and New York social entrepreneur Rosanne Haggerty.  Role in curbing corruption  Lin and Chen, in \\"The Impact of Societal and Social innovation: a case-based approach\\" have argued that social innovation's goal is to produce actions that are \\"socially valuable and good for many\\". In governance, its main role is to enhance and maximize the trust of citizens through active involvement in society, whether in the public or private sphere. Social innovation's role in curbing corruption is carried out through two main mediums. Firstly, it is institutionalized through actors (in the public and the private sectors), and secondly, it is executed with new tools available, specifically ICTs. Local and regional development Literature on social innovation in relation to territorial/regional development covers innovation in the social economy, i.e. strategies for satisfaction of human needs; and innovation in the sense of transforming and/or sustaining social relations, especially governance relations at the regional and local level. Beginning in the late 1980s, Jean-Louis Laville and Frank Moulaert researched social innovation.Laville, J.-L. (Ed.) (1994) L‚Äô√©conomie solidaire, une perspective internationale, Descl√©e de Brouwer, Paris In Canada CRISESCRISES initiated this type of research. Another, larger project was SINGOCOMSocial Innovation, Governance, and Community Building (2002‚Äì2004) a European Commission Framework 5 project, which pioneered so-called \\"Alternative Models for Local Innovation\\" (ALMOLIN). These models were further elaborated through community actions covered by KATARSIS and SOCIAL POLIS. More recent works focus on the societal role of the economic life in terms of innovations in social practices and social relations at the local and regional levels. Social Innovation, therefore, is increasingly seen as a process and a strategy to foster human development through solidarity, cooperation, and cultural diversity.MacCallum, D., Moulaert, F., Hillier, J. and S. Vicari (Eds) (2009) Social Innovation and Territorial Development. Ashgate, Aldershot. The EU funded URBACT programme is designed to help cities to exchange and learn around urban policies. The URBACT methodology can be seen as a social innovation action planning approach. A typical URBACT network would have ten cities working on a specific theme such as active inclusion or regenerating disadvantaged neighbourhoods. They examine good practice and then working through a local support group use the results to inform their local action plan.Jegou F., Bonneau M., (2015) Social Innovation in Cities - Urbact II Capitalisation. The Social Innovation Europe initiative, funded by the European Commission's Directorate General for Enterprise and Industry, was set up to map social innovation at a European level, by creating a directory of grass-roots examples of social innovation from across the 27 member states. The European Commission funded the SELUSI study between 2008 - 2013 that looked at over 550 social ventures and examined how these insights can spark change and innovation at a much larger scale. It looked at business models of social ventures in five countries - UK being one of them ‚Äì identifying which specific practices evolved by social ventures are particularly successful, and how and by whom ‚Äì be it social enterprise, public sector body or mainstream business ‚Äì they can be most effectively scaled-up. The European Commission has launched a new initiative (project) in 2013 under FP7 funding, with the aim to build a network of incubators for social innovation across regions and countries. This network facilitates identification of 300 social innovation examples and facilitates its scaling. The network is organised in a way to identify new models for scaling of social innovations across various geographical clusters in collaboration with each other, communicating the ideas, finding the tools and funds, developing business plans and models in order to promote the new promising ideas throughout Europe. * A guide also exists that provides a way to promote social innovations at a local or regional level.The Guide to Social Innovation.

It is the most common Mycobacterium tuberculosis skin infection. The lesions may ultimately develop into disfiguring skin ulcers if left untreated. Signs and symptoms It begins as painless reddish-brown nodules which slowly enlarge to form irregularly shaped red plaque. File:Lupus vulgaris.jpgLupus vulgaris, changes in skin in hyperkeratotic forms File:Lupus vulgaris 2.jpgLupus vulgaris in a woman in 19th century Cause Lupus vulgaris often develops due to inadequately treated pre-existing tuberculosis. It may also develop at site of BCG vaccination. Rarely, it has been shown to be associated with tattoo mark and also with long term bindi use, the so-called \\"bindi tuberculosis\\". Pathophysiology right Histologically, it shows well-formed granulomas with necrotic centers in dermis. Diagnosis On diascopy, it shows characteristic \\"apple-jelly\\" color. Biopsy will reveal tuberculoid granuloma with few bacilli.

Prognosis In longstanding scarred lesions, squamous cell carcinoma can develop. History In the 19th century, the chronic and progressive nature of this disease was particularly marked: it remained active for ten years, twenty years, or even longer and, proved resistant to all treatment until the breakthrough by Niels Ryberg Finsen using a form of \\"concentrated light radiation\\" now known as Photobiomodulation which won him a Nobel Prize. Queen Alexandra of Great Britain, (1844‚Äì1925), consort to Edward the VII, as the inscription on the bronze statue of her at the London Hospital, notes, \\"Introduced to England the Finsen light cure for Lupus, and presented the first lamp to this hospital\\". =Etymology= The term \\"lupus\\" (meaning \\"wolf\\" in Latin) to describe an ulcerative skin disease dates to the late thirteenth century, though it was not until the mid-nineteenth that two specific skin diseases were classified as lupus erythematosus and lupus vulgaris. The term may derive from the rapacity and virulence of the disease; a 1590 work described it as \\"a malignant ulcer quickly consuming the neather parts; ... very hungry like unto a woolfe\\".\\"Lupus\\", Oxford English Dictionary, online second edition.

Overview  The work is a practical manual and according to its author \\"a rather modest elementary handbook [...] for those devoting themselves to generalship\\", that was to serve as a general guide or handbook to Byzantine art of war. In the introduction of his 1984 translation of the text, George Dennis noted that \\"the Strategikon is written in a very straightforward and generally uncomplicated Greek.\\" The Strategikon may have been written in an effort to codify the military reforms brought about by the soldier-emperor Maurice. The true authorship of the Strategikon is still debated among academics. Maurice may have only commissioned it and perhaps his brother Peter or, more likely, another general was the true author. The date also remains debated. If it was written during the 6th century, the Strategikon may have been produced to analyze and reflect on the experience of the Balkan and Persian campaigns, or the campaigns may have been carried out in compliance with the manual. However, beginning in the late 19th century, a number of historians have, due to perceived philological and technological inconsistencies, argued for a later publication date during the eighth or ninth century.Lynn White, Jr., Medieval Technology and Social Change, Oxford University Press, 1964, pp. 20-21, gives the argument for a later date on technological grounds; his notes on p. 144 list some of the works arguing for a later date on philological grounds. In any case, the work is considered to be one of the most notable military texts of the medieval Byzantine period, along with treatises attributed to the Byzantine emperors Leo VI (Tactica) and Nicephorus Phocas (De velitatione and the Praecepta Militaria), among others. Leo's Tactica in particular was greatly inspired by the Strategikon. The text consists of 12 chapters or \\"books\\" on various aspects of strategy and tactics, employed by the Byzantine army during the 6th and 7th century C.E. Its contents primarily focus on cavalry tactics and formation and several chapters elaborate on matters of infantry, siege warfare, logistics, education and training and movement. The author was familiar with antique military treatises, especially Onasander and Aelian, which he utilized as conceptional models rather than sources of content.P. Rance, \\"Maurice's Strategicon and the Ancients: the Late Antique Reception of Aelian and Arrian\\" in P. Rance and N.V. Sekunda (edd.), Greek Taktika. Ancient Military Writing and its Heritage (Gda≈Ñsk 2017) 217-255. Each book focuses on a generic topic. Several levels of subsections go into further detail and include maps. These maps are mainly sketches and drawings to show essential symbols of troop positions and highlight the standard designs of formation and manoeuvre of the Byzantine military of the epoch. Books seven and eight tackle with practical advice for the commander in the form of instructions and military maxims. The eleventh book is of interest for ethnographers as it portrays various enemies of the Byzantine Empire, such as the (Franks, the Lombards, the Avars, the Turks and the Slavs). The Strategikon also represents and refers to Military justice and Byzantine legal literature, since it contains a list of military infractions and their respective penalties. Contents * Book I ‚Äì Introduction * Book II ‚Äì The Cavalry Battle Formation * Book III ‚Äì Formations of the Tagma * Book IV ‚Äì Ambushes * Book V ‚Äì On Baggage Trains * Book VI ‚Äì Various Tactics and Drills * Book VII ‚Äì Strategy, The Points Which the General Must Consider * Book VIII ‚Äì General Instructions and Maxims * Book IX ‚Äì Surprise Attacks * Book X ‚Äì Sieges * Book XI ‚Äì Characteristics and Tactics of Various Peoples * Book XII ‚Äì Mixed Formations, Infantry, Camps and Hunting Summary = Book I ‚Äì Introduction = This book contains a great deal of detail on the origin of the Byzantine Military, and specific information of selections, organization, crimes, and punishment. They go into a great deal of detail on the topics listed below to make sure that there are no confusion on general topics of the Byzantine military. The topics that this book discusses include: training and drilling of soldiers as individuals, the armament of the cavalryman and the basic equipment to be furnished, the various titles of the officers and soldiers, the organization of the army and the assignment of officers, how the tagmatic commanders should select their subordinate officers and combat leaders and organize the Tagma into squads, the regulations about military crimes to be given to the troops, the regulations about military crimes to be given to the tagmatic commanders, military punishments, and the orderly way of marching through our own country when there is no hostile activity. = Book II ‚Äì The Cavalry Battle Formation and Book III - Formations of the Tagma = These books cover the formations of the cavalry and Tagma. They include maps to show what these formations appeared on a smaller scale to help people visually. These maps have many shapes and characters that some will not understand but through further readings can make sense of them due to the amount of that character on the map. These books cover every topic from the recruitment, creation of squads, the strategy of using block formation instead of the one lengthy line of military. This also discusses the importance of having a cavalry and the importance of the cavalry in their specific military style. = Book IV ‚Äì Ambushes = This book discusses what each part of the formations of the cavalry and tagma would do in the case of an ambush as well as each implement in place to deter the ambush from taken place. They have certain spacing between squads to prevent ambushes from the ability to reach a squad without intervention from a squad further behind. This method was also used to help prevent retreats from any member of the military because there is always someone watching them. = Book V ‚Äì On Baggage Trains = Baggage trains should be regarded with utmost care as they contain the ingredients to make a forward operating base function, including servants and children. Baggage trains should be kept away from areas of battle to avoid dispiriting soldier morale in the event of capture. Reserve horses should be kept with the baggage train at the onset of battle, their utility is not needed at the front line and will only add to the confusion in battle. The encampment area for the baggage train should be stationed in a defensible area with water and grass readily available at a distance of approximately 30 to 50 miles away from the location of the main battle and should be staffed with a force of two Banda; the encampment should forage for food and hay equivalent to four days of necessity. The defense force should select known and capable men to form a communication chain from the baggage train encampment to the front line. An intermediate encampment, closer to the front line, should be established between the battle area and the baggage train; the camp should be fortified and supplied with food for a day at the camp for each bandon. While in transit, the baggage train should be kept separate from the soldiers' marching lines; when enemies are present, the baggage train should be in the middle of the caravan to avoid harassment by enemies. = Book VI ‚Äì Various Tactics and Drills, Book VII - Strategy. The Points Which the General Must Consider, and Book VIII - General Instructions and Maxims = Book six contains the tactics and drills that the military had at the time and put the soldiers through to properly train the individuals. This gave them all of the knowledge that they would need with weapons, tactics, actions, and strategies they needed to use in battles. Then book seven focuses on the different strategic points that the generals must consider prior to engaging in a battle, not necessarily a war. Book eight then covers the details of the instructions that the generals had been given from Emperor Maurice and his administrative people. = Book IX ‚Äì Surprise Attacks and Book X - Sieges = These books cover the surprise attacks and siege strategies that the Byzantine Military used at this point in time. It covers how the military would use different strategies to surprise attack the enemy or siege the enemy land than when they would when in just a battle. = Book XI ‚Äì Characteristics and Tactics of Various Peoples and Book XII - Mixed Formations, Infantry, Camps and Hunting = Books eleven and twelve cover the mixed uses of non cavalry and tagma groups and their various formations. This explains what the rest of the military would do with while the Tagmas and cavalry had in formation and use. In separate chapter of Strategycon (Book XI), the author is presenting everything useful and needed as well as important from war point of view about life of the enemy. * He describes Persians as deviant but obedient and \\"persistent in work and fighting in the name of their homeland\\". * Scythians, Turks and Avarians and similar are nomad people; Sinewy, superstitious, reckless, committed to desire for abundance. They are good in horse riding and archery; also, they own a lot of horses. They can stay on their backs for a very long time, but they are not skilful while they are walking, not very hardy. * Francs, Lombards and their lookalikes value their freedom very much. They are fearless and bold in battle. They are dissolute in attack and disobedient to their leaders. They are greedy and bribable. They can't stand the heat as much as cold, they are easily ambushed, their camps are very unorganized. * Slavs, Ants and their lookalikes have the same customs and don't let be enslaved. Slavs acted with slaves better than other nations did; after certain period of time a slave would be realised and he could go back home or stay and live as equal member of Slavic community. They easily bear extreme weather conditions and shortage of food; they are good in crossing water as well as hiding under the water ( by using concave canes). They are friendly with foreigners and their hospitality is well known-revenge for the guest is considered a duty. They are easily bribed, they are discordant and they cannot stand each other. Slavs are skilled with arms and nimble in tight and wooded areas, but unorganized in outdoor battles. The author praises Slavic women who are honorable after their husbands died\\".  Conclusions  Military historians consider the Strategikon to be the earliest sophisticated theory of Combined arms at battalion level (Greek: Tagma). However, historians still question and debate the validity of these sources due to the tradition of copying from ancient Greek and Roman authors, such as Aeneas Tacticus, Arrian or Polybius in Byzantine treatises like the Strategikon, the Tactica, the Sylloge Taktikon, the Praecepta Militaria and others. The Strategikon also testifies to the lasting influence of Latin on the Byzantine terminology of warfare and shows that up until the year 600 C.E Latin was still the official command language of the imperial army.

Early life Austin grew up in the Nazarene Church and in Halliburton oil camps in Oklahoma, Texas and California. He graduated from Santa Fe High School in Santa Fe Springs, California, in 1960 and earned his BA in Theatre from San Francisco State University in 1964. The Committee After college, Austin moved to Los Angeles where he became a stage manager for the L.A. branch of San Francisco's famed improvisational comedy group, The Committee. It was here Austin worked as an improviser with Second City's Del Close and began to develop characters. When the Los Angeles company closed in 1969, Austin moved to San Francisco where he became a performing member of The Committee. After his departure from The Committee, Austin moved back to Los Angeles and worked at the newly-opened Comedy Store where he improvised with The Comedy Store Players, worked as emcee, and did stand-up. In 1972, Gary gathered together a group of actors and started the Gary Austin Workshops. After a year he decided it was time for the actors to perform publicly and he began directing shows in Los Angeles. As word got around about the workshop, the improvisers began to perform at various venues around Hollywood. The Groundlings In January 1974, Austin created the non-profit improvisational theatre company, The Groundlings, composed of members of his workshops. The company moved into the Oxford Theatre in East Hollywood. Austin continued as Artistic Director. A non-profit company requires a name to be agreed to by the charter members. After taking a poll, Gary found that most members wanted the company to be called \\"The Working Class.\\" The night before the vote, Austin was reading Hamlet's speech to the players \\"with the intention of using Shakespeare‚Äôs acting lesson as a jumping off point for the next day‚Äôs workshop\\" and came up with the name Groundlings (a reference in the play to the lower class audience members who sat on the ground in front of the stage to watch plays at the Globe Theatre in Shakespeare's day.) The next day, Austin presented the name and after much debate, \\"The Groundlings\\" won. During the course of one year at The Oxford the Groundlings became known throughout the Hollywood industry. They performed in a thirty-seat theatre with a cast of twenty-five and the actors often outnumbered the audience. Austin was interviewed by Sylvie Drake, Los Angeles Times theatre critic, one week before the opening show. In her article in the Times the Sunday prior to the Groundling opening she concluded, \\"This could be the start of something big.\\" She gave the Groundlings the first of many rave reviews. As the buzz about the new company increased, the entertainment industry began to take notice. Comedian Lily Tomlin was a regular in the audience, as was Lorne Michaels, and several Groundlings were hired to perform on Lily, the 1975 Emmy Award-winning ABC special. Gary was hired to direct portions of the show. Later that year, Lorne Michaels, who produced the Tomlin special, asked Groundling Laraine Newman to be a cast member for his new late night comedy series Saturday Night Live. He asked Gary to move to New York City to direct the cast and Austin declined in order to continue his work with The Groundlings. Before long, membership in the company grew to 90 performers. To keep the size of the company down, auditions became required. (Phil Hartman, who was then a graphic designer and not an actor, attended that first audition. He got in, but because of the stiff competition, it would be over a year before he started performing in the shows). As the company grew in numbers and popularity, it was time to move into a new theatre. One day while driving home from a workshop, Austin saw a For Rent sign on a building at 7307 Melrose Ave. in West Hollywood and in 1975, the company members rented the empty space and constructed The Groundling Theatre with their own hands. Due to building codes, parking restrictions and problems with contracting, it would take four years for the theatre to open to the public. In the meantime, the Groundlings continued to perform at various Hollywood locations, including The Improv, The White House (home of Kentucky Fried Theatre) and even the Plantation Dinner Theatre in St. Louis. The Groundlings performed on national television on the Merv Griffin Show, on an NBC special and on the then local Regis Philbin Show. A year after the theatre opened Austin left the company due to creative and business differences. He returned in 1990, to direct the show for a while. Other Work Gary Austin was Artistic Director of The Gary Austin Workshops in Los Angeles, Seattle and Washington DC. He worked in New York at Artistic New Directions and at People's Improvisational Theatre. He wrote two solo shows, \\"Church\\" and \\"Oil,\\" and performed them coast to coast. In 2014, he released his album The Traveler which featured both songs and storytelling. His final show at The Groundlings was \\"Gary Austin in Word and Song\\" in 2016. Death Austin died of cancer in Los Angeles, California, at the age of 75. He was survived by his wife Wenndy MacKenzie and daughter Audrey Moore.

Joe Extreme is a line of military-themed toys that was sold in retail from 1995 to 1997. The toys were produced by Kenner following their acquisition by former competitor Hasbro and was intended to succeed the G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero line, which was discontinued the previous year. It was supported by a syndicated animated series that ran for two seasons and a series of comics. The line features a storyline quite similar to the A Real American Hero line. In a \\"near-future\\" continuity, a new G.I. Joe Team fights to stop a rising terrorist organization called S.K.A.R. (short for Soldiers of Khaos, Anarchy and Ruin) and their leader, a mysterious, shrewd, and incredibly powerful military leader only known as Iron Klaw. Toyline The title logo was reminiscent of the original G.I. Joe logo from the 1960s and 1970s. The 3.75\\" scale was discarded in favor of a new 5\\" scale, which allowed a greater level of detail especially in the facial and muscular features. Carded figures were released in two varieties, basic figures and deluxe figures. The deluxe versions of the figures, which were advertised as featuring \\"Ultra SLAM Firepower\\", came packaged with a backpack accessory connected to a missile launcher via a tube. The launcher shoots its missiles by lowering the plunger on the backpack. A single two-pack was also released. The vehicles and playsets were also advertised with \\"Ultra SLAM Firepower\\". The Extreme line never approached the success of the Real American Hero line and was canceled after its first wave. A second wave of figures and playsets was showcased in Toy Fair '96, but only two figures (Black Dragon and Harpoon) were given full releases. The rest, which included Mayday (the sole female Joe in the Extreme lineup), were shelved. = Carded figures = * Basic figures  Lt. Stone  Sgt.

Joe Extreme series was produced by Sunbow Entertainment (who co-produced the first G.I. Joe TV series), Graz Entertainment, inc. and Gunther-Wahl Productions, inc. and distributed by Claster Television. Set in the (at the time) \\"near future\\" of 2006, the show's main threat is a new, emerging terrorist organization called S.K.A.R. led by Iron Klaw, the former count of an eastern European country. According to the one-minute intro (which resembles a news flash), a \\"former super-power\\" has collapsed with several factions vying for control against a new global terrorist organization \\"known only as S.K.A.R.\\" whose goal is nothing less than total world domination. Iron Klaw claims: \\"We will be VICTORIOUS!\\" to which Lt. Stone replies \\"Not on MY watch!\\" followed by an introduction to the new Joe roster. The opening concludes with a news reporter giving odds of survival as \\"a million to 1\\" and Stone yelling: \\"...and that's the way we LIKE it!\\" Season 1 with a one-minute intro with all of the live-action segments during the beginning of all the episodes, Season 2 with a thirty-second intro during Friday's The Power Block. The new Joe team operates in a post-Cold War world wracked by chaos and carnage, and battling against both SKAR and independent mercenaries, who seek to further destabilize an already unstable world. Unlike the previous series, the cartoon featured a pre-credits teaser featuring a mixture of both live actors with the voices dubbed over and CGI. However, as with the previous series, the end of the episode featured new public service announcements in the same vein as the popular \\"Knowing is Half the Battle\\" PSAs.  Comics  Dark Horse Comics acquired the G.I. Joe comic license in 1996. The initial four issue mini-series, simply titled G.I. Joe (which featured the tagline \\"extreme times call for extreme heroes!\\" on the cover of each issue), was written by Mike W. Barr, with art by Tatsuya Ishida and Scott Reed. The cover to the first issue (The Hour of the Iron Claw) was done by Frank Miller, the second issue (Pawn of the Iron Klaw) by Norm Breyfogle, and issues three (The Gang's All Here) and four (The Ultimate Price) by Walter Simonson. The plot of the mini-series revealed events that occurred after the ones depicted in the television series, but also contradict them on several points, notably in that Iron Klaw is, at the very beginning, the second-in-command of the military wing of S.K.A.R. The original leader was a woman named The Duchess of M'Klavia, who wanted her royal line to regain control of her country‚Äôs government through whatever means necessary. She was assassinated by Iron Klaw, when he became more ambitious and craved for world domination. At this point, the new Joe Team included two new members, Short Fuze (unrelated to the character of the same codename from the A Real American Hero series) and Tall Sally. The mini-series led to an ongoing series following the same continuity, and beginning with a three-part story: (Red Scream: Hunted, Red Scream: Shakes Hands with Satan, Red Scream: Island Assault). The plot featured an anti- globalist group led by a woman called Red Scream, who sought to discredit (and eventually destroy) the Inter-Alliance, by using Joe impostors to commit acts of terrorism. The storyline concluded with both Red Scream's and Iron Klaw's capture. A fourth issue (All This and World War II and The Last Wild Heart: The Fourth Man) began a new story following the still-active remnants of the I.R.O.N. Army, but the comic was put on an indefinite \\"hiatus\\", and publication never resumed. Characters =G.I. Joe Team= * Mr. Clancy (voiced by Campbell Lane) - He is the Joe Team's presidential liaison and the true team leader, very much like General Flagg in the original series. He dresses in a black suit and is always wearing sunglasses, resembling the men in black. * Lt. Stone (voiced by Garry Chalk) - Field commander. After foiling an attempted kidnapping by S.K.A.R. soldiers, both he and Sgt. Savage were approached by Mr. Clancy to form a new G.I. Joe Team. * Sgt. Savage (voiced by Michael Dobson) - Master Sergeant Robert S. Savage, Jr. was the only character carried over from A Real American Hero, as he was part of the short-lived Sgt. Savage and his Screaming Eagles subline. Savage is the \\"oldest\\" member of the team; he once had a wife and child. * Ballistic/Eagle Eye (voiced by Brian Drummond) - Albert Salviatti is the team's sharp shooter. He has a strong rivalry with his former comrade-in-arms, the Silencer. He's referred to as \\"the guy who never misses\\". His codename was inexplicably changed in Season 2. * Black Dragon (voiced by Tony Lung in Season 1, Terry Klassen in season 2) - Kang Chi Lee is the Joe Team's resident ninja and martial artist. He is from Hong Kong (as revealed in \\"The Search for Clancy\\") and has a history with a crime family from that area. * Freight (voiced by Blu Mankuma) - Omar Diesel is a former professional football player and the team's demolitions expert. Freight served in the U.S. Army before becoming a football player. He left football when he heard about the reformation of the Joe Team (Crawling from the Wreckage, Winner Take All). * Harpoon (voiced by Francisco Trujillo) - Jose Montalvo is a former Navy SEAL and the team's nautical expert (Dawn's Oily Light). He provides comic relief for the G.I. Joe team. * Mayday (voiced by Randall Carpenter) - Mayday is the lone female of the reformed Joe Team. She is an aggressive and determined skilled fighter and pilot. * Metalhead (voiced by Matt Hill) - Matthew Hurley is the team's communications and computer expert and hacker. He was the first person recruited to join the new Joe Team (as seen in \\"Summoning of Heroes\\"). He is unrelated to the Iron Grenadier member who was introduced in A Real American Hero line. * Quick Stryke (voiced by Blu Mankuma) - A former S.K.A.R. operative who defected to the Joe Team after the death of his brother Jonathan (Point of Honor). * Red McKnox (voiced by Dale Wilson) - A scientist of Scottish descent who designed most of the equipment used by the Joe Team. * Tracker - Tracker is an expert tracker recruited by Stone, in order to find Clancy. Tracker possesses extra- sensory perception (as seen in \\"The Search for Clancy\\").  Lakota - Tracker's trained wolf. * Short-Fuze - A member of the Joe Team, appearing only in the comic series. He is an expert in demolitions, unrelated to the original one from A Real American Hero series. * Tall Sally - A second female character appearing only in the comic series. \\"Sally\\" is a nickname short for Salindra. =S.K.A.R.= * Iron Klaw (voiced by Richard Newman) - The leader of the military wing of S.K.A.R. He has a fascination and deep respect for Genghis Khan (as seen in Relics, Rebellion, and The Search for Clancy). Iron Klaw operates under the alias of Count von Rani, the ruler of a small Eastern European nation called Kalistan. * Steel Raven (voiced by Elizabeth Carol Savenkoff) - Iron Klaw's right-hand woman, Steel Raven becomes the main instrument of his will by the second season of the TV show. * Inferno (voiced by Ian James Corlett) - Kidwell Pyre served Iron Klaw throughout the first season of the television series. Inferno grew up as the adopted son of a poor single mother who worked as a maid while his two brothers Miles and Fredwick bullied him at an early age. Refers to flamethrower arms as his \\"Toys\\" and talks with a hissing voice. * Wreckage (voiced by Dale Wilson) - He was once a soldier named Eric Alexander who fought alongside Freight in the American military. Wreckage was experimented upon in an early attempt by Iron Klaw to create a cybernetic super-soldier when he was captured during a major military conflict in South America (s seen in Crawling from the Wreckage). The experiments made Wreckage extremely strong and resilient, but prone to fits of rage. * Rampage (voiced by Colin Murdock) - J. Remington III is an arms manufacturer who operates legitimate business fronts and black market deals. Rampage is S.K.A.R.'s primary weapon supplier. However, he seeks to eliminate Iron Klaw and seize control of the organization. Rampage possesses the ability to transform into a grotesque devilish green-skinned creature (as seen in Crawling from the Wreckage and Extend a Helping Klaw). In addition when he's in battle, he also wears high-tech armor with guns on it that often vary from a chain-gun to a rocket launcher. * Duchess of Mklavia - The former leader of the military wing of S.K.A.R., the Duchess appears only in the first comic series. Iron Klaw assassinated her to replace her as head of both Kalistan and S.K.A.R. * S.K.A.R. Soldiers - The robotic foot soldiers of S.K.A.R. =Non- Aligned characters= * The Silencer (voiced by David Kaye) - Although not technically a member of S.K.A.R., the Silencer is often found in their employ. He is a freelance mercenary known for his marksmanship. The Silencer used to be a member of the U.S. Special Forces serving with Ballistic (Eagle Eye). However, he was court-martialed and thrown out of the military. * Red Scream - Appearing only in the comic series, Red Scream is an anti-globalist terrorist who sought to destroy the Inter-Alliance by discrediting the Joe Team through the use of imposters. Her identity was later revealed to be Commander Roston, an American military officer with access to the Joe Team's files. Voices * Randall Carpenter - Mayday * Garry Chalk - Lt.

The program was launched in November 2001 with seven initial participants, all large U.S. companies. As of December 1, 2014, the program had 10,854 members. The 4,315 importers in the program account for approximately 54% of the value of all merchandise imported into the U.S. Companies who achieve C-TPAT certification must have a documented process for determining and alleviating risk throughout their international supply chain. This allows companies to be considered low risk, resulting in expedited processing of their cargo, including fewer customs examinations. Companies eligible to become CTPAT Certified * US importers of record * US Exporters * US/Canada and US/Mexico cross-border highway carriers * Mexico long-haul highway carriers * Rail carriers * Sea carriers * Air carriers * US marine port authority and terminal operators * Consolidators (US air freight consolidators, ocean transportation intermediaries and non-vessel operating common carriers) * Mexican manufacturers * Canadian manufacturers * Certain invited foreign manufacturers * Licensed US customs brokers * Third-party logistics providers * Customs House Agent(CHA)providers C-TPAT partner benefits According to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the benefits of participating in C-TPAT could include: * Playing an active role in the war against terrorism and good corporate citizenship * A reduced number of CBP inspections * Priority processing (front-of-line) for CBP inspections * Eligibility to attend C-TPAT training seminars * Prerequisite for participation in the importer self-assessment program * Penalty mitigation under certain circumstances * Assigned security consultant, a supply-chain security specialist * Tier III importers allowed block designation application to DHS SAFETY Act * Exporters who allow CBP to share information with other customs agencies gain reduced inspections upon arrival in those countries (see below list) Using the right technology, the processes of supplier data collection, organization, and risk analysis can be done easily, without requiring large investments into IT infrastructure or resources. The primary goal of the C-TPAT program is not to add more work for the importer or the companies participating, but to help improve the security of all global supply chains. U.S. Senators Susan Collins and Patty Murray have introduced a bill in Congress, the GreenLane Maritime Cargo Security Act, which would enhance these potential benefits for companies at the highest level of security within C-TPAT. CTPAT mutual recognition Mutual recognition (MR) refers to those activities relates with the signing of a document between foreign customs administration that allows an exchange of information aiming to improve supply-chain security. The signed document, or MR, indicates that security requirements or standards of the foreign partnership program, as well as its validation procedures are similar. The essential concept of a mutual recognition agreement (MRA) is that CTPAT and the foreign program are compatible in both theory and practice so that one program will recognize the validation findings of the other program. The following programs have mutual recognition with CTPAT: *New Zealand Customs Service ‚Äì Secure Export Scheme Program (SES) ‚Äì June 2007 *Canada Border Services Agency ‚Äì Partners in Protection Program (PIP) ‚Äì June 2008 *Jordan Customs Department ‚Äì Golden List Program (GLP) ‚Äì June 2007 *Japan Customs and Tariff Bureau ‚Äì Authorized Economic Operator Program (AEO) ‚Äì June 2009 *Korean Customs Service ‚Äì AEO Program ‚Äì June 2010 *European Union ‚Äì AEO Program ‚Äì May 2012 *Taiwan ‚Äì General of Customs, Taiwan Ministry of Finance‚Äôs ‚Äì AEO Program.* ‚Äì November 2012 *Israel ‚Äì June 2014 *Mexico ‚Äì October 2014 *Singapore ‚Äì December 2014 *Peru ‚Äì 2018 * *Note: This MRA is signed between the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT) and the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office (TECRO) in the United States. C-TPAT and Taiwan AEO are the designated parties responsible for implementing the MRA. Through this initiative, CBP is asking businesses to ensure the integrity of their security practices and communicate and verify the security guidelines of their business partners within the supply chain. Trusted Trader Program When customs administrations offer tangible to businesses that meet minimum security standards and follow best practices, those businesses are known as ‚Äútrusted traders.‚Äù This concept is internationally accepted and is entrenched in protocols such as the World Customs Organization SAFE Framework of Standards. In North America, both CBP agency and the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) offer ‚Äútrusted trader‚Äù programs, CBP‚Äôs Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (CTPAT) and the CBSA‚Äôs Partners In Protection (PIP) programs as well as the bi-national Free And Secure Trade (FAST) program. Efforts are underway to Harmonize the application process and the administration of such partner accounts. In the US, CBP and the trade have been collaborating for some time to create a design for a holistic, integrated Trusted Trader Program that includes both security and compliance requirements. This approach will enable CBP to provide additional incentives to participating low risk partners, while benefiting from additional efficiencies of managing both supply chain security (CTPAT) and compliance (ISA) in one partnership program.

North Carolina Aquatic biomonitoring is the science of inferring the ecological condition of rivers, lakes, streams, and wetlands by examining the organisms that live there. While aquatic biomonitoring is the most common form of biomonitoring, any ecosystem can be studied in this manner. Approaches and study organisms Population and species surveying using electrofishing equipment Biomonitoring typically takes different approaches: * Bioassays, where test organisms are exposed to an environment to see if mutations or deaths occur. Typical organisms used in bioassays are fish, water fleas (Daphnia), and frogs. * Community assessments, also called biosurveys, where an entire community of organisms is sampled to see what types of taxa remain. In aquatic ecosystems, these assessments often focus on invertebrates, algae, macrophytes (aquatic plants), fish, or amphibians. Rarely, other large vertebrates (reptiles, birds, and mammals) may be considered as well. * Online biomonitoring devices, using the ability of animals to permanently taste their environment. Different types of animals are used for this purpose either in the lab or in the field. The study of the opening and closing activity of clams' valves is an example of one possible way to monitor in-situ the quality of fresh and coastal waters. Aquatic invertebrates have the longest history of use in biomonitoring programs. In typical unpolluted temperate streams of Europe and North America, certain insect taxa predominate. Mayflies (Ephemeroptera), caddisflies (Trichoptera), and stoneflies (Plecoptera) are the most common insects in these undisturbed streams. In contrast, in rivers disturbed by urbanization, agriculture, forestry, and other perturbations, flies (Diptera), and especially midges (family Chironomidae) predominate. Aquatic invertebrates are responsive to climate change.Lawrence, J.E., K.B. Lunde, R.D. Mazor, L.A. B√™che, E.P. McElravy, and V.H. Resh. 2010. \\"Long-Term Macroinvertebrate Responses to Climate Change: Implications for Biological Assessment in Mediterranean- Climate Streams.\\" Journal of the North American Benthological Society 29: 1424-1440.  Importance Aquatic biomonitoring is important in assessing marine life forms and their ecosystems. Monitoring aquatic life, from which life on land evolved, can also be beneficial in understanding land ecosystems. Aquatic biomonitoring can reveal the overall health and status of the environment, can detect environmental trends and how different stressors will affect those trends, and can interpret the effect that various environmental activities will have on the overall health of the environment. Pollution and general stresses to aquatic life can have a major impact on the environment. The main sources of pollution to oceans, rivers, and lakes are sewage, oil spills, land runoff, littering, ocean mining, and nuclear waste. Pollution greatly upsets marine life and can endanger species that live in or close to water. Because many aquatic animals serve as a main food source for many land animals, when aquatic species are affected, it causes a ripple effect in land species. Biomonitoring can help mitigate such problems through monitoring all forms of life and conditions in different bodies of water, both fresh and salt water. A challenge in aquatic biomonitoring is to simplify data and make data easier for all to understand, especially investigators in the health and environmental fields.  Practice  Methods employed in aquatic biomonitoring are: * monitoring and assessing aquatic species and ecosystems, * monitoring the behavior of certain aquatic species and assessing any changes in species behavior, and * looking at contaminants in the water and their effect on marine life. Water quality is graded both on appearance‚Äîfor example: clear, cloudy, full of algae‚Äîand on its chemistry levels. Determining levels of enzymes and minerals found in water is extremely important. Changes in these factors can change the overall aquatic environment and can severely impact aquatic life. Some contaminants, such as metals and certain organic wastes, can be lethal to individual creatures and could thereby ultimately lead to extinction of certain species. This could affect both aquatic and land ecosystems and cause disruption in other biomes and ecosystems.

In the game, a single player drives a car along a race track, viewed from above, avoiding walls of pylons and trying to pass as many checkpoints as possible before time runs out. The game is controlled with a steering wheel, accelerator and brake pedals, and a gear stick, and the car crashes and spins if it hits a pylon. Gran Trak 10 began development in late 1973; it was initially designed by Larry Emmons of Cyan, with the mechanical design handled by Eigen Systems, though after several design and production problems were uncovered during an initial small production run in March 1974 the design was overhauled by Allan Alcorn, the designer of Pong, with wider distribution beginning in May. The game's circuits include possibly the first instance of integrated circuit-based read- only memory (ROM), which thereafter became the standard for arcade games, replacing diode-stored graphics. Gran Trak 10 was developed during a time of several internal changes at Atari; as a result communication problems led Atari to not accurately track the expense of manufacturing the game. It was initially sold to distributors for a net loss of US$100 per cabinet; although this flaw was fixed it contributed to a total loss of $500,000 for the company that fiscal year, placing Atari in financial difficulties. The game itself was successful, and led to several versions of the game being produced in 1974 by Atari and its subsidiary Kee Games, including a smaller cabinet version titled Trak 10 and a two-player version titled Gran Trak 20, as well as numerous later racing games. Gran Trak 10 was the first arcade car racing game, though Atari had released the drag racing game Space Race in 1973, and a simple racing game, Wipeout, was included with the 1972 Magnavox Odyssey console. Gameplay Gran Trak 10 is a single-player racing video game in which the player drives a race car along a race track, shown from above. The player controls the car with a steering wheel, accelerator and brake pedals, and gear stick, as in a real car. The gear shifting requires the player to shift between reverse, first, second, and third gears as needed, but the pedals are digital controls rather than analog, so the player cannot control his speed by applying differing levels of pressure. The steering wheel turns the car only while it is being turned, rather than having a neutral \\"straight\\" position. Braking does not stop the car instantly and turning while braking will cause the car to skid. The course is defined on the screen by walls of white dots representing pylons, which if hit stop the car and spin it. There is only a single track layout. The track contains one black path representing an oil slick, which prevents the player's car from turning. At the top of the screen are two numbers; the number on the right is the remaining time in the game, starting at 78 and counting down by 2s, while the number on the left is the number of checkpoints the player has passed, and counts up by 2s. The time per game, though the counter always starts at 78, is by default 105 seconds and is adjustable by the game operator; changing the time adjusts both the speed of the counter and how long a player spends crashed after hitting a pylon. A switch on the internal circuit board can turn off crashes entirely, while another allows for two games to be played for a quarter rather than one. A placard on the front of the game gives suggested ratings for the score in a given game, from \\"License Revoked\\" for 10 or fewer points to \\"Real Pro\\" for greater than 40; the operator's manual suggests changing or removing this card if the time per game is adjusted. Development A Gran Trak 10 cabinet where time has run out at 8 points. In late 1973, Atari began work on a driving game, an idea founder Nolan Bushnell had wanted to do since the company was initially founded in June 1972 before it was shelved in favor of Pong. The design work itself was handled by Cyan Engineering, which had recently become a semi-independent research and development subsidiary of Atari and had previously handled the prototype design of Gotcha. Larry Emmons developed the circuits to control the car itself in the game, creating the feel of braking, acceleration, and movement. Emmons also used integrated circuit-based memory‚Äîspecifically, mask ROM (read-only memory)‚Äî in his circuit design to store graphical data such as the tracks, rather than the diode arrays that previous arcade games used. This is believed to be the first use of integrated circuit-based memory in an arcade game, and ROMs thereafter became the standard for arcade and console video games. The mechanical designs for the game, including the steering wheel, pedal, and gear shift controllers, were developed by Eigen Systems, located in the same building as Cyan and founded by ex-coworkers of the Cyan founders Emmons and Steven Mayer. At one point, the game's design included a small printer that would print high scores when achieved, but this was removed prior to the final design. Allan Alcorn, the designer of Pong, took a leave of absence from the company beginning in September 1973, and around the same time Steve Bristow, who had previously worked with the founders of Atari on the first arcade video game Computer Space, left to co-found Kee Games. This in turn left Lloyd Warman, new to the company, as the head of engineering for Atari during Gran Traks development. Alcorn and Emmons have stated that they believed Warman was a good engineer but a poor project manager, which led to the Gran Trak project running behind schedule and having several design problems. This was exacerbated by a new short-lived Atari management team and product development structure, which led to several communication problems and cost overruns. When Atari began production in early 1974, it had difficulties getting enough circuits to build the cabinets from National Semiconductor, who cited a \\"hybrid\\" integrated circuit design by Emmons as non-standard, first refusing to sell them to Atari and then producing only small production runs. According to Alcorn, the non- standard design was a tactic to prevent competitors from copying the design, as other manufacturers would be unable to produce it at all. A short run of Gran Trak systems was produced in March 1974 and revealed other design problems, such as the steering controls; in their prototype system, Eigen used a real car steering wheel and pedals, but the production run used different parts. Alcorn returned to Cyan that month and redesigned the game to fix the flaws and use more standard parts; the copying protection scheme was changed to use a custom-designed integrated circuit that was named the same as a standard Texas Instruments integrated circuit. Alcorn later stated in an interview that neither Warman nor Emmons understood the challenges in converting a prototype design to a product that could be manufactured. The game entered production soon after, and Atari announced it was shipping a full production run in May 1974. Although the design flaws were fixed, the communication problems during development led to one final problem with the game: Atari was unclear on the actual cost of producing the game. As a result, a single Gran Trak game ended up costing US$1,095 to manufacture, while Atari was selling them to distributors for only $995, losing $100 per sale. Atari soon corrected the problem, but ended the fiscal year with a large loss due in part to the financial failure of the game. Legacy Atari reported a loss of $500,000 for the 1974 fiscal year, roughly as much as the previous year's profits, with Gran Trak as one of the major causes. This led Atari into deep financial problems, leaving part of Gran Traks legacy being \\"the game that nearly put Atari out of business\\". In September 1974, Atari announced plans to merge with its subsidiary Kee Games; Kee's final game Tank, released in November 1974, was a commercial success, however, and is credited with buoying the finances of the newly merged Atari at a critical time for the company. The Gran Trak 10 game itself, after its problems were resolved, was considered a success, and Atari released multiple versions of it: a clone version titled Formula K was released through Kee Games for different distributors around July 1974, and Atari produced a small cabinet version in late in the year titled Trak 10. According to Ralph H. Baer, Formula K sold 6,000 units. A two- player version titled Gran Trak 20 was released in August, along with its own clone version from Kee Games titled Twin Racer and its own small cabinet version, Trak 20. Baer estimates that Gran Trak 20 sold 4,500 units. Atari produced numerous other racing arcade games in the same style as Gran Trak, including Le Mans (1976), Sprint 2 (1976), Super Sprint (1986), and Badlands (1989). Gran Trak 10 was the first arcade car racing video game and the first game to use a steering wheel, and is known as the \\"grandfather of car-based racing games\\", though a simple racing game, Wipeout, had been released in 1972 for the Magnavox Odyssey home video game console and a spaceship drag racing arcade game, Space Race, had been released by Atari in 1973.

The term is not commonly used by experts, dietitians and nutrition scientists, many of whom dispute that particular foods have the health benefits claimed by their advocates. Even without scientific evidence of exceptional nutrient content, many new, exotic, and foreign fruits or ancient grains are marketed under the term - or superfruit or supergrain respectively - after being introduced or re- introduced to Western markets. In 2007, the marketing of products as \\"superfoods\\" was prohibited in the European Union unless accompanied by a specific authorized health claim supported by credible scientific research. Definition and use of the term The term has no official definition by regulatory authorities in major consumer markets, such as the United States Food and Drug Administration and Department of Agriculture or the European Food Safety Authority. It appears to have been first used in a Canadian newspaper in 1949 when referring to the supposed nutritional qualities of a muffin. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, the term \\"superfood\\" was used as a marketing tool for selling specific foods, dietary supplements, foods with selected food additives, and self-help books about fad diets, promising an enhancement to health. \\"Superfood\\" products were sold at a higher price than similar foods not marketed with the label. The purported health benefits and effects of foods described as superfoods are unsupported or disputed by scientific studies. , the marketing of products as superfoods was prohibited in the European Union unless accompanied by a specific authorized health claim supported by credible scientific research. The ruling was a marketing guide issued to manufacturers to assure scientific proof or evidence why a food would be labeled as extra healthy or classified as a superfood. The European Food Information Council stated that it was impractical for people to have a diet based only on superfoods when nutrients are provided readily from a diet based on a diversity of foods, especially a diet including fruits and vegetables. According to Cancer Research UK, \\"the term 'superfood' is really just a marketing tool, with little scientific basis to it\\". Although superfoods are often promoted as preventing or curing diseases, including cancer, Cancer Research UK cautioned that they \\"cannot substitute for a generally healthy and balanced diet\\". According to Catherine Collins, chief dietitian at St George's Hospital in London, the term can be harmful: \\"There are so many wrong ideas about superfoods that I don't know where best to begin to dismantle the whole concept.\\" Commonly cited as a superfood, blueberries actually provide moderate levels of nutrients compared to many vegetables and other fruits. Superfruits are a subset of superfoods as first used in 2004. The designation of a fruit as a superfruit is entirely up to the product manufacturer, as the term is primarily used to create consumer demand. Examples The Dutch food safety organization Voedingscentrum ('Nutrition Centre') noted that the health claims marketers used to sell goji berry, hemp seed, chia seed, and wheatgrass were not scientifically proven. The organization warned that people who consumed such foods in large quantities may develop an \\"impaired, one-sided diet\\". Berries remain under research and do not have evidence of providing any health benefits different from other fresh fruits. Specifically, blueberries are not especially nutrient dense (a superfood characteristic); they have moderate content of only three essential nutrients: vitamin C, vitamin K, and manganese. History and economics In 2007, the superfoods category was forecast to become a billion-dollar global industry by 2011, with several thousand new superfruit products expected to enter the marketplace. According to Datamonitor, superfruit product launches grew at a rate of 67% (2007‚Äì2008), but underwent significant category erosion beginning in 2011, when introductions of food and nonfood products featuring pomegranate, a√ßa√≠ or goji declined by 56% (2011‚Äì2012 vs. 2009‚Äì2010). More than a dozen industry publications on functional foods and beverages have referred to various exotic species as superfruits, with estimates for some 10,000 new product introductions in 2007‚Äì2008. Relatively rare fruits originating from Oceania (noni), China (goji, seabuckthorn), Southeast Asia (mangosteen), or tropical South America (a√ßa√≠) and unknown to American consumers were among the first wave of superfruits successfully used in product manufacturing from 2005 to 2010, but their popularity declined from 2010 to 2013. However, consumer interest in new products using pomegranate remained constant during that time. The company Tahitian Noni began selling noni juice in 1996 and achieved billions of dollars in sales during their first 10 years. Earlier reports showed pomegranate-based products grew nearly 400% over 2005‚Äì2007 from new product launches, a gain that exceeded the previous 6 years. Similarly, sales of XanGo, a multiple-fruit juice containing mangosteen juice, grew from $40 million in 2002 to $200 million in 2005. Manufacturers may use some fruits to enhance the flavor of food products in an attempt to mask other tastes or provide impressions of novelty and health. Five thousand new products were introduced in 2005 based on berries alone. The superfruit category was one of the top 10 global trends in consumer products in 2008. By 2013, however, innovation in superfruit products appeared to be in decline, with fewer new introductions to the category. Over the years 2011 to 2015, the number of food or beverage products containing the words \\"superfood\\", \\"superfruit\\" or \\"supergrain\\" doubled. Grains such as quinoa, barley, spelt, and millet are marketed as \\"heritage\\" or \\"ancient\\" superfoods because they have been consumed over centuries, are perceived as a whole food, and require minimal processing.

Her accomplishments include six Primetime Emmy Award nominations, two Screen Actors Guild Awards, and two Critics' Choice Awards for Best Supporting Actress in a Drama Series. A 2010 poll of female readers taken by Esquire magazine named her \\"the sexiest woman in the world,\\" and voted as Best Looking Woman in America the same year. Born in Tennessee, Hendricks was raised in Portland, Oregon and Twin Falls, Idaho, where she became active in local theater. After completing high school in Virginia, Hendricks relocated to New York City and pursued a career as a model following her entry into a Seventeen cover contest. She continued to work internationally as a model for over a decade before transitioning into acting. Hendricks had recurring roles in several television series, including Beggars and Choosers (2001‚Äì2002) and Kevin Hill (2004‚Äì2005) before being cast as Joan Holloway on the AMC period drama series Mad Men in 2007, of which she remained a main cast member until the series' conclusion in 2015. She received critical acclaim for her role on the series, including six Emmy Award nominations and multiple Screen Actors Guild Awards for Best Ensemble. While starring on Mad Men, Hendricks also began appearing in films, receiving critical notice for her performance in Nicolas Winding Refn's thriller Drive (2011), Sally Potter's drama Ginger & Rosa (2012), and Ryan Gosling's neo-noir fantasy Lost River (2014). Following the conclusion of Mad Men, Hendricks starred in the comedy series Another Period from 2015 to 2016, and in the SundanceTV drama series Hap and Leonard (2016). She reunited with Refn for a supporting role in his thriller film The Neon Demon (2016), followed by roles in the comedy Fist Fight (2017), the horror film The Strangers: Prey at Night (2018), and the animated comedy Toy Story 4 (2019). She returned to television with starring roles on the crime drama series Tin Star (2017‚Äìpresent) and on the NBC comedy-crime series Good Girls (2018‚Äìpresent). Early life Hendricks was born May 3, 1975, in Knoxville, Tennessee, the second child of Jackie Sue Hendricks (n√©e Raymond), a psychologist, and Robert Hendricks, a Forest Service employee originally from Birmingham, England. Through her father, she has dual British and American citizenship. Hendricks has one older brother. Though born in Tennessee, Hendricks's family relocated frequently due to her father's Forest Service job, first to Georgia when she was two months old, and subsequently to Portland, Oregon, where Hendricks attended elementary school. When she was nine years old, the family left Portland, relocating to Twin Falls, Idaho, where Hendricks completed elementary and middle school. Hendricks described her family as \\"outdoorsy\\", relating that she, her brother, and parents frequently went on camping trips in the Pacific Northwest. Hendricks' mother encouraged her and her brother to join a local theater group in Twin Falls as a way of making friends, and Hendricks appeared in a production of Grease. \\"I had all these amazing friends through the theatre company,‚Äù she recalled. ‚ÄúAnd it was a community that really respected theatre. The kids would put on a play and the entire town would show. And you were cool if you were an actor.‚Äù Hendricks, a natural blonde, began coloring her hair red at age 10, inspired by the book Anne of Green Gables. When Hendricks was a teenager, her father's job necessitated the family move near Washington, D.C., so the family settled in Fairfax, Virginia. Hendricks described the move from Idaho to Virginia as \\"traumatic\\" for her, and she was frequently bullied while attending Fairfax High School. Hendricks described herself as an \\"outcast\\" and a \\"goth\\", and found companionship in the school's drama department, where she appeared in plays. In addition to theater, Hendricks also studied ballet throughout her teenage years. She left Fairfax High School during her senior year and completed her studies at a local community college. Career =1994‚Äì2006: Modeling career and early acting= After high school, Hendricks worked as a receptionist and shampoo girl at a salon before entering a competition to appear on the cover of Seventeen magazine. This resulted in her signing with IMG Models, after which she moved to New York City at age 18, forgoing her pre-acceptance into Virginia Commonwealth University's drama school. Hendricks began modeling in New York, London, and Japan between the ages of 18 and 27 before transitioning into appearing in commercials. Hendricks lived in London for around a year during this period, residing with two friends who were working there as teachers. In her early twenties, Hendricks relocated with her mother and brother to Los Angeles, California. Initially, Hendricks pursued a career working in the administrative sector of the music business, but was dissuaded by friends, and instead continued working as a model before auditioning for acting roles. She appeared in commercials for Carl's Jr. and Dr. Pepper, and also starred in the music video for Everclear's \\"One Hit Wonder\\" (1997). She appeared as the hand model in the poster for the film American Beauty. Hendricks in 2005 She made her television debut in the MTV anthology series Undressed. Her first starring role was as an intern on Beggars and Choosers, a Showtime comedy series focused on a group of young professionals. The series filmed in Vancouver, and ran from 1999 to 2001. During this time, she also had a guest role on the series Angel in 2000. Hendricks subsequently appeared in the television film The Big Time (2002), and had recurring guest roles on ER (2002), The Court (2003), and Firefly (2002‚Äì2003). After a guest appearance on Tru Calling, Hendricks was cast as Nicolette Ray in the UPN legal drama Kevin Hill, which aired during the 2004‚Äì05 television season. =2007‚Äì2015: Mad Men= She played Joan Holloway on the AMC series Mad Men as the office manager of advertising agency Sterling Cooper & Partners, providing mentoring to a group of women who must deal with the come-ons and callousness of professional advertising executives. Her performance has received critical praise, resulting in six Primetime Emmy nominations for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series over the course of its seven seasons.¬∞ Also in 2007, Hendricks made her feature film debut in La Cucina, a drama film that premiered on Showtime in December 2009, and which stars Hendricks as a writer. The same year, she starred in the thriller film South of Pico, and appeared in four episodes of the NBC series Life (2007‚Äì2008) in the recurring role of Olivia, detective Charlie Crews' soon-to-be stepmother and Ted Earley's love interest. On October 11, 2009, Hendricks married actor Geoffrey Arend. In 2010, she appeared in the musical video for The Ghost Inside on \\"Broken Bells (album)\\" by Broken Bells. She appeared in a supporting role in the action-thriller Drive (2011), directed by Nicolas Winding Refn, alongside Carey Mulligan and Ryan Gosling. The following year, she was cast in a supporting role in Sally Potter's drama film Ginger & Rosa, playing the countercultural mother of a teenager growing up in the 1960s. In 2011, Hendricks appeared onstage in a production of Stephen Sondheim's Company at the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts opposite Martha Plimpton and Stephen Colbert. Hendricks also lent her voice and likeness in the 2011 racing video game Need for Speed: The Run, playing the role of Sam Harper opposite Sean Faris. In 2014, she played the lead character in Gosling's directorial debut Lost River, a fantasy film set in Detroit. The film received mixed reviews. The following year, she starred in the novel adaptation Dark Places (2015) opposite Charlize Theron. After the conclusion of Mad Men in 2015, Hendricks starred as a prostitute in two seasons of the Comedy Central series Another Period (2015‚Äì2016), set during the early 20th century. =2016‚Äìpresent: Subsequent acting roles and Good Girls= In 2016, she appeared as one of the leads in Refn's thriller film The Neon Demon, portraying a modeling agent. Critical response to the film was polarized, though the French film magazine Cahiers du cin√©ma named it the third-best film of 2016. The same year, she starred in six episodes of the series Hap and Leonard, playing the ex-wife of investigator Hap Collins. In 2018, she was seen in home-invasion based horror film The Strangers: Prey at Night, playing the matriarch of a family under siege by killers. Upon release, the film received generally unfavorable reviews from critics, though The Guardians Benjamin Lee praised Hendricks' performance. It was a commercial success, however, grossing $30 million. In 2018, Hendricks returned to television in the Amazon Prime series The Romanoffs, reuniting with Mad Men creator Matthew Weiner. She was cast as one of the leads on the NBC comedy crime series Good Girls, playing a woman who attempts to gain financial control of her life by holding up a grocery store. The show was renewed for a fourth season in 2020. In late 2018, Hendricks starred opposite Sienna Miller in the drama American Woman, portraying a woman helping her sister raise her family in rural Pennsylvania. She also supplied the voice of Gabby Gabby, the main antivillain in the Disney/Pixar animated sequel Toy Story 4 (2019). In October 2019, it was announced that Hendricks and husband Geoffrey Arend had separated after 10 years of marriage. In 2020, Hendricks voices Officer Jaffe in the Scooby-Doo film Scoob!.  Public image  Hendricks launches a Spectacle Wearer of the Year competition at The Star in Sydney, Australia, 2012. Hendricks has been credited as having an ideal shape for a woman by British Equalities Minister Lynne Featherstone who praised Hendricks' hourglass figure, saying \\"Christina Hendricks is absolutely fabulous... We need more of these role models. There is such a sensation when there is a curvy role model. It shouldn't be so unusual.\\" Los Angeles Times television critic Mary McNamara says her portrayal of Joan has revolutionized perceptions of beauty on television. She has been called the \\"new modern ideal of Hollywood glamour‚Äîfull figured, voluptuous; a throwback to the days of Marilyn Monroe, Jane Russell and Veronica Lake\\". British designer Vivienne Westwood selected Hendricks to represent her \\"Get A Life\\" Palladium jewelry collection in March 2011. A study by the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons attributed a 10% rise in 2010 of the number of British women receiving breast augmentation surgery in part to Hendricks' influence. Hendricks has moved away from accepting the term \\"full- figured\\" and once lambasted a reporter who used the term while interviewing her. Hendricks commented in September 2010 that the media is too focused on women's bodies and not their actual talents. \\"I was working my butt off on the show [Mad Men] and then all anyone was talking about was my body.\\" Filmography  Accolades   References  Sources *  External links   Category:1975 births Category:20th-century American actresses Category:21st-century American actresses Category:Actresses from Idaho Category:Actresses from Tennessee Category:Actresses from Virginia Category:Actresses of British descent Category:American film actresses Category:American people of English descent Category:American television actresses Category:American voice actresses Category:Living people Category:Actors from Fairfax, Virginia Category:Actresses from Portland, Oregon Category:People from Knoxville, Tennessee Category:People from Twin Falls, Idaho ","title":"Christina Hendricks"},{"id":"3426210","text":"Arms of Sir William Fitzalan, 11th Earl of Arundel, KG William Fitzalan, 11th Earl of Arundel, 8th Baron Maltravers KG (147623 January 1544) was an English peer, styled as Lord Maltravers from 1487 to 1524.

The law established the National Museum of the American Indian as part of the Smithsonian Institution. The law also required the Secretary of the Smithsonian to prepare an inventory of all Indian and Native Hawaiian human remains and funerary objects in Smithsonian collections, as well as expeditiously return these items upon the request of culturally affiliated federally recognized Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations. The Smithsonian Institution The NMAI expands the Smithsonian Institution by authorizing erection of a new museum on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. to house Native American artifacts from the Heye Foundation's Museum of the American Indian. As part of a legal compromise regarding the Heye Foundation's New York state charter, the George Gustav Heye Center of the National Museum of the American Indian was also created by the NMAI in the Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House in New York City. The purpose of the NMAI is threefold: *To advance the study of Native Americans *To collect, preserve, and exhibit Native American objects *To provide for Native American research and study programs Inventory and return Prior to enactment of the NMAI, representatives of the Native American Rights Fund and the Association for Native American Affairs told Congressional staffers that they would oppose the bill if repatriation provisions were not included. At an August, 1989, meeting in Santa Fe, NM, Secretary of the Smithsonian Robert McCormick Adams, Jr., agreed that the Smithsonian would abide by new repatriation provisions.McKeown, C.T., In the Smaller Scope of Conscience: the Struggle for National Repatriation Legislation, 1986-1990 (2012) University of Arizona Press . As a result of the law, the Secretary of the Smithsonian is required to inventory Indian and Native Hawaiian human remains and funerary objects in the possession or control of the Smithsonian Institution and return them upon request by a descendant or culturally affiliated Indian tribe or Native Hawaiian organization. These items are housed primarily in the National Museum of Natural History, National Museum of the American Indian, and National Museum of American History. The Smithsonian had amassed a huge collection of Native American items including: *4,000 Native American remains collected under an 1867 order by the Surgeon General of the United States Army to Army medical officers to send skeletal remains of Native Americans to the Army Medical Museum. These remains were transferred to the Smithsonian Institution beginning in 1898. *Another 14,000 Native American remains were obtained through archaeological excavations, individual donations, and museum donations. *The acquisition of the Heye Foundation's collections added 800,000 artifacts to the Smithsonian's Native American collections. Return criteria The 1989 act applied only to the return of Indian and Native Hawaiian human remains and funerary objects. The NMAI was amended in 1996 to include additional categories derived from the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act enacted in 1990, with similar definitions: *Human remains *Associated funerary objects *Unassociated funerary objects *Sacred objects *Objects of cultural patrimony The 1996 amendment also established specific deadlines for the Smithsonian to complete its summary and inventory tasks. The National Museum of Natural History posted summaries of its cultural affiliation case reports on its website. By 2007, the remains of 18,568 individuals had been identified. Of these, remains representing 5,435 individuals (29%) had been offered for repatriation to lineal descendants or culturally affiliated Indian tribes or Native Hawaiian organizations. By 1996, the National Museum of the American Indian had identified the remains of 524 individuals in its collection, of which 227 (41%) had already been repatriated.McKeown, C.T., Repatriation, Handbook of North American Indians, volume 2, 2008. GAO Report on Repatriation In 2011, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) completed a study of the extent to which the Smithsonian had fulfilled the repatriation requirements of the NMAI Act.Government Accountability Office, Smithsonian Institution: Much Work Still Needed to Identify and Repatriate Indian Human Remains and Objects, GAO-11-505 (May 2011) The GAO found that while the Smithsonian had inventoried, identified, and returned thousands of Indian human remains, at the current pace it may take decades more for it to complete the process. The GAO suggested that Congress consider ways to expedite the process including, but not limited to, directing the Smithsonian to make cultural affiliation determinations as efficiently and effectively as possible. The GAO also recommended certain administrative changes to enhance oversight of the process.

The amortization repayment model factors varying amounts of both interest and principal into every installment, though the total amount of each payment is the same. An amortization schedule calculator is often used to adjust the loan amount until the monthly payments will fit comfortably into budget, and can vary the interest rate to see the difference a better rate might make in the kind of home or car one can afford. An amortization calculator can also reveal the exact dollar amount that goes towards interest and the exact dollar amount that goes towards principal out of each individual payment. The amortization schedule is a table delineating these figures across the duration of the loan in chronological order. The formula The calculation used to arrive at the periodic payment amount assumes that the first payment is not due on the first day of the loan, but rather one full payment period into the loan. While normally used to solve for A, (the payment, given the terms) it can be used to solve for any single variable in the equation provided that all other variables are known. One can rearrange the formula to solve for any one term, except for i, for which one can use a root-finding algorithm. The annuity formula is: A = P\\\\frac{i(1 + i)^n}{(1 + i)^n - 1} = Pi \\\\times \\\\frac{(1+i)^n}{(1+i)^n-1} \\\\times \\\\frac{(1+i)^{-n}}{(1+i)^{-n}} = \\\\frac{P \\\\times i}{1 - (1 + i)^{-n}} Or, equivalently: A = P\\\\frac{i(1 + i)^n}{(1 + i)^n - 1} = Pi \\\\times \\\\frac{(1+i)^n}{(1+i)^n-1} = Pi \\\\times \\\\frac{(1+i)^n - 1 + 1}{(1+i)^n-1} = Pi \\\\times (\\\\frac{(1+i)^n - 1}{(1+i)^n-1} + \\\\frac{1}{(1+i)^n-1}) = P\\\\left(i + \\\\frac{i} {(1 + i)^n - 1}\\\\right) Where: * A = periodic payment amount * P = amount of principal, net of initial payments, meaning \\"subtract any down-payments\\" * i = periodic interest rate * n = total number of payments This formula is valid if i > 0. If i = 0 then simply A = P / n. :For a 30-year loan with monthly payments, n = 30 \\\\text{ years} \\\\times 12 \\\\text{ months/year} = 360\\\\text{ months} Note that the interest rate is commonly referred to as an annual percentage rate (e.g. 8% APR), but in the above formula, since the payments are monthly, the rate i must be in terms of a monthly percent. Converting an annual interest rate (that is to say, annual percentage yield or APY) to the monthly rate is not as simple as dividing by 12; see the formula and discussion in APR. However, if the rate is stated in terms of \\"APR\\" and not \\"annual interest rate\\", then dividing by 12 is an appropriate means of determining the monthly interest rate.  Internet Tools  The online tools for calculating amortization loan let the user enter the Principal amount, rate of interest and the duration of loan. With the given inputs, tool process the calculations. Derivation of the formula The formula for the periodic payment amount A is derived as follows. For an amortization schedule, we can define a function p(t) that represents the principal amount remaining at time t. We can then derive a formula for this function given an unknown payment amount A and r = 1 + i. :\\\\;p(0) = P :\\\\;p(1) = p(0) r - A = P r - A :\\\\;p(2) = p(1) r - A = P r^2 - A r - A :\\\\;p(3) = p(2) r - A = P r^3 - A r^2 - A r - A This may be generalized to :\\\\;p(t) = P r^t - A \\\\sum_{k=0}^{t-1} r^k Applying the substitution (see geometric progressions) :\\\\;\\\\sum_{k=0}^{t-1} r^k = 1 + r + r^2 + ... + r^{t-1} = \\\\frac{r^t-1}{r-1} This results in :\\\\;p(t) = P r^t - A \\\\frac{r^t-1}{r-1} For n payment periods, we expect the principal amount will be completely paid off at the last payment period, or :\\\\;p(n) = P r^n - A \\\\frac{r^n-1}{r-1} = 0 Solving for A, we get :\\\\; A = P \\\\frac{r^n (r-1)}{r^n-1} = P \\\\frac{(i+1)^n ((i+\\\\cancel{1})-\\\\cancel{1})}{(i+1)^n-1} = P \\\\frac{i (1 + i)^n}{(1 + i)^n-1} or :\\\\frac{A}{P} = \\\\frac{i}{1 - (1+i)^{-n}} After substitution and simplification we get :\\\\frac{p(t)}{P} = 1 - \\\\frac{(1+i)^t-1}{(1+i)^n-1} = \\\\frac{(1 + i)^n - (1 + i)^t}{(1 + i)^n - 1} Other uses While often used for mortgage-related purposes, an amortization calculator can also be used to analyze other debt, including short-term loans, student loans and credit cards.

Nicknamed \\"Noli,\\" he was born in Mayumba in south-west Gabon in 1959. He is best known for his 1989 song Bane, which was popularized by Radio Africa N.1 and Gilles Obringer. Career N'Goma was first exposed to music by his father, a teacher and harmonium player. Although he took his first music lessons when he was eight years old, he began performing for audiences after moving to Libreville to attend school. While taking classes in accounting, he joined the Capo Sound, the school band, where he learned to play guitar. The group played at formal dances and balls, teaching N'Goma the art of performing on stage. N'Goma was a poor student, devoting himself to music and cinema instead of his classwork. His love of film led to a job with Gabon TV, who sent him to France in 1988 where he was trained as a cameraman. While spending a winter in Paris, he finished work on music he'd written in Gabon. He shared his music with Manu Lima, a Cape Verdean well-known record producer. Lima was impressed with the young man's work, and handled the artistic direction of N'Goma's first record Bane. The album enjoyed modest success at first, until an African radio station began to play his songs. The title track scored large success in Africa, France, and the French West Indies, and continues to rank as a party anthem in those areas. It enjoys success comparable to Mario by Franco or Yeke Yeke by Mory Kante. The album is one of the best-selling African albums to date. N'Goma released a second album, Adia in December 1995, again working with Manu Lima. Five years later, his third album Seva debuted.

As an example, mechanical work and heat are process functions because they describe quantitatively the transition between equilibrium states of a thermodynamic system. Path functions depend on the path taken to reach one state from another. Different routes give different quantities. Examples of path functions include work, heat and arc length. In contrast to path functions, state functions are independent of the path taken. Thermodynamic state variables are point functions, differing from path functions. For a given state, considered as a point, there is a definite value for each state variable and state function. Infinitesimal changes in a process function are often indicated by to distinguish them from infinitesimal changes in a state function which is written . The quantity is an exact differential, while is not, it is an inexact differential. Infinitesimal changes in a process function may be integrated, but the integral between two states depends on the particular path taken between the two states, whereas the integral of a state function is simply the difference of the state functions at the two points, independent of the path taken. In general, a process function may be either holonomic or non-holonomic. For a holonomic process function, an auxiliary state function (or integrating factor) may be defined such that is a state function. For a non-holonomic process function, no such function may be defined. In other words, for a holonomic process function, may be defined such that is an exact differential. For example, thermodynamic work is a holonomic process function since the integrating factor (where is pressure) will yield exact differential of the volume state function . The second law of thermodynamics as stated by Carath√©odory essentially amounts to the statement that heat is a holonomic process function since the integrating factor (where is temperature) will yield the exact differential of an entropy state function .

The town is situated at an altitude of 280 metres near the Magana River where it flows into the Enguri River; The town is divided in two with \\"Jvari\\" lying on the Zugdidi-Mestia highway, and Jvarzeni (Upper Jvari) up the hill.  Etymology  In Georgian the word \\"Jvari\\" means \\"cross\\". There are three legends about where this name came from. *The first legend is connected to St Andrew who was Jesus Christ's pupil. After Christ's crucifixion his pupils began spreading Christianity all around the world. St Andrew had to convert to Christianity in Georgia, so one day he came to Jvari from Abkhazia. He preached Christianity and after that he christened the people in Enguri River. He drove a cross into the ground and people named this territory 'Jvari'. *The second legend says that the Queen of Georgia, Tamara, was in Jvari in the 12th century. As she was walking she saw two rivers, the Enguri and the Magana, crossing each other and forming the shape of a cross. Queen Tamara exclaimed \\"Look! Jvari, Jvari!\\" That is why the territory was named Jvari. *According to the third legend, when Queen Tamara visited the village she lost her golden cross. She was looking for the cross with her retinue. After she found it she cried \\"Jvari, Jvari!\\" and named this territory Jvari.  Description  Jvari is located in the far northwest of Georgia, at the beginning of the Mestia highway through the mountains, which provides the rest of Georgia with access to Svaneti. Jvari is a very old settlement in the north-west of Georgia in the Tsalenjikha municipality. According to the legends we can suppose that Jvari has a 2,000 year old history. Nearby Jvari is the Enguri Dam, which is an important part of Jvari's economy. The dam provides 46% of all electricity consumed in Georgia. There are three schools, a vocational college and a community centre funded by a German organisation. The first school in Jvari opened in 1888. Its founder and first teacher was a priest named Bede Getia. The school didn't have its own building, just a single room. In 1907 a wooden 8-room building was constructed, but this burned down on 31 August 1930. Construction of a new school began in 1934. In 1949 many Jvari residents left to Abkhazia under instruction by the Georgian government. Then in 1992 the Russian war in Abkhazia started and around 10,000 refugees came to the Enguri area. It was the hometown of Meliton Kantaria, the sergeant of the Soviet Army, who was photographed hoisting a Soviet flag Banner of Victory over the Reichstag following the final defeat of Nazi Germany.

He was succeeded in the earldom by his brother, Robert de Vere, 3rd Earl of Oxford. Aubrey de Vere, the eldest son and heir of Aubrey de Vere, 1st Earl of Oxford, by his third wife, Agnes of Essex, the daughter of Henry of Essex, lord of Rayleigh, was born in 1163 or later. He had three brothers, Ralph, Robert and Henry, and a sister, Alice. His brother Ralph predeceased him, and his brother Robert succeeded him as 3rd Earl in 1214.. The first notice of Aubrey de Vere is as a young boy witnessing his father's charters for Colne Priory. In 1194 Vere was with King Richard I in France, and succeeded to the earldom on the death of his father on 26 December of the same year. In 1195 he was assessed to pay 500 marks towards the ransom of King Richard, who was being held captive by the Emperor Henry VI.. In 1197 Oxford was again with King Richard in Normandy when a dispute was litigated between Abbot Samson of Bury St Edmunds and some fifty tenants of the Abbey, including the earl of Oxford. Ultimately most of the tenants came to the King's court in London and acknowledged the Abbey's right to certain feudal aids. Earl Aubrey, the last to hold out, finally capitulated when the abbot seized and sold his plough-beasts.. In 1204 Oxford paid 200 marks for the third penny of Oxfordshire and 'that he might be Earl of Oxford', a confirmation of the title which had been granted to his father in July 1141 by the Empress Matilda during a time of civil war.. The title had already confirmed to his father by Matilda's son, King Henry II and Aubrey III had been acknowledged earl of Oxford by Richard I and John. This payment five years after John took the throne is thus unusual. In March 1208 Pope Innocent III placed England under an interdict.. At the time of the interdict Oxford is said to have been regarded as one of the King's 'evil counsellors'. In the summer of 1209 he was among the courtiers who met the Pope's agents in Dover to try to prevent King John's excommunication. Their mission failed; Pope Innocent excommunicated the King in November of that year.. In what may have been his last military service, the earl of Oxford was with King John's forces during a nine-week campaign in Ireland from June to August 1210.; . Among other appointments, Oxford was Keeper of the manor of Havering in 1208, Sheriff of Essex and Hertfordshire from 1208 to 1213, and steward of the Forest of Essex in 1213. On 20 June 1213 he had the King's greyhounds in his charge. Oxford died in 1214, in or before the month of October, and was buried at Colne Priory. He was succeeded by his younger brother, Robert de Vere, 3rd Earl of Oxford, later one of the guarantors of Magna Carta.. Marriages and issue Oxford married twice. His first wife was the heiress Isabel de Bolebec,Not to be confused with her aunt, Isabel de Bolebec, widow of Henry de Nonant and daughter of Hugh de Bolebec of Whitchurch, who married Oxford's brother, Robert de Vere, later 3rd Earl of Oxford. whose marriage his father had purchased in 1184.. She died in 1206 or 1207.. His second wife, Alice, is said to have been a daughter of Roger Bigod, 2nd Earl of Norfolk and thus his second cousin. After Oxford's death his brother and successor, Robert de Vere, 3rd Earl of Oxford, established Alice's dower by lot, drawing two knights' fees for every one drawn by Alice. She never remarried and outlived her husband by several decades. Earl Aubrey had no surviving issue by either of his wives. The earl left an illegitimate son, Roger de Vere, who was apparently acknowledged and provided for by his father. Roger died in 1221 at Damietta on crusade.

Later authors usually applied the taxon to Senna obtusifolia. Senna tora (originally described by Linnaeus as Cassia tora) is a dicot legume in the subfamily Caesalpinioideae. Its name is derived from its Sinhala name Tora (‡∂≠‡∑ù‡∂ª). It grows wild in most of the tropics and is considered a weed in many places. Its native range is in Central America. Its most common English name is Sickle Senna or Sickle Wild sensitive-plant.NatureServe (2007) Other common names include sickle pod, tora, coffee pod, tovara, chakvad, thakara in Malayalam and foetid cassia.Country Compass Food and Agriculture Organization It is often confused with Chinese Senna or Sicklepod, Senna obtusifolia. Description The Cassia tora is an herbaceous annual foetid herb. The plant can grow tall and consists of alternative pinnate leaves with leaflets mostly with three opposite pairs that are obovate in shape with a rounded tip. The leaves grow up to 3‚Äì4.5 centimeters long. The stems have distinct smelling foliage when young. The flowers occur in pairs in axils of leaves with five petals and pale yellow in colour. The stamens are of unequal length. The pods are somewhat flattened or four angled, 10‚Äì15 cm long and sickle shaped, hence the common name sickle pod. There are 30‚Äì50 seeds within a pod.  Growing conditions  Casia tora is considered an annual weed, is very stress tolerant, and is easily grown. In India, it occurs as a wasteland rainy season weed and its usual flowering time is after the monsoon rains, during the period of October to February. Cassia tora grows in dry soil from sea level up to 1800 meters. The seed can remain viable for up to twenty years. Up to 1000 plants can emerge per square meter following rain. Once the seed has matured, it is gathered and dried in the sun. In South Asia, it usually dies off in the dry season of July‚ÄìOctober.  Pests/diseases  In Vanuatu, which is an island in the South Pacific, Cassia tora has been known to suffer limited damage by the leaf-eating larvae of a species of moth called Stegasta variana, a Gelechild moth.  Uses  Gyeolmyeongja-cha (sicklepod tea) Cassia tora has many uses. The whole plant and roots, leaves, and seeds have been widely used in traditional Indian and South Asian medicine. The plant and seeds are edible. Young leaves can be cooked as a vegetable while the roasted seeds are used as a substitute coffee. In Sri Lanka, the flowers are added to food. It is used as a natural pesticide in organic farms, and as a powder commonly used in the pet food industry. It is mixed with guar gum for use in mining and other industrial applications. The seeds and leaves are used to treat skin disease and its seeds can be utilized as a laxative. Cassia tora is made into tea. In the Republic of Korea, it is believed to rejuvenate human vision. This tea has been referred to as ‚Äúcoffee-tea‚Äù, because of its taste and its coffee aroma. Since Cassia tora has an external germicide and antiparasitic character, it has been used for treating skin diseases such as leprosy, ringworm, itching and psoriasis and also for snakebites. Other medicinal provisions from plant parts include balm for arthritis using leaves of Cassia tora. Cassia tora is one of the recognized plants that contain the organic compound anthraquinone and is used in Chinese and Ayurvedic medicine. This herb is used in Ayurveda for treatment of swellings.  Economics  The galactomannans (a form of polysaccharide) from Cassia tora (CT gum), after proper processing and chemical derivatization (converting chemical into a product of a similar structure), could function as an improved and more economical thickener than locust bean gum for textiles, because of the bean gum‚Äôs current high price ($18/kg) and limited availability. Most of the CT-gum processing plants in India are located in Gujarat state because of the availability of Cassia tora beans in the neighbouring states, but the widespread use of these beans as vegetables and seeds as cattle feed has been pushing up the raw material cost for the CT-gum industry. The total fixed capacity in the country is 0.2 million tonnes for splits and 59,000 for powder based on Cassia tora seeds. The capacity utilization in the industry has been around 70 percent for the last three years. Apart from domestic consumption, there are now noteworthy exports of cassia powder of the international standard to various countries. This includes the United States of America, Australia, Germany, France, Spain, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Singapore and Japan. The export value of Cassia tora has been progressively increasing over the last five years. Comprehensive export data disclosed that Japan and the UK receive a regular supply, while the United States market fluctuates. However, the export growth rate of Cassia tora plainly shows the difference between quantity and value, which leads to a low price per unit price.  Cultivation  Soak the seeds for 2‚Äì3 hours in warm water before sowing it from early spring to early summer in a warm greenhouse or pot in your own home. The seed usually germinates in 1‚Äì12 weeks at 23¬∞C. Cassia tora can be transplanted. Synonyms The taxonomic history of this plant is extremely confused, even by the standards of Senna and Cassia. S. tora and S. obtusifolia were for long and are often still held to be‚Äîand may eventually be verified as‚Äîa single species. Hence, taxa referring to either species were indiscriminately applied to both.ILDIS (2005) * Cassia boreensis Miq. * Cassia borneensis Miq. * Cassia gallinaria Collad. * Cassia numilis Collad. :Apparently a misprint for Cassia humilis, which would have been applied to this species in error as it is properly a synonym of Senna obtusifolia and Chamaecrista kunthiana, depending on the author. * Cassia tora L. :As discussed above, the Cassia tora of other authors refers to Senna obtusifolia * Cassia tora L. var. borneensis (Miq.)

Œ£œÄ·æ∞œÅœÑ·øê·æ±ÃÅœÑŒ±Œπ) or Homoios (pl. Homoioi from respectively Classical- and ·ΩçŒºŒøŒπŒøŒπ \\"those who are alike\\") was a male of Sparta, known to the Spartans as a \\"peer\\" or \\"man of equal status\\". From a young age, male Spartiates were trained for battle and put through grueling challenges intended to craft them into fearless warriors. In battle, they had the reputation of being the best soldiers in Greece, and the strength of Sparta's hoplite forces let the city become the dominant state in Greece throughout much of the Classical period. Other city-states were reluctant to attack Sparta even though it could muster a force of only about 8000 Spartiates during the zenith of its dominance, such was the reputation of its soldiers. Structure of Spartan society Classical Spartan society was rigidly divided into several castes, each with assigned duties and privileges. The smallest of them, with the most power and freedom, was the Spartiate elite. Spartiates were exempt from manual labour and controlled the government of the state. Spartiates men were expected to prepare constantly for military conflict. Below the Spartiates were the perioeci, literally \\"dwellers around\\", inhabitants of outlying towns who carried out most of the trade and commerce of the city since Spartiates were forbidden from engaging in commercial activity. The lowest were the helots, enslaved populations tied to the land and over whom the Spartan state claimed ownership. In the late 5th century BC and later, a new class, the neodamodeis, literally new damos dwellers, arose and seems to have been composed of liberated helots. Also were the hypomeiones, literally inferiors, men who were probably although not certainly Spartiates who had lost their social rank. Origins of Spartan system According to classical accounts, the Spartan constitution was the product of a great lawgiver, Lycurgus. He was said to have written the Spartan constitution late in the Archaic period, most likely in the 770s BC. It is impossible to determine whether Lycurgus was an actual historical figure. It is clear, however, that at some point in the late Archaic period, the model of Spartan society was changed from a monarchical system to an aristocracy for the elite warrior class. That change is likely to have been in some way related to the change from Dark Age warfare, in which nobles were the dominant force, to the hoplite warfare of the classical period. Around the time of that change, Sparta embarked on the conquest of the neighboring state of Messenia. The acquisition of such a comparatively large piece of territory and conquered population seems to have both provided the basis for the system of helotage and required the existence of a large military force to keep the potentially- rebellious Messenians under control. The Spartiates thus became a permanently- armed master class, living off the labour of the helots and preventing rebellion through constant struggle. Spartiate lifestyle During the 6th and the 5th centuries BC, the Spartan system was at its height. In 555 BC, Sparta defeated Tegea and forced that state to become its ally. Around 544 BC, Sparta defeated Argos and established itself as the pre-eminent power in the Peloponnese. For over 150 years, Sparta became the dominant land power of Greece, with the Spartiates hoplites serving as the core of its army. To maintain the social system of the city, it was necessary to have a force ready to oppose any uprising of the helots (that occurred several times in the classical period). To ensure their military readiness, Spartiate youths enrolled in military training (agoge) from the age of seven to thirty, the age of full citizenship. From that age until they became too old to fight, they would live in their barracks, visiting their families (and, later, their wives) only when they could sneak out. Spartiate women, as well, were expected to remain athletically fit since the Spartans believed that strong and healthy parents would produce strong and healthy children. Spartiates were expected to adhere to an ideal of military valour, as exemplified by the poems of Tyrtaeus, who praised men who fell in battle and heaped scorn on those who fled. Each Spartiate male was assigned a plot of land, with the helots that worked it. That was the source of his income since he performed no labour or commerce himself. The primary use of that income was to pay the dues of the communal mess halls to which all Spartiates were required to belong. Any Spartiate who was unable to pay these dues was demoted from his class. Politically, Spartiate males composed the army assembly, the body that elected the ephors, the most powerful magistrates of Sparta after the kings. The Spartiates were also the source of the krypteia, a sort of secret police, which, by measures such as assassination and kidnapping, sought to prevent rebellion among the helots. Decline of Spartiates In the late 5th and the early 4th centuries BC, the Spartiate class gradually declined, along with Spartan military prowess, for several reasons. First was attrition through the increasingly-frequent wars that Sparta found itself embroiled in from the mid-5th century onward. Since Spartiates were required to marry late, birth rates were low, and it was difficult to replace losses from the class. Exacerbating that problem was the possibility of demotion from Spartiate status for a number of reasons, such as cowardice in battle and inability to pay for membership in the syssitia. The latter became increasingly severe; as commercial activity began to develop in Sparta, some Spartiates would sell the land from which they were supposed to draw their earnings. Since the constitution included no known provisions for promotion to Spartiate status, the number of Spartiates gradually dwindled. By the mid-4th century BC, the number of Spartiates had been critically reduced although Sparta continued to hold sway over much of Greece. Finally, at Leuctra in 371 BC, a Theban army decisively defeated a Spartan force, killing 400 Spartiates of a force of 700 and breaking the back of Spartan military power. In 370 BC, Messenia was liberated by a Theban army, destroying the basis of the Spartan social system. The Spartan state never recovered its former power, and the Spartan army, by the later 3rd century, was not particularly superior to other hoplite armies in Greece.

Truong (born May 13, 1968 in Saigon in South Vietnam) is a Vietnamese American writer living in Brooklyn, New York.  Early life and education  In 1975, at the age of six, Truong and her mother left Vietnam for the United States as refugees of the Vietnam War. Her father, an executive for an international oil company, initially stayed behind for work but left the country after the fall of Saigon. The family lived in North Carolina, Ohio, and Texas. Truong completed her undergraduate studies at Yale University, graduating in 1990 with a B.A. in Literature. She earned a J.D. from Columbia University School of Law and went on to specialize in intellectual property law.  Career  Truong co-edited the anthology Watermark: Vietnamese American Poetry & Prose (Asian American Writers Workshop, 1998) with Barbara Tran and Khoi Truong Luu. Truong's first novel, The Book of Salt, published in 2003 by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, takes place in post-World War I Paris, and tells the story of Binh, a Vietnamese cook who works for Gertrude Stein and Alice B. Toklas. The inspiration for the novel came from reading in The Alice B. Toklas Cookbook (1954) that Toklas and Stein had employed \\"Indo-Chinese\\" cooks. The novel explores themes of sexuality, diaspora, race, and national identity. The Book of Salt won numerous literary awards, including the New York Public Library Young Lions Award, the Bard Fiction Prize, and a Stonewall Book Award. Her second novel, Bitter in the Mouth, published by Random House in 2010, tells the story of a Vietnamese- American adoptee growing up in the American South. Diane Leach wrote in The Los Angeles Times: \\"Monique Truong‚Äôs bone is the outsider‚Äôs plight, and her pen is a scalpel, laying perfect words down along that nerve until even the happiest reader understands what it means to forever stand apart from your family and the larger society you inhabit.\\" Truong's third novel The Sweetest Fruits (Viking, 2019) is a fictionalized recreation of the life of the Greek- Anglo Irish-Japanese writer Lafcadio Hearn, as told through the voices of three women in his life. It was named a best fiction book of 2019 by Publisher's Weekly, Mental Floss, and PopMatters. Her novels have been translated into fourteen languages to date. From 2011 to 2012, Truong wrote the food column, Ravenous, in T: The New York Times Style Magazine. She also received two James Beard Award nominations for contributing to Gourmet. Her essays on a variety of topics, including food, racism, the Vietnam War, and the American South, have appeared in The Wall Street Journal, O, The Oprah Magazine, The Washington Post, and The New York Times. In collaboration with the composer/performer/sound artist Joan La Barbara, Truong has written the lyrics for a choral work and a song cycle, and is at work on a libretto for an opera inspired by Joseph Cornell and Virginia Woolf. Truong currently serves as vice president of The Authors Guild.

She refused to abort her third child after already having twins and was detained in an ankang (psychiatric hospital) and then dismissed from her job. A frequent petitioner, Mao served a year and a half of re-education through labor in 2004-2005 and two and half years in prison for \\"intentional destruction of property\\" in 2006-2008. She was released from Shanghai Women's Prison on 29 November 2008. Since then she has served another year in RTL after protesting in support of Liu Xiaobo. She was briefly released, in February 2011, but under house arrest. She was almost immediately taken again, and placed in Shanghai City Prison Hospital, where she was previously tortured and ill-treated.Amnesty Urgent Action email network Background A mother of twins, Mao Hengfeng was reportedly dismissed from her job at a Shanghai soap factory in 1988 because she became pregnant for a second time with a third child, in contravention of China's family planning regulations. Mao refused to have an abortion, and was subsequently detained in a psychiatric hospital. She gave birth on 28 February 1989, and was notified on 20 March that she had been dismissed from her job for missing sixteen days of work. This was the period when she was giving birth and recuperating, as well as recovering from her ordeal in the psychiatric institute. Appeal and petitions Mao Hengfeng appealed against her dismissal under China's Labour Law, and was reinstated to her job. However, the soap factory disputed the ruling. Mao was seven months pregnant with her fourth child at the time of the appeal hearing, when the judge reportedly told her that if she terminated this third pregnancy he would rule in her favour. Concerned for the welfare of her existing family, Mao terminated her pregnancy against her wishes, but still the court ruled against her, apparently because she had taken sixteen days of \\"unauthorized leave\\" from work, and also for her original violation of family planning policies. From 1990 to 2004 Mao repeatedly petitioned the authorities for redress for her dismissal from work, her forced abortion, and the denial of other basic rights including that of freedom of expression. She also made several attempts to initiate legal proceedings against the authorities in relation to these abuses, but courts repeatedly failed to respond or refused to file the cases. As well as actively petitioning authorities to seek redress for herself, Mao Hengfeng has also acted to safeguard the rights of others. For example, she is known to have actively supported other people seeking redress over alleged forced evictions in Shanghai and Shanxi province, and is reportedly regarded by the Shanghai authorities as one of the city's most persistent and experienced petitioners. She is actively campaigning on behalf of other individuals arbitrarily detained in \\"Re-education Through Labour\\" or psychiatric facilities, including women held for alleged violation of family planning policies. She opposes arbitrary detention and campaigns for legal reforms that ensure redress and protect ordinary people against abuse of power. More recently she was arrested due to her protest in support of human rights activist Liu Xiaobo. 2004-2005 Mao Hengfeng was assigned without trial to eighteen months' \\"Re-education through labor\\" (RTL) in April 2004 after repeatedly protesting about various abuses of her rights. Her welfare allowances were discontinued, leaving her family in severe financial difficulties. Many people in Shanghai openly demonstrated in support of her. On 13 September 2005, Mao and her husband, Wu Xuewei (Âê¥Èõ™‰ºü), were both reportedly beaten by police when they gathered with over a hundred other petitioners at Putuo District Court in Shanghai. They were supporting Xu Zhengqing, a petitioner who was facing trial in connection with his attempts to attend a memorial service in Beijing in January 2005. Along with dozens of other petitioners, the couple was detained by the police. Mao Hengfeng managed to escape and tried to continue her protest on behalf of Xu Zhengqing. However, she was detained again and sent back to her residential district, where local police and government officials apparently threatened her with imprisonment if she continued her protests and presented her with a formal police summons for investigation on suspicion of 'disturbing the normal lives of others'. From 23‚Äì27 September 2005, Mao and her family were reportedly held under a form of house arrest after she stated that she would go to a United Nations representative office in Beijing to protest about the abuses. Seven police officers reportedly stood guard in front of her flat preventing her from leaving, even to go shopping. On 29 September 2005 she was again placed under house arrest; an official told her that this would continue until the end of the fifth plenary session of the 16th Central Committee of the Communist Party on 11 October 2005. The following day, three police officers and seven Yangpu District Official Guards were stationed in front of her house. She was warned that she would be detained or face violent treatment if she tried to break out. Imprisonment (2006-2007) In early 2006, Mao Hengfeng was detained in a roundup of petitioners before the anniversary of the Tiananmen Incident and placed under residential surveillance. She was then charged with \\"violating the terms of residential surveillance,\\" and placed her under \\"soft detention\\" in a small guesthouse room with six other men and women in Yangpu District, Shanghai.Human Rights in China, \\"Mao Hengfeng Sentenced to 2-1/2 Years for Breaking Lamps ,\\" 2007-01-16 While under detention, Mao broke two table lamps in the guesthouse and was for that reason formally arrested on 30 June 2006 for \\"intentional destruction of property.\\"Incorporating Responsibility 2008, \\"About the Individual: Mao Hengfeng\\" She was sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison on 12 January 2007 and imprisoned at Shanghai Women's Prison. Mao and her husband, Wu Xuewei, filed an appeal against Mao's sentence. At the appeal hearing on 16 April 2007, the judge at Shanghai Municipal No. 2 Intermediate People's Court merely read a statement reaffirming Mao's sentence, allowing no evidence to be presented by Xu or Mao's lawyer. Mao was tormented and tortured by prisoners and staff alike while in prison.Fang Yuan {ÊñπÂ™õ}, \\"Mao Hengfeng Suffers Abuse and Maltreatment in Prison; Two Petitioners Detained for Supporting Yang Jia\\" {ÊØõÊÅíÂá§Âú®Áã±‰∏≠ÂèóÂ∞ΩËôêÂæÖ ‰∏§ÂêçËÆøÊ∞ëÂõ†Â£∞Êè¥Êù®‰Ω≥Ë¢´ÊãòÁïô}, Radio Free Asia, 2008-09-22 In addition to her regular abuse, she was placed under solitary confinement for 70 days, a violation of China's Prison Law, which allows a maximum of 15 days in solitary confinement.Human Rights in China, \\"Mao Hengfeng Protests Abusive Confinement ,\\" 2007-09-19 She was finally released on 29 November 2008, at the scheduled end of her sentence.China Human Rights Defenders, \\"Rights Defense Heroine Mao Hengfeng Released; Torture from within Jail Was like \\"living death\\"! \\" (Áª¥ÊùÉËã±ÈõÑÊØõÊÅíÂá§Ëé∑ÈáäÔºåÁõëÁã±ÈÖ∑Âàë\\"Áîü‰∏çÂ¶ÇÊ≠ª\\"ÔºÅ), 2008-12-01 Protest for Liu Xiaobo, and imprisonment (2009-2011) On 25 December 2009, she was found guilty of \\"disturbing public order\\" due to her peaceful protest outside the Beijing municipal intermediate court, where she was campaigning in support of the human rights activist Liu Xiaobo. She was sent back to the RTL camp on 4 March 2010. There she was tortured and ill-treated. Abuses include force-feeding, blocking her access to food from her family and ordering other inmates to repeatedly beat her. Due to her protests about human rights in the RTL camp, on 9 September 2010, she was tied up for four days in the same position, without food or water. This was repeated on 29 September. She was released on 22 February 2011. A CT scan showed that the ill-treatment had caused her to have bleeding in her brain. She was very quickly taken again, and is now believed to be in Shanghai City Prison Hospital, where she was previously tortured and ill-treated. Recently, on 28 July 2011, Mao Hengfeng has been released again to her family in an unconscious state. Members of the police force are still currently keeping Mao Hengfeng under surveillance.

It broadcasts content from the CITV archive and acquisitions, every day from 6 am to 9 pm which was previously 6 am to 6 pm until 21 February 2016. It is also the title of a programming block on the ITV network at weekends. Children's ITV launched on 3 January 1983, as a late afternoon programming block on the ITV network.At this point, there was only one \\"ITV\\" channel in any given area- transmitter overlap and split weekday/weekend franchises aside- and \\"ITV\\" was solely a generic/collective name for the various regional commercial television stations. It replaced the earlier Watch It! branding and introduced networked in-vision continuity links between programmes. These links were originally pre-recorded from a small London studio, up until 1987 when Central won the contract to produce live links from their Birmingham studios. In 2004, presentation of CITV was relocated to Granada Television in Manchester, which saw the demise of in- vision continuity. Nine years later, the operations moved to ITV Granada's MediaCityUK studios in Salford. In 2006, CITV launched as a channel in its own right. The CITV channel averages around 100,000 viewers between 4pm-6pm every day. The CITV strand on the ITV network airs on weekend mornings from 6 am to 9:25 am, as part of the ITV Breakfast time slot. CITV has no HD or +1 simulcast, unlike the rest of ITV's portfolio of channels.  History  = Watch It! and Children's ITV: Early years (1980‚Äì1989) = Before being known as Children's ITV, the timeslot for children's programmes on the ITV Network was briefly branded as Watch It!. The Watch It! brand started on 29 December 1980 and was presented live by the duty continuity announcer in each ITV region. The notion of networking children's continuity was first suggested within ITV as far back as the early 1970s, but with fierce regional identities prevalent ‚Äì including scheduling, presentation and programming ‚Äì the idea stalled until the late 1970s, when the IBA began to express concern that most ITV shows for children were not consistent or fully networked. On Thursdays, the ITV regions were able to broadcast whatever programmes they wished; many non-children's programmes appeared, such as Little House on the Prairie. In December 1980, ITV announced its first concerted effort at a more coherent approach to children's output, with the introduction of Watch It! each weekday from 4.15 to 5.15 , after the IBA continued to emphasized issues. Watch It! was conceived by the promotions department at ATV, with the implementation of the branding differed from region to region, thus it was always transmitted locally and never provided on a network basis. ATV provide different animations each season, to freshen up what was available to each company. Most regions, including Southern/TVS and Granada, would use their own station announcers during Watch It! airtime. Shortly after the start of new franchises in 1982, some ITV stations raised concerns that Watch It! had not gone far enough to address previous concerns. Central's Controller of Children's Programmes, Lewis Rudd, suggested a different approach to the presentation method. As a result, the Central promotions department came up with the initial concept for Children's ITV. The new look was devised, and links between programmes were pre-recorded using presenters drawn from the constituent programmes. The networking arrangements were similar to those already in place for the transmission of schools programmes ‚Äì the links were played out from Central and the component programmes came from the supplying companies. Children's ITV went to air on Monday 3 January 1983, between 4 and 5.15 each weekday afternoon, the extra fifteen minutes being filled by a repeat of one of the pre-school programmes shown at lunchtime the same day. Initially featuring a different presenter each month (usually from children's television), the links were pre-recorded in advance in a small studio at a London facility called Molinare, using a single locked-off camera. The first set design was a rocket ship and was used for the first few months. The concept was eventually retired, and the set and style of presentation used began to reflect the presenter doing the presenting that month or the programme that he/she starred in (i.e. Pat Coombs as \\"The Dressmaker\\" from Yorkshire Television's Ragdolly Anna in a room of antiques in April 1984). By 1985, the links were still being recorded, but using a common, stylized set known as Network Control, which allowed the presenter to be joined by guests in the studio for interviews. The exterior of this fictitious location also featured in the animations and stings. Technical considerations often left the system flawed. With each programme coming from a different playout source (usually from that of the originating ITV company, i.e. if the first programme was Rainbow, which came from Thames TV, the staff there would have to run the tape while the presenter was talking and wouldn't show Thames TV's skyline ident before the programme's titles) and each link being pre-recorded (played out by Central), things often went wrong on air: Programmes would be rolled early and the links would be cut short. Programmes would also fail to appear and the presenter would be left on screen. Because each link was recorded for the slot available, the presenter would hold the final pose for a few moments so that the transmission controller at Central had something to leave on screen just in case. Pre-recording the links also meant that late schedule changes could not be easily referenced. In September 1985, the BBC revamped their own children's presentation with the introduction of \\"Children's BBC\\". Using the BBC1 announcer booth at BBC Television Centre, later dubbed \\"The Broom Cupboard\\", Phillip Schofield provided links between the programmes. This format of a small self-op continuity studio using one single presenter (and an occasional puppet) continued in largely the same format until 1993, but was broadcast live and allowed for a looser, more relaxed style of presentation than the rival ITV service. Children's ITV went live two years later. Using the small presentation studio at their Broad Street studios ‚Äì which had become available since in-vision continuity for the Central region was dropped ‚Äì former Central announcer Gary Terzza and Debbie Shore presented live links from a set built to look like a transmitting station. Although the studio space was small, the designers' use of a plate glass mirror gave the effect of a much larger set. The new live format gave brought a great deal of flexibility; timings could be altered, schedule changes reflected and breakdowns dealt with in a continuous manner. In 1988, the format was refreshed again with a new single presenter, Mark Granger, replacing Terzza and Shore, in a smaller, more basic studio set which included in-vision monitors showing the VT clock of the next scheduled item. = The Stonewall Productions era (1989‚Äì1991) = From 3 April 1989, the independent production company Stonewall Productions won the contract to produce Children's ITV presentation. Stonewall Productions was headed up by Michael Jackson, a Central staffer who used his expertise to prepare a suitable application. Whereas Central had restricted links to the station's former in-vision presentation studio, Stonewall chose not to use a fixed set, but instead presented links from various areas of Central's headquarters at Broad Street in Birmingham, utilising a rotating team of presenters which included Clive Warren (now a DJ), Jeanne Downs (a singer), Jerry Foulkes (a producer who left Children's ITV on 22 December 1989) and a large puppet dog called Scally (who started out with Mark during his last few months). = Central regains control (1991‚Äì2000) = CITV logo (1998‚Äì2006) Central won back the contract to produce the continuity links from 8 April 1991, choosing to revert links back to a small in-vision studio and using one regular presenter, Tommy Boyd. During the 1991‚Äì1993 era, greater importance was being placed throughout television on promotions (trailers) as a way of effectively detailing areas of the schedule to viewers who might not know about them. The 1993 invitation to tender for the provision of the Children's ITV service specified a minimum number of high quality trailers that the successful applicant must produce over the term of the contract. With a large promotions department - and a strong, highly credible reputation for presentation within the ITV network - the contract remained with Central. On 15 February 1993, in-vision presentation was dropped by the first Network Centre controller of children's & daytime programming Dawn Airey (a former Central management trainee) with Steven Ryde providing live out-of-vision continuity links featuring a wide variety of animated characters. On 6 September 1993, CITV was extended to start at 3.30 , when ITV network centre decided to move the pre-school children slot from 12.10 , to be branded under the CITV in the afternoon slot. Around the same time, the Children's ITV name was changed to CITV, having been used in some form or another since the previous year. However, the Children's was not removed from the logo until Monday 2 September 1996, the same month a digital on-screen graphic (DOG) was introduced. Presentation for the service was moved in 1997 when Central moved into new, smaller studios at Gas Street Studios in Birmingham, which continued until Monday 25 May 1998, when a new in-vision service was introduced by the new controller of ITV children's output, Nigel Pickard. Steven Ryde became a producer with Stephen Mulhern and Danielle Nicholls becoming the new presentation team. A new logo was introduced (with traces predecessors), and henceforth the service was referred to as CiTV, until the 2006 re-brand, initially being broadcast from Studio B at Central's Gas Street Studios. Central retained the contact to produce CITV for a further two years, seeing off two rival bids from other ITV companies. Shortly after launch, CITV started sharing studio space with the West Midlands edition of Central News in September 1999, allowing room for a large stylised set created by a company called Dorans Propmakers. The main studio for Central News West had previously been used for live music performances during CITV. = Cutbacks (2001‚Äì2008) = First CITV channel logo (2006‚Äì2009) During 2001, CITV's budget was cut by 17% due to the advertising recession, leading to CITV's controller Janie Grace publicly criticising Carlton and Granada Television, then the main controlling forces in the network, for underinvestment in ITV's children's service. Grace went even further and complained to the regulator ITC, claiming CITV was unlikely to fulfil its range of programming commitments in the following year. Grace also sought support from the ITC for the creation of a separate CITV Ltd company which would allow more children's output to be made in-house - a proposal which ultimately fell apart due to the need for a change in the law and support from the Office of Fair Trading. A new strand was introduced from 3:25 every afternoon and was put in place under the name \\"CiTV's Telly Tots\\". The in-house presentation was dropped between 3:25 and 4:00 and replaced with a CGI animated town using a plane, car and a post box as mascots. A child voiceover was used to introduce its pre-school shows. Books and video tapes were introduced to tie-in with new strand. Further cuts took place again during 2002 which brought the total cutback to 25% of the overall budget (¬£30 million less). Despite the cutbacks, the ITC noted that CITV had a \\"sustained an impressive schedule\\", gave \\"factual material a fresh look\\" and \\"continued to produce good dramas\\" Just after CITV celebrated its 20th birthday in January 2003, Janie Grace resigned from the post, just before Nigel Pickard was named as ITV's new Director of Programmes. Pickard pledged to produce 80 more hours of children's programming in 2003, against a target of 520 hours in 2002 and extend the range of programmes to include more factual and topical programmes and more mixed entertainment and drama, Once again, concerns about CITV and its structure where highlighted by Angus Fletcher, president of Jim Henson Television Europe, and Anne Wood, founder of Ragdoll Productions, as it could only earn money from a then unreliable advertising market, unlike BBC Worldwide where the likes of Teletubbies, Tweenies and Bob the Builder became key money earners for the Corporation. Steven Andrew took over as ITV's controller of children and youth, overseeing the merger of Carlton and Granada's children's departments. Andrew also began looking at the possibility of launching a CITV channel, which had previously been put on hold by budget cuts. On-screen, various changes to the continuity presenting team saw no less than eight additions and replacements in the space of four years. By 31 August 2004, all in-vision continuity was replaced by voice over, while ITV plc announced the closure of its presentation and transmission facilities in Birmingham, signalling the end of CITV continuity from Central. Presentation was relocated to Granada in Manchester by November 2004\\\\. Further cuts back took place in 2005 added with the perceived rising costs of original production and the effects on advertising revenues following the ban by Ofcom on 'junk food' advertising within children's schedules from 2007 and increasing competition from CBBC and countless digital children's channels for new programmes (especially imported cartoons, typically from America). In Summer 2006, ITV closed down its in-house children's production unit, as part of ITV's then on-going process of restructuring ITV Productions, and blaming the closure because of the competitive production environment, though ITV denied any intention of ditching its children's programming from its network schedule. At the end of 2006, CITV's weekday afternoon strand on the main ITV network ceased, making the CITV channel, which had launched earlier that year, the primary outlet for ITV's kids programming. = Increase in budget (2009‚Äìpresent) = In July 2009, ITV announced it was the only channel to have an increased budget. Emma Tennant, the then controller of CITV, told the Showcomotion conference \\"The commissioning budgets for all channels next year are going to be smaller, except CITV, which is growing ‚Äì but it will not necessarily spend the additional money on original commissions\\". It was also made clear due to tight budgets it may just lead to more acquisitions rather than new programmes being commissioned.http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/citv-bucks-trend-to-grow- budget/5003131.article CITV bucks trend to grow budget 2 July 2009  By Katherine Rushton  CITV Channel  The CITV channel was due to start in 2001 but was axed when CITV lost 25% of its budget. When Steven Andrew become controller of children and youth at ITV, he stated \\"No kids strategy is complete without us being able to play in the cable and satellite world. In fact, we can't not do this and ultimately survive as a kids player in the future\\". In early 2004, ITV finally confirmed it was planning to launch a children's channel, but as a joint venture. Charles Allen, chief executive of ITV, did not believe in ITV creating a new channel as it was already an over- populated market, with talk being held with Nickelodeon and Disney. The plans were dropped 12 months later with ITV instead using its own branding, and using spare Daytime capacity on new ITV4, channel being launch in the autumn of 2005. The original new channel, with Nickelodeon dubbed \\"INK\\" (ITV Nickelodeon Kids) - would have seen the two companies share programmes across each other's networks. Unfortunately each side failed to agree on the exact structure of the new venture and how it would be branded. ITV said We just got to the point of thinking that it was more sustainable for us to do it ourselves. The deal fizzled out over a period of time. Nickelodeon described the decision to end the talks as a \\"mutual backing away\\". The original launch date of the channel was set for November 2005, to coincide with the launch of ITV4 but was held back till 11 February 2006. As a result of problems \\"clearing the digital rights to children's programming\\" and \\"comprehensive\\" re-branding, it was again pushed back by another four weeks. Promos for the channel began on 20 February, including an online countdown clock, running to the channel's launch date. As has become standard for Freeview channel launches, the channel was allocated an EPG number well before transmission started. Initially, a static 'coming soon' graphic was shown, followed by a preview video loop running from late February 2006 until the launch. The channel launched on 11 March 2006 at 9.25 am, replacing the ITV News Channel on Freeview Channel 75, Homechoice (now known as TalkTalk TV) and Telewest Channel 734.NTL and Telewest are now both known as Virgin Media. It also launched on Sky Channel 624 on 8 May 2006 and NTL Channel 76/602 on 6 June. Additionally, the channel simulcasts CITV Breakfast (previously known as GMTV2, which was originally broadcast on ITV2, then ITV4) on weekdays between 6 am and 9.25 am. CITV logo from 2009‚Äì2013 The channel broadcasts daily from 6 am to 6 pm and previously time-shared with ITV4 until 5 February 2008 when ITV4 expanded its broadcast hours to become a full 24-hour channel. As a consequence, it moved to the multiplex space on Freeview originally held by ABC1 from English and Scottish transmitters and S4C from Welsh transmitters, this meant that viewers of the latter were unable to receive the channel on Freeview unless they could receive transmissions from England. On 2 November 2009, the channel was relaunched, with a new logo and new branding to match ITV1 as part of ITV plc's corporate look. The channel's pre-school strand was given a dramatic overhaul, and renamed Mini CITV. Mini CITV is hosted by a group of spacemen-like beings called the Minis, who oversee presentation items on the channel. With the exception of weekends and holidays, Mini CITV took up the majority of output on the channel for a few years, though this was scaled back in 2012. On 9 January 2012, a change in the forward error correction mode on the multiplex allowed CITV to broadcast in Wales on Freeview. On 21 December 2012, the channel aired its first live programme since 2006, a 45-minute CITV special of Text Santa, ITV's Christmas charity appeal. A year later a series of 10-minute programmes titled Help for Hattitude in aid of the above-mentioned appeal was produced for the channel - both programmes were produced in-house by ITV Studios. A new look was introduced on 14 January 2013 to coincide with ITV's corporate rebranding. The channel adopted a \\"yellowy- orange\\" logo with playful idents that \\"burp and fart, and do other things kids love\\". On the weekend of Saturday 5 and Sunday 6 January 2013, CITV celebrated its thirty years of service with a marathon of archive programming, officially known as the Old Skool Weekend. On 22 February 2016, CITV extended its on-air hours, the channel now finishes at 21:00 rather than the earlier 18:00.  Programming  Programming between 6:00 and 9:25 am is controlled by ITV Breakfast (previously GMTV), who, having rebranded the vast majority of their GMTV children's output as CITV, now use the space to simulcast their programming at weekends on the ITV network and CITV Breakfast on weekdays. ITV takes over at 9.25 am, controlling the rest of the day's programming. When it first launched, GMTV used to sell all the airtime for the channel, making it the first ITV plc-owned channel not to be sold by the in-house sales team. Airtime sales have now been taken back in-house by ITV. Some of the channel's most notable programming has been specially commissioned by CITV, such as Horrid Henry, Mr. Bean: The Animated Series, Thunderbirds Are Go!, and Sooty. A vast of other programmes are sourced from the likes of Disney Channel, Disney+, Family Channel, Family Chrgd, HBO Max, Nickelodeon, Netflix, Peacock, Teletoon, YTV and Cartoon Network.  Mini CITV  Mini CITV, which was launched on 2 November 2009, was the slot that housed CITV's pre-school programming. Between 2009 and 2012, Mini CITV was shown on weekdays in school term time between 8:45 am to 3 pm, and on weekends and school holidays between 6 am to 7:25 am. ITV broadcast Mini CITV on weekend mornings, there was also a block called The Fluffy Club between 2008 and 2010 on weekend mornings that housed preschool programmes and featured a puppet baby chick in between programmes. A series of little animated spaceman characters called the Minis were the mascots of the strand (similar to the yellow bugs of its rival CBeebies). On 7 January 2013, the Mini CITV name and the Mini mascots were dropped from on-screen use and two years later, (7 January 2015) CITV withdrew all of its pre-school programmings from both its weekday and weekend schedules with the exception of Sooty, which continued to air until 3 September 2018, after which it started airing on ITVBe's new preschool block, LittleBe. =Pre-school Programming = *Babar and the Adventures of Badou *Bookaboo *Mopatop's Shop (2006-2009) *Curious George *Engie Benjy *The Hive *Signed Stories *Sooty (2011 TV series) *Jake and the Never Land Pirates *Mickey Mouse Clubhouse *Handy Manny *Special Agent Oso *The Animal Shelf *Captain Mack *Pocoyo *Bo on the Go! *Tractor Tom  Presenters  Presenters and announcers on CITV over the years have included: = In-vision presenters = * Tommy Boyd (August 1983, April 1991 ‚Äì December 1992) * Gary Terzza (July 1985 - September 1985 & August 1987 ‚Äì August 1988) * Debbie Shore (July 1985 - September 1985 & August 1987 ‚Äì August 1988) * Gareth Jones (January‚ÄìApril 1987) * Andi Peters (Summer 1988) * Nicky Brown (Summer 1988) * Mark Granger (September 1988 ‚Äì March 1989) * Jerry Foulkes (April ‚Äì December 1989) * Clive Warren (Summer mornings 1989 & 1990, Afternoons; Summer 1989 & 1990) * Jeanne Downs (Summer mornings 1989 & 1990, Afternoons; January 1990 ‚Äì April 1991) * Scally the Dog (puppet dog) (January 1989 ‚Äì April 1991) * Glenn Kinsey (Summer mornings 1991, Afternoons December 1991 & December 1992 ‚Äì 12 February 1993) * Stephen Mulhern (May 1998 ‚Äì August 2002) * Danielle Nicholls (May 1998 ‚Äì December 2001) * Thomas Darvill (December 1999 ‚Äì December 2001) * Andrea Green (December 1999 ‚Äì October 2000) * David Leon (September 2001 ‚Äì December 2002) * Leigh Morrison (September 2001 ‚Äì December 2002) * Leah Charles-King (September 2001 ‚Äì December 2003) * Michael Underwood (August 2002 ‚Äì December 2003) * Tim Dixon (January ‚Äì March 2003) * Gail McKenna (Relief January 2003, October 2003) * Andy Jaye (January 2004 ‚Äì August 2004) * Laura Jaye (January 2004 ‚Äì August 2004) = Out-of-vision announcers = * Steve Ryde (15 February 1993 ‚Äì February 1998) * Emily Morris (March‚ÄìMay 1998) * Sophie Aldred (As herself as well as Minnie The Magic Magician) (1999-2000) (as a guest) * Tim Dann (2004‚Äì) * Tillie Amartey (2014-) * Noah Ros (2014-) = Monthly presenters = * Matthew Kelly (January 1983, December 1984, April and September‚ÄìDecember 1986) * Isla St Clair (February 1983) * Derek Griffiths (March 1983 & January 1984) * Charlotte Coleman (as Marmalade Atkins) (April 1983) * Mick Robertson (May 1983) * Bob Carolgees (June 1983 & June 1984) * Pat Coombs (July 1983) * Mike Reid (September 1983) * David Rappaport (October 1983) * Bill Oddie (November 1983) * The Krankies (December 1983) * The CBTV Team (February 1984) * Roland Rat (March 1984 & January 1985) * Christopher Biggins (April 1984) * Sue Robbie (May 1984) * Sandi Toksvig (as 'Ethel' from No. 73) (August 1984) * Andrea Arnold (as 'Dawn' from No. 73) (August 1984, August 1985 & April 1987) * Neil Buchanan (as 'Neil' from No. 73) (August 1984) * Rod Hull & Emu (September 1984 & December 1985) * Terrahawks voice cast (October 1984) * Bonnie Langford (November 1984) * Cheryl Baker (February 1985) * Dave Goelz (as Travelling Matt from Fraggle Rock) (March 1985) * Ken Jones (as Whistle Willie from Behind the Bike Sheds (April 1985) * Gudrun Ure (as Supergran) (May 1985) * Timmy Mallett (June 1985) * Nick Staverson (as 'Harry' from No. 73) (August 1985) * Jimmy Cricket (September 1985) * Stu Francis (October 1985) * Gary Wilmot (November 1985) * Bernie Winters (January 1986) * Nino Firetto (February 1986) * David Jensen (March 1986) * Carol Lee Scott (as 'Grotbags') (May 1986) * James Baker (June 1986 & April‚ÄìJune 1987) * Basil Brush (July 1986) * Elizabeth Estensen & John Hasler (as T-Bag & T-shirt) (August 1986) = Relief presenters = * Bryn Musselwhite (November 1998) * Liana Bridges (November 1998) (both CITV and Sooty Heights) * Vanessa Bewley (November/December 1998, January 1999 & June 1999) * Fearne Cotton (December 1998 & December 2000) * Ben Jones (February 1999 & June 1999) * Kate McIntyre (July 2003) * Anna Williamson (August‚ÄìSeptember 2003) * Mak Wilson as Mopatop from Mopatop's Shop (December 25, 1999)  Ratings  The CITV channel launched with a full-day average of 33,000 viewers and a 2.5% share of the child audience.

Its expressed aim is to \\"promote national economic development in a sustainable and socially balanced way.\\" Sydney Morning Herald economics editor Ross Gittins has described CEDA as seeking to \\"inform the public debate without lobbying\\". It is financed by around 700 members drawn from business, universities, governments and community groups, and by a program of conferences and other events. Foundation CEDA was formed in 1960 by Sir Douglas Copland, one of the most influential figures in Australian economics, and George Le Couteur OBE was President from 1968 until 1974. It was modelled on the US CED (Committee for Economic Development), but is now organised along lines more similar to the US Conference Board and the Conference Board of Canada. It is Australia's third-oldest think-tank, after the Institute of Public Affairs and the Australian Institute of International Affairs.James G. McGann and R. Kent Weaver (ed), Think Tanks and Civil Societies, Transaction Publishers, 2002, at p395 In 1979, after a debate on CEDA's involvement in lobbying, it established a 'Business Roundtable' as an independent entity which in 1983 was merged into the Business Council of Australia. Research approach In 2018 CEDA identified its policy stack ‚Äì technology and data; workplace, workforce and collaboration; population; critical services and institutions. These are issues and areas in which CEDA believes it can play an important role in advancing reforms that will drive progress and connect people to it and be the focus of CEDA's research and advocacy. Rather than identifying strongly with a particular ideological viewpoint in the style of the Centre for Independent Studies, the Institute of Public Affairs or the Australia Institute, it mostly offers conclusions that are near the centre of the policy spectrum. It tends to favour market-oriented or at least price- oriented solutions to issues such as water supply and infrastructure. However, a substantial amount of its social policy work ‚Äì for instance, on transitional labour markets ‚Äì is sympathetic to government intervention in appropriate circumstances.

Amortization refers to the process of paying off a debt (often from a loan or mortgage) over time through regular payments. A portion of each payment is for interest while the remaining amount is applied towards the principal balance. The percentage of interest versus principal in each payment is determined in an amortization schedule. The schedule differentiates the portion of payment that belongs to interest expense from the portion used to close the gap of a discount or premium from the principal after each payment. While a portion of every payment is applied towards both the interest and the principal balance of the loan, the exact amount applied to principal each time varies (with the remainder going to interest). An amortization schedule indicates the specific monetary amount put towards interest, as well as the specific amount put towards the principal balance, with each payment. Initially, a large portion of each payment is devoted to interest. As the loan matures, larger portions go towards paying down the principal. Methods of amortization There are different methods used to develop an amortization schedule. These include: *Straight line (linear) *Declining balance *Annuity *Bullet (all at once) *Balloon (amortization payments and large end payment) *Increasing balance (negative amortization) Amortization schedules run in chronological order. The first payment is assumed to take place one full payment period after the loan was taken out, not on the first day (the origination date) of the loan. The last payment completely pays off the remainder of the loan. Often, the last payment will be a slightly different amount than all earlier payments. In addition to breaking down each payment into interest and principal portions, an amortization schedule also indicates interest paid to date, principal paid to date, and the remaining principal balance on each payment date. Amortization schedule assumptions  This amortization schedule is based on the following assumptions: First, it should be known that rounding errors occur and, depending on how the lender accumulates these errors, the blended payment (principal plus interest) may vary slightly some months to keep these errors from accumulating; or, the accumulated errors are adjusted for at the end of each year or at the final loan payment. There are a few crucial points worth noting when mortgaging a home with an amortized loan. First, there is substantial disparate allocation of the monthly payments toward the interest, especially during the first 18 years of a 30-year mortgage. In the example below, payment 1 allocates about 80-90% of the total payment towards interest and only $67.09 (or 10-20%) toward the principal balance. The exact percentage allocated towards payment of the principal depends on the interest rate. Not until payment 257 or over two thirds through the term does the payment allocation towards principal and interest even out and subsequently tip the majority toward the former. For a fully amortizing loan, with a fixed (i.e., non-variable) interest rate, the payment remains the same throughout the term, regardless of principal balance owed. For example, the payment on the above scenario will remain $733.76 regardless of whether the outstanding (unpaid) principal balance is $100,000 or $50,000. Paying down more than the monthly contractual amount reduces the amount outstanding and thus the interest that is payable to the lender; if the contractual monthly payment stays the same, the number of payments and the term of the loan must decrease. Conversely, paying down less than the monthly contractual amount increases the amount outstanding and thus the interest payable (negative amortization); if the contractual monthly payment stays the same, the number of payments and the term of the loan must increase.

Carbonate hardness is usually expressed either in degrees KH (dKH) (from the German \\"Karbonath√§rte\\"), or in parts per million calcium carbonate ( ppm or grams per litremg/l). One dKH is equal to 17.848 mg/l (ppm) , e.g. one dKH corresponds to the carbonate and bicarbonate ions found in a solution of approximately 17.848 milligrams of calcium carbonate() per litre of water (17.848 ppm). Both measurements (mg/l or KH) are usually expressed as mg/l - meaning the concentration of carbonate expressed as if calcium carbonate were the sole source of carbonate ions. An aqueous solution containing 120 mg NaHCO3 (baking soda) per litre of water will contain 1.4285 mmol/l of bicarbonate, since the molar mass of baking soda is 84.007 g/mol. This is equivalent in carbonate hardness to a solution containing 0.71423 mmol/L of (calcium) carbonate, or 71.485 mg/l of calcium carbonate (molar mass 100.09 g/mol). Since one degree KH = 17.848 mg/L CaCO3, this solution has a KH of 4.0052 degrees. Carbonate hardness should not be confused with a similar measure Carbonate Alkalinity which is expressed in either [milli[equivalent]s] per litre (meq/L) or ppm. Carbonate hardness expressed in ppm does not necessarily equal carbonate alkalinity expressed in ppm. \\\\text{Carbonate Alkalinity CA (mg/L)} = [\\\\text{HCO}_3^-] + 2\\\\times[\\\\text{CO}_3^{2-}] whereas \\\\text{Carbonate Hardness CH (mg/L)} = [\\\\text{HCO}_3^-] + [\\\\text{CO}_3^{2-}] However, for water with a pH below 8.5, the CO32‚àí will be less than 1% of the HCO3‚àí so carbonate alkalinity will equal carbonate hardness to within an error of less than 1%. In a solution where only CO2 affects the pH, carbonate hardness can be used to calculate the concentration of dissolved CO2 in the solution with the formula CO2 = 3 √ó KH √ó 10(7-pH), where KH is degrees of carbonate hardness and CO2 is given in ppm by weight. The term carbonate hardness is also sometimes used as a synonym for temporary hardness, in which case it refers to that portion of hard water that can be removed by processes such as boiling or lime softening, and then separation of water from the resulting precipitate.

The 2,667 students who graduated during the academic year were awarded 2,568 academic certificates and 1,287 academic degrees. Adults age 18‚Äì24 years represent almost 48 percent of the WCC student body. According to data for the Fall 2017 semester, 812 international students attended Washtenaw Community College. These students receive additional support through the on- campus International Student Center. Many students receive financial aid in part because of the WCC Foundation. According to 2016-2017 school year data, the Foundation awarded approximately 1,000 scholarships, totaling more than $700,000. The Foundation oversees the Student Emergency Fund, a project that assists students with unexpected financial strains, including shutoff notices, car repairs, medical expenses and food. The Student Resource Center runs a food pantry that is free to WCC students. The college's Advanced Transportation Center was established to help build the talent pipeline for the mobility industry as well as meet the needs of incumbent workers to stay up-to-date on rapidly developing advanced manufacturing, intelligent transportation, and automotive technology. Since 2015, WCC has spent more than $8 million in equipment and facility upgrades for the center to outfit the college with state-of-the-art equipment to train the next generation of welders, technicians and engineers. This includes $4.4 million in funding awarded through the Michigan Community College Skilled Trades Equipment Program. Washtenaw Community College is publicly funded, with an annual operating budget in excess of $100 million; the college employs nearly 1,500 people in full- and part-time positions. WCC is one of the largest employers in Washtenaw County. The Washtenaw Voice is the student-run newspaper. Started in December 1966, they publish in the fall and winter semesters. Orchard Radio broadcasts live on the web and is one of the first internet-based radio formats produced by a college. The campus is home to the Washtenaw Technical Middle College, a charter high school whose graduates earn college degrees and certificates by taking classes alongside WCC students. Washtenaw Community College provides a nationally accredited and licensed child care facility in the Family Education Building for children age 18 months to 5 years. The service center was established in 1968 for WCC students, staff and faculty. The center offers a comprehensive child development program which emphasizes the child's self-identity and feeling of worth. Children are supported in strengthening learning in key areas through active learning, discovery, and problem solving. The college claims ownership of the largest fossiliferous limestone rock (55 tons and roughly 400 million years old) ever unearthed in the region.  Veteran Assistance  WCC opened a veterans‚Äô center in 2012 to centralize the work done to help veterans and active duty members transition to college. The center unveiled its new name ‚Äì Wadhams Veterans Center ‚Äì in November 2015, honoring Tim and Laurie Wadhams for their ongoing financial support of WCC, particularly student veterans. The Wadhams Veterans Center serves veterans and current military personnel, spouses and dependents of veterans, and students in the National Guard or reserves. The center seeks to integrate veterans into the college community by helping with their transition and offering any assistance veterans may need.  History  Washtenaw Community College welcomed students for its first semester in September 1966. Since there was no central campus at the time, the 1,200 students who enrolled in more than 30 occupational areas took classes at various sites throughout the county, including an elementary school, dairy farm, in a church basement as well as at a former fire station and the abandoned Willow Run bomber plant. The college purchased an apple orchard in December 1965 and began construction in the summer of 1967. WCC operations moved to the new campus (and former apple orchard) on Huron River Drive in September 1970. ' Presidents *Dr. Rose B. Bellanca - 2011‚Äìpresent *Dr. Larry L.

Name and geology The local descriptive name was reported in 1910 by Knopf (1912, fig 4), in United States Geological Survey. Blue Lake, as its name suggests, possesses a deep blue hue to its water. Blue Lake's water sources are partially from snowpack and small glaciers from the glacially carved, U-shaped, Blue Lake valley in which it lies. Dam Blue lake was first dammed in 1913 by Sitka Wharf and Power Company. It sold its operation to the city in 1942. Floods damaged the infrastructure in 1943 and 1947. Blue Lake was dammed again in 1958, greatly expanding the lake's size from to and increasing its height from to 342 ft. Dam fluctuations allow the lake elevation to vary up to . The Blue Lake dam, along with the Green Lake Dam, combine to make Sitka's mainstream power sources exclusively hydroelectric. Blue Lake Road is used to reach the lake from Sawmill Cove, allowing residents to use kayaks and canoes to more easily access peaks further up the Blue Lake valley, like Clarence Kramer Peak. Blue Lake Campground lies along this road. The road itself is very dangerous, often winding above cliff ledges. There are also many avalanche chutes located along the road which can pose a hazard or block it completely in winter. Water rights Currently, at the Sawmill Cove Industrial Park, there is a small water bottling operation utilizing the water that originates from the watershed.

Son of Francisco Olympio Sylvio, Octaviano Olympio studied as a young man in Nigeria and London before working with his brothers Chico and Cesar at a branch office of the British trading firm A. and F. Swanzy. In 1882, Octaviano and Chico were commissioned to open a new branch office in the growing trading center of Bey Beach on the Gulf of Guinea. The office was immediately successful, allowing the founding of the Olympio family in what would soon become the city of Lom√©. Following Chico's 1886 death, Octaviano continued to expand the office with help from older sisters Clara and Julia; he also bought property on Market Street, the city's key trading district, and in 1889 founded Lom√©'s first coconut plantation. By 1892, Octaviano Olympio was one of the most powerful citizens of the town, and instrumental in opening Lom√©'s first Catholic mission school. In 1903 he expanded successfully into cattle-raising. Olympio would also be prominent in Togo's anti-colonial movement. Records show that in 1891, Olympio was ordered flogged by Acting Commissioner Markus Graf von Pfeil over a dispute involving a horse; Olympio would be fined in both 1898 and 1899 for disobedience to the German authority. On May 24, 1909, he joined Ewe pastor Andreas Aku in petitioning the colonial government for greater rights, and signed a second petition in 1913. With the end of World War I, France took possession of Togo. Though Olympio greeted the new government with initial skepticism, he warmed to the French over time, learning the French language, traveling to Paris in 1924, and accepting several medals from the French government, including the prestigious Chevalier de la L√©gion d'honneur. Olympio died in 1940, leaving 24 children. One of his sons, Pedro, would go on to be the first Togolese doctor trained in Europe, while Octaviano's youngest son, Luciano, would go on to be the Attorney General of Togo's Supreme Court. His nephew Sylvanus (son of brother Epiphanio), would become both the first Prime Minister and the first President of independent Togo.

It is located about 2 km (1.2 miles) south of Nkayi (formerly known as Jacob), the country‚Äôs fourth largest city. Kayes is also the name of a district, of which the town of Kayes is the capital (). (See the map before page 1) The district of Kayes has population of 13,123 as of 2007. It is bordered to the east by the Madingou District, to the west by the Loudima District. At least 21 villages or sub-districts are located in the Kayes area, including Kayes, Dakar, Kilounga, Kimpalanga, Kimpambou, Kiossi (Kiosi), Kimbaouka (Kimbaoka), and Moutela. According to one paper on Tsetse control published in 1986, the population of the town of Kayes was around 1500 at that time. The town lies between the south bank of the Niari River and the north bank of the Livouba River, a tributary of the Niari. The Livouba joins the Niari about 2 km northwest of Kayes. The distance between the two rivers at Kayes is around 1‚Äì2 km. Although Kayes and Nkayi are very near each other, they are different areas, separated by the Livouba River, belonging to different municipalities. Kayes is the capital of the Kayes District, while Nkayi is an independent commune not belonging to any district, with more than five times the population of the whole Kayes District. In the past there was a district called Nkayi, which seems to have included both the present-day Nkayi Commune and Kayes District. Nkayi station of the Congo‚ÄìOcean Railway, a narrow gauge railway connecting Brazzaville to Pointe-Noire, is in the southern part of Nkayi, roughly 3 km (2 miles) south of Kayes.

Known as the Mynarski Memorial Lancaster in honour of Pilot Officer Andrew Charles Mynarski, it is painted in the markings of his aircraft. An Ontario Historical Plaque near the entrance commemorates Eileen Vollick's role in Ontario's heritage as Canada's first licensed female pilot. History On February 15, 1993, a fire destroyed one of the museum hangars. Destroyed in the fire were also the Hawker Hurricane, Grumman TBM Avenger, Auster, Stinson 105 and Supermarine Spitfire. In August and September 2014, the Mynarski Memorial Lancaster Bomber flew across the North Atlantic to RAF Coningsby to participate in six weeks of airshows and events across the United Kingdom. Unique to this tour, the Lancaster VeRA (as she became known due to her wartime VR-A markings) flew in close formation with the Royal Air Force - Battle of Britain Memorial Flight's Lancaster bomber PA474 for most of the 60 displays and events over the two months of the tour. Lancaster VeRA returned to Hamilton on September 29, 2014.

Stephanotis are grown for their strongly perfumed, waxy, tubular, usually white flowers. Leaves are opposite, ovate to elliptic, and leathery. Stephanotis is a beautiful but difficult plant - it hates sudden changes in temperature, needs constant cool conditions in winter and is attractive to scale and mealy bug. The stems of Stephanotis can reach 10 ft or more, but it is usually sold twined around a wire hoop. The heavily scented waxy flowers appear in summer. The best known species is Stephanotis floribunda (Madagascar jasmine), which is cultivated as a tropical or hothouse ornamental, and whose flowers are a popular element in wedding bouquets. The Stephanotis has grown in popularity over the past few years along with some of the other spring flowering vines.

Their primary language is the Waray language (also called Lineyte-Samarnon), an Austronesian language native to the islands of Samar, Leyte and Biliran, which together comprise the Eastern Visayas Region of the Philippines. Waray people inhabit the most part of Samar where they are called Samare√±os/Samarnons, the northern part of the island of Leyte where they are called Leyte√±os, and the island of Biliran. On Leyte island, the Waray people occupy the northern part of the island, separated from the Cebuano language-speaking Leyte√±os by a mountain range in the middle of the island. On the island of Biliran, Waray-Waray-speaking people live on the eastern part of the island facing the island of Samar; their Waray-Waray dialect is commonly referred to as Biliranon. On the island of Ticao, which belongs to the province of Masbate in the Bicol Region, Waray-Waray-speaking people live on most parts of the island; they are commonly referred to as Ticaonon. However, the Ticaonon have more affinity with the Masbate√±o-speaking people of Masbate, being their province-mates. The Bicolano language has more common vocabulary with the Waray-Waray language than with other Visayan languages (i.e. Cebuano or Ilonggo). Area The Waray people form the majority of the population in the provinces of Eastern Samar, Northern Samar, Samar while they form a significant population in Leyte, Southern Leyte, Biliran, and Sorsogon. History The Warays are descendants of the Austronesian-speaking immigrants who came to the Philippines during the Iron Age. In 1521, the Warays were the very first Filipinos to be sighted by Europeans under the leadership of Ferdinand Magellan. The Warays were among the first Filipinos converted to Christianity. Paradoxically, they are also among the last Filipino ethnicities to retain traditional pagan practices alongside their practice of Roman Catholicism.

Many also speak Cebuano as their second language. Some people of Waray descent speak Waray as their second or third language, especially among emigrants to Metro Manila, other parts of the Philippines and elsewhere in the world. Other notable foreign languages spoken include Spanish, Chinese and Japanese. Traditions Many Waray traditions can be traced to pre-colonial times. For example, the Kuratsa Dance, or Kuratsa de Mayor is a very popular traditional dance of the Waray-Waray at many social gatherings, especially weddings. It is very common throughout Samar. Initially thought to have originated from the la cucaracha (cockroach dance) of Mexico, it was later confirmed by the National Commission for Culture and the Arts that the dance was indeed indigenous Waray in origin, not Mexican. The dance depicts a courtship dance which exemplifies the movements of the rooster and the hen, which were prized commodities for the indigenous Waray people. Traditionally, the dance is played together with a rondalla or a live string band. The music used for the dance is complex, having a wide variety depending on the wishes of the musicians. In some cases, the rondalla also sings while the performers dance to the music. In Waray tradition, a sarayaw or social dancing event is never complete without the kuratsa. The dance is so integral to Waray culture that it is also exhibited in birthdays, weddings, baptisms, and even political and sports events. Traditionally, the dance area for the dancers are leveled, and not elevated, so that the spectators may surround them, whether the location is indoor or outdoor. To begin the dance, the parag-adu (the person who pairs the dancers) calls out the dancers first. The pairs then proceed to the paseo. The first dance move begins with the siki-siki (foot steps) or the tinikud-tikud (heel steps). Both of which are extremely rapid steps that keep both foot near each other. The couple who dances the Kuratsa are showered with money by the people around them. Both dancers afterwards wave their arms sideways or a little overhead, arms together or in alteration. Afterwards, the men will perform the sarakiki step, a rapid vibrating step performance that depicts the agility of the rooster. It includes mincing, skipping, hopping, and jumping combinations. Despite being brisque and rapid, the men are expected to execute the steps in a graceful manner where they seem to glide in space. For the women, they are expected to perform that languorous and wavy mabalud-balud steps. The basic format of the women's steps is based on a sub- step known as duon, which means 'to put weight on'. The usage of the duon makes the dancers of the mabalud-balud bounce with grace, if properly done. The best dancers of the mabalu-balud should be light, fluid, and fine in execution. As partners, the pairs should be synchronized with the moves that are designated as dual in nature. The pair dramatize the romantic palanat, a chasing pair step. The palanat depicts the man as chasing the women in pursue of love. The women are seen to reject the man initially, as to test if the man is serious in his pursuit. Once the man is rejected, it is expected for the man to turn back in grief, while the women will follow the man as if looking if the man is really in grief, all while executing the palanat. Once the grief has been proven, the dance proceeds to the dagit (swoop down steps) and wali (lift steps). The man afterwards will kneel and roll around while the woman manifests her prestige with poise as she sways and circles towards her partner. To make it more elaborate, there is also a gapus-gapusay or tying steps. In gapus-gapusay, the dancers are tied with kerchief at separate times. The tied partner is only released once the free partner immobilizes the sabwag, or dropping money on the scarf laid at the center of the ground. The sabwag notably depicts the dowry. Afterwards, both partners woo each other through steps that differentiate the man and the woman. The man uses the parayaw (showing off steps), while the woman uses the flirtatious lubay-lubay (hip sway steps). The dance traditionally ends with all dancers expected to exhibit finesse in the art form. The kuratsa is notably used in the Waray wedding ritual known as bakayaw. The bride and the groom are expected to dance the kuratsa, followed by the ninang and ninong (the principal sponsors of the marriage). During a bakayaw, people are mandated by tradition to throw money towards the dancing bride and groom. The thrown money is known as gala, and is collected and offered by the groom to the bride as the precursor of a married life. The friends and family of the couple usually throws a lot of money towards the couple as the Warays believe that the more money showered upon them, the more blessings shall arrive for the couple. In 2011, the performing art was cited by the National Commission for Culture and the Arts as one of the intangible cultural heritage of the Philippines under the performing arts category that the government may nominate in the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists. Universities Tacloban City in Leyte is home to a campus of the University of the Philippines. Leyte Normal University is also located in Tacloban. There are numerous state universities serving the region, including Eastern Samar State University, Eastern Visayas State University, Samar State University and the largest both in terms of land area and curricular offerings in the whole region, the University of Eastern Philippines located in Catarman, Northern Samar. There are also other colleges in (Western) Samar like St. Mary's College of Catbalogan, formerly Sacred Heart College and Samar College. Northwest Samar State University, formerly Tiburcio Tancinco Memorial Institute of Science and Technology and Samar State College of Agriculture and Forestry, offer courses that are needed in technology and business community. Stereotypes The Waray-Waray are often stereotyped as brave warriors, as in the popular phrase, Basta ang Waray, hindi uurong sa away, meaning \\"Waray never back down from a fight\\". Most of the negative connotation of this stereotype however, which depicted Warays as violent and callous, were caused by the notorious Waray-Waray gangs. July 25‚Äì31, 2011Bill filed to stop naming rob gangs after hometowns They are also known as contented people, so much so that, during the Spanish era, they were often called lazy, for being contented to live in simplicity as farmers, and for making tuba palm wine from coconut nectar. Warays are also known for their love of music, in particular the Kuratsa, a courtship dance with music based on native and Hispanic influences. Local artists often create Waray versions of popular songs, such as \\"An Bahal nga Tuba\\" that was based on a Mexican song. Crops The most important crop and major source of income for many is the coconut. Other major agricultural products include rice and corn, while sugarcane, abaca, and tobacco are also grown. Cassava and camote (sweet potato) are grown as supplementary staple crops. Pineapple, banana, mangoes, and other fruit are grown year round, as are many vegetables and peanuts. In Eastern Samar, a root crop known as palawan is grown. It is not common outside of that area, except in some parts of (Western) Samar like Basey and Marabut. Leyte is a big producer of bananas. Farming/Fishing Farming and fishing provide much of the livelihood of the Waray-Waray. There is an impressive variety of seafood available. Native wines are produced in the area, as in many places in the Philippines. The most common of these wines are tuba extracted from the coconut palm, \\"manyang\\" extracted from palm tree (common in the province of Northern Samar) and pangasi, made from fermented rice.

In an effort to achieve a standard set the classifications, representative bodies from Australia, Canada, South Africa, the USA and the UK reached a provisional agreement in 1997 on the definitions of each of the various mineral classifications. This was followed in 1998 to have these definitions incorporated into the International Framework Classification for Reserves and Resources - Solid Fuels and Mineral Commodities, developed by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe(UN-ECE). Mineral deposits can be classified as: * Mineral resources that are potentially valuable, and for which reasonable prospects exist for eventual economic extraction. * Mineral reserves or Ore reserves are valuable and legally, economically, and technically feasible to extract Classification, because it is an economic function, is governed by statutes, regulations and industry best practice norms. There are several classification schemes worldwide, the most commonly used are the Canadian CIM classification (see NI 43-101), the Australian Joint Ore Reserves Committee Code (JORC Code), the South African Code for the Reporting of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves (SAMREC) and the ‚Äúchessboard‚Äù classification scheme of mineral deposits by H. G. Dill. To ensure international standardization in the definitions of the various mineral classifications, an initiative was commenced by CRIRSCO to develop a template (largely based on the JORC Code) to assist countries in developing their own guidelines and regulations based upon global best practices. This template was recognized in the United Nations Framework Classification for ResourcesUnited Nations Framework Classification for Mineral resources A 'Mineral Resource' is a concentration or occurrence of material of intrinsic economic interest in or on the earth's crust in such form, quality and quantity that there are reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction. Mineral Resources are further sub-divided, in order of increasing geological confidence, into inferred, indicated and measured as categories. Inferred Mineral Resource is the part of a mineral resource for which quantity, grade (or quality) and mineral content can be estimated with a low level of confidence. It is inferred from geological evidence and assumed but not verified geological or grade continuity. It is based on information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill holes which may be of limited or uncertain quality and it is also reliability. Indicated resources are simply economic mineral occurrences that have been sampled (from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits and drill holes) to a point where an estimate has been made, at a reasonable level of confidence, of their contained metal, grade, tonnage, shape, densities, physical characteristics. Measured resources are indicated resources that have undergone enough further sampling that a 'competent person' (defined by the norms of the relevant mining code; usually a geologist has declared them to be an acceptable estimate, at a high degree of confidence, of the grade (or quality), quantity, shape, densities, physical characteristics of the mineral occurrence. Mineral reserves and ore reserves Mineral reserves (or ore reserves) are resources known to be economically feasible for extraction. Reserves are either Probable Reserves or Proved Reserves. A Probable Ore Reserve is the part of indicated, and in some circumstances, measured mineral resources that can be mined in an economically viable fashion. It includes diluting material and allowances for losses which may occur when the material is mined. A Probable Ore Reserve has a lower level of confidence than a Proved Ore Reserve but is of sufficient quality to serve as the basis for decision on the development of deposit. A Proved Ore Reserve is the part of Measured resources that can be mined in an economically viable fashion. It includes diluting materials and allowances for losses which occur when the material is mined. A Proved Ore Reserve represents the highest confidence category of reserve estimate. The style of mineralization or other factors could mean that Proved Ore Reserves are not achievable in some deposits. Generally the conversion of resources into reserves requires the application of various modifying factors, including: *mining and geological factors, such as knowledge of the geology of the deposit sufficient that it is predictable and verifiable; extraction and mine plans based on ore models; quantification of geotechnical risk--basically, managing the geological faults, joints, and ground fractures so the mine does not collapse; and consideration of technical risk--essentially, statistical and variography to ensure the ore is sampled properly: *metallurgical factors, including scrutiny of assay data to ensure accuracy of the information supplied by the laboratory --required because ore reserves are bankable. Essentially, once a deposit is elevated to reserve status, it is an economic entity and an asset upon which loans and equity can be drawn--generally to pay for its extraction at (hopefully) a profit; *economic factors; *environmental factors; *marketing factors; *legal factors; *political factors; and *social factors See also * Economic geology * Mineral economics * Mineral exploration * Ore genesis * Ore * National Instrument 43-101 * United Nations Framework Classification for Resources * Valuation (finance) #Valuation of mining projects References External links * Official CRIRSCO website * JORC Code * University of Western Australia Mining Law Centre * U.S. Geological Survey Circular 831, Principles of a Resource/Reserve Classification for Minerals * Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum - CIM Definition Standards - On Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves (PDF Format) * The Canadian Council of Professional Geoscientists CCPG * National Instrument (NI) 43-101 Standards for Disclosure of Mineral Properties (Canada) * The South African SAMVAL, SAMREC and SAMOG Codes * United Nations Framework Classification of Resources * Official PERC website Category:Economic geology Category:Mineral economics ","title":"Mineral resource classification"},{"id":"3426767","text":"CJCB may refer to: * CJCB (AM), a radio station (1270 AM) licensed to Sydney, Nova Scotia, Canada * CJCB-TV, a television station (channel 4) licensed to Sydney, Nova Scotia, Canada * CKPE-FM, a radio station (94.9 FM) licensed to Sydney, Nova Scotia, Canada, which held the call sign CJCB-FM from 1957 to 1981 ","title":"CJCB"},{"id":"3426768","text":"CKCW may refer to: * CKCW-FM, a radio station (94.5 FM) licensed to Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada * CKCW-TV, a television station (channel 2) licensed to Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada ","title":"CKCW"},{"id":"3426783","text":"Shut-in may refer to: *Shut-in (river), a river that's naturally confined within a deep, narrow channel *A shut-in is a person confined indoors, especially as a result of physical or mental disability agoraphobia.

The village developed during the second half of the 19th century with the building of a school in 1862, stores, a church, a blacksmith's establishment and town hall, the establishment of a general goods carrier and the influx of agricultural workers. In 1890 the village changed its name to Barry ‚Äì probably in honour of a Caleb Barry, who was the former bank manager of nearby Blayney and a vigorous member of the Church of England in that town. Indeed, the streets of Barry are named after clergy (including bishops) of the time, such as Barber, Moorhouse, Hale, Marsden, Pearson, Sawyer, Turner, Selwyn and Staunton. Barry today Today all the public buildings except for St James Anglican Church, the school and the community hall are closed. Other public buildings, such as the Post Office, the stores, the school residence and the former Roman Catholic Church of St Therese, are private residences. Barry's streets, other than the intersection of Selwyn and Sawyer Streets, remain unsealed. Water resources have, however, improved, with water now flowing from a hilltop tank that is constantly supplied by a bore.

J. Cronin first published in 1950. The first edition for Australia and New Zealand was in 1953. A serial version appeared in Collier's under the title of To Live Again. Adaptations It has been adapted for both film and television. The British film version (1959) was directed by Jack Cardiff and featured Van Johnson and Vera Miles. A television adaptation was broadcast on CBS in 1957, and was produced by David Susskind and directed by Sidney Lumet. It starred Farley Granger, Peggy Ann Garner, Torin Thatcher, Brian Donlevy, and Shelley Winters. A Bengali version, Sabar Uparey starring Uttam Kumar, Suchitra Sen and Chhabi Biswas was made in 1955. A Bollywood version, Kala Pani (1958), was directed by Raj Khosla and starred Dev Anand and Madhubala. A Telugu version, Poola Rangadu (1967), loosely based on the novel, was directed by Adurthi Subba Rao and starred ANR and Jamuna. 1970 Tamil movie En Annan starring MGR was also based on this movie. Plot summary Paul Mathry, a student about to graduate and embark upon a teaching career, finds out that his father was convicted for murder, a secret that his mother had hidden from him since his childhood. Driven by an intense desire to see his father, Paul sets out to visit him in prison, only to find out that visitors are never allowed there. From there, he meets the primary witnesses in the case that convicted his father, not all of whom are supportive to Paul's cause. He encounters several dead ends but he persists, with the help of a store girl named Lena and a news reporter. His persistent campaign finally bears fruit. Rees Mathry, Paul's father, goes on appeal and is vindicated. The novel ends with Paul's father, a hardened, cynical man, seeing a fleeting hope for self-renewal and a purposeful life. From the book cover: 'In this, his latest and most exciting novel, A. J. Cronin tells of a son and his father, of a crime of passion and a crime of injustice, of a bond of loyalty that reached across fifteen years towards a man broken, brutalized, and forgotten within prison walls. Paul Burgess at twenty-one was mature and level-headed, a successful student and a good son to his \\"widowed\\" mother. But his life turned to a nightmare when he discovered that he was the son of a convicted murderer who was even then serving the fifteenth year of his life sentence. The suspense mounts as Paul's inquiries not only resurrect long-buried fears and hatred but also bring threats and pressure from high places as he penetrates further into the mystery surrounding the crime and grows more and more convinced of his father's innocence. From then on the story is of Paul's desperate struggle for his father's release, supported only by a few loyal friends and by the girl he loves. The dramatic force of 'Beyond This Place' is heightened by its social significance and by the warm human understanding that has characterized A. J. Cronin's work from 'Hatter's Castle' onwards. To read it is an experience that will be long remembered.' References External links * Category:1953 British novels Category:Novels by A. J.

Shut-ins are inherently confined to a narrow valley or canyon, with the river valley widening out both above and below the formation. Because the rock resists downcutting, streams typically descend at relatively steep gradient through shut-ins, with the downstream terminus of the formation often marked by a very large plunge pool. The river becomes unnavigable at shut-ins even by canoe due to the rapids and narrow channels. Johnson's Shut-Ins State Park in Missouri, with its hard rhyolite and a diabase dike that divert the Black River into many small streamlets following a complex joint system, is the most well known example.Beveridge, p.39 - 62 More than ninety other shut‚Äìins occur within and around the St. Francois Mountains region of southeast Missouri. The term has an origin in Appalachia, where it was used to refer to a narrow river gorge confined by resistant rock layers. In southern Illinois, the Burden Falls Wilderness area includes a narrow canyon below a waterfall that is confined by a resistant sandstone layer. The gorge is referred to as a shut‚Äìin, following the Appalachian usage for the term. See also * References *Beveridge, T.

It contains significant paintings by Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio and Annibale Carracci, two of the most important masters of Italian Baroque art, dating from 1600-1601. History =Precursor: Foscari Chapel= Before the present-day edifice another funerary chapel on the same spot was dedicated to the Virgin Mary. It was built by Pietro Foscari, the Cardinal of Venice. Johann Burchard notes in his diary that the cardinal died on 11 August 1485. \\"His body was then transferred to the city, and given over for burial in a chapel of the Church of Santa Maria del Popolo, which he had built for himself\\", states Burchard.The Diary of John Burchard of Strasburg, trans. Arnold Harris Mathew, Vol I. A. D. 1483-1492, London, 1910, p. 110 This construction obviously correlated to the general rebuilding of the basilica by Pope Sixtus IV which began in 1472. The Cardinal of Venice was an influential person in the Roman court and Italian politics. It seems an obvious choice that he built himself a chapel in the Pope's favourite church in a very prominent position in the left transept. The construction might have begun in 1476. The chapel was covered by a barrel vault with a depth equal to the 15th century arch of the papal chapel. According to the will of the patron, the sarcophagus, which was due to host his remains, was placed at the center of the edifice. Due to its particular placement and visibility the sarcophagus was decorated on all four sides. This arrangement was markedly different than the Florentine type wall tombs of the basilica. Probably it was modelled after the tomb of Pope Sixtus IV by Pollaiolo or even more after other 15th century sculptural works in the city of Siena. This sepulchral monument is the only remaining vestige of the demolished chapel. Now it is placed in the Costa Chapel in the right aisle. The bronze gisant is attributed to a Sienese sculptor, Giovanni di Stefano, a follower of Vecchietta, who was commissioned by the heirs of Cardinal Pietro Foscari and used a funerary mask for the modelling of the face.Antonio Foscari: Il cardinale veneziano Pietro Foscari e lo scultore senese Giovanni di Stefano in Santa Maria del Popolo a Roma, in: \\"Arte Documento\\", n. 14, Edizioni della Laguna, Gorizia 2000, pp. 59-63 =Tiberio Cerasi's chapel= The funeral monument of Tiberio Cerasi.The patronage rights of the chapel were purchased on 8 July 1600 by Monsignor Tiberio Cerasi, Treasurer-General of Pope Clement VIII. He bought the chapel from the Augustinian friars with the option to rebuild and adorn it \\"in the manner and form\\" he wanted to. The edifice was reconfigured by Carlo Maderno who was referred to as the architect of the still unfinished chapel in the 2 May 1601 codicil to Cerasi's will. In September Cerasi contracted Caravaggio to paint two panels for the side walls; the contract with Annibale Caracci for the altarpiece has not been preserved. The commissions went to the leading artists in Rome at the time. Caracci painted The Assumption of Mary while Caravaggio depicted the Conversion of Saint Paul and the Crucifixion of Saint Peter on the lateral walls. Cerasi's choice of the Assumption for the altar seems straightforward enough, while the other two paintings honoured the Apostles central to the foundation of the Catholic Church as well as popular Counter-Reformation themes of conversion and martyrdom. The precedent already existed for this juxtaposition in the Cappella Paolina at the Apostolic Palace by Michelangelo.Lilian H. Zirpolo, cit., pag. 91. Saint Peter and Paul were also the patrons of Rome and they had a strong connection with the papacy. Because Tiberio Cerasi did not belong to the ranks of the Roman aristocracy and he made his career and fortune in the Roman Curia, it was important to emphasize his proximity to papal power and the Church of Rome. The first versions of the Caravaggio paintings were rejected by the patron and then Caravaggio painted two canvasses instead of the cypress panels as it had been formerly stipulated. The story of the rejection of the first versions was recorded by Giovanni Baglione in his 1642 Life of Caravaggio.Heather Nolin: \\"Non piacquero al Padrone: A Reexamination of Caravaggio's Cerasi Crucifixion of St. Peter, in:Rutgers Art Review 24 (2008), p. 41 Tiberio Cerasi died on 3 May 1601 and was buried in the chapel. In his will he named the Hospital of the Madonna della Consolazione as his heir with the responsibility to complete the unfinished chapel.Christopher L. C. E. Witcombe, cit., pag. 22. Annibale's altarpiece was probably already complete at the time while Caravaggio was paid on 10 November 1601 for his work.William Breazeale: ¬´Un gran soggetto ma non ideale¬ª: Caravaggio and Bellori‚Äôs legacy, Kunsttexte.de. 1/2001, p. 1 The paintings were finally installed in the chapel by a woodworker named Bartolomeo in May 1605, and the chapel was consecrated on 11 November 1606.Heather Nolin, cit., pag. 48. The chapel was acquired by a descendant of the family, Antonio Cerasi, count of Monterado in 1853 who subsequently restored it.Enzo Bentivoglio, Simonetta Valtieri: Santa Maria del Popolo a Roma. Bardi, 1976, p. 99 Description Preparatory study for the Coronation of the Virgin on the vault.The oblong shaped chapel consists of a sail-vaulted anteroom and a narrower, barrel-vaulted chancel with the altar. The space is lit dimly by light coming through a lunette window on the back wall. The arched entrance is closed by a balustrade of colourful marble. The focal point of the architecture is the altar. It was built of white and colourful marble in the shape of an aedicule adorned with two large Corinthian columns, two half-pilasters and a broken pediment. The Cerasi coat-of-arms is depicted in the center of the stained glass lunette window. From the outside the chapel is invisible because it is hemmed in by the neighbouring parts of the basilica and a narrow, walled courtyard. The architect skillfully maximized the very small space left between the presbytery (on the right) and the 16th-century Theodoli Chapel (on the left), and created the impression of \\"a miniature Latin-cross church, complete with transept, domed crossing, and choir. The nave [...] is supplied by the visitor's motion, his sense of direction and focus\\".Leo Steinberg: Observations in the Cerasi Chapel, in: The Art Bulletin, Vol. 41, No. 2 (Jun., 1959), p. 183 Coronation of the Virgin and side panels by Innocenzo Tacconi.Caravaggio's dramatically lit and foreshortened paintings are intended to be viewed from the side rather than straight-on, and draw the eye to Carracci's frontally presented Assumption, so that the chapel is aesthetically united despite the very different styles of the two artists. According to Steinberg the light on the Caravaggio paintings comes from the painted heaven on the vault of the anteroom, inhabited by the dove of the Holy Spirit.Leo Steinberg, cit., pag. 185. On the other hand, Varriano claims that the \\"source\\" of the light seems to be the clerestory window across the transept.John L. Varriano, cit., pag. 44. The chapel is decorated in exuberant Baroque style. The frescos on the short barrel-vault of the chancel depict the Coronation of the Virgin (central medaillon) and the visions of Sts Peter and Paul, Domine quo vadis and Saint Paul Transported to the Third Heaven (side panels), both set in rich gilded stucco frames. The frame of the central medaillon is held by four stucco putti. The paintings were executed by Innocenzo Tacconi, an able assistant of Annibale Carracci, and at least the coronation scene was designed by Carracci himself. This is proved by a detailed preparatory drawing of the figure of Christ in almost the same position as in the executed fresco which was preserved in the Louvre. A far less elaborate sketch of the meeting of Christ and St Peter in front of a city gate, which was made for the Domine quo vadis panel by Carracci, was identified by Hans Tietze in the collection of the Albertina.Hans Tietze: Annibale Carraccis Galerie im Palazzo Farnese und seine r√∂mische Werkst√§tte, Jahrbuch der Kunsthistorischen Sammlungen des Allerh√∂chsten Kaiserhauses, Vienna, 1906, p. 135 Baglione identified the right-hand panel as Paul in Third Heaven (mentioned in the Second Letter to the Corinthians) while others believe it represents Christ ordering Paul to leave Jerusalem (Acts 22:17-21) or even a synthesis of the two episodes. The setting of the fresco is celestial with Christ surrounded by angels and reclining on clouds. On the right is the constellation of Ursa Major, perhaps a hidden signature of Annibale, playing on the assonance of the word carro (meaning cart, the constellation is also known as Grande Carro in Italian) and his own surname, Carracci.John Rupert Martin, The Farnese Gallery, 1965, pp. 142-144. Iconographically the side panels \\"relate to the Caravaggio paintings in that they manifest the divine cause of what passes below\\" them. Similarly the Coronation scene is placed above Carracci's Assumption as a direct continuation. The vault forms a celestial zone in close contact with the three famous paintings below. These relationships indicate that the artists worked in a compositional framework conceived by the patron or even more his friend and artistic adviser, Marchese Vincenzo Giustiniani. (That Caravaggio received 50 scudi as advance payment from Giustiniani, when he signed the contract to the two paintings, may be a hint to his role.) Scenes from the life of PeterThe intrados of the arch between the chancel and the anteroom is decorated with white-gold stucco panels with two putti holding a wreath (top) and angels playing the harp and the flute (above the cornice). The stucco decoration on the pillars is similar but the figurative panels are gilded. The panels are directly related to the paintings of Caravaggio because they depict episodes from the life of St Peter and St Paul. The episodes from the life of Paul are on the right (from the top to bottom): Paul and Barnabas in Lystra refusing the sacrifice of a bull by the priest of Jove (Acts 14:8-18); Saul's baptism by Ananias (Acts 9:10-21) and The stoning of Stephen (Acts 7:54-60) which Saul had witnessed guarding the coats of the executioners. The episodes from the life of Peter are on the left (from the top to bottom): Peter delivered from prison (Acts 12:6-11); The Fall of Simon Magus (Acts of Peter XXXII) and Peter and John healing the cripple (Acts 3:1-10). The lower zone of the walls, up to a height of 2.2 m from the floor, is covered with fake painted marble, interspersed with real white and black marble slabs. The other surfaces are decorated with dense white-gold floral motifs. The frescos in the anteroom of the chapel depict the Holy Spirit in the central oval medaillon and the Evangelists with their usual symbols and helpful putti on a golden background. The Doctors of the Church (Saint Augustine and Jerome; Saint Ambrose and Gregory the Great) are in the two lunettes. The oval form is repeated in the pattern of the terracotta pavement. The frescos of the anteroom were attributed to Giovanni Battista Ricci by Giovanni Baglione in his Lives.Giovanni Baglione: Le Vite de‚Äô pittori, scultori et architetti, Naples, 1733, p. 141 The attribution is generally accepted by modern scholars. Two preparatory studies for the lunette paintings are preserved in the Louvre.La fabrique des saintes images. Rome‚ÄìParis, 1580‚Äì1660, Louvre, Dossier de presse, 2015, p. 30 Four golden putti in the spandrels seem to support the vault. As Giovanni Battista Ricci was a dependable but rather mediocre artist compared to Carracci and Caravaggio, Tiberio Cerasi's heirs probably chose him to complete the unfinished chapel in a quick and economical way. There are funeral monuments on the lateral walls of the anteroom, one for Tiberio Cerasi, the founder of the chapel on the left and another for his father, Stefano Cerasi (‚Ä†1575) and his mother, Bartolomea Manardi on the right (‚Ä†1573). These are typical Baroque wall monuments with the carved busts of the deceased set in oval niches, curved broken pediments and long epitaphs. The projecting heads are turned towards the altar. The monuments have painted backgrounds with rich draperies and flaming urns. The tomb itself, where his father, mother and brother had been buried, was mentioned in Tiberio Cerasi's will in 1598; it was probably located under the floor of the transept. The 19th-century Neoclassical tomb of Teresa Pelzer, a young German woman from Aachen and the wife of Count Antonio Cerasi, was inserted into the wall under the monument of Tiberio Cerasi. She died in 1852 at the age of 27 in childbirth and her baby died with her. Their sculpture was created by Giuseppe Tenerani who finished the monument in 1857.Oreste Raggi, Della vita e delle opere di Pietro Tenerani, del suo tempo e della sua scuola nella scultura, libri tre. Successori Le Monnier, 1880, p. 483 The Latin inscription on their grave says: Post tenebras spero lucem (After Darkness I Hope Light). Teresa Pelzer is portrayed sleeping on her bed, and she is holding her dead child on her breast. The benefactor of the public hospital of San Giacomo degli Incurabili, Paolo M. Martinez (‚Ä†1833) was buried under the pavement,Vincenzo Forcella. \\"Iscrizioni delle chiese e d'altri edifici di Roma dal secolo XI fino ai nostri giorni.\\" Roma (1869): vol.1, p. 400 but his monument was placed on the external left pillar.

Following AJW's closure, she continued to work in other joshi promotions such as Gaea and NEO. .  Career  Manami Toyota made her professional wrestling debut on August 5, 1987, at the age of 16, in a singles match against Sachiko Nakamura.John Molinaro, The Top 100 Pro Wrestlers of All Time, (Winding Stair Press: 2002), p. 208. Her big break came in her second year, on the first Wrestlemarinpiad show from Yokohama Arena, on May 6, 1989. Teamed with Mima Shimoda as the Tokyo Sweethearts, she defeated Etsuko Mita and Toshiyo Yamada in a match that nearly stole the card from the more established veterans. The bout had all the basic ingredients that made Toyota a star, including flashy moves, fast and frequent tags, double-team moves, and a long series of dramatic near falls. When the bout was released as part of a four-hour commercial tape, Toyota became recognized as a wrestler to watch. Toyota won her first title on November 18, 1989, when she defeated Mika Takahashi for the AJW Championship. She defended the title three times, including one defense against her future rival Kyoko Inoue (on August 1, 1990), before vacating it on September 1. The following month (October 7 in Tokyo) she challenged Bison Kimura for the All Pacific Championship and emerged victorious. However, she only managed to defend the title once before losing to Suzuka Minami on March 17, 1991. Parallel to this success ran Toyota‚Äôs feud with future tag-team partner Toshiyo Yamada. Initially, following Tokyo Sweethearts' success, the AJW braintrust felt they could well be the new Beauty Pair or Crush Gals. However, Toyota's real chemistry came not with Shimoda but with Yamada, whose style was unlike Toyota's and provided more of a contrast. Yamada was a slightly built, short-haired, kicking specialist, who idolized both Chigusa Nagayo and Akira Maeda. Unlike other wrestlers who rely on kicks and submissions, Yamada could also work the rapid- paced matches and was accomplished at building to near-falls with repeated kick-outs at the last possible moment. To begin with, however, Toyota and Yamada were opponents rather than partners. Between 1989 and 1991 they wrestled many times. At the start of 1992, the two won their first tag team championship when they defeated KAORU and Lady Apache in Tokyo on January 19 for the UWA Women's World Tag Team Championship. Their singles feud was not yet over, however, and it reached a climax on August 15, 1992 in a Hair vs. Hair match. The bout was a dramatic one, not least due to what occurred after the match was over. Toyota, even though she had won the match, did not want Yamada to get her head shaved, and had to be forcefully restrained by four prelim girls, who eventually forced her back to the mat. In respect of the match conditions, Yamada wanted her head shaved and went ahead with the stipulation. Soon after this match the two stars once again teamed up to win their first WWWA World Tag Team Championship in March 1992, defeating Jungle Jack (Aja Kong and Bison Kimura) in Tokyo. On November 26, at AJW‚Äôs Dreamrush show Toyota and Yamada defended their WWWA Tag Team titles against Dynamite Kansai and Mayumi Ozaki in a 2/3 Falls match, which was rated 5 Stars by Dave Meltzer of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter. In April of that year, Toyota furthered her singles career by defeating rival Kyoko Inoue on April 25 in Yokohama for the IWA Singles Championship. Toyota defended that title eight times over the course of three years, before losing it to Reggie Bennett on May 15, 1995. It was at around this time that Toyota's talent was being compared to most male competitors, as one of the best wrestlers in the world. At Dreamslam II, on April 11, 1993 Toyota and Yamada fought a rematch against JWP Joshi Puroresu's Kansai and Ozaki in yet another highly rated two of three falls encounter. This time, however, Toyota and Yamada were on the losing side, and Kansai and Ozaki got their revenge. The feud concluded at AJW‚Äôs St. Battle Final event, on December 6, 1993, where Toyota and Yamada regained their tag titles. On August 24, 1994 Toyota once again squared off against Kyoko Inoue and defeated her to unify the IWA and All Pacific Singles Championships. Toyota‚Äôs run with the two titles was not to last long. On October 9, Inoue gained a measure of revenge against Toyota, as Kyoko and her partner Takako Inoue (no relation) won the WWWA Tag Team Championship from Toyota and Yamada. Toyota then vacated her All Pacific Championship, prior to her first WWWA Heavyweight Championship match against the monstrous Aja Kong at AJW‚Äôs Queendom III show, on March 26, 1995. The match saw Toyota reach the summit of AJW when she won and became the 39th WWWA World Single Champion. On May 7, Toyota defended her crown against arch-rival Kyoko Inoue at the Korakuen Hall, where the two fought to a 60-minute time limit draw. Despite piledrivers on the floor, German suplexes off the top rope, and multiple finishers, neither combatant was able to secure outright victory. Nonetheless, Toyota retained, and the match was voted Match of the Year for 1995 in the Wrestling Observer Newsletter. Manami Toyota is also the only woman to have competed in 14 matches that were given a 5-Star rating by the Wrestling Observer. The following month, Toyota lost the WWWA Championship to former champion Aja Kong, on June 27. Toyota soon recovered from the loss. In 1995, she won the AJW Grand Prix tournament, securing her position as the number one contender for the WWWA Championship. Before she received her title opportunity, she faced Akira Hokuto at AJW's Destiny show on September 2, 1995. On December 4, she finally received her title shot and defeated then- champion Dynamite Kansai to become a two-time world champion. Over the next 12 months, Toyota made three successful defenses of her WWWA title. In December 1996 she came up against long term rival Kyoko Inoue and lost in a match that saw the All Pacific and IWA Women's World titles unified with the WWWA Title. On November 28, 1998, Toyota faced the legendary Chigusa Nagayo in a one-time- only legends bout that saw arguably the two best female wrestlers ever go at it. Nagayo came out victorious in a 15-minute match. Toyota was brought in by Aja Kong to Chigusa Nagayo's Gaea Japan wrestling group. She feuded with her old partner Toshiyo Yamada, as well as Dynamite Kansai. She competed there from 2002 to 2004 before moving on. Toyota put her wrestler career on hiatus after her August 2007 Tribute Show, where she wrestled in every match. She returned to action in the following year. On a Wrestling Observer poll taken on March 20, 2009, Toyota was voted as the greatest female wrestler of all time, garnering 31% of the vote. Chikara in April 2011 On July 25, 2010, it was announced that Toyota would make her first wrestling appearance in the United States, wrestling for the Chikara promotion in September. On September 18, 2010, in Baltimore, Maryland, Toyota defeated Daizee Haze in her first match on American soil. The following day in Brooklyn, New York, Toyota and Mike Quackenbush defeated the Bruderschaft des Kreuzes (Claudio Castagnoli and Sara Del Rey) in a tag team match. On February 10, 2011, Chikara announced that Toyota would be returning to the promotion in April to take part in the 2011 King of Trios tournament, where she would team up with Jigsaw and Mike Quackenbush. On April 15, Toyota, Jigsaw and Quackenbush defeated Amazing Red, Joel Maximo and Wil Maximo in their first round match in the 2011 King of Trios. The following day, Toyota, Jigsaw and Quackenbush were eliminated from the tournament by Team Michinoku Pro (Dick Togo, Great Sasuke and Jinsei Shinzaki). On April 17, the final day of the tournament, Toyota defeated Madison Eagles in a singles match. Toyota returned to Chikara on December 2, 2011, to take part in the special JoshiMania weekend, defeating Toshie Uematsu on night one. She was also presented with the Diva Dirt Legacy Award, honoring her career. The following day, Toyota teamed with Mike Quackenbush, Fire Ant and Soldier Ant to defeat Chuck Taylor, Icarus, Johnny Gargano and Portia Perez in an eight-person tag team match. On the third and final night of the tour, Toyota, Hanako Nakamori and Sawako Shimono were defeated by Aja Kong, Mio Shirai and Tsubasa Kuragaki in a six-woman tag team match. On September 14, 2012, Toyota made yet another return to Chikara to team with Jigsaw and Mike Quackenbush in the 2012 King of Trios, with the three defeating combatAnt, deviAnt and Soldier Ant in their first round match. The following day, the team was eliminated from the tournament, after losing to Team Sendai Girls (Dash Chisako, Meiko Satomura and Sendai Sachiko). On the third and final day of the tournament, Toyota teamed with Kaori Yoneyama in a tag team match, where they were defeated by Command Bolshoi and Tsubasa Kuragaki. Back in Japan, Toyota produced her 25th anniversary event on September 22, during which she wrestled in all five matches. On March 17, 2017, Toyota announced that she would retire from professional wrestling on November 3 with her final match at a special thirty-anniversary show in Japan. Toyota's retirement event featured a series of one-minute time limit matches, which Toyota finished with a record of 12 wins, 29 draws and 10 losses. Toyota then had her retirement match with no time limit against her hand-picked successor, Tsukasa Fujimoto, which she won with the Japanese Ocean Cyclone Suplex. However, Toyota demanded a rematch and went on to defeat Fujimoto again with the Japanese Ocean Queen Bee Bomb. Toyota and Fujimoto then had a third match, where Fujimoto was victorious with Toyota's own Japanese Ocean Cyclone Suplex, bringing Toyota's thirty-year career to an end.

It was believed to be the largest artificial ski resort in Europe with a sports shop, bar, restaurant and a range of slopes which included a Snowflex nursery slope, a Dendix recreational slope and a freestyle park consisting of a half pipe, hip jump, kicker, a quarter pipe and various grind rails. Facilities The first slope at the ski village opened in October 1988. The ski village proved popular and by the end of 1990 the ski village had 8 slopes. During 1991 to 1994 the ski village underwent a significant re-design - adding a ski lodge, bar and shops. The slopes were also re-designed during this period to add a half pipe and moguls. In subsequent years additional facilities were added including an aerials water ramp and a toboggan run. In addition to the Ski Village slopes there was a ten pin bowling alley, quad biking, laser tag and a downhill biking track designed by Steve Peat. Ski Village Bowling housed a state of the art ten pin bowling alley which opened in 2009. The full sized ten pin bowling lanes were built with Brunswick technology. Activities The Sheffield Sharks Ski Club met at Sheffield Ski Village on Saturday mornings and Thursday evenings. The club was formed in 1990 to promote children's skiing, both at recreational and competitive levels. In 2004, the club became the CCPR UK Sports Club of the Year. The club was run on a voluntary basis by an elected committee of parents, with a dedicated team of instructors. Older members had the opportunity to become ski instructors themselves, and often instructed the younger children on the Saturday sessions. Sharks Ski Club continues to thrive but now meets at Xscape, Castleford on Saturday mornings from 9-11 am. The Sheffield Ski Village was also one of the main training grounds for the Yorkshire Freestyle Squad and many professional freestyle skiers, such as James Woods and Katie Summerhayes. Other significant British athletes who trained at Sheffield Ski Village include Ellie Koyander (Women's Moguls, 2010 Winter Olympics) and Paddy Graham (Pro freeskier sponsored by Red Bull.) Most of the former were also active members of the Sheffield Sharks Ski Club during their childhood and early teenage years. Fires On 29 April 2012, the main building of the Ski Village was destroyed by a fire. The blaze occurred in the early hours of the morning and no-one was injured. This fire was subsequently ruled to have started accidentally, with subsequent fires on the site being treated as arson. On 1 May 2012, a small hut at the top of the main slope containing controls for the ski lifts was destroyed in a second fire in the early hours of the morning. On 21 May 2012, the former snowflex nursery slope was partially destroyed in a third fire, again started deliberately. On 24 April 2013, the remaining wooden outbuildings of the former Adventure Mountain outdoor playground were set on fire, destroying the only remaining infrastructure on the site. By August 2016 the site had suffered from approximately 50 arson attacks. On 11 April 2017, a further arson attack at the site occurred after two fires were started. On 22 September 2017, a fire broke out in the old pump house in an incident thought to be an accident caused by another bonfire nearby. On 14 October 2017, a fire broke out at the site and the fire brigade were called, who found some fly tipped items and some of the material used to make the old ski slopes alight. On 6 June 2018, the site was again reported to be on fire. An unrelated wildfire on adjacent grassland swept into the Ski Village site on 2 September 2018, causing further damage to numerous buildings and structures on the site. Since the initial fire, the site has remained closed to the public aside from a brief attempt by the Sharks Ski Club to hold sessions in May 2012, which were stopped when the ski lift motors and power ancillaries were stolen. The site has stood derelict and has been blighted by significant fly tipping, gypsy traveller site use, theft, arson and vandalism ever since. Campaign to rebuild A local campaign group formed by members of the former slope management staff has been started with the objective of eventually reopening the former Ski Village site and operating it as a hub for snowsports excellence in the UK. The Snowsport for Sheffield group is headed by former Ski School manager Al Bister, and Paul Yiend former Snowboard Instructor and has already generated significant support from local residents and notable press coverage. On 9 December 2016, Sheffield City Council asked for potential investors to propose future uses for the site. The preferred uses for the site by the council are for a snowsports centre or mountain bike centre. Developers had until 7 April 2017 to submit their proposals. However, due to stronger than expected interest in development for the site Sheffield City Council extended the deadline by a further two weeks till 21 April. On 28 November 2017 it was announced that developers Extreme wanted to rebuild on the site, and redevelop a ¬£22.5 million extreme sports centre. And on 28 January 2019 Sheffield City Council agreed a loan of ¬£4.8 million towards the project.

Azahari, was a Brunei politician. According to Historian Hussaymiya, it is not possible to verify the truth about his 'Brunei birth'. Many people claimed he was born in Labuan, but Azahari strongly deined the claims and said he was born in Brunei Town in a house on the site where the Churchill Memorial Museum (currently Royal Regalia Museum) was later built.Hussainmiya, B. A. (1995). Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddin III and Britain: The Making of Brunei Darussalam. Oxford University Press, USA. p.110 Born of mixed Arab-Malay heritage in Labuan, he was educated in Java and later fought against the Dutch. There he met Mohammad Hatta in Java, and was involved in the Battle of Palembang and Battle of Surabaya.Ahmady Hassan, Ke Mana Azahari?, Alor Star, United Development Corporation, n.d., p. 63 He was the leader of the Brunei People's Party which sought to reduce the power of Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddin III to a constitutional monarch during the Brunei Revolt in 1962. Azahari's party won all 16 elected seats in the 33-member legislative council and as a left-leaning politician, Azahari strongly objected to the idea for Brunei's membership in the Federation of Malaysia, along with British North Borneo (which was later renamed to Sabah), Sarawak and Singapore. The idea of the North Kalimantan was originally proposed by Azahari, who had forged links with Sukarno's nationalist movement, together with Ahmad Zaidi Adruce, in Java in the 1940s. The idea supported and propagated the unification of all Borneo territories under British rule to form an independent leftist North Kalimantan state. Azahari personally favoured Brunei's independence and merging with British North Borneo and Sarawak to form the federation with the Sultan of Brunei as the constitutional monarch. However, the Brunei People‚Äôs Party was in favour of joining Malaysia on the condition it was as the unified three territories of northern Borneo with their own Sultan, and hence was strong enough to resist domination by Malaya, Singapore, Malay administrators or Chinese merchants.Pocock p. 129 The North Kalimantan (or Kalimantan Utara) proposal was seen as a post-decolonisation alternative by local opposition against the Malaysia plan. Local opposition throughout the Borneo territories was primarily based on economic, political, historical and cultural differences between the Borneo states and Malaya, as well as the refusal to be subjected under peninsular political domination. During the Brunei Revolt, Azahari was in Manila and managed to avoid capture by British and Commonwealth forces that help quell the revolt. He was even involved in the Limbang raid. Life in exile and death After his defeat, Azahari fled to Jakarta where he was granted asylum by President Sukarno in 1963 and lived in Bogor, West Java. A. M. Azahari later died in 2002 in Bogor, Indonesia. He was 73. He is survived by a wife and more than 10 children. Azahari was the strong voice against the proposal by then Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman Putra to merge Malaya, Sabah, Sarawak and Brunei to form Malaysia. Instead, Azahari, who led BPP from the time it was formed in 1956 to when the party was disbanded in 1962, proposed the formation of a unified state consisting of Brunei, Sarawak and North Borneo.

Biography He was born at the Henry House in Bennington, Vermont in October, 1844.Hoggson, p. 3 He left Norwich Military School (better known as Norwich University) at age 18,Snowden p. 103 serving as a First Sergeant, 14th Vermont Infantry in the Second Vermont Brigade which was in the center of the line repulsing Pickett's Charge at the Battle of Gettysburg in the American Civil War.Hoggson, pp. 18-20 After the war he was a partner in Henry & Balch working on railroad construction in the Midwest. He moved to Seattle in 1890 to work on the Northern Pacific Railroad's belt line around Lake Washington, and later the Great Northern Railway's route from Stevens Pass in the Cascade Mountains to Everett on Puget Sound. In 1906 he won a $20 million contract to build 450 miles of the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul line from the Montana-Idaho border across Snoqualmie Pass to Seattle, which was completed in 1909.Hoggson, pp. 25-77 Seventy-one years after its completion, the Pacific Extension was abandoned by the Milwaukee Road due to bankruptcy. Henry's 1901 home in the Harvard-Belmont District on Seattle's Capitol Hill was the first of many Victorian, Neo-classical, Colonial Revival, and Tudor Revival houses built in the early part of the century. It is noteworthy for having been built with a five-car garage at a time when automobiles were a novelty in Seattle.NPS Seattle Travel Itinerary: Harvard- Belmont Historic District He was president of the Metropolitan Bank and National Bank of Commerce in Seattle, and formed Pacific Creosoting Company on Bainbridge Island in 1906. A tanker which supplied creosote from Europe to this plant was named the H.C. Henry and was sunk by a German submarine in World War I on September 28, 1915.Hoggson, p. 84Naval-History.net In 1911, after the death of a son to tuberculosis, he donated land and funds to open Henry Sanatorium in Seattle, later renamed Firland Tuberculosis Hospital. He was an investor in, and vice president of, the Metropolitan Building Company, which developed the Metropolitan Tract in Seattle. The 11-story Henry Building there was named for him.Snowden p. 106 For his personal contributions and efforts to collect funds for the Fatherless Children of France, a charity for wartime orphans, he was awarded the Legion of Honor medal in 1920.Hoggson, p. 132 He donated his art collection, which he formerly kept at his home and opened to the public for display, to the University of Washington in 1926 and donated the funds to build a new gallery to house the collection, which was to be the Henry Art Gallery.Hoggson, pp. 146-147 Henry died in his sleep in his Seattle home on June 28, 1928 and is buried at Lake View Cemetery in Seattle. =After his life= In 1934, his sons donated land (including his original house) to the city for construction of a library. This was to become the Susan J. Henry branch of the Seattle Public Library, named for his wife. The branch was rebuilt and renamed in 2003 to the Capitol Hill Branch.Henry Branch (historylink.org)Capitol Hill Branch (SPL) The Snoqualmie Pass route was converted to a Rail Trail after Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul went bankrupt in 1980.

The lyrics were written in 1873 by blind hymn writer Fanny Crosby to the music written in 1873 by Phoebe Knapp. History Crosby was visiting her friend Phoebe Knapp as the Knapp home was having a large pipe organ installed. The organ was incomplete, so Mrs. Knapp, using the piano, played a new melody she had just composed. When Knapp asked Crosby, \\"What do you think the tune says?\\", Crosby replied, \\"Blessed assurance; Jesus is mine.\\" The hymn appeared in the July 1873 issue of Palmer's Guide to Holiness and Revival Miscellany, a magazine printed by Dr. and Mrs. W. C. Palmer of 14 Bible House, New York City. It appeared on page 36 (the last page) with complete text and piano score, and indicated it had been copyrighted by Crosby that year. It is not certain that this was the first printing of the hymn, but it certainly helped to popularize what became one of the most beloved hymns of all time. The popular song reflects Crosby's walk of faith, as expressed by the apostle Paul in Philippians 1:21, \\"For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain\\" (ESV).

It was first introduced in Windows 3.1 in 1992, and was included in every version of Windows up to Windows 7. Despite the name, the game rules correspond to those of Black Lady in which the queen of spades is a penalty card, in addition to the cards of the heart suit that are the only penalty cards in the traditional card game of Hearts. History Hearts was first included in Windows with Windows for Workgroups 3.1, Microsoft's first \\"network-ready\\" version of Windows, released in 1992, which included a new networking technology that Microsoft called NetDDE. Microsoft used Hearts to showcase the new NetDDE technology by enabling multiple players to play simultaneously across a computer network. This legacy could be seen in the original title bar name for the program, \\"The Microsoft Hearts Network\\". Hearts continued to be included in subsequent versions of Windows, but was absent in all Windows NT-based OSes prior to Windows XP including Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000. From the 'Help' menu, Hearts offered a quote from Shakespeare's famous play, Julius Caesar (act III, scene ii): \\"I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts...\\". Later versions of Windows starting with Vista removed this quote, and changed the title bar name to \\"Hearts\\" (network play was also removed in the Windows XP version). Hearts, like all Windows games, is not included with Windows 8 or Windows 10. As part of the operating system, it is deleted upon upgrading to Windows 10 from an earlier version. On Windows 3.11 for Workgroups, the default opponent names are Anna, Lynda, and Terri. In later versions, the three default opponent names, Pauline, Michele, and Ben, were specified by the program's developer. One is the spouse of a Microsoft employee who found a program bug, one was a Microsoft employee who resigned in 1995, and one is an employee's child who frequented the Microsoft worksite. The names are not used in the Windows Vista version of the game, instead favoring the three cardinal directions that the computer players pertain to depending on their side of the window (\\"West\\", \\"North\\", and \\"East\\"). This version of the game no longer prompts for a player name to be entered at startup, and instead uses the name of the currently logged-in user account as the player name. Windows XP Hearts had different graphics than the Windows Vista or Windows 7 Hearts. Windows Vista and Windows 7 Hearts' cards were redesigned to suit the Windows Aero window, whereas Windows XP Hearts' cards were designed to suit and accompany the application's looks of solid colors. Gameplay Game play follows the standard rules of Hearts. When the game is first loaded, the user is prompted for their name, and then the game begins. The computer uses all three hands against the player. The game ends when at least one player has 100 or more points at the end of a hand. The winner is the one who has the fewest points. =Before the hand= The user is given thirteen pseudo-random playing cards, and selects any three of them to pass. For the first hand, cards are passed to the left; for the second, to the right; for the third, across; and for the fourth, the passing stage is skipped entirely, and the players keep (or \\"eat\\") their cards. On the fifth hand, the cycle starts again, passing to the left. In any case, after passing three cards, the players receive three cards, and play begins. =Tricks= As Hearts is a trick-taking game, the game progresses by tricks. Each player plays one card to a trick, which is won by the player of the highest card of the suit led. There is no trump suit. The aim is to avoid gaining points, which are incurred by winning a trick including point cards, which are any Hearts and the Queen of Spades. Any Hearts taken incur 1 point each, and the Queen of Spades incurs 13 points. For each hand, the player with the Two of Clubs leads first, and they must play that card. Subsequent leads are by the winner of the last trick. For tricks after the first, any card can be led, except that a Heart cannot be led until Hearts have been \\"broken\\". Hearts are broken with the first Heart played in the hand, which can be done in only two situations: # A player who did not lead a trick may play a Heart to it if they cannot follow suit (and it is not the first trick in the hand); # A player with only Hearts left in their hand may lead with a Heart. Players must follow the suit led if able to (with any card of their choice in that suit) - otherwise they may play any card, except that a point card cannot be played to the first trick in each hand. Notwithstanding the above rules, in the highly improbable event that a player receives all thirteen Hearts as their hand, or twelve Hearts and the Queen of Spades, then a heart card may be played in the first trick. The concept of revoking, failing to follow suit when able, does not exist in the computer version of Hearts. In real-life card play there is a penalty for any revoke that is discovered to have taken place; in the computer version the computer does not permit players to revoke and instructs the player to follow suit. =After the hand= Any players who took point cards incur the appropriate points for those, which are added to their previous score. But any player who succeeds in taking all point cards (worth 26 points) has successfully \\"shot the moon\\", and they incur no points, while the other players incur 26 points each. After each hand, a scoreboard shows the current and previous scores of all four players, with the current leader's (or leaders') score written in blue. Each of the players has in front of them all of the point cards accumulated during the preceding trick, for easy identification of who got how many points (and a quick check to see if a player shot the moon). The game ends when one player reaches 100 or more points, and the winner is the player with the lowest score. A tie is possible if two or more players have the equal lowest score, and if the human player is one of them, the computer credits him or her as the winner. When the game ends, the score of the winning player(s) is shown in red. A new game then begins. References External links * Example of a game being played with audio explanation.

Founded by Mar Adolph Medlycott in 1889, this college played a very important role in the development of the State. It is the oldest college in the erstwhile princely state of Cochin and present day Thrissur district. It is also the first private college to be recognised as a first grade college under University of Madras, among others in then existed princely states of Travancore, Cochin and Malabar which later became mostly the present geographical area of Kerala. It is the first Catholic college in Kerala and is conducted by the Syro-Malabar Catholic Archdiocese of Thrissur. Mar Andrews Thazhath is the Patron and Mar Tony Neelankavil is the Manager of the College now. The college is affiliated to University of Calicut. The College attained Autonomous status in 2014 and was recognised as _College with Potential for Excellence_ by University Grants Commission in 2016. The College was awarded A Grade in its third cycle of reaccreditation by National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) after the peer team review in 2016. History St. Thomas College, Thrissur Started as a lower secondary school in 1889, the founder, the first Vicar Apostolic of Thrissur, Adolphus Edwin Medlycott, named it St. Thomas‚Äô College. In 1919, it was raised to a second grade college in arts, affiliated to the University of Madras. The college was raised to the rank of a Second Grade College for the service of the people in the field of higher education during the period of Rt. Rev. Dr. John Menachery, the Bishop and Vicar Apostolic of Thrissur in April 1919. The college was elevated as a first grade college under University of Madras in April 1925 and it is the second non-government college in Kerala to achieve that status, Union Christian College, Aluva being the first. In 2004, St. Thomas' was accredited with a B++ grade by NAAC, an autonomous organization instituted by the UGC. In September 2010, The college was re- accredited with A grade by NAAC. The College attained A Grade in its NAAC reaccreditation in 2016. The year 2018-2019 was celebrated as Sathyaprayan 1919-2019, the centennial as second grade college and the commemoration was inaugurated by Honourable President of India, Shri Ram Nath Kovind on 7th August 2018. Academic Programmes The college offers graduate, postgraduate and Ph.D.-level programmes in a wide range of subjects.

Retrieved 21 February 2010. Growing up in Geislingen an der Steige, Allg√∂wer completed his youth years with SV Altenstadt and SC Geislingen before moving to Stuttgart to score 59 goals for 2. Bundesliga team Stuttgarter Kickers from 1977 to 1980 as striker. Local rival VfB Stuttgart paid Kickers 750,000 Deutsche Mark to team him up with their Bundesliga squad. Just a few matches for them, he got selected for the B-international team of Germany, impressing as a goalscoring midfielder. His immediate progress earned him a call-up from Jupp Derwall for Germany. In Hanover they faced France in November 1980 and Allg√∂wer was having a bright debut, playing on the right in midfield and cementing his ambitions. Subsequent to him taking part regularly for Germany on their way to the 1982 FIFA World Cup, his participation in that tournament was expected. However, Allg√∂wer retired from playing for West Germany before the World Cup. Allg√∂wer's international retirement of 1982 lasted for three years. Three years in which he once won the Bundesliga title with Stuttgart (in 1984) and in which he massively expanded his importance for his club. Franz Beckenbauer, successor of Jupp Derwall at the helm of the German team in 1984, attempted to lure the strong shooting player out of that retirement, but Beckenbauer had to wait until October 1985 to see Allg√∂wer return for the World Cup qualifier against Portugal (0‚Äì1), which ironically took place at VfB Stuttgart's Neckarstadion. He kept on for West Germany then, declaring his final international retirement after staying unused in the 1986 FIFA World Cup runner-up campaign of Germany. He collected 10 caps. On club level he remained a key player for his sole team, switching to a sweeper role later on. Karl's brother Ralf also played a few matches for Stuttgart in these years, but never gaining the status Karl had for his coaches and the Stuttgart supporters. In 1989 the powerful free-kick specialist was part of the Stuttgart XI with Guido Buchwald and J√ºrgen Klinsmann that got defeated by Diego Maradona's SSC Napoli in the UEFA Cup final. After 338 Bundesliga matches Allg√∂wer said farewell to the German top division in the summer of 1991.

The exchange operator acts by switching the labels on any two identical particles described by the joint position quantum state \\\\leftx_1, x_2\\\\right\\\\rangle. Since the particles are identical, the notion of exchange symmetry requires that the exchange operator be unitary. Construction In three or higher dimensions, the exchange operator can represent a literal exchange of the positions of the pair of particles by motion of the particles in an adiabatic process, with all other particles held fixed. Such motion is often not carried out in practice. Rather, the operation is treated as a \\"what if\\" similar to a parity inversion or time reversal operation. Consider two repeated operations of such a particle exchange: :\\\\hat{P}^2\\\\leftx_1, x_2\\\\right\\\\rangle = \\\\hat{P}\\\\leftx_2, x_1\\\\right\\\\rangle = \\\\leftx_1, x_2\\\\right\\\\rangle Therefore, \\\\hat{P} is not only unitary but also an operator square root of 1, which leaves the possibilities :\\\\hat{P}\\\\leftx_1, x_2\\\\right\\\\rangle = \\\\pm \\\\leftx_2, x_1\\\\right\\\\rangle\\\\,. Both signs are realized in nature. Particles satisfying the case of +1 are called bosons, and particles satisfying the case of ‚àí1 are called fermions. The spin‚Äìstatistics theorem dictates that all particles with integer spin are bosons whereas all particles with half-integer spin are fermions. The exchange operator commutes with the Hamiltonian and is therefore a conserved quantity. Therefore, it is always possible and usually most convenient to choose a basis in which the states are eigenstates of the exchange operator. Such a state is either completely symmetric under exchange of all identical bosons or completely antisymmetric under exchange of all identical fermions of the system. To do so for fermions, for example, the antisymmetrizer builds such a completely antisymmetric state. In 2 dimensions, the adiabatic exchange of particles is not necessarily possible. Instead, the eigenvalues of the exchange operator may be complex phase factors (in which case \\\\hat{P} is not Hermitian), see anyon for this case. The exchange operator is not well defined in a strictly 1-dimensional system, though there are constructions of 1-dimensional networks that behave as effective 2-dimensional systems. Quantum chemistry A modified exchange operator is defined in the Hartree‚ÄìFock method of quantum chemistry, in order to estimate the exchange energy arising from the exchange statistics described above. In this method, one often defines an energetic exchange operator as: :\\\\hat K_j (x_1) f(x_1)= \\\\phi_j(x_1) \\\\int { \\\\frac{\\\\phi_j^*(x_2)f(x_2)}{r_{12}}\\\\mathrm{d}x_2} where \\\\hat K_j (x_1) is the one-electron exchange operator, and f(x_1) , f(x_2) are the one-electron wavefunctions acted upon by the exchange operator as functions of the electron positions, and \\\\phi_j(x_1) and \\\\phi_j(x_2) are the one-electron wavefunction of the j-th electron as functions of the positions of the electrons. Their separation is denoted r_{12}.Levine, I.N., Quantum Chemistry (4th ed., Prentice Hall 1991) p.403. The labels 1 and 2 are only for a notational convenience, since physically there is no way to keep track of \\"which electron is which\\".

During her career, Healy held leadership positions at the Johns Hopkins University, the Cleveland Clinic, Ohio State University, and Harvard University. She was also president of both the American Red Cross and the American Heart Association. She was health editor and columnist for U.S. News & World Report and a well-known commentator in the news media on health issues.https://www.nih.gov/about-nih/what-we-do/nih-almanac/bernadine-healy-md Early years and family Born in New York City to Michael Healy and Violet McGrath, Healy was one of four daughters raised in Long Island City, Queens. Healy's parents stressed the importance of education. In 1962, she graduated at the top of her class at the Hunter College High School in Manhattan. She attended Vassar College on a full scholarship and graduated summa cum laude in 1965 with a major in chemistry and a minor in philosophy and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. She went on to Harvard Medical School, also on full scholarship, and was one of only ten women out of 120 students in her class. After graduating cum laude from Harvard Medical School in 1970, she completed her internship and residency in internal medicine and cardiology fellowship at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and Johns Hopkins Hospital. After finishing her post-doctoral training, she became the first woman to join its full-time faculty in cardiology and rose quickly to the rank of professor of medicine. For eight years she headed the coronary care unit at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. At the medical school, she served as assistant dean for post-doctoral programs and faculty development. During that time she organized a nationally covered Mary Elizabeth Garrett symposium on women in medicine which examined the opportunities and hurdles faced by women physicians roughly 90 years after the founding of the medical school in 1893, and at the same time honored Garrett, the Victorian socialite and philanthropist who made sure that Johns Hopkins School of Medicine opened its admissions to women (the medical school opened its doors in October 1893; and three of the eighteen original candidates for the M.D. degree were women) and ultimately admitted women and men precisely on the same terms. Affiliations While at Johns Hopkins, Healy held several leadership positions in organizations such as the American Federation of Clinical Research, the American College of Cardiology, and the American Heart Association, an organization she later led as its volunteer president, and served on advisory committees to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. The nonprofit Age of Autism named her 2008 Person of the Year for her publicly stated opinion that it had not been shown that vaccination is not a trigger or cause of autism, and for her vigorous insistence that adequate science be done to resolve the issue. The scientific consensus was and is that no association has been found between vaccines and autism. Cleveland Clinic In 1985 Healy left Washington and moved to Cleveland where she became chair of the Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute and also practiced cardiology. In addition to building major new programs in molecular biology, neuroscience, and cancer biology, she headed a large NIH-funded research program in hypertension, and was the lead investigator for the Cleveland Clinic's participation in a major clinical research study comparing angioplasty with coronary artery bypass surgery. She headed the NIH advisory board for another multi-center clinical study that showed that statins could slow the course of atherosclerosis in coronary artery bypass grafts. During this time she initiated a medical student program in alliance with Ohio State University that served as a precursor to the founding of the Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine in 2004. American Red Cross Healy was recruited away from Ohio State to become president and CEO of the American Red Cross in late 1999, succeeding Elizabeth Dole. From the outset, she strove to unite the various services and volunteers under the banner \\"Together we can save a life.\\" Her tenure at the Red Cross was unsteady. In the spring of 2001, the FDA issued a record fine to the Red Cross for mishandling CMV infected blood products. The American Red Cross was criticized in the news media, notably by Fox News Channel host Bill O'Reilly, New York State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, and some in Congress for misleading donors by soliciting and receiving donations worth $564 million after the 9/11 attacks, after it was discovered that the majority of the received funds were put aside for the organization's long-term use rather than going to support victims and volunteers. The Red Cross was forced to change its policy. Healy also advocated withholding dues from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies for not allowing Israel's Red Cross society (Magen David Adom) to join the international body without adopting the cross or crescent as its symbol. The Red Cross Board of Directors hired her as a ‚Äúchange agent‚Äù but chaffed at her steely managerial style and the board's ‚Äúloss of control over day-to-day decision-making.\\" The board forced her resignation in the wake of these disagreements and controversies. Healy departed the organization as president on December 31, 2001. Government service Healy (right) with President George H.W Bush in 1991, being sworn in as director of the National Institutes of Health. =Presidential Advisor= President Ronald Reagan appointed Healy deputy director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. She served as chairman of the White House Cabinet Group on Biotechnology, executive secretary of the White House Science Council's Panel on the Health of Universities, and a member of several advisory groups on developing government-wide guidelines for research in human subjects and for the humane treatment of animals in research. She subsequently served on the President's Council of Advisers on Science and Technology during the administration of Presidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush. =National Institutes of Health= Healy was director of the Research Institute at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation when President George H. W. Bush tapped her in 1991 to become director of the NIH, its first woman head. She took on many initiatives during her two years at the helm, including the development of a major intramural laboratory for human genomics; recruited a world-renowned team to head the Human Genome Project, including current NIH director Dr. Francis Collins; elevated nursing research to an independent NIH institute; and established a policy whereby the NIH would fund only those clinical trials that included both men and women when the condition being studied affects both sexes. Healy served at NIH from 1991 to 1993. According to Francis Collins, Healy was responsible for pressuring James Watson to retire as director of the Human Genome Project due to Watson's publicized belief that identified DNA gene sequences should be openly available for use to prevent disease instead of allowing DNA sequences to be patented, an idea which Watson characterized as crazy and insane, and an idea which Healy preferred. Women's Health Initiative The Women's Health Initiative was a $625 million effort to study the causes, prevention, and cures of diseases that affect women at midlife and beyond. The study continues to unearth critical information, including evidence in 2002 that combined hormone replacement therapy increases the risk of invasive breast cancers by 26% and heart attack by 27% and increases risk for stroke. The study's findings have resulted in a permanent 15% annual reduction in invasive estrogen positive breast cancer in post menopausal women in the United States; The HRT (hormone replacement) drug market in the United States simultaneously dropped by 50% to $1 billion, twelve months after the study's results were publicized. As president of the American Heart Association from 1988 to 1989, she sought to convince both the public and medical community that heart disease is also a woman's disease, \\"not a man's disease in disguise.\\" Appointed president of the American Red Cross in 1999, Healy worked to improve the safety and availability of the American blood supply while overseeing the development of a Weapons of Mass Destruction response program. In 2001 she led the organization's response to the September 11 attacks. =U.S. Senate candidate= In 1994, Healy was a Republican candidate to represent Ohio in the U.S. Senate. She ran in the GOP primary and came in second in a four-person race. Lt. Gov. Mike DeWine won and prevailed in the general election. =Ohio State University= Healy served as professor and dean of the College of Medicine from 1995 to 1999. During her tenure, the college expanded its public health programs to become a School of Public Health, re-christening the College of Medicine into a College of Medicine and Public Health. Her efforts led to the medical school's designation as a National Center of Excellence in Women's Health. A new department of orthopaedics was created along with a planned development of a Musculoskeletal Institute. The James Cancer Center expanded its efforts in basic research with recruitment of Dr. Clara Bloomfield, an oncologist and leukemia researcher, and her husband Dr. Albert de la Chappelle, a world-famous geneticist: Together, they expanded the college's programs in cancer research and tumor genetics. Cardiovascular research and practice grew with the recruitment of Dr. Robert Michler of Columbia University, who helped to revitalize the thoracic surgery and heart transplantation programs and developed one of the earliest robotic heart surgery programs. Dr. Pascal Goldschmidt, a cardiologist and researcher, who was recruited from Johns Hopkins, helped create the Heart and Lung Institute. =Advisory boards= Healy served on numerous medical advisory committees and boards over her career. They included committees of the National Academy of Science's Institute of Medicine, of which she was a member, and the national Academy of Engineering; the Department of Energy, NASA, and the National Institutes of Health. She participated briefly on an advisory board of The Advancement of Sound Science Coalition (an organization later shown to have been funded by Philip Morris), and served on numerous advisory groups and boards of the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology, where she was an outspoken critic of smoking and its effects on the cardiovascular system. =Press= Over her career Healy served as a medical commentator and consultant for CBS, PBS and MSNBC, and made numerous appearances on CNN, C-SPAN and Fox News Channel. Healy authored a column, \\"On Health\\", for U.S. News and World Report beginning in 2003 on a wide array of medical topics from women's health to marijuana, coronary artery disease to cancer, tattoos to male circumcision, and medical preparedness to health reform. Healy became the focus of controversy when she questioned the 2004 finding of the Institute of Medicine that the evidence refuting a link between childhood vaccinations and autism was conclusive. In a nationally televised CBS interview with Sharyl Attkisson, she alleged that the government has avoided studying whether there are any susceptible population sub-groups in which vaccination may result in autism, because of a fear that, if such a link were found between vaccines and autism, people would stop vaccinating. Family Healy was married to cardiac surgeon Floyd D. Loop, a former CEO of the Cleveland Clinic. She and her husband had one daughter, Marie McGrath Loop. She had another daughter, Bartlett Bulkley, from her previous marriage. Death Healy died in Gates Mills, Ohio from brain cancer on August 6, 2011, two days after her 67th birthday after a thirteen-year battle with brain cancer. Popular media Healy is the subject of a 2018 episode of Malcolm Gladwell's podcast \\"Revisionist History\\" : \\"Strong Verbs, Short Sentences\\", Season 3, Episode #9.

Until its abolition in 2019, the OEH supported the community, business and government in protecting, strengthening and making the most of a healthy environment and economy within the state. The OEH was part of the Department of Planning and Environment cluster and managed national parks and reserves. Following the 2019 state election, the functions of the agency were assumed by the Department of Planning, Industry and Environment with effect from 1 July 2019. Structure Until its 2019 abolition, the Chief Executive of the Office of Environment and Heritage was Anthony Lean; who reported to the then Minister for the Environment and Minister for Heritage, the Hon. Gabrielle Upton, MP. The Office consisted of five functional areas: *National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) managed, conserved and cared for more than of land in national parks and reserves *Regional operations delivered integrated and customer focused services at the regional and local level to strengthen communities and partnerships across the state *Heritage provided an integrated approach to conserving Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal heritage, worked with the community to list items on the State Heritage Register, declared Aboriginal Places and register state shipwrecks *Policy provided policy advice and leading the development of strategic policy within the Office and across the government. *Science provided scientific evidence and knowledge to underpin environmental decision making, regulation and service delivery 50px This content is available under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License. History Government agencies for the protection and conservation of natural and built resources in New South Wales have existed since the appointment of the first Minister for Conservation, the Hon. Captain Bill Dunn, MLA in 1946. In 2003, the Department of Environment and Conservation was formed following the merger of the Environment Protection Authority, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the Botanic Gardens Trust, and Resource NSW. The Department of Environment and Conservation was later known as the Department of Environment and Climate Change (DECC) and Department of Environment, Climate Change and Water (DECCW). This department contained the Office of Water, formed from the Department of Water and Energy dissolved in 2009; other parts and responsibilities of the Department of Water and Energy were transferred to the Division of Minerals and Energy in Department of Industry & Investment. Following the election of the O'Farrell government at the 2011 state election, the functions of the DECCW were broken up with its responsibilities split between the new Office of Environment and Heritage and the residual functions managed by the Industry, Innovation and Investment Division of the Department of Trade and Investment, Regional Infrastructure and Services. The OEH was managed under the direction of the Department of Premier and Cabinet until 2014, when the Baird government changed the reporting arrangements so that the OEH reported to the Department of Planning and Environment. Following the 2019 state election, the Office was abolished and all its functions assumed into the newly-formed Department of Planning, Industry and Environment. =Former departmental responsibilities= The former department was responsible for: *management of flora and fauna *promotion of environmentally sustainable consumption and production *protection of the state's cultural heritage, particularly Aboriginal cultural heritage *regulation of air and water quality, noise, chemicals, radiation and waste disposal The organisation had strong links with the Sydney Catchment Authority. Former structure The department was headed by Director-General Lisa Corbyn and headquartered in Sydney, with offices across the city and state. The Office consists of seven functional areas: *Climate Change, Policy and Programs Group *Environment Protection and Regulation Group *Parks and Wildlife Group *Botanic Gardens Trust *Corporate Services Division *Culture and Heritage Division *Scientific Services Division Although an agency of the Government of New South Wales, the Office includes a number of independent boards and committees; for example, the management of the Botanic Gardens is overseen by the Botanic Gardens Trust, and the powers of the Environment Protection Authority, as exercised by the Authority to investigate or prosecute government agencies, are formally vested in an independent board. Threatened species determinations are made by an Independent Scientific Committee. A number of advisory councils have been established to allow community members to have a say in the management of parks and reserves. Environment protection The NSW Environment Protection Authority (EPA) was established in February 2012 as a statutory authority. The EPA has an independent governing Board and is the primary environmental regulator for NSW. It carries out environmental protection work in a variety of areas including air and water quality, environmental incident management, contaminated land, noise, coal seam gas, native forestry, dangerous goods, hazardous waste, chemicals and pesticides, and waste and resource recovery. Parks and wildlife The Parks and Wildlife division is referred to in the department's external communications by its pre-merger name, the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS). The NPWS manages over 660 protected areas in the state, including Kosciuszko National Park, Sydney Harbour National Park, Royal National Park and the Blue Mountains National Park. With the national parks estate covering around 10 per cent of New South Wales, the department is a significant player in debates over land management in the state. The NPWS has a significant amount of responsibility for fire management in the state, and is often the target of criticism when Sydney ‚Äì the so-called \\"city in a national park\\" ‚Äì is threatened by bushfire. The Carr Labor government sought to significantly increase the size of the national parks estate. This was despite funding constraints, meaning that funding per unit area has fallen in recent years. A large number of parks and reserves in the NPWS estate lack detailed plans of management and fire management strategies. As a land manager, the NPWS must also address pest management issues. The status of wild horses in Kosciuszko National Park and deer in Royal National Park is particularly contested, with some park users viewing these introduced species as having heritage value. Botanic Gardens Trust The Botanic Gardens Trust manages four parkland areas in and around metropolitan Sydney including The Royal Botanic Gardens, The Domain, Blue Mountains Botanic Garden and the Australian Botanic Garden Mount Annan. Other agencies The department is mirrored at a national level by the Australian Department of the Environment. Some protected areas in metropolitan Sydney are protected by other agencies, including local councils, the Centennial Park Trust, the Sydney Olympic Park Trust, and the Australian Government's Sydney Harbour Federation Trust. Elsewhere in the state are protected areas managed by the Marine Parks Authority of New South Wales and the State Parks of New South Wales.  Criticism  New South Wales Office of Environment and Heritage was subject to criticisms for handling of Sirius Building heritage status.

There are several distinctive populations within the wide distribution range of this species and in the past the slender-billed oriole (Oriolus tenuirostris) was included as a subspecies. Unlike the Indian golden oriole which only has a short and narrow eye-stripe, the black-naped oriole has the stripe broadening and joining at the back of the neck. Males and females are very similar although the wing lining of the female is more greenish. The bill is pink and is stouter than in the golden oriole. Taxonomy and systematics In 1760 the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the black-naped oriole in his Ornithologie based on a specimen that he mistakenly believed had been collected in the former French colony of Cochinchina in what is now southern Vietnam. He used the French name Le loriot de la Cochinchine and the Latin Oriolus Cochinsinensis. The two stars () at the start of the section indicates that Brisson based his description on the examination of a specimen. Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his Systema Naturae for the twelfth edition, he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson. One of these was the black-naped oriole. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the current binomial name Oriolus chinensis and cited Brisson's work. The type location was subsequently corrected to Manila in the Philippines. The evolutionary history of this group of orioles is complex and there may be more cryptic species within the group. The subspecies are very closely related and the group forms a clade in which the Eurasian oriole and Indian golden oriole are also nested. =Subspecies= Twenty subspecies are recognized: * O. c. diffusus - Sharpe, 1877: Originally described as a separate species. Found in the eastern Palearctic * O. c. andamanensis - Beavan, 1867: Originally described as a separate species. Found on the Andaman Islands * O. c. macrourus - Blyth, 1846: Originally described as a separate species. Found on the Nicobar Islands * O. c. maculatus - Vieillot, 1817: Originally described as a separate species. Found on the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, Belitung, Bangka Island, Nias, Java, Bali and Borneo * O. c. mundus - Richmond, 1903: Originally described as a separate species. Found on Simeulue and Nias Is. * O. c. sipora - Chasen & Kloss, 1926: Found on Sipora (off western Sumatra) * O. c. richmondi - Oberholser, 1912: Found on Siberut and Pagi Island (off western Sumatra) * O. c. lamprochryseus - Oberholser, 1917: Found on Masalembu and Keramian Islands (Java Sea) * O. c. insularis - Vorderman, 1893: Originally described as a separate species. Found on Sapudi, Raas and Kangean Islands (northeast of Java) * O. c. melanisticus - Meyer, AB & Wiglesworth, 1894: Originally described as a separate species. Found on Talaud Islands (south of the Philippines) * O. c. sangirensis - Meyer, AB & Wiglesworth, 1898: Found on the Sangihe Islands (off north-eastern Sulawesi) * O. c. formosus - Cabanis, 1872: Originally described as a separate species. Found on Siau, Tahulandang, Ruang, Biaro and Mayu Islands (off north- eastern Sulawesi) * O. c. celebensis - (Walden, 1872): Originally described as a separate species. Found on Sulawesi and nearby islands * O. c. frontalis - Wallace, 1863: Originally described as a separate species. Found on Banggai and Sula Islands (east of Sulawesi) * O. c. stresemanni - Neumann, 1939: Found on Peleng (off eastern Sulawesi) * O. c. boneratensis - Meyer, AB & Wiglesworth, 1896: Originally described as a separate species. Found on Bonerate, Djampea and Kalao Islands (Selayar Islands) * O. c. broderipi - Bonaparte, 1850: Originally described as a separate species. Found on Lombok, Sumba, Sumbawa, Flores, and Alor Island (Lesser Sunda Islands) * O. c. chinensis - Linnaeus, 1766: Found on Palawan, Luzon, Mindoro and satellite islands (western and northern Philippines) * O. c. yamamurae - Kuroda Sr, 1927: Found on the Visayan Islands, Mindanao and Basilan (central and southern Philippines) * O. c. suluensis - Sharpe, 1877: Found in the Sulu Archipelago (south-western Philippines) Calls of O. c. diffusus in winter range Description Male O. c. maculatus (Selangor, Malaysia) O. c. maculatus (Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia) The black-naped oriole is medium-sized and overall golden with a strong pinkish bill and a broad black mask and nape. The adult male has the central tail feathers tipped yellow and the lateral ones are more broadly yellow. The female has the mantle colour more greenish or olive. The juvenile has a streaked underside. The nestling has dull greenish with brown streaks. The head and nape are more yellowish and the undertail coverts are yellow. Several variations exist in the populations that have been separated as subspecies. The subspecies in the Andamans, O. c. andamanensis has all black wings while O. c. macrourus of the Nicobars has a very broad nape band so that only the top of the head is yellow. The wings are all black with a yellow primary covert patch. The calls of the Andaman and the Nicobar subspecies are said to be quite different, the latter having a more modulated call note. In the Southeast Asian populations some geographic trends include a reduction of yellow on the forehead and a decreased brightness in the yellow plumage from north to south. Females from southern populations are more greenish on the back and tail and there are no yellow spots on the tips of the secondaries as in northern populations. The usual call is a nasal niee or myaa and the song (diffusus) is a fluty iwee wee wee-leeow. They have a dipping flight. Distribution and habitat Juvenile bird in Kolkata, West Bengal, India Subspecies diffusus breeds in eastern Siberia, Ussuriland, northeastern China, Korea and northern Vietnam and is widespread across India during winter, mainly in the northeastern parts and in the peninsular region and also found in Bangladesh. The population in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands are resident. In winter, populations breeding in eastern Asia spend the winter in the tropical areas of Southeast Asia such as Thailand and Myanmar. Subspecies diffusus is an uncommon migrant in many parts of South India and very rare migrant to Sri Lanka and are most regularly seen in the Western Ghats. In Singapore they are believed to have established as breeders only in the 1920s and are today common even within gardens in the city. In the 1880s they were considered rare. At the present time, orioles are fairly common in Singapore. The black-naped oriole is found in forests, gardens and plantations. It feeds on berries and insects in the canopy. Behaviour and ecology Males differ geographically in extent of black and yellow on head, wing and tail O. c. broderipii illustration (1850) Black-naped orioles have been recorded to feed on a range of berries including Trema orientalis, Ficus and others apart from insects. It has been suggested that they may have aided in the dispersal of Ficus species into the island of Krakatoa where they were also among the early pioneer species. In India it has been noted to take nectar from large flowers such as those of Salmalia and Erythrina. They can sometimes be nest predators on smaller birds. The breeding season is April to June (January‚ÄìMarch in the Nicobars) and the nest is a deep cup in a fork of a tree. The eggs, two to three, are salmon pink with reddish spots and darker blotches The nests are often built in the vicinity of the nest of a black drongo. Two or three nests may be built by the female and one is finally chosen for laying eggs. Males may sometimes sit beside the unused nests. Incubation is by the female alone and the eggs hatch after 14 to 16 days and the chicks fledge after another two weeks. Females stay closer to the nest, taking part in nest sanitation by removal of fecal sacs, driving away predators and feeding the young. The males take a more active role in feeding and guarding. Eurasian tree sparrows and black bulbuls may sometimes use abandoned nests. Nest predators include crows, treepies and hawks. In many parts of Southeast Asia, they are trapped and sold in the bird trade.

Background In the second half of the 18th century a militant Islamic movement began in the Sudan region to the south of the Sahara, stretching from the Senegal to the Nile. The leaders waged jihad, or holy war, against pagans and less strict Muslims, establishing a string of strictly Muslim states across the region. The first jihad was launched in Fouta Djallon in 1726 by Ibrahim Musa. He was a leading Muslim cleric who had studied in Kankan. Ibrahim Musa, also known as Ibrahima Sambeghu, Karamokho Alfa or Alfa Ibrahim, enlisted the support of gangs of young men, slaves and outlaws in his fight against the ruling powers. He became recognized as the \\"Commander of the Faithful\\" at a time when the Fulani were gaining supremacy over the Jalonke people in a Jihad, although he had to contend with competing families and with squabbling clerics and military leaders. The Jalonke people adopted the Muslim religion and achieved some social status, but remained subordinate to the Fula leaders. The jihad process was protracted, because the Fula were not simply taking over an existing state, but were building a new state. Alfa Ibrahim died in 1751. Struggle for power Fula Jihad states around 1830 - Fouta Djallon to the west Ibrahim Sori was Alfa Ibrahim' cousin. He succeeded Alfa Ibrahim on the latter's death and consolidated the Fulani military authority. His motives were more commercial than religious. He threw his energy into taking control of all trade, which at that time primarily consisted of trading slaves for European fabric, iron and weapons. Sori promoted warfare as a means to gain more slaves, joining forces with the king of the Dyalonke people of Solima. In 1762 the combined Fulani and Solima forces invaded the territory of the animist Wassoulou to their west and were defeated. The alliance between the Fulani and Solima broke up. The Solima allied themselves with the Wasulunke against the Fulani, and began annual raids into Fulani territory. In 1776 they were decisively defeated by the Fulani under Ibrahim Sori, and the Solima had to accept Fulani supremacy. Almami After the victory over the Solima, Ibrahim Sorio adopted the title almami. He became known as Sori Maudo (\\"Sori the Great\\"). Although he was the leader of the Fulani, he had to respect the advice of a council of elders, and had to accept that the council would confirm his successors. The council also collected tithes and booty to cover the costs of the jihad, and enforced the Shari's laws. Under Ibrahim Sori the theocratic state was organized into nine provinces, each led by a cleric who was subordinate to Sori as almami. The almami was formally installed in Fugumba, the religious capital, but ruled from Timbo, the political capital, with the help of the council. The council became jealous of Ibrahim Sori's power and prestige, and began agitating against him. Sori entered Fugumba, executed the councillors who had opposed him, and called a general assembly to confirm his authority. The packed assembly duly voted in his favor, and the military faction was firmly in control until Sori's death in 1791-1792. He was succeeded by his son Sa'id, who held office until 1797-1798 when he was killed and replaced by a descendant of Karamokho Alfa. The original Fulani leaders retained the right to elect the almami, who was usually a clerical descendant of either Alfa Ibrahim or a more secular and military descendant of Ibrahim Sori.

It is threatened by habitat loss, leading the IUCN to rate it as Vulnerable. Related species This rabbit was the sole representative of the genus Nesolagus until the Annamite striped rabbit was discovered in the Annamite Mountains between Laos and Vietnam. Description The Sumatran striped rabbit is usually about 40 cm (1 ft, 4 in) long, with tails 17mm long. It is black with brown stripes, with a red tail and rump, and the underside is white. Their fur is soft and dense, overlaid by longer, harsher hairs. Biology As the species is rare, nocturnal and found only in remote forests, little is known about it. The local people do not have a name for the Sumatran Rabbit because they are not aware that the species even exists. The rabbit rests in the burrows of other animals. It usually eats the stalk and leaves of understory plants, but captive rabbits eat grain, and tropical fruits. Habitat and range This species is said to be endemic and is native to the Barisan Mountains in Sumatra, Indonesia in north-west Sumatra. It has also been found in west and southwest Sumatra, and there is one record from Gunung Leuser National Park. It lives in forests at altitudes of 600‚Äì1600 metres above sea level. It is one of the few lagomorphs that chooses to live in the dense rainforest. The Sumatran rabbit also prefers to live more specifically in montane forests with volcanic soil. Threats The forests which the species inhabits are being cleared more and more for timber, tea and coffee plantations, and human inhabitation. The unusual surge of immigrants coming from the Indonesian island of Java has also increased the rate of disappearance of the species' habitat. Observation in the wild Following a sighting in 1972, the Sumatran striped rabbit went unreported until an individual rabbit was photographed in 2000. Since then there have been three reports of this species, all from the Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park: In January 2007 one was photographed with a camera trap, in September 2008 one was photographed by a WWF scientist,WWF Save Sumatra (2009) Rare rabbit species directly photographed. Retrieved January 3, 2011. and in June 2009 one was observed. In 2011 examples were photographed in the wild by a scientific team using camera traps in Bukit Barisan Seletan and Kerinci Seblat National Parks. Conservation The species is listed as Vulnerable by the IUCN. It is rarely seen and thought to be uncommon in its habitat; population size is unknown. Its rarity may be the result of deforestation and habitat loss. Attempts to start a conservation plan were not funded due to lack of reliable distribution and abundance information.

The film is directed by Doug Liman and stars Hayden Christensen, Jamie Bell, Rachel Bilson, Max Thieriot, AnnaSophia Robb, Diane Lane, Michael Rooker, and Samuel L. Jackson. The film follows a young man capable of teleporting as he is chased by a secret society intent on killing him. The script went through a rewrite prior to filming, and the roles for the main characters were changed during production. Jumper was filmed in 20 cities and 14 countries from 2006 to 2007. The film was released on February 14, 2008, and the soundtrack was released five days later on February 19. The film held the first position in its opening weekend with $27.3 million, but received generally negative reviews from critics, mostly because of the many changes to Gould's novel, rushed plot and anti-climactic ending. Plot In Ann Arbor, Michigan, 15-year-old David Rice (Max Thieriot) gives his crush, Millie Harris (AnnaSophia Robb), a snow globe. A bully, Mark Kobold (Jesse James), throws it onto a frozen river. While trying to retrieve it, David falls through the ice and is pulled away by the current. He suddenly finds himself in the local library and discovers his ability to \\"jump\\" from one place to another. Amazed with his new ability, he leaves his abusive father (Michael Rooker) and runs away from home. Eight years later, an adult David (Hayden Christensen) lives lavishly on stolen money acquired from 'jumping' into and out of bank vaults. One day, he is ambushed in his home by Roland Cox (Samuel L. Jackson), commander of the Paladins, a secret society of religious fanatics who are sworn to trace and kill \\"Jumpers\\". Their justification is that Jumpers' alleged omnipresence is blasphemous. Roland tries to capture David with electric cables designed to nullify his ability, but David escapes. He returns to Ann Arbor, seeking his old crush Millie (Rachel Bilson). When Mark (Teddy Dunn) attacks him, David teleports him into a bank vault and traps him. David then returns to Millie and invites her on a trip to Rome. Roland later discovers Mark in police custody and learns David's identity. David and Millie arrive in Rome, though he keeps his ability a secret. After talking, they share a kiss and have sex. They visit the Colosseum, where David meets Griffin (Jamie Bell), another Jumper. A group of Paladins appears, and Griffin casually kills them, then jumps away. David tries to leave with Millie, but he's detained by Italian police and questioned about the deaths. David's mother, Mary (Diane Lane), who had left him when he was five, appears and helps him escape. She urges him to leave Rome with Millie, to protect her. Millie, upset and afraid when David tries to skirt around the issue, demands to know the truth. David declines and puts her on a plane home. David runs into Griffin again, and follows him to his hideout in a cave. Griffin reveals that he has been trailing and killing Paladins for years and plans to kill Roland to avenge his parents. Griffin tells David that the Paladins will target his loved ones to draw him out. David teleports home and finds his father lying bleeding. He jumps his father to a hospital and returns to Griffin to ask for help. Realizing Roland is personally hunting David, Griffin agrees. They go to pick Millie up at the airport, but she is no longer there. Griffin returns to his hideout to get weapons. David breaks into Millie's apartment, angering her. Seeing Roland arriving, David decides to reveal the truth to her. He teleports her to Griffin's hideout. Using a machine that keeps David's \\"jump scar\\" open, the Paladins, including Roland, invade the hideout. David and Griffin subdue most of them. David sees his mother's photo on the wall and realizes she is also a Paladin. Roland is chased back through the jump scar, but he manages to snatch Millie with him. He sets up a trap in Millie's apartment, expecting David to come back for her. Obsessed with killing Roland, Griffin plans to bomb the apartment, but David objects, wanting to save Millie. They fight and David traps Griffin with power lines in Chechnya. Ignoring Griffin's warning, David jumps to Millie's apartment and is quickly trapped by Roland's cables. The cables \\"link\\" him to the apartment, making him unable to jump away alone. Mustering his strength, David teleports the apartment and everyone inside to a river. Once free of the cables, David teleports Millie to safety and dumps Roland in a cave in Horseshoe Bend. He strands Roland there, telling him \\"I could have dropped you with the sharks\\". David visits his long-lost mother Mary and discovers his younger half-sister Sophie (Kristen Stewart). Mary tells David that when he was five, he made his very first jump. She is a Paladin and had to either kill David or leave. After leaving her house, David meets up with Millie, and he jumps himself and her to a much warmer location.

Screenwriter Jim Uhls was hired to rewrite an adapted screenplay by David S. Goyer. However, Liman desired another rewrite and Simon Kinberg assisted in completing the script. Liman said about using the novel for developing the script: \\"This is 100% Steven Gould's story, it's just reinvented as a movie.\\" In an interview, Gould revealed that he approved of the deviations from the novel. Before filming was to begin, the studio announced plans to develop a trilogy based on the novel's premise. While other films tend to use only one storyboard artist, Jumper required six, who each worked on an individual action sequence. The artists were given specific instruction on the rules of the teleportation used in the film, to ensure accuracy in the storyboarding. One of them, Rob McCallum, reflected on the instructions: \\"I was just thinking, 'How would a guy that can teleport fight?' So you were really pushing yourself to try to think of inventive, cool, spectacular ways that you could use this jumping talent that these characters have.\\" =Casting= In April 2006, actors Tom Sturridge, Teresa Palmer, and Jamie Bell were cast for Jumper with Sturridge in the lead role. The following July, actor Samuel L. Jackson was cast as an Roland Cox, with producer Simon Kinberg rewriting the original screenplay draft by Goyer. Principal photography was scheduled to take place in Tokyo, Rome, Toronto, and New York. Production was stopped in June 2006 after producer Tom Rothman told Liman \\"The lead is 18. Wouldn't the movie be better if he was 25? You have a huge movie here and adults won't go and see an 18-year-old. They'll consider it a children's movie. You could make a bigger movie than that.\\" Liman agreed on casting older actors for furthering the romantic aspect of the film. In August, actor Hayden Christensen replaced Sturridge in the lead role as David just two weeks before the beginning of shooting, as the studio \\"became concerned about not having a more prominent actor in their trio of young stars.\\" After Christensen was recast for the lead role, Liman replaced Palmer with Rachel Bilson. =Filming= In September 2006, Jumper was filmed at various locations in Peterborough, Ontario and principal photography began in Toronto in October. In December 2006, Liman negotiated with the Rome Film Commission for rare access to film for three days in the Colosseum. The scene in the Colosseum was originally written for the Pantheon, where exterior shots were also filmed. The crew was required to keep equipment off the ground by using harnesses and had to rely on natural light for filming. Filming took place for 45 minutes in the morning and in the evening so as not to disturb the public touring the amphitheater throughout the day. In order to maximize the short period for filming, four steadicams were set up to ensure time was not wasted in reloading the camera. A visual effects supervisor explained how visual effects were needed for various aspects after filming: \\"There were three kinds of shots: there were shots where they were able to get most of what they needed in the Collosseum itself; and then there were shots on a set that needed extensions beyond the limits of the set; and then there were shots where we needed to create the Coliseum basically from scratch.\\" After filming in Rome, scenes were filmed in Toronto during December 2006 to January 2007 and wrapped at the Canadian location on January 19. On January 26 in Toronto, 56-year-old David Ritchie, a set dresser, was fatally struck by frozen debris while dismantling an outdoor set in wintry conditions. Another worker was injured and was sent to a hospital with serious head and shoulder injuries. After Toronto, the cast and crew traveled to Tokyo to film scenes. One scene required over 30 shoots as the scene could only be filmed in between traffic light changes. As a result of director Liman insisting Christensen perform his own stunts, the actor injured his hand, split open his ear, and developed a hyperdilated pupil that required hospital care while filming various scenes. In February 2007, the next filming site was set up at Gallup Park in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Sixty students from the nearby Huron High School were cast as extras for the film. Since additional filming was required of the area, twenty other students were used for a day of filming in September. Altogether, filming took place in 20 cities in 14 countries. =Visual effects= The New Zealand visual effects studio Weta Digital was initially selected to assist in creating a preview clip for the 2007 Comic-Con Convention. The studio's 100 employees later developed the visual effects for 300 of the 600 shots in the film. In total, there are more than 100 jumps in the film, and each jump was modified based on the distance and location the character(s) jumped. The jumps were developed using Nuke and Shake software; many, including those to Big Ben and the Sphinx were created with Maya. Weta's VFX supervisor Erik Winquist explained how the visual effects of the jumps were created: \\"The concept of what a jump looks like changed and evolved a little over the course of post production. There are shots in the film that use still array footage but not in the same way that we saw in The Matrix. The Matrix was largely about stopping time whereas this was about using slow shutter speeds on those still array cameras to end up with a streaky motion-blurred image as the perspective was changing, which is a pretty interesting look.\\" Other visual effects studios that assisted with the film include Hydraulx, Digital Domain, and Pixel Magic. Lightwave 3D was also used for some of the movie's scenes. Reception =Critical reception= On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 15% based on 168 reviews, with an average rating of 4.04/10. The site's consensus states, \\"An erratic action pic with little coherence and lackluster special effects.\\" Metacritic gives the film an average score of 35, based on 36 reviews. Austin Chronicles Marc Salov called the film \\"... pretty slick, entertaining stuff, well-crafted by Liman, edited into a tight, action-packed bundle of nerviness\\". Empire had a verdict of \\"[Doug] Liman's least charismatic action movie and the least developed, but it still packs some cracking action into its brief running time and lays foundations on which a great franchise could be built\\". Australian film reviewer David Stratton was far less kind, stating that \\"this film represents a new [watershed] in the history of the cinema because it's got no plot, it's got no characters, it's got no action scene that makes any kind of sense\\", and awarded it half a star out of five. =Box office= The film was released on February 14, 2008 in the United States and Canada, in the hopes of pulling in business on Valentine's Day. The film was targeted at an audience of both males and females below the age of 25. Jumper grossed $27.3 million on 4,600 screens in 3,428 theaters from Friday to Sunday, ranking first for the weekend at the box office. In its first weekend, the film set the record for the largest February release in Korea and had the first place position in 11 of the 30 markets it was released in. For the first two weekends of its release, the film maintained its number one position in international markets, while slipping to the second position in the United States to the release of Vantage Point. The film's worldwide gross is $221,231,186 with $80,172,128 from the box office in the United States and Canada and $142,059,058 from other territories. It was the 28th highest-grossing film worldwide for 2008. Soundtrack The score for the film was released on February 19, 2008, after the film's release in theaters. The tracks were all written by John Powell. The music was conducted by Brett Weymark and performed by the Sydney Symphony Orchestra. Home media The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc in North America on June 10, 2008 and internationally on June 16. Special features include a commentary, deleted scenes, an animated graphic novel, featurettes, and a digital copy allowing consumers to watch the film on portable devices. =Video game= A video game titled Jumper: Griffin's Story was made for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 2, and Wii consoles. The storyline focuses on the character Griffin as he attempts to avenge the death of his parents. Nicholas Longano of the video game publisher Brash Entertainment stated, \\"From the very first script read, we knew this had to be made into a game. The teleportation elements make for some very compelling gameplay.\\" The game was released on February 12, 2008, two days before the film's wide release. GameRankings gave the Xbox 360 version of the game a 28% positive rating, based on 12 reviews. The PlayStation 2 version received a 35% positive rating while the Wii version had a 23% positive rating. Daemon Hatfield of IGN reviewed the Xbox 360 version and gave it a negative review: \\"Low production values, monotonous gameplay, and lackluster visuals make this a story you can jump past.\\" =Novel tie-ins= Steven Gould, the author of Jumper and Reflex also wrote Jumper: Griffin's Story as a tie-in for the film. The novel, released on August 21, 2007, focuses on the character Griffin which was created by screenwriter David S. Goyer specifically for the film. Because Griffin had not appeared in the two prior novels, Gould developed Jumper: Griffin's Story as a backstory of the character's early childhood before the film. When writing the novel, Gould had to work closely with a producer of the film to ensure that the story did not conflict with the film's premise. Oni Press released a graphic novel, Jumper: Jumpscars, that portrays several backstories related to the film. The novel was released on February 13, 2008, one day before the film's wide release. A publisher for Oni Press commented on the tie-in to the film, stating: \\"The world that was being built around these characters was so well-realized and the mythology so interesting that other stories about this conflict would be plentiful and add to what the filmmakers were building.\\" The novel was written by Nunzio DeFilippis and Christina Weir and illustrated by Brian Hurtt. Potential sequel Author Steven Gould's second novel in the Jumper series, Reflex, was published in 2004 (by 2014, two more Gould novels in the series have been published). Prior to the film's 2008 release, Hayden Christensen reflected on the possibility of one or more sequels: \\"This has definitely been set up in a way that will allow for more films, and Doug has been careful to make sure that he's created characters that will have room to grow.\\" Lucas Foster during production of the film stated in an interview: \\"The ideas got so large, that they really couldn't fit into, you know, one or two movies, they needed to evolve over at least three movies. So we planned the story out over three movies and then we sliced it up in such a way as to leave room for the other two movies.\\" In response to the film's box office performance, director Doug Liman has spoken of his ideas for a sequel. Among them are that Jumpers can reach other planets and travel in time, as well as their capacity for espionage. He has also stated that Rachel Bilson's character would learn how to jump (hinted by David falling unconscious before the jump from the river to the library), just as in Gould's sequel, Reflex. Television series A spin-off television series from the film, titled Impulse, was released on YouTube Premium on June 6, 2018.

Views CATW is rooted in a feminist point of view. Its definition of \\"trafficking\\" includes all forms of prostitution of women or children. CATW opposes a distinction between \\"forced\\" and \\"voluntary\\" prostitution, as it sees all forms of prostitution as a violation of the dignity of women and violence against them. In this regard, it is strongly opposed to the perspectives of the Global Alliance Against Traffic in Women and the sex workers' rights movement. Aside from prostitution, CATW is opposed to \\"pornography, sex tourism, and mail-order bride selling\\". On its website, CATW categorizes sexual exploitation as including sexual harassment, rape, incest, and battery. CATW was set up in 1988. The coalition's proposed solution to the problem of human trafficking and sexual exploitation is to decriminalize the selling of sexual acts, while criminalizing the buying of sexual acts, pimping, brothel-keeping, and trafficking. This approach, sometimes referred to as the \\"Swedish Model\\" or \\"Nordic Model\\", has been implemented in Sweden, Norway, Iceland, France, Northern Ireland, and Ireland, partly as a result of lobbying by CATW-affiliated activists in those countries. CATW views these laws as successful in combating prostitution and human trafficking, and lobbies for the replication of such legislation elsewhere. CATW also claims to \\"reject state policies and practices that channel women into conditions of sexual exploitation\\" ... and to \\"provide education and employment opportunities that enhance women's worth and status\\". History CATW was founded 1988 as the outcome of a conference titled \\"First Global Conference Against Trafficking in Women,\\" organized by several American feminist groups, including Women Against Pornography and WHISPER. The leaders of CATW, such as founder Dorchen Leidholdt and co-chair (as of 2007) Norma Ramos, were originally leaders of Women Against Pornography. CATW was the first international non-governmental organization (NGO) working against trafficking, and gained consultative status with ECOSOC (UN) in 1989. The CATW has influenced anti-sex industry and anti-trafficking legislation in places all over the world, including the Philippines, Venezuela, Bangladesh, Japan, Sweden, and the United States. Involvement In 2008, the Coalition supported the campaign to defeat San Francisco's Proposition K, which was a proposition that called for the full decriminalization of prostitution. CATW also encouraged its followers to get television network HBO to stop airing shows like Cathouse, which it claims promote sex trafficking and prostitution. In 2008, CATW held a discussion at the New York City Bar Association on the laws in Sweden and the US governing prostitution and human trafficking entitled, \\"Abolishing Sex Slavery: From Stockholm to Hunts Point\\". Structure The organization consists of regional networks and affiliated groups. It is an umbrella organization that is directed by the regional networks. The organization has what it describes as \\"national coalitions\\" in countries including the Philippines, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Thailand, Venezuela, Puerto Rico, Chile, Canada, Norway, France, Spain, and Greece. After the \\"Conference on Women Empowering Women: A Human Rights Conference on Trafficking in Asian Women\\" held in Manila, Philippines, in April 1993, CATW created an Asia Pacific chapter. The Australian branch of CATW is also part of the Asia Pacific chapter. The Australian branch is for women only. Other branches can be found in Africa, Europe, Norway, Northern Norway, Latin America, and the Caribbean islands. Tactics CATW is an organization subscribing to a \\"low-risk activism\\", meaning it claims to use tactics that typically do not disrupt the public or otherwise lead to disobedience. It tends to pursue objectives by fund-raising to provide safe houses for victims and to purchase other resources. It schedules and attends meetings with the targets of their lobbying efforts (mainly countries which it regards as having lax or no human trafficking laws) and politicians to submit resolutions and enact legislation against sexual exploitation and other forms of human trafficking. It also publicizes its efforts via its Web site and various human rights and anti-human trafficking organizations. CATW lobbies students and communities all over the globe. It stages \\"training\\" sessions for educators, law enforcement and government officials, and community leaders, and testifies before national congresses, parliaments, law reform commissions, and regional and United Nations committees. Campaigns, programs and projects The following is a list and brief description of some of CATW's global campaigns: *Measures to Combat Trafficking in Human Beings - addresses perceived gaps in current anti-trafficking programs and policies, with a focus on gender equality, demand, and the links between prostitution and trafficking (some participating countries include Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic) *The Prevention Project - multi-tiered project to prevent sex trafficking and sexual exploitation by developing standard practices (some participating countries include Italy, Nigeria, Mali, Mexico, the Republic of Georgia) *Project to Curb Male Demand for Prostitution (some participating countries include the Baltic Countries, India, the Philippines) *Human Rights Documentation Project - conducts training sessions that instruct women's organizations in what the organization describes as \\"feminist research methods\\" See also * Human Trafficking * International Day of No Prostitution * Prostitution References  External links  * Coalition Against Trafficking in Women: Official Site * No On K: Say No to ALL Human Trafficking * Prostitution Research & Education * Bilateral Safety Corridor Coalition Category:Feminist organizations in the United States Category:Anti- prostitution feminism Category:Organizations that combat human trafficking Category:Radical feminist organizations ","title":"Coalition Against Trafficking in Women"},{"id":"3427196","text":"Ivanhoe is a very small township on the Cobb Highway between the Lachlan and Darling rivers in New South Wales, Australia. It is located within the Central Darling Shire local government area. Ivanhoe functions as a service centre for the surrounding area. The township is characterised by a particularly wide main street. At the 2016 census, Ivanhoe had a population of 196 people. The town was founded in the early 1870s, and was named after Sir Walter Scott's work of historical fiction, Ivanhoe. The township was situated on well-used coach and stock routes connecting Wilcannia on the Darling River with Balranald on the Murrumbidgee and Booligal on the Lachlan. History Post Office at Ivanhoe (2011) Ivanhoe was on the western boundary of the Wangaibon people. In 1869 George Brown Williamson, the postmaster and a storekeeper at Booligal, purchased from the \\"Waiko\\" pastoral run at the site which was to become the township of Ivanhoe. Williamson selected the location as a business opportunity, being the junction of two roads from Booligal and Balranald leading to Wilcannia on the Darling River. Williamson began operating a branch store at the location under the charge of his employee Charles Hiller. George Williamson was a native of Morayshire in Scotland, and is believed to have chosen the name ‚ÄòIvanhoe‚Äô. Initially the nearest water supply to Ivanhoe was at Kilfera Lake, 25 kilometres away, from which drinking water had to be carted by dray.Glover, H. M. (Noni), A Town called Ivanhoe: a History, 1989 (Riverine Grazier); Williamson may have initially just occupied the land at Ivanhoe and purchased it later ‚Äì there is a record of George Williamson purchasing at Ivanhoe at the Hay Land Office in November 1873 (Riverine Grazier, 19 November 1873, p. 2). A hotel was built at Ivanhoe in 1871 (the Ivanhoe Hotel); the licensee was James Eade, who remained publican until 1875 (apart from during 1873 when Joshua Smith held the license). A post office opened at Ivanhoe on 1 January 1874 at Williamson's store (renamed ‚ÄòThe Post Office Store‚Äô), with Charles Hiller in charge (though Williamson was the designated Postmaster). On 1 February 1876, after a ten-year stint at Booligal, George Williamson moved to Ivanhoe. In 1876 two new hotels opened at Ivanhoe: the Horse and Jockey (licensee, Duncan McGregor) and Mac's Ivanhoe Hotel (licensee, Henry Gayson). The licensee of the Ivanhoe Hotel in 1876 was Roberick MacKenzie. In 1879 a police presence was maintained at Ivanhoe to protect local residents from the Hatfield Bushrangers.Glover, op. cit.; Lists of Publican licenses, New South Wales Government Gazettes; Riverine Grazier, 29 December 1875, p. 2. The Ivanhoe Hotel ceased operating from 1882, leaving two hotels in the township. During 1882 work commenced on the erection of a telegraph line from Booligal to Wilcannia. A telegraph station was opened at Ivanhoe on 5 February 1883 under the charge of Alfred Webber Rice, who had been promoted from his position at Campbelltown. The township was described in 1883 as having about 50 residents, a blacksmith's shop, two hotels, two stores (Williamson's and Stewart's), and \\"a few cottages\\". By 1884 Ivanhoe was a major change-station for Cobb & Co's horses on the coach routes to and from the Darling River. In 1884 businesses in the township included the Cobb & Co Chaff House and Millie's Stable and Yards (Henry Thomas Millie was the licensee of Mac's Ivanhoe Hotel at that time). The mounted police were established at Ivanhoe in 1885. The Ivanhoe Jockey Club held its first race meeting in May 1885. From 1887 race meetings were held twice a year (until the late 1930s) on a course which formed part of the town common. In 1889 a school opened in the township.Glover, op. cit. The summer heat was a significant problem for the school. Refrigerating paint and a veranda were used to ward off the sun but the school was closed during the extended drought of 1904 to 1907.

The Indian Pacific passes through to Sydney on Tuesdays, and to Adelaide and Perth on Thursdays but does not stop. The main town is located approximately three kilometres north of the railway station and from the original opening of the line a separate suburb was constructed by the railways adjacent the station to service the railways needs. This locality was generally referred to as a railway town. Workshops, worker houses, locomotive depots, track maintenance depot, crew barracks, fuelling point and the station were all located in rail town. Twenty-three new houses were built as recently as 1979 by the NSW Housing Commission.New Desert Village Transport News September 1979 pages 7-9The Desert Blossoms - PTC's $2 million Ivanhoe Complex Network November 1979 pages 7-11 Rail town has now largely been taken over by the Ivanhoe (Warakirri) Correctional Centre.

Historically, the development of lodging areas and facilities was sometimes driven by their physical locations, such as at river crossings, at major trading posts or in locations lending themselves to defense, such as forts or castles. Property location continues to be a key consideration in hotel design in contemporary times.Rutes, Walter A.; et al. (2001). Hotel Design, Planning, and Development. Pages 7, 19.

Pages 19-20. outdoor facilities and swimming pools, fitness centers and spas. Contemporary hotel design involves effectively integrating these various aspects of hotel operations within a location to minimize interference with one another. For example, hotel design includes considerations to avoid guests being inundated with excessive noise and the movement of people. Hotels are usually designed from the inside-out to ensure the practical functionality and relationship of its parts. Cultural influences Hotel designers bring to their work their own cultural mores and need to understand the culture in which the hotel will operate if working outside their native environment. Due to travel becoming international in scope, links with local traditions in many hotel designs have been weakened, and ‚ÄòInternational‚Äô has become a style in its own right. Some hotels base their operations with a theme of vernacular local traditional styles, while others have modernist stylistic designs. Hotel design ranges from basic variables, such as the appropriate height for bed head light switches to the more specialized, such as the right layout for a kitchen or the sightlines from reception areas to enable control and protection of entry to rooms. The pace of change in hotel design has, as in most areas of modern life, increased with the development of innovative technology. Despite cultural variations, hotels commonly function to provide a welcome environment that supports the comfort of its guests for work, rest and relaxation.Riewold, Otto. New Hotel Design. Page 6. Remodeling Hotels are consistently being updated to maintain the health of the hotel. During a remodel or renovation you will be dealing with the interior of the hotel like furniture, maintenance, and layout. The exterior of the hotel needs updates like roofing. Each year the amount of money put in the update is increasing. The furniture in the hotel every few years needs to be replaced. New areas to hotel like weight rooms, arcades or business rooms with computers are added to hotels as part of remodels. Maintenance updates throughout the hotel occur every 15‚Äì25 years. Hotels have been converting to be more eco-friendly. During remodels and renovations sections of the hotel are block off while they work on that current part, then move on to the next section and continue this until all the work is finished. This way the hotel can stay open while remodeling.

Belonging to the family Leporidae, it is one of fourteen species in the genus Sylvilagus, a genus restricted to the New World. The Omilteme cottontail is considered one of the most endangered rabbit species in the world and is only known and been described by very few specimens.  Description  The Omilteme cottontail is a large rabbit with long ears (greater than 53mm from the base), hind feet of medium length (greater than 81mm) and a short tail. This rabbit has a very distinct coat colouration. Around the nose and orbital area, the coat is a dull grey. The convex surface of the ears is a dark brown- black colour and the black is also very concentrated along the anterior border as well as on the tips of the ears. The dorsal side is rufous (a red-brown colour) mixed with black while the sides are grey-black in colour. The medium- sized hind feet are white on the dorsal side and the soles are a dark brown. The dorsal side of the tail is reddish-black while the ventral side is white  Anatomy  The literature available on the anatomy of Sylvilagus insonus mainly concentrates on the skull and therefore distinguishing features of the Omilteme cottontail's skull have been well described. The skull is large, approximately in length and in depth, with a large palate and a wide braincase. The supraorbital process is flat, attached to the braincase and has two extensions (anterior and posterior). The anterior extension of the supraorbital process is attached to the skull while the posterior extension is slender and can be free of the brain case or attached with a slit in between the process and the braincase. The supraoccipital shield is square shaped. The tympanic bullae are small and less than in length. The width of the basioccipital is less than . The width of the infraorbital canals is very narrow being less than . The width across the nasals is very narrow and their length is less than . They have medium-sized auditory bullae with a length of less than . The shield bullae have a shallow depth of less than . The skull also has a narrow basioccipital and is very broad across the carotid foramina. The mouth consists of a mandible whose height is less than with a mandible ramus depth of less than . The incisive foramen and the diastema are short. The premaxillaries have dorsal extensions. They have large maxillary and mandibular tooth rows. The Omilteme cottontail is heterodont with a total of 28 teeth. They have incisors, premolars and molars, and lack canines. The dental formula is . The length of the first upper incisor is generally less than . = Differences from other members of the genus Sylvilagus = Sylvilagus insonus differs from S. brasiliensis (forest rabbit) and S. dicei (Dice's cottontail) in that it has a larger skull, wider zygomatic bone, deeper rostrum, wider carotid foramina and dorsal extensions of the premaxillaries that extend posterior to the nasal instead. S. insonus also has a narrower basioccipital and narrower post-dental. In external appearance, the Omilteme cottontail has a longer bicoloured tail (rufous and black) instead of a uni-coloured tail (solely brown); hind feet with white and brown versus hind feet of only brown; and longer ears. In contrast, S. insonus differs from S. cunicularius (Mexican cottontail) with whom it shares its habitat by being smaller in size. Most notably S. insonus is smaller in: length of upper incisors, skull length, nasal length, width of basioccipital, auditory bulla length, the depth of shield bullae, skull depth, width across infraorbital canals, mandible height and mandible ramus depth. In colour, dorsally the Omilteme cottontail is a rufous-black colour whereas the Mexican cottontail is only grey dorsally.  Taxonomy and systematics  There is no fossil evidence of Sylvilagus insonus and it is only known from its type locality in the province of Guerrero, Mexico. The exact phylogenetic relationship between S. insonus to other species in the genus Sylvilagus is still unknown but the only other member of the genus living in Guerrero is S. cunicularius.  Distribution  S. insonus is endemic to Mexico and is found only in Sierra Madre del Sur of the State of Guerrero. It is only known from its type locality, located in a wooded summit of a semi-isolated mountain range. Its habitat range is 2,133-3048m elevation. Surrounding the wooded area is the village of Omiltemi at 2,332m above sea level (in Municipio Chilpancingo). The Omilteme cottontail is therefore restricted to a region of less than 500 square kilometres.  Ecology  The Omilteme cottontail lives at the summit of a mountain range which has steep slopes and ravines covered with dense cloud forests. Some pine and pine-oak forests are present as well. It shares its habitat with 37 other mammal species. In the dense cloud forests, the rabbit lives amongst the undergrowth where it makes runways and burrows under objects such as rocks. It is a mainly nocturnal mammal.  Status and conservation  According to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, the Omilteme cottontail is data deficient. The major threats to the survival of this species are poaching and habitat destruction caused by deforestation. This rabbit went unreported in the wild from the early 1900s to the 1990s; however, two specimens were captured in 1998, confirming that the species was still extant. The rabbit is among the 25 \\"most wanted lost\\" species that are the focus of Global Wildlife Conservation's \\"Search for Lost Species\\" initiative.

GAATW is committed to work for changes in the political, economic, social, and legal systems and structures which contribute to the persistence of trafficking in persons and other human rights violations in the context of migratory movements for diverse purposes, including security of labour and livelihood. It was founded in 1994 by several feminist activists. Method GAATW applies a human rights approach to trafficking, which means: * Centering the human rights of trafficked persons and those in vulnerable situations, in all anti-trafficking activities; * Acknowledging the equality of all persons to exercise, defend and promote their inherent, universal and indivisible human rights * Non- discrimination on any grounds, including ethnic descent, age, sexual orientation or preference, religion, gender, age, nationality and occupation (including work in the informal sectors such as domestic work, sex work, etc.) * Primacy of the principles of accountability, participation and inclusivity / non-discrimination in working methodologies, and organisational structures and procedures. In this respect, self-representation and organisation of those directly affected by trafficking are strongly encouraged and supported.  Activities  GAATW's work is structured around three main strategic thematic directions: * Accountability, which aims to increase the accountability of all anti-trafficking stakeholders involved in the design or implementation of anti-trafficking responses, towards the persons whose human rights they purport to protect. * Access to Justice, which aims to broaden spaces for trafficked persons and migrant workers to practice their human rights by improving access to justice and combating all forms of discrimination that impact women‚Äôs ability to exercise their human rights as they relate to trafficking. * Power in Migration and Work, which centres an analysis of women‚Äôs power in their labour and migration to better assess migration and labour policies‚Äô impact on women, and to work towards labour and migration processes that reflect migrants‚Äô needs, aspirations and capabilities. GAATW also serves its members through international advocacy, research and strategic communications. The organisations has produced a number of seminal publications that have challenged and improved the understanding of human trafficking, among them: * Trafficking in Women, Forced Labour and Slavery- like Practices (1997) - the first worldwide investigation of human trafficking in the context of prostitution, marriage and domestic labour * Human Rights Standards for the Treatment of Trafficked Persons (1999) - a collection of human rights standards that can be used to protect trafficked persons' rights. * Collateral Damage - The Impact of Anti-Trafficking Measures on Human Rights around the World (2007) - a research in eight countries across the globe highlighting how anti-trafficking policies are routinely used to infringe on the human rights of groups of people, like women, migrants and sex workers. * What's the Cost of a Rumour? A guide to sorting out the myths and the facts about sporting events and trafficking (2011) - which challenged the wide- spread false belief that large sporting events lead to an increase in human trafficking. Since 2012, GAATW publishes the Anti-Trafficking Review - the first open access, peer reviewed journal dedicated specifically to human trafficking.

According to this myth, he was a soldier in the Habsburg-Ottoman Wars (Battle of Vienna). Armed with nothing but a bar, he supposedly stove in the gates of Belgrade. He refused rewards for his heroic deed from the prince electors. Another legend attributed to him is leading the farmer rebellion against the imperial troops of the Habsburg Emperor Joseph I during the War of Spanish Succession. This culminated in the Sendlinger Mordweihnacht (\\"Sendling Christmas Massacre\\"). In literature, the smith is described as a man of over 70 years of age, yet great in stature and power. For the revolt, he supposedly armed himself with a spiked club of his own making that weighed over 100 lb (50 kg) . On the night of the massacre, the smith fought in the ranks of the rebels at the Sendling Parish Church. There he died heroically, the last man to fall. History Historical research about the smith of Kochel has shown that he was probably only a legend and a symbol rather than a real person, possibly invented to make the defeat of the revolt more bearable. The smith is known as Balthasar with a last name of either Mayer or Riesenberger. A Balthasar Mayer (born January 6, 1644 in Waalkirchen) actually existed, but no evidence of this person being a smith in Kochel could be found. A Balthasar Riesenberger (born in Bach bei Holzolling) took part in the battle in Sendling, but no evidence of his being a smith in Kochel could be found either. The fact that Kochel belonged to the court district of Murnau at the time of the revolt, which did not take part in the Oberl√§nder rebellion, also speaks against the Kochel theory. In memory of the Sendling Christmas Massacre and the Smith of Kochel, there are regular pageants and events in Bavaria.

In 1876, Jabavu took over editorship of the Isigidimi samaXhosa (\\"The Xhosa Messenger\\"), and by the early 1880s had become an important political force. Jabavu's writings tended to focus on the threat of growing Afrikaner nationalism and his demands for equal rights for South Africa's black population. Tengo Jabavu was also known as a proponent of women's rights as well as public education. In recognition of his political influence, a group of prominent Cape Colony political figures approached Tengo Jabavu in 1883 with a request for him to stand for election to the Cape Parliament. They recommended that he represent one of the constituencies of the Cape where Black African voters formed a significant percentage of the electorate, such as Victoria East. However Jabavu declined, citing the possibility that such a move would unite and aggravate reactionary elements in the Cape Parliament and would therefore be counterproductive. Nonetheless, he later lent his powerful support to the more liberal leaders of the Cape's South African Party against the repressive policies of Rhodes's \\"Progressives\\"Cape Argus Weekly 7 September 1898 & 23 Dec. 1903. In 1884, Tengo Jabavu founded his own newspaper, Imvo Zabantsundu (\\"Black Opinion\\"); a year later, he married Elda Sakuba, who would die in 1900, leaving four sons. The eldest of these sons, Davidson Don Tengo Jabavu, would become a respected author and activist in his own right; the second eldest, Alexander, succeeded John Tengo Jabavu as editor of Imvo Zabantsundu, following his 1921 death in the home of D.D.T.

While it aspired to unity, Jabavu's movement was still perceived as dominated by Fengu people like Jabavu himself. By contrast, Rubusana's movement was perceived as dominated by Gcaleka. Rivalry was exacerbated by subtle ethnic tensions, but largely came to an end as some degree of unity was achieved under the larger African National Congress, intended finally to lay to rest \\"the aberrations of the Xhosa-Fingo feud.\\" References  External links *John Tengo Jabavu at SAhistory.org Category:1859 births Category:1921 deaths Category:19th-century South African people Category:Anti- apartheid activists Category:South African activists Category:South African newspaper editors Category:South African Party (Cape Colony) politicians Category:South African writers Category:Xhosa people Category:Members of the Order of Luthuli Category:Xhosa-language writers ","title":"John Tengo Jabavu"},{"id":"3427245","text":"Sathanur is a village located near Magadi in Bangalore district of Karnataka, India.

Retiring as the most capped Australian Kangaroos player ever, Churchill is thus considered one of the game's greatest ever players Century's Top 100 Players and the prestigious Clive Churchill Medal for man-of-the-match in the NRL grand final bears his name. Churchill's attacking flair as a player is credited with having changed the role of the . Background Clive Churchill was born in Newcastle, New South Wales, and was a star schoolboy at Marist Brothers, Hamilton where he won five premierships while at school. The brothers at his school banned him from playing with Central Newcastle juniors and as a result he only appeared for them a handful of times. Playing career In 1946 Churchill was graded with Central in the Newcastle Rugby League competition as a . He represented for Country Seconds in 1946 and came to the attention of Sydney talent scouts. He was signed to South Sydney by their patron Dave Spring and moved to Sydney at the start of the 1947 season. Like many top Australian players, Churchill attracted the attention of English clubs, and was signed by Workington Town for ¬£10,000.See Chesterton, Ray; Tiger, Tiger Burning Bright: The Story of the Balmain Rugby League Club, p. 111 However, an international transfer ban imposed by the ARL in 1948 meant Churchill had to stay in Sydney. Under captain-coach Jack Rayner, South Sydney reached the 1949 season's grand final against St. George and Churchill played at fullback in the Rabbitohs' loss. Souths reached the grand final again the following season, this time against Western Suburbs, and Churchill played fullback in the Rabbitohs' victory. Nicknamed \\"The Little Master\\" Churchill was selected to captain Sydney's representative team when they hosted France during the 1951 French rugby league tour of Australia and New Zealand. The match ended in a 19‚Äìall draw. At the end of the 1951 season South Sydney reached their third consecutive grand final, this time against Manly-Warringah and Churchill played at fullback, scoring a try in the Rabbitohs' second consecutive victory. Churchill missed South Sydney's fourth consecutive grand final in 1952 as he was away on the Kangaroo tour to England. South Sydney reached the 1953 season's premiership final, their fifth in succession, and Churchill played at fullback, kicking a goal in the Rabbitohs' victory over St. George. Souths won the 1953 premiership without the need to play a grand final, but this would be the last time such an outcome was possible with the mandating of a grand final to determine the premiership from the following season onward. At the 1954 Rugby League World Cup, the first ever rugby football world cup, Churchill captained the Australian team, however they failed to reach the final. He would play for the Rabbitohs as they defeated Newtown 23‚Äì15 in the first mandatory grand final in 1954. Churchill played Souths' second last regular game of the 1955 season against Manly with a broken arm, winning the game with a successful sideline conversion kicked after the full-time bell with his broken arm wrapped in cardboard. However he was forced to miss the finals in 1955 due to injury. Churchill played his final Test for Australia on the 1956‚Äì57 Kangaroo tour. He captained South Sydney in 1957 and captained-coached them in 1958, which would prove his last season playing for the Rabbitohs. Churchill spent twelve seasons at Redfern, playing 164 games and winning five premierships: 1950, 1951, 1953, 1954 and 1955. In 1959 Churchill captain-coached Brisbane Rugby League club Norths to a premiership, and was also selected as captain-coach for the Queensland team. He retired from playing at the end of that season, but in 1961 he played a swansong season in the northwestern town of Moree, New South Wales. Churchill had played 34 Tests for Australia and the 1954 World Cup series. He captained Australia in 24 Test matches over a period of six years which including three series against Great Britain. He also played 37 games for New South Wales the standing record for most games by a player for the state. Coaching career Churchill, widely renowned for his coaching career, was appointed non-playing coach of the Australia national team for their 1959‚Äì60 Kangaroo tour. On the tour the Australians lost the Ashes series to Great Britain but won both test matches against France. Churchill commenced his NSWRFL Premiership coaching career with Canterbury-Bankstown in 1963. The club finished with the wooden spoon the following season and Churchill was replaced by Eddie Burns. In 1967 Churchill was appointed coach of South Sydney. He had immediate success, the Rabbitohs winning the premiership in his inaugural year as coach. He steered the Rabbitohs to four premiership victories out of five grand final appearances between 1967 and 1971. Churchill resigned as coach of the Rabbitohs during the 1975 season. Churchill also had success in coaching the Queensland and Australian teams. Churchill was also commemorated as one of Australias most successful coaches. Accolades On 10 June 1985 Churchill was honoured as a Member of the Order of Australia \\"in recognition of service to sport, particularly Rugby League Football and to the community\\". Also that year he was selected by the respected publication Rugby League Week as one of the initial four post-war \\"Immortals\\" of the Australian game alongside Fulton, Raper and Gasnier. In 1986 the newly built Clive Churchill Stand at the Sydney Cricket Ground was named in his honour. He is one of six sportsmen and only two rugby league players to have a stand at the SCG named after him. The Clive Churchill Medal has, since 1986, been awarded annually to the player judged best on ground in the season's Grand Final. A plaque in the Walk of Honour at the Sydney Cricket Ground commemorates his career as not only a great player but as an all-time great coach. In 2002 Churchill was inducted into the Australian Rugby League Hall of Fame and was later named in the South Sydney team of the Century. In 2007 Churchill was selected by a panel of experts at fullback in an Australian 'Team of the 50s'. In February 2008, Churchill was named in the list of Australia's 100 Greatest Players (1908‚Äì2007) which was commissioned by the NRL and ARL to celebrate the code's centenary year in Australia. Churchill went on to be named as fullback in Australian rugby league's Team of the Century. Announced on 17 April 2008, the team is the panel's majority choice for each of the thirteen starting positions and four interchange players.

The media not only informs the public, but it also works towards engaging citizens and creating public debate. The civic journalism movement is an attempt to abandon the notion that journalists and their audiences are spectators in political and social processes. In its place, the civic journalism movement seeks to treat readers and community members as participants.  Overview  With a small but committed following, civic journalism has become as much of a philosophy as it is a practice. Civic journalism has began to develop a strong following again after first emerging as a philosophy in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Those who find civic journalism to be a new, progressive, and profound method for the media to engage with the public see it as an opportunity to revitalize democracy as we know it. As technological advances overtake the modern world, it is becoming less common for the general public to buy newspapers or watch TV news to inform themselves on the events in the political sphere. Including this, younger generations, such as Generation X, Generation Y, and even Millennials, are not coming out to the polls due to a variety of reasons. Overall, democracy is beginning to fail as there is a lack of civic engagement and even interference with democratic processes, such as Russia's involvement with the 2016 United States election, and even electronic voting (e-voting) machines that are being hacked and altering results. All in all, proponents of civic journalism believe that for democracy to regain its traction and glory in the modern world, the media must be more receptive to feedback from the public and take initiative to engage the public as well. According to Oxford Research Encyclopedias, the popularity of political journalism is rising, and the area is becoming one of the more dominant domains of journalism. Political journalism is meant to be more of an overseer of democratic process as they relate to civic engagement rather than a scapegoat for the issues with democracy. Including this, there are four key concepts that political journalism can be boiled down to. These concepts are the framing of politics as a strategic game, interpretive versus straight news, conflict framing and media negativity, and finally, political or partisan bias. In essence, these can be viewed as the four quintessential pillars of civic journalism. History In the 1920s, before the notion of public journalism was developed, there was the famous debate between Walter Lippmann and John Dewey over the role of journalism in a democracy. Lippmann viewed the role of the journalist to be simply recording what policy makers say and then providing that information to the public. In opposition to this, Dewey defined the journalist's role as being more engaged with the public and critically examining information given by the government. He thought journalists should weigh the consequences of the policies being enacted. Dewey believed conversation, debate, and dialogue were what democracy was all about and that journalism has an important piece of that conversation. Decades later Dewey's argument was further explored by Jay Rosen and Davis Merritt, who were looking at the importance of the media in the democratic process. In 1993, Rosen and Merritt formed the concept of public journalism. In their joint \\"manifesto\\" on public journalism that was published in 1994, Rosen explains that \\"public journalism tries to place the journalist within the political community as a responsible member with a full stake in public life. But it does not deny the important difference between journalists and other actors including political leaders, interest groups and citizens themselves...In a word, public journalists want public life to work. In order to make it work they are willing to declare an end to their neutrality on certain questions ‚Äì for example: whether a community comes to grips with its problems, whether political earns the attention it claims.\\" Picture of Jay Rosen, a professor of journalism at New York University. According to communication scholar Seong Jae Min, it was actually in the 1990s when this conversation style of journalism, \\"gained significant traction in both academia and the professional world of journalism\\". He reports that the rise of this idea combined with ongoing dissent over traditional journalistic practice lead to the movement of public journalism. \\"This new journalistic movement was born to defeat the plagues of modern democracy in which citizens are alienated from the civic life and reduced to passive voters\\". He later admits that this movement was superficially prescriptive, and that due to several reasons it was eclipsed by the movement for citizen journalism. Definition According to the now dormant Pew Center for Civic Journalism, the practice \\"is both a philosophy and a set of values supported by some evolving techniques to reflect both of those in journalism. At its heart is a belief that journalism has an obligation to public life ‚Äì an obligation that goes beyond just telling the news or unloading lots of facts. The way we do our journalism affects the way public life goes.\\"Pew Center for Civic Journalism, \\"Doing Civic Journalism,\\" at http://www.pewcenter.org/doingcj/ , accessed Dec. 25, 2008 Leading organizations in the field include the now dormant Pew Center, the Kettering Foundation, the Participatory Journalism Interest Group (formerly named the Civic and Citizen Journalism Interest Group) in the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication (AEJMC) and the Public Journalism Network. Although they developed the concept of public journalism together, both Rosen and Merritt have differing viewpoints on what exactly public journalism is. Rosen defines public journalism as a way of thinking about the business of the craft that calls on journalists to (1) address people as citizens, potential participants in public affairs, rather than victims or spectators; (2) help the political community act upon, rather than just learn about, its problems; (3) improve the climate of public discussion, rather than simply watch it deteriorate; and (4) help make public life go well, so that it earns its claim on our attention and (5) speak honestly about its civic values, its preferred view of politics, its role as a public actor. Rosen explains five ways to understand public journalism: *As an argument, a way of thinking about what journalist should be doing, given their own predicament and general state of public life. *As an experiment, a way of breaking out of established routines and making a different kind of contribution to public life. *As a movement involving practicing journalists, former journalists who want to improve their craft, academics and researchers with ideas to lend and studies that might help, foundations and think tanks that gave financial assistance and sanctuary to the movement, and other like minded folk who wanted to contribute to the rising spirit of reform. *As a debate with often heated conversation within the press and with others outside it about the proper role of the press. *As an adventure, an open-ended and experimental quest for another kind of press. Merritt, on the other hand, explains that it is the responsibility of the journalist to act as a fair-minded participant in the public arena. His famous analogy of the journalist having the same role as a sports referee best depicts this idea: > The function of a third party ‚Äì a referee or umpire or judge ‚Äì in sports > competition is to facilitate the deciding of the outcome. Ideally, the > official impinges on the game; if things go according to the rules, he or > she is neither seen nor heard. Yet the presence of a fair-minded participant > is necessary in order for an equitable decision to be reached. What he or > she brings to the arena is knowledge of the agreed-upon rules, the > willingness to contribute that knowledge, and authority ‚Äì that is, the right > to be attended to. The referee's role is to make sure that the process works > as the contestants agreed it should. In order to maintain that authority, > that right to be heard, the referee must exhibit no interest in the final > score other than it is arrived at under the rules. But, both for referees > and contestants, that is the ultimate interest. It is important to remember > that the referee doesn't make the rules. Those are agreed on by the > contestants ‚Äì in this case, the democratic public. The referee, rather, is > the fair-minded caretaker. What journalist should bring to the arena of > public life is knowledge of the rules ‚Äì how the public has decided a > democracy should work and the ability and the willingness to provide > relevant information and a lace for that information to be discussed and > turned into democratic consent. Like the referee, to maintain our authority > ‚Äì the right to be heard ‚Äì we must exhibit no partisan interest in the > specific outcome other than it is arrived at under the democratic process. In a National Public Radio interview Merritt summed up civic journalism as \\"a set of values about the craft that recognizes and acts upon the interdependence between journalism and democracy. It values the concerns of citizens over the needs of the media and political actors, and conceives of citizens as stakeholders in the democratic process rather than as merely victims, spectators or inevitable adversaries. As inherent participants in the process, we should do our work in ways that aid in the resolution of public problems by fostering broad citizen engagement.\\"Jeffrey A. Dvorkin. 2001. \\"Can Public Radio Journalism Be Re-Invented?\\" National Public Radio interview with W. Davis \\"Buzz\\" Merritt Jr. (Dec. 30) at https://www.npr.org/yourturn/ombudsman/2001/010705.html, accessed Dec. 25, 2008  Goals  The goal of civic journalism, or public journalism, is to allow the community to remain engaged with journalists and news outlets, restore democratic values, and rebuild the public's trust in journalists. The ubiquity of \\"fake news\\" and biased reporting in the modern media landscape has led to an overall decrease in the trust that people put in journalists and media sources. Proponents of civic journalism believe that this philosophy will allow individuals to have a greater say in decision-making and in the broader political sphere. Given the rise in yellow journalism and search engine optimization algorithms that create an echo-chamber among mass-media, civic journalism is entering a niche role where it can shift the position of news within public reception. Recently, news publishers undergo more and more observation as their ethics and content come under extensive scrutiny for political biases. Civic journalism pivots the role of publishers from distributing information to curating information. Given one of civic journalism's central tenets - making the press a forum for discussion of community issues - a publisher is able to seek out a niche in bolstering local engagement over spreading knowledge of international issues readily available on the Internet.  Related concepts  Citizen journalism is variety of journalism that is conducted by people who are not simply professional journalists, but who convey information by using social media and various blog posts. Recently, citizen journalism has expanded its worldwide influence despite continuing concerns over whether citizen journalists are as reliable as true, well-practiced journalists. The goal of citizen journalists is to increase civic engagement, similar to how the goal civic journalism is to increases civic engagement. Citizen journalists may be influencers as opposed to accredited journalists, but still have a substantial means of conveying their message to the general public.  Political journalism  As previously mentioned, a similar concept to civic journalism is political journalism. Political journalism has four key pillars, which are the framing of politics as a strategic game, conflict framing and media negativity, interpretive versus straight news, and political or partisan bias. These four pillars are integral to the ideology as a whole. Political journalism relates to civic journalism in that it is a movement towards democratizing the media to partake in the voting process. Political journalism's first pillar, the framing of politics as a strategic game, is meant to signify how politics should not simply be seen as a simple election process for democracies. In order to win, one must play the game well. Civic journalism and political journalism are meant to be tools for successful democratic elections in viewing politics as a strategic game. This is mainly due to the fact that they both encourage constituents to voice their opinions so that politicians are more representative of the true whole. The second pillar is conflict framing and media negativity, due to the fact that information portrayed in the media can often be skewed or false. Political journalism offers an avenue to resolve this issue and eliminates potential conflicts of interest. The third pillar is interpretative versus straight news. Often, the way that information is portrayed is not entirely neutral, and has some bias. Media sources may leave the implications or ramifications of a certain news event up to interpretation by the viewer. An idea that relates to this is interpretive journalism, or interpretive reporting, which requires a journalist to go beyond the basic facts related to a news event and provide a deeper analysis or coverage of an event. Finally, the last pillar is political or partisan bias, which in a sense relates to the rest of these pillars as well. Political or partisan bias refers to the non-neutrality of news coverage or general political occurrences. Often, when politicians speak they are heavily biased, and it is up to the individual to determine whether to believe what they are hearing. Political and civic journalism provide an avenue for the media and the general public to integrate into the democratic process to promote transparency. Main tenets According to The Roots of Civic Journalism by David K. Perry,David K. Perry, Roots of Civic Journalism: Darwin, Dewey, and Mead. Lanham, MD: Rowman and Littlefield, 2003. the practitioners of civic journalism ‚Äì who saw the movement's most drastic growth in the early 1990s ‚Äì have always adhered to the basic tenets of public journalism: * \\"Attempting to situate newspapers and journalists as active participants in community life, rather than as detached spectators.\\" * \\"Making a newspaper a forum for discussion of community issues.\\" * \\"Favoring the issues, events and problems important to ordinary people.\\" * \\"Considering public opinion through the process of discussion and debate among members of a community.\\" * \\"Attempting to use journalism to enhance social capital.\\" Structure Usually formulated by a few devoted members in a newsroom, civic journalism projects are typically associated with the opinion section of papers. These projects are usually found in the form of organized town meetings and adult education programs. The Public Journalism Network explains that \\"journalism and democracy work best when news, information and ideas flow freely; when news portrays the full range and variety of life and culture of all communities; when public deliberation is encouraged and amplified; and when news helps people function as political actors and not just as political consumers.\\"Public Journalism Network, 2003. ‚ÄúA Declaration for Public Journalism,‚Äù (25 January), at http://www.pjnet.org/charter.shtml, accessed Dec. 25, 2008 Key proponents and opponents Civic journalism is a polarizing philosophy, according to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln College of Journalism and Mass Communications. Proponents believe integrating journalism into the democratic process helps inform voters and makes them more aware of what is occurring in the political sphere. It may make a difference in the democratic process if all voters are well informed. Civic journalism itself is the process of integrating journalism into the democratic process and allowing voters and the media to play a more active role rather than being witnesses and bystanders of political events. Opponents find civic journalism to be risky and ineffective and believe it brings about conflicts of interest and necessitates involvement in unethical public affairs. Notable proponents of civic journalism include: *John Bender, assistant professor of new editorial at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, claims that journalists who are the most esteemed and high regarded play active roles in helping their community thrive. *David Mathews, president of the Kettering Foundation and a supporter of civic journalism states that, \\"when people are in the business of making choices, are going to look for information to inform their choices.\\" Mathews affirms that civic journalism is aimed at aligning journalistic practices with the ways that citizens form publics, in turn creating a more efficient and reciprocal way of communicating with readers. *Jay Rosen, a journalism professor at New York University, is one of the earliest proponents of civic journalism. From 1998‚Äì99, Rosen wrote and spoke frequently about civic journalism. He published his book, What Are Journalists For? in 1999 about the early rise of the civic journalism movement.Jay Rosen. What Are Journalists For? New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1999. Rosen writes a popular blog called PressThink. *W. Davis \\"Buzz\\" Merritt Jr., a former editor of The Wichita Eagle, is another pioneer of civic journalism. Merritt is a key advocate for news media reforms, and published his book Public Journalism and Public Life in 1995. Merritt began exploring civic journalism after acknowledging loss of public trust in traditional journalistic values. Merritt feels that journalists need a clear understanding and appreciation for the interdependence of journalism and democracy. *James W. Carey, a media critic and a journalism instructor at Columbia University, was an advocate for the public journalism movement. He saw it as a \\"reawakening of an antecedent tradition of journalism and politics, one that emphasizes local democracy, the community of locale, and citizenship as against the distant forces that would overwhelm it...public journalism performs a great service in reminding us what is work protecting.\\" *Seong Jae Min states that the idea of public or civic journalism is a notion that the press not only informs the public, but also works toward engaging citizens and creating public debate. It was \\"about problem solving for the public rather than truth seeking.\\" But it eventually faltered for several reasons: public journalism lacked clear conceptual definitions, ignored news businesses‚Äô commercial interests, and its effort was artificial, surrounded by many textbook, normative parameters of deliberative democracy: public journalists imposed shared values and goals on citizens to force problem solving and public judgment. Case studies *Citizen Voices The Citizen Voices Project was one newspaper's attempt to facilitate civic conversation within the diverse city of Philadelphia. Citizen Voices came into effect in 1999, during a very close mayoral election between a black democrat and a white republican. Citizen Voices was modeled on the National Issues Forum and was intended to amplify minority voices not frequently acknowledged in the political realm. Forums were held throughout the city, facilitating deliberation of the most important issues facing citizens: jobs, neighborhoods, public safety, and reforming city hall. Essays written by Citizen Voices participants were published in the commentary pages of The Philadelphia Inquirer, while the editorial board framed its coverage of the campaign around the five designated issues. While the Citizen Voices Project did not increase voter turnout, it has given journalists a new perspective on how to cover urban political issues. *The Front Porch Forum was introduced in Seattle in 1994 through a partnership between the Seattle Times newspaper, KUOW-FM radio station and the Pew Center for Civic Journalism. The mission of the Front Porch Forum was to strengthen communities through news coverage that focuses on citizens‚Äô concerns, encourages civic participation, improves public deliberation and reconnects citizens, candidates and reporters to community life. Over the course of 5 ¬Ω years, the Seattle Times and KUOW-FM featured a series of stories highlighting issues that affect Seattle residents, and encouraged readers' participation. *Critical thinking in Public Journalism: \\"Public conversation imagined in public journalism was rigid and artificial. Public journalism placed a high premium on consensus and civility, it has made no space for social movements and settled for a demure, middle-class conception of public life.\\"  See also  References External links *Pew Center for Civic Journalism (link not working) *Kettering Foundation *Jay Rosen of New York University *Citizen Voices *Public Journalism Network *Citizen/Public Journalism Bibliography *CGnet Swara Category:Types of journalism ru:–ì—Ä–∞–∂–¥–∞–Ω—Å–∫–∞—è –∂—É—Ä–Ω–∞–ª–∏—Å—Ç–∏–∫–∞ ","title":"Civic journalism"},{"id":"3427293","text":"\\"Poker Face\\" (stylized as \\"poker face\\") is Ayumi Hamasaki's debut single under Avex Trax.

The Headmaster, Robert Dahl (Headmaster. 1952-71), greeted the Queen, and in his study presented a specially bound copy of B.C.W Johnson‚Äôs A Brief History of Wrekin College, whilst Head of School, David Franklin (W. 1961-67) was given the honour of presenting a cricket bat for her sons. Girls were introduced to the sixth form by headmaster Geoffrey Hadden in 1975. It became fully co- educational in 1983. There are currently approximately 492 pupils including a number of international boarders. The school admits pupils from the age of eleven. In 2006, the trust was merged with that of the Old Hall Preparatory School (founded 1845), which moved from its original site on Limekiln Lane to the site of Wrekin College. Old Wrekinians Association In 1907, The Old Wrekinian Association, (OWA), was created by just a small group of 14 past pupils and has today almost 6000 members who have subscribed to the mailing list. The sole purpose of the OWA is to help past students keep in touch with not only one another but also the school. The OWA Record magazine is published twice a year and it contains news of the OWA members and the school. There are five officials of the OWA, and they are as follows: President: Barrie Roberts (N.51-55) Chairman: Emma Crawford (n√©e Summers)(R. 94-99) Vice-Chairman: Neil Griffiths (L/Y. 93-00) Treasurer: Haydn Griffiths (Staff. 76-16) Auditor: Yvonne Thomas (Bursar. 04-20) Secretary: Michael de Weymarn (Staff. 74-10) Archivist: Mervyn Joyner (Staff. 62-94) Staff representative: David Winterton (B.81-86) (Staff. 98-present) They meet at least twice a year along with the current Wrekin College headmaster Mr Tim Firth, OW School Governors and OW Branch representatives.

The medical term for this infection in humans and other animals is sparganosis. Morphologically, these worms are similar to other worms in the genus Spirometra. They have a long body consisting of three sections: the scolex, the neck, and the strobilia. They have a complex life cycle that consists of three hosts, and can live in varying environments and bodily tissues. Humans can contract this parasite in three main ways (ingestion of under cooked meat, contaminated water, or poultices contained contaminated flesh). Historically, humans are considered a paratenic host; however, the first case of an adult S. erinaceieuropaei infection in humans was reported in 2017. Spirometra tapeworms exist worldwide and infection is common in animals, but S. erinaceieuropaei infections are rare in humans. Treatment for infection typically includes surgical removal and anti-worm medication.  Morphology  Adult Spirometra are typically large worms with long bodies consisting of three distinguishable body sections: the scolex, the neck, and the strobilia. Overall body length can reach up to several meters; however, this can vary depending on host species as well as other factors. The scolex is the spoon shaped anterior portion of the worm and consists of the head with attachments. Instead of hooks and distinct suckers (like most tape worms), S. erinaceieuropaei have two bothria. Bothria are grooves on the scolex that contain weak muscles that perform a sucking action. The neck is unsegmented and located between the scolex and the rest of the body. The proglottids make up the remainder of the body (everything after the neck), and together are termed the strobilia. As proglottids mature, they develop two sets of reproductive organs, one male and one female. Each proglottid is capable of reproducing via self fertilization. Eggs are typically ovoid in shape with tapered ends. Finally, should the head and neck be severed from one or all of the proglottids, S. erinaceieuropaei can regenerate a new body. Life cycle The S. erinaceieuropaei life cycle is complex and consists of three hosts. The life cycle starts when eggs are discharged via feces from the definitive host. When discharged, the eggs are immature until they reach a fresh water source. Once in fresh water, the eggs hatch to become first stage larvae (coracidia). From here, coracidia are ingested by crustaceans (copepods), which become the first intermediate host. Inside the first intermediate host, the coracidia develop into procercoid larvae; however, this is still considered the first larval stage. Next, copepods are eaten by fish, reptiles, or other amphibians that become the second intermediate host. Inside the second intermediate host, the larvae will burrow into the intestinal tract where they develop into plerocercoid larvae (the final larval stage). In the final larvae stage, S. erinaceieuropaei migrate to subcutaneous tissues and/or muscles. Finally, the second intermediate host is eaten by a definitive host. A couple of weeks later, S. erinaceieuropaei mature into adult tapeworms and the life cycle continues. Adult tapeworms can survive up to 30 years in their definitive host (typically dogs and cats). The secondary intermediate host can also be eaten by other animals such as primates, pigs, mice, birds, and even humans. These animals become the paratenic hosts.  Transmission to humans  There are three ways in which humans have become infected in the past: 1) Eating raw or under cooked snakes, frogs, and other four footed animals; 2) drinking contaminated water containing infected copepods; and 3) using raw snake or frog flesh in poultices that come in contact with intact human skin (Spirometra larvae have been shown to penetrate skin and cause infection in this manner.) This method was more prevalent in parts of Asia where poultices were used due to superstition.  Geographical distribution  Spirometra parasites are found worldwide. Most human cases are recorded from Southeast Asia; however, there are a significant number of animal cases in North America. Historically, humans have been identified as paratenic hosts for larvae; however, the first recorded infection by an adult S. erinaceieuropaei was reported in Vietnam in 2017. For this case, a 23-year-old male was admitted to the hospital with fever, weight loss, and gastric discomfort. Parasite eggs were discovered in his feces and were original thought to be from flukes. As a result, the patient was prescribed anti-worm medication. Two days later, proglottids were viewed in the patients stool. The species of the worm was identified as S. erinaceieuropaei via morphological and molecular methods. The patient fully recovered and was released from the hospital several days later. Pathology Infection of S. erinaceieuropaei is termed sparagnosis. However, this term encompasses the entire genus Spirometra and is not specfic to S. erinaceieuropaei. Sparagnosis due to S. erinaceieuropaei is rare. Adults Spirometra typically infect dogs, cats and other carnivores. They will reproduce in their intestines, and the eggs will be shed in their feces. Although humans can get infected with this parasite, they cannot contract it from the feces of an infected cat or dog. Sparagnosis refers specifically to the infection with Spirometra _larvae_ and is endemic in animals but a rare condition for humans. In humans, the larvae are typically found in subcutaneous tissues or muscle, and will form slowly growing masses. Sometimes infection in humans can also involve genitourinary tract, pleural or abdominal cavity, and scrotum. Infection can also involve the central nervous system, but this is even less common. When the central nervous system is involved, symptoms may occur as many as twenty years after infection. These can include weakness, headache, seizures, numbness, tingling, or abnormal skin sensations. Because the masses are typically slow growing, they often resemble tumors on radio graphs. Additionally, larvae may create migratory lesions (also called wandering lesions) within tissue. These lesions are a large sign of infection. Diagnoses and treatment Infection in humans can be detected via imaging, but because larvae may appear as a mass, most diagnosis occurs after surgical removal. Diagnosis in animals is typically done by characterizing eggs in fecal matter. Since most tapeworm infections within the genus Spirometra have similar egg morphology, species characterization is not typical. Animals are usually treated with anti-worm medications, such as Praziquantel. Surgical removal is the most common treatment in humans, as well as treatment by anti- worm medication such as Albendazole. Genomics The genome of S.erinaceieuropaei recovered from a patient's brain in 2014, was sequenced and is available through the WormBase ParaSite website.

Markell and Voge‚Äôs Medical Parasitology. 9th edition. St. Louis: Saunders Elsevier, 2006.https://www.cdc.gov/dpdx/sparganosis/ It was first described by Patrick Manson from China in 1882, and the first human case was reported by Charles Wardell Stiles from Florida in 1908. The infection is transmitted by ingestion of contaminated water, ingestion of a second intermediate host such as a frog or snake, or contact between a second intermediate host and an open wound or mucous membrane.Manson, P., Manson-Bahr, P., and Wilcocks, C. Manson‚Äôs Tropical Diseases: A Manual of the Diseases. New York: William Wood and Company, 1921. Humans are the accidental hosts in the life cycle, while dogs, cats, and other mammals are definitive hosts. Copepods (freshwater crustaceans) are the first intermediate hosts, and various amphibians and reptiles are second intermediate hosts. Once a human becomes infected, the plerocercoid larvae migrate to a subcutaneous location, where they typically develop into a painful nodule.GIDEON, \\"Sparganosis.\\" Date viewed February 26, 2009 Migration to the brain results in cerebral sparganosis, while migration to the eyes results in ocular sparganosis. Sparganosis is most prevalent in Eastern Asia, although cases have been described in countries throughout the world. In total, approximately 300 cases have been described in the literature up to 2003. Diagnosis is typically not made until the sparganum larva has been surgically removed. Praziquantel is the drug of choice, although its efficacy is unknown and surgical removal of the sparganum is generally the best treatment. Public health interventions should focus on water and dietary sanitation, as well as education about the disease in rural areas and discouragement of the use of poultices. Symptoms Clinical presentation of sparganosis most often occurs after the larvae have migrated to a subcutaneous location. The destination of the larvae is often a tissue or muscle in the chest, abdominal wall, extremities, or scrotum, although other sites include the eyes, brain, urinary tract, pleura, pericardium, and spinal canal. The early stages of disease in humans are often asymptomatic, but the spargana typically cause a painful inflammatory reaction in the tissues surrounding the subcutaneous site as they grow. Discrete subcutaneous nodules develop that may appear and disappear over a period of time. The nodules usually itch, swell, turn red, and migrate, and are often accompanied by painful edema.Garcia, L., and Bruckner, D.A. Diagnostic Medical Parasitology. Herndon, VA: ASM Press, 2007. Seizures, hemiparesis, and headaches are also common symptoms of sparganosis, especially cerebral sparganosis, and eosinophilia is a common sign. Clinical symptoms also vary according to the location of the sparganum; possible symptoms include elephantiasis from location in the lymph channels, peritonitis from location in the intestinal perforation, and brain abscesses from location in the brain. In genital sparganosis, subcutaneous nodules are present in the groin, labia, or scrotum and may appear tumor-like. Ocular sparganosis a particularly well-described type of sparganosis. Early signs of the ocular form include eye pain, epiphora (excessive watering of the eye), and/or ptosis (drooping of the upper eyelid). Other signs include periorbital edema and/or edematous swelling that resembles Romana‚Äôs sign in Chagas disease, lacrimation, orbital cellulitis, exophthalmos (protrusion of the eyeball), and/or an exposed cornea ulcer. The most common sign at presentation is a mass lesion in the eye. If untreated, ocular sparganosis can lead to blindness. In one case of brain infestation by Spirometra erinaceieuropaei, a man sought treatment on suffering headaches, seizures, memory flashbacks and strange smells. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans showed a cluster of rings, initially in the right medial temporal lobe, but moving over time to the other side of the brain. The cause was not determined for four years; ultimately a biopsy was performed and a 1 cm-long tapeworm was found and removed. The patient continued to suffer symptoms.The Guardian newspaper: Man‚Äôs headaches due to tapeworm living in his brain for four years, 21 November 2014 Transmission The parasite is transmitted to humans in three different ways. First, humans may acquire the infection by drinking water that is contaminated with copepods housing Spirometra larvae. Second, humans may acquire the infection by consuming the raw flesh of one of the second intermediate hosts, such as frogs or snakes. For example, humans consume raw snakes or tadpoles for medicinal purposes in some Asian cultures; if the snakes or tadpoles are infected, the larvae may be transmitted to humans. Third, humans may acquire the infection by placing raw poultices of the second intermediate hosts on open wounds, lesions, or the eyes for medicinal or ritualistic reasons. If the poultice is infected with plerocercoid larvae, the human may become infected. According to Zunt et al., human infection most often occurs following ingestion of infected raw snake, frog, or pig, although contact with infected flesh of an intermediate host can also cause infection. The high prevalence in Korea may be explained by the ingestion of dog meat. In the Western hemisphere, the most common cause of infection is drinking contaminated water. Hosts, reservoirs, and vectors Definitive hosts of Spirometra include dogs, cats, birds, and wild carnivores, while humans are accidental hosts. First intermediate hosts include copepods and other fresh- water crustaceans, while second intermediate hosts include birds, reptiles, and amphibians. The intermediate hosts are also the reservoirs of Spirometra. There are no vectors of Spirometra. Incubation period The incubation period of Spirometra is 20 days to 3 years. Morphology The sparganum larvae are white, wrinkled, and ribbon-shaped. They range from a few millimeters in length to several centimeters. The anterior end can invaginate and bears suggestions of the sucking grooves that are present in the scolex of the mature worm. The absence of a scolex or protoscolex in Spirometra is a key difference in differentiating between Taenia solium and Spirometra. The worm‚Äôs body is also characterized by a stromal network of smooth muscle. In general, plerocercoids in the East (S. mansoni) are described as larger and more delicate than those in the West. The eggs of S. mansonoides provide an example of the general morphological characteristics of Spirometra eggs. S. mansonoides eggs resemble the eggs of D. latum, with some specific differences. S. mansonoides eggs measure 57-66 ¬µm by 33-37 ¬µm, which is smaller than the eggs of D. latum. The eggs of S. mansonoides are also ellipsoidal and have a conical, prominent operculum.Ash, L.R. and Orihel, T.C.. Atlas of Human Parasitology. Chicago: ASCP Press, 1990. Life cycle The adult Spirometra live in the small intestine of the definitive host‚Äîa dog, cat, raccoon, or other mammal‚Äîfor up to 9 years, where they produce many eggs. When the host defecates, the unembryonated eggs leave the body in the feces and hatch when they reach fresh water. The eggs are eaten by copepods (crustaceans of the genus Cyclops), which are the first intermediate hosts. In the copepods, the eggs develop into procercoid larvae that live in the body cavity. The second intermediate hosts include fish, reptiles, or amphibians that consume the copepods. The larvae penetrate the intestinal tract of the second intermediate host, where they become plerocercoid larvae and proliferate to the subcutaneous tissues and muscles. The second intermediate host is eventually eaten by a definitive host predator, such as a dog, and the cycle begins again.CDC: Sparganosis, Date viewed February 25, 2009 Humans are accidental hosts in the cycle, becoming infected with the plerocercoid larvae by contact with or ingestion of the first or second intermediate hosts. The larvae migrate to the subcutaneous tissues in humans; however, no development takes place and the human is not capable of transmitting the disease. In S. proliferum, many larvae, rather than just a few, proliferate throughout the subcutaneous tissues of humans. Diagnosis Sparganosis is typically diagnosed following surgical removal of the worms, although the infection may also be diagnosed by identification of eosinophilia or identification of the parasite in a tissue specimen. If such biopsy and excision procedures are not feasible, the antisparganum ELISA test may be used. In theory, a pre-operative diagnosis could be made by identification of exposure history and a painful, migratory, subcutaneous nodule. Sparganosis usually presents as a single nodule, while other cestode infections such as cysticercosis typically present as multiple nodules. Preoperative diagnosis, however, is rare. CT and MRI scans are especially useful for diagnosis of cerebral sparganosis, as they reveal lesions in the brain. Through a retrospective analysis of 25 cases of cerebral sparganosis from 2000 to 2006, Song et al. found a number of characteristic signs that could be used in the future to diagnose cerebral sparganosis without performing an excision or tissue biopsy. The most characteristic finding was the \\"tunnel sign\\" on MRI images, showing the migrating track of the worm, while the most common finding was multiple conglomerated ring-shaped enhancements, seen as bead-shaped, usually with 3 to 6 rings. These findings led Song et al. to suggest that clinical history, ELISA, and either MRI or CT scans could be sufficient to make a sparganosis diagnosis. These lesions, however, are sometimes mistaken for tuberculosis lesions. In one case cerebral sparganosis was not diagnosed for four years, during which scans showed a cluster of rings moving from the right to the left side of the brain; ultimately the worm was found on biopsy. Prevention Because sparganosis is a rare infection, public health strategies have not made its prevention a priority. Public health strategies focusing on providing basic access to clean water may help to reduce future sparganosis infections. In their retrospective study of 25 cases of cerebral sparganosis, Song et al. found that 12 patients (48%) had eaten raw or uncooked frog or snake that was infected with sparganum, 5 patients (20%) had applied an animal's flesh as a poultice to an open wound, 4 patients had drunk contaminated water, and the cause of infection was not known for 4 patients. As a result of these findings, Song et al. conclude that health education about sparganosis and the importance of food sanitation should be implemented in all rural endemic areas. It has been recommended that water consumed in endemic areas should be boiled or treated to prevent ingestion of Cyclops or Spirometra larvae. Especially in areas where ponds or ditches provide potential habitats for infected copepods, public health strategies should include education campaigns about how to identify drinking water that could potentially be infected. Strategies should warn people against ingesting the raw flesh of the intermediate hosts, such as snakes and frogs, and against using them as poultices. Management  One treatment for sparganosis is praziquantel, administered at a dose of 120 to 150 mg/kg body weight over 2 days; however, praziquantel has had limited success. In general, infestation by one or a few sparganum larvae is often best treated by surgical removal. DNA analysis of rare worms removed surgically can provide genome information to identify and characterise each parasite; treatments for the more common tapeworms can be cross-checked to see whether they are also likely to be effective against the species in question. Epidemiology Sparganosis is endemic or potentially endemic in 48 countries, and although rare, cases have been described in Asia, Africa, Australia, South America, and the United States. The majority of cases occur in Southeast Asia and Eastern Africa. Ocular sparganosis is especially prevalent in China and Vietnam. The highest numbers of cases occur in Korea and Japan. As of 2003, only seven cases of sparganosis had ever been described in Europe. History of discovery Diesing first named the Sparganum genus of cestodes in 1854. Patrick Manson first reported sparganosis and the species Sparganum mansoni in China in 1882, while making the post-mortem examination of a man in Amoy, China.Fantahm, H.B., and Stephens, J.W.W., and Theobald, F.V. The Animal Parasites of Man. New York: William Wood and Company, 1916. The first case of sparganosis in the United States was reported by Stiles in 1908; this was a case of infection by Spirometra proliferum. Mueller first described Spirometra mansonoides in the United States in 1935.

Description As in some other species in the genus Elymnias, the common palmfly has a precostal cell in the hindwings and a tuft of androconial scales on the dorsal discal cell of the hindwings. Some populations of this butterfly species are sexually dimorphic: males and females do not look alike. In sexually dimorphic populations, males have black upperside forewings with small blue patches and mimic Euploea species, while the females mimic butterfly species of the genus Danaus. Race undularis at Kolkata, India Race undularis at Kolkata, India Race undularis (Subhimalayas and Southeast Asia) male upperside blackish brown. Forewing with a subterminal series of blue or sometimes slightly green elongate spots, curving strongly inwards and getting more elongate opposite the apex, forming almost an oblique bar up to the costa. Hindwing: the terminal margin broadly bright chestnut, sometimes with a subterminal paler spot in two or more of the interspaces. Underside pale brown, the basal two-thirds of both forewing and hindwing densely, the outer third more sparsely covered with dark ferruginous, somewhat broad, transverse striae. Forewing with a broadly triangular pale purplish- white preapical mark; both forewings and hindwings with a broad subterminal area purplish white. Hindwing with a small white spot opposite middle of the costa and a more or less complete series of more obscure whitish subterminal spots. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen brown; abdomen beneath paler. Female upperside tawny, veins black. Forewing: the dorsal margin broadly black; the apical area beyond a line curving from the tornus, round apex of the cell and a little beyond it, to the base of the costa also black, the wing crossed preapically by a conspicuous, broad, oblique white bar, and three subterminal white spots. Hindwing: dorsal margin dusky; terminal broadly, costal margin more narrowly, black; a subterminal series of four white spots. Underside tawny, with markings similar to those in the male; the pale whitish markings more extensive; the dorsal margin broadly without striae. Race fraterna, Butler (Sri Lanka) is an insular representative of E. undularis. The male differs on the upperside in the more or less complete absence of the subterminal and preapical blue markings on the forewing; and in the broad terminal border of the hindwing being of a much brighter, almost ochraceous chestnut. On the underside the pale markings are somewhat restricted. The male very closely resembles, both on the upper and underside, the male of E. undularis.

Early political career Inspired by the nationalist and Pan-Africanist ideas of Patrice Lumumba, the co-founder of the Mouvement National Congolais, Gizenga helped to organize the Parti Solidaire Africain (which was openly left leaning). He later became the leader of the party. Following independence and free elections in 1960, Gizenga became Lumumba's deputy prime minister of the new Republic of the Congo. Gizenga in 1961 In September, President Joseph Kasa-Vubu dismissed Lumumba and Gizenga from their positions for the former's decision to involve the Soviet Union in the Congo Crisis. Lumumba protested, and the government went into a deadlock over the issue. A coup launched shortly thereafter by Colonel Joseph Mobutu politically incapacitated both Lumumba and the President, though Mobutu soon developed a working relationship with the latter. Gizenga objected to the new government and left for Stanleyville on 13 November to form his own. On 12 December, he declared his government, the Free Republic of the Congo, to be the legitimate ruling authority in the Congo. Lumumba had attempted to join him, but was arrested and eventually executed in the State of Katanga in January 1961. Gizenga's government persisted for half the year and garnered diplomatic recognition from the Soviet Union, China, and Egypt, though it received no logistical support. In August, Gizenga agreed to rejoin the regular Congolese government as deputy prime minister, now under the leadership of Cyrille Adoula. Aside from his reinstatement ceremony, he chose to stay out of L√©opoldville and remained in Stanleyville. Gizenga soon realized that Adoula was under the influence of Western governments and willing to negotiate with rebel leader Moise Tshombe. He denounced Adoula and declared that the government was committing treason. In January 1962 the Congolese Assembly demanded that Gizenga return to L√©opoldville to hear charges levied against him for leading a rebel government. He replied that he would only come back when the Katangan secession was resolved. Gizenga then attempted to arrest Arm√©e Nationale Congolaise Commander-in-Chief Victor Lundula and a UN official, both of whom were in Stanleyville to investigate the Kindu atrocity. The plan backfired when Gizenga's militiamen refused to obey his orders. Clashes between his regular supporters and Congolese soldiers ensued, resulting in several deaths. United Nations Secretary General U Thant ordered peacekeeping troops to restore order in Stanleyville, while Adoula had Gizenga placed under house arrest by UN and Congolese troops. He was flown back to L√©opoldville via UN aircraft and detained at Camp Kokolo. Gizenga turned down an offer of UN protection and was eventually imprisoned on the island Bula Mbemba which lies in the mouth of the Congo River. In July 1964 Tshombe became prime minister and, as part of an attempted political reconciliation, ordered Gizenga's release. In spite of this, Gizenga quickly organised a Lumumbist party and denounced Tshombe's handling of the Simba rebellion. As a result, Gizenga was placed under house arrest in September. Mobutu seized power in a coup in November 1965, thereby freeing Gizenga. He fled to Congo-Brazzaville, though he soon settled in Moscow to pursue a doctorate in political science. Over the next couple of years Gizenga traveled to Egypt, Guinea, Mali, and Ghana to solicit support for the fractured and crumbling anti-Mobutu movement. In 1973 he briefly joined Laurent-D√©sir√© Kabila's pro-China rebel group in eastern Zaire (as The Congo was then called), thereby losing Soviet support. He then moved to France, but was deported to Algeria. After briefly living in Angola, he returned to the Republic of the Congo before finally settling in Canada. Mobutu invited him to return to Zaire in 1977 to serve as a figurehead for opposition groups, but Gizenga declined. Later political career Mobutu began democratizing Zaire in 1990, allowing Gizenga to return to the country. By 1993, he had consolidated Lumumbist organizations into the Parti Lumumbiste Unifi√© (PALU). The party had very few members, but Gizenga gained respect for his history of opposing Mobutu. He supported Laurent-D√©sir√© Kabila's seizure of power in 1997, which resulted in the country's name being changed back to The Congo. The following year his house was ransacked by police and several PALU demonstrators were shot, and he subsequently opposed Kabila's leadership. Gizenga ran as the presidential candidate of PALU in the July 2006 election. According to the provisional election results of 20 August, he came in third place with 13.06 percent of the vote, after Joseph Kabila (Laurent-D√©sir√©'s son) and Jean-Pierre Bemba. On 30 September 2006, Gizenga signed a coalition agreement with the AMP, Kabila's platform, whereby he would back Kabila in the second round of the presidential election in October 2006, in exchange for the premiership. Kabila won the election and was sworn in as President on 6 December 2006. He subsequently appointed Gizenga as Informant, a position that involves identifying a parliamentary majority so that a government can be formed, Kari Barber, \\"Congo President Begins Forming New Government\\" , VOA News, 21 December 2006. and then appointed Gizenga as Prime Minister on 30 December 2006.

Later in the day he announced this on television, saying that he decided to resign due to his advanced age. According to Gizenga, he felt unable to continue in office: \\"For every man, even if you are sane and alert, your body has limits which you have to recognise\\". \\"DR Congo's prime minister, 83, quits citing old age\\" , AFP, 25 September 2008. He had not received a response from Kabila at that point. Reacting to the news, the opposition Movement for the Liberation of Congo (MLC) said that Gizenga's \\"resignation constitutes an admission of failure and negligence from a government which, after nearly two years, left the country in a general state of crisis\\". The MLC disputed Gizenga's statement that his resignation was related to age and health. \\"Gizenga's resignation 'an admission of failure': opposition\\" , AFP, 26 September 2008.

It is situated within the coastal plain of Jableh, a short distance of two other main archaeological sites: Tell Sukas (5 km) and Tell Siyannu (6 km). As a tell, the site is the result of centuries of habitation on the same place, which resulted in a rising mound, as every new generation built their houses on top of the remains of older structures. The tell is sited about 1.7 kilometers from the coast but it appears that in the Bronze Age a sea incursion provided a harbor access to the sea.

The transition between the Late Bronze Age and Iron Age remains one of the most poorly understood aspects of the most northern Levantine site, but preliminary results from the end of the 2007 campaign show that the city was inhabited during the 11th-10th century BCE. During the Iron Age, the city was completely urbanised. Geophysical prospecting conducted on the complete surface of the tell demonstrated this and made it possible to detect the ancient street system of the Iron Age city. By the Persian era the city had lost its importance and the habitation was relocated near to the modern harbour of Jebleh at the Mediterranean sea coast. Later, during the Byzantine domination of the region, some isolated structures were installed on the surface of the tell.

He played first-class cricket for Yorkshire in 1964, for Lancashire from 1966 to 1979, and for Derbyshire from 1980 to 1983, where he was captain for three seasons. At Osset Cricket Club In 1962, Barry Wood was a celebrity in a charity cricket match in his home town. To the fans disappointment he was caught on the boundary for a duck by local John Russell Orr in his opening over of the match, known in the clubhouse as Russell. Now vice captain of The seniors at Elsham Golf Club. Life and career Wood was born in Ossett, Yorkshire, England. He made his first-class debut for Yorkshire in 1964 but, due to limited opportunities, made the switch across the pennines to Lancashire in 1966, where he became the first ever Yorkshire man to score two Roses hundreds (reaching his century with a six on both occasions) in the same season against his native county. In the 1970s, by winning more Man of the Match gold awards than any other player in the history of the game, he was arguably the most valuable player of a stellar Lancashire team that were the undisputed one day kings of English cricket. This record was finally broken by Graham Gooch. That side was captained by Jack Bond and included a number of international players: Clive Lloyd, David Lloyd and Peter Lever. This great Lancashire team won six trophies in six years ‚Äì the Players County League in 1969, the John Player League in 1970 and the Gillette Cup in 1970, 1971, 1972 and 1975. Wood's highest first-class score was 198 v Glamorgan and he still holds the record at Lancashire for a fifth wicket partnership of 249 with Andy Kennedy against Warwickshire at Edgbaston in 1971. Wood's good form for Lancashire led to his selection for his first Test against Australia at The Oval in 1972. Against a fearsome Australian bowling attack, spearheaded by the great Dennis Lillee, he made a very fine score of 90 which led to his selection for a tour of India and Pakistan. However, he had a lean time in the subcontinent and was dropped from the side. He was selected as a replacement in a New Zealand tour but failed again. The lateness of his selection was a contributing factor as he completed a 63-hour trip from the West Indies to New Zealand just before the first Test. In 1975, he played Tests against Australia, standing up to the menacing duo of Lillee and Thompson scoring a half century. His final Test was against Pakistan in 1978. In his prime, Wood was widely regarded as the finest player of fast bowling in the country. Wood played thirteen One Day Internationals between 1972 and 1982, including playing in the inaugural World Cup in 1975. His One Day International batting record was better than his record in Tests, and he was a handy bowler as well taking nine wickets. In addition, he was one of the best fielders in the gully and in the outfield was the pioneer of many of the dives which are now part and parcel of the modern game. He was the first person to be dismissed by the first ball in an ODI match, bowled by Andy Roberts at Scarborough on 26 August 1976. Wood and controversy seemed closely linked, and an example of this was the 1975 pay dispute which resulted in Lancashire's international players at that time (Wood, Lever and Frank Hayes) being suspended ‚Äì Lever and Hayes for three games and Wood for six games. He also left the club in controversial circumstances when, shortly after receiving a record testimonial cheque of ¬£62,429 in 1979, he again entered into a pay dispute marking the end of his Old Trafford career. Wood moved to Derbyshire in 1980, but only after a protracted dispute with the T.C.C.B in which they attempted to block his registration. However, in a ballot by the P.C.A, his fellow professional players backed him overwhelmingly in a vote of 154 for and 31 against, and his transfer was duly completed. He became captain in 1981 and led them to victory in the Nat West Trophy final against Northamptonshire, which was the first silverware the club had won in its entire history. He was captain again in the 1983 season but resigned midway through, and this would prove to be his last first-class season, when Derbyshire came ninth in the Championship.Barry Wood at Cricket Archive He was then professional for Barnoldswick C.C.in the Ribblesdale league for the remainder of that season following the departure of their professional, Trevor Franklin, who joined the New Zealand squad and who subsequently sored a century at Lords against England. Wood subsequently played for Cheshire from 1986 to 1989, where he had the dubious distinction of recording five consecutive noughts. However, he also produced many fine performances, most notably in the historic win over Northamptonshire in the first round of the Nat West Trophy in 1988. Described as the greatest game in Cheshire's history, Wood took 2‚Äì39 and scored 40 before being run out to earn his record-breaking 21st and final Man of the Match gold award. He was 46 years old at the time. The following season (aged 47 and ten years after his last game for the club), an injury to Wasim Akram led to him being recalled as twelfth man for Lancashire in their championship match versus Warwickshire at Old Trafford, whereupon he took a superb catch in the gully to dismiss Andy Moles. Wood's son, Nathan Wood, played for Lancashire, Cheshire and Young England. Wood was also a fine footballer and played mid-field for Ossett Town in the Yorkshire League in the mid 1960s and for Bradford (Park Avenue) in the Northern Premier League in the 1970s and also Stalybridge Celtic References External links * Category:1942 births Category:Living people Category:People from Ossett Category:Derbyshire cricket captains Category:English cricket captains Category:England Test cricketers Category:England One Day International cricketers Category:English cricketers Category:Cheshire cricketers Category:Lancashire cricketers Category:Cricketers at the 1975 Cricket World Cup Category:Yorkshire cricketers Category:Marylebone Cricket Club cricketers Category:Eastern Province cricketers Category:Cricketers from Yorkshire ","title":"Barry Wood (cricketer)"},{"id":"3427483","text":"The Reverend Percy Ewart Warrington (1889‚Äì1961) was an educationist and evangelical Church of England clergyman. He was vicar of Monkton Combe for forty-three years from 1918 to 1961 and the founder of an educational trust, Allied Schools, in the 1920s which founded and purchased a number of schools in Britain and a girls' school in Kenya. He was described as a 'financier in a surplice'.  Early life  Warrington was born in Newhall, Derbyshire on 29 December 1889, where his father Thomas Warrington was a farmer. He attended Stapenhill School.  Career  Warrington entered Hatfield College, Durham as an ordinand, where he obtained his licentiate in theology. He was ordained a deacon in 1914 and priest in 1915 at Worcester Cathedral for St Matthew's Church, Rugby, Warwickshire. In 1917 he moved to St Peter's, Congleton, Cheshire and in 1918 he accepted the benefice of Monkton Combe in the Bath and Wells diocese, a small village in which Monkton Combe School was based. Warrington would later describe his experience in Monkton Combe as a 'living hell'. This was likely due to a rift that developed between himself and the school when he accused pupils of heckling him as he preached, an accusation that was roundly refuted by the Headmaster. However, in later years a happier relationship developed.  Allied Schools Trust  Warrington became secretary to the Church Trust Society, through which he founded a series of schools, typically by purchasing country houses and then converting them. Wrekin College was acquired in 1921. In 1923, Warrington saw an advertisement in The Times for Canford Manor and bought it the same day, founding Canford School which opened on 15 May 1923. In the same year he purchased Stowe House from the estate of the Dukes of Buckingham in which Stowe School was established. In 1928 he purchased Weston Birt as a public school for girls; Westonbirt School. This was followed in 1929 by Felixstowe College. The Allied Schools Trust was developed which incorporated the Church Trust Society and was renamed The Martyrs Memorial. Eventually, the Trust administered some thirteen public schools. The financial activities related to the founding of these schools have been described as a 'reverse ponzi scheme'. Each successive school was founded by raising a mortgage on the last, with the financial years of the schools ending in different months, with all the cash balances being placed into the school that was next to report. The Trust ran into severe financial difficulties during the years of depression in the early 1930s and was rescued by the intervention of the Legal & General Assurance Society through a mortgage that was not paid off until 1980. As a consequence, Warrington lost his positions except from his living at Monkton Combe, with the schools he founded becoming the Allied Schools group. In 1934 he acquired Stoke House in Bristol, which became the Clifton Theological College for Church of England candidates by ordination (later merged with others to become Trinity College, Bristol). Warrington was instrumental in the founding of the evangelical St Peter's College, Oxford, through financial assistance provided to Christopher Chavasse.  Pentonville Church  Warrington was a vigorous supporter of the restoration of Pentonville Church, London, which was derelict after World War I. The church was reconsecrated in 1933.  Death  Warrington died in a nursing home in Bath in 1961, leaving an estate valued at ¬£47,000.England & Wales, National Probate Calendar (Index of Wills and Administrations), 1858-1966 References Category:1889 births Category:1961 deaths Category:St Peter's College, Oxford Category:Alumni of Hatfield College, Durham Category:Evangelists Category:20th-century English Anglican priests ","title":"Percy Warrington"},{"id":"3427491","text":"Judicial astrology is the art of forecasting events by calculation of the planetary and stellar bodies and their relationship to the Earth. The term \\"judicial astrology\\" was mainly used in the Middle Ages and early Renaissance to mean the types of astrology that were considered to be heretical by the Catholic church, distinguished from the \\"natural astrology\\" such as medical astrology and meteorological astrology, which were seen as acceptable because they were a part of the natural sciences of the time.  Categorisation  In the Middle Ages natural astrology was mainly focused on the diagnosis and the treatment of medical patients. For more information on this, see the article on medical astrology. An additional use would have been the application of astrology to determine future weather patterns based on the Aristotelian/Ptolemaic rationale that the planets cause change in the sublunary world by producing an efflux of elements and qualities. Every other branch was lumped together into the heading of 'judicial astrology'. These included natal astrology, mundane astrology, horary astrology, and electional astrology. Judicial astrology is an obsolete category, because since the Middle Ages other sciences have arisen, astrology has ceased to be a tool in medicine and meteorology, and scientifically demonstrable parts of natural astrology such as the moon's effect on tides are considered to be physics not astrology.Wood, 1970. pp. 5‚Äì6  References   Sources  *  Further reading  * A History of Western Astrology, Jim Tester, New Hampshire: Boydell Press (1987) * An Introduction to Political Astrology, by Charles E.O.

Terminal Illness Insurance is a form of insurance that is often added to a life insurance policy or a Mortgage Life Insurance policy by the insurance company issuing the policy. Terminal Illness Insurance is not available as a separate insurance policy. If a life insurance policyholder also has terminal illness insurance, then he/she has the benefit of knowing that if he/she is diagnosed with a serious illness and is expected to die within 12 months of diagnosis, then the combined policy will pay out straight away rather than waiting for the policyholder to die (as would happen if the policyholder did not have terminal illness insurance). Do not confuse terminal illness insurance with critical illness insurance. The two forms of insurance are very different.

Considered \\"the leading commercial printer of his day,\\" De Vinne did much for the improvement of American printing and typography. Life and career The De Vinne Press printers mark, Thomas Jefferson Building, Library of Congress De Vinne was born at Stamford, Connecticut, and educated in the common schools of the various towns where his father, an itinerant Methodist mininister, had pastorates. He learned the rudiments of printing while employed in a shop at Fishkill, New York. He worked at the Newburgh, New York Gazette, then moved to New York City. In 1850 he was hired as a compositor by the printing shop of Francis Hart in New York, where he rose to the position of foreman within a year, which included duties as shop manager. He became a partner in Hart's business in 1858 and assumed sole proprietorship of the firm upon Hart's death in 1877, eventually renaming it to Theodore L. De Vinne & Co. in 1883. While still a partner of Hart's, De Vinne managed to steer the business from job printing to the more lucrative and prestigious book and periodical trade, mostly thanks to his excellence in printing wood engravings. De Vinne's commercial success and high repute derived in large measure from the collaboration with his main client in this market segment, The Century Company, for whom he printed the popular St. Nicholas Magazine and The Century Magazine, as well as many books, such as George Kennan's influential Siberia and The Exile System, as well as large multi-volume works such as The Century Dictionary and John Nicolay and John Hay's authoritative biography of Abraham Lincoln. In 1886, with his business greatly expanded and seeking to increase its printing capacity, he moved the company to the De Vinne Press Building on Lafayette Place, a model plant designed by himself in collaboration with the architects Babb, Cook & Willard. The building was designated a New York City landmark in 1966, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. De Vinne either commissioned Linn Boyd Benton, or co-designed in conjunction with Benton, the still-popular Century Roman typeface for use by The Century Magazine. For use at his own press, he also commissioned Linotype to produce De Vinne, an updated Elzevir (or French Oldstyle) type, and the Bruce Typefoundry to produce Renner, a Venetian face.Mac MacGrew, \\"American Metal Typefaces of the Twentieth Century, Oak Knoll Books, New Castle Delaware, 1993. However, De Vinne's was not closely involved with the design of \\"De Vinne\\" and he ultimately was somewhat unhappy with the typeface. In 1865 De Vinne was a co-founder of the Typothetae, a trade organization of master printers, which was a predecessor of the Printing Industries of America. He was also one of nine men who founded the Grolier Club in 1884, and he was printer to the Club for the first two decades of its existence and designed and printed most of its publications during his lifetime. Works De Vinne started his writing career at the age of thirty, as soon as he had become a partner in Hart's printing office. A prolific author in the periodical printing trade press, he also wrote a number of books on the history and practice of printing. His books include: *The printers‚Äô Price List (1871), an item-by-item list of pricing recommendations for job and book printing based on systematic cost accounting, designed to counteract the practice of underbidding among fellow printers. *The Invention of Printing (1876), an investigation of the claims of Laurens Coster to be inventor of printing with movable type, and awarding the honor to Gutenberg *Historic Printing Types (1886) *Plain Printing Types (1900) (The Practice of Typography, vol. 1) *Correct Composition (1901) (The Practice of Typography, vol. 2), a leading style guide for compositors, proofreaders and authors. *A Treatise on Title-Pages (1902) (The Practice of Typography, vol. 3), a revision of his earlier Title Pages as seen by a Printer, published by the Grolier Club in 1901. *Modern Methods of Book Composition (1904) (The Practice of Typography, vol. 4) *Notable Printers of Italy during the Fifteenth Century (1910) See also *De Vinne Press Building * The Century Company * The Century Magazine * Century Dictionary References Sources * * External links * * Category:1828 births Category:1914 deaths Category:American instructional writers Category:American printers Category:American typographers Category:Writers from Stamford, Connecticut Category:Writers from New York (state) ","title":"Theodore Low De Vinne"},{"id":"3427536","text":"The following is a list of notable alumni, faculty and affiliates of Queen's University at Kingston in Kingston, Ontario, Canada.

Dedicated on December 22, 1935, the castle was originally sponsored by the Curtiss Candy Company of Chicago, creators of the Baby Ruth and Butterfinger candy bars. Designed by artist Emil Straus, the red-brick building has all the elements of a castle including a crenellated tower, a turret, and a rotunda. Santa Claus Town was the vision of Vincennes entrepreneur Milton Harris, who saw the potential of Santa Claus, Indiana‚Äôs unique name after its post office had been featured in Robert Ripley‚Äôs famous Believe It or Not cartoon. Harris leased almost all of the land in and around the town and secured sponsorships from leading national toy manufacturers. Santa Claus Town was officially launched with the dedication of Santa‚Äôs Candy Castle in 1935. The Toy Village, added in 1936, featured over a half dozen miniature fairytale buildings, each uniquely designed and sponsored by a prominent national toy manufacturer. Inside, children could play with the popular toys of the day. Santa's Workshop, which was also added in 1936, housed an actual wood shop where someone playing Santa Claus could be seen making wooden toys by hand. A wooden sleigh complete with Santa and reindeers was among the popular wooden toys originally produced in the workshop. Santa Claus Town established agreements with retailers to sell the manufacturers‚Äô toys through a special mail order service. Retail giant Marshall Field's, among others, would arrange for toys purchased at their Chicago store to be shipped from Santa Claus Town, emblazoned with a Santa Claus Seal of Approval and postmarked at the town‚Äôs famous post office. Santa Claus Town directly led to the creation of the town‚Äôs Chamber of Commerce as well as the town's first newspaper. Santa Claus Town also caught the attention of rival entrepreneur Carl Barrett, leading him to build the town's famous Santa Claus statue, which still stands today. Santa Claus Town would serve as a strong influence for other Santa Claus-themed attractions throughout the United States. Restoration of Santa's Candy Castle was completed in 2006, and officially re-dedicated and re-opened to the public on July 26, 2006. Santa's Workshop is in the process of restoration. In December of 2017 Santa's Candy Castle was featured on an episode of the Travel Channel's Man v. Food.

Wilson, and Leah Pinsent. The plot follows a group of college students vacationing during April Fool's Day weekend on an island estate, which is infiltrated by an unknown assailant. Filmed in British Columbia in 1985, April Fool's Day was released in late March 1986 through Paramount Pictures in conjunction with the April 1 holiday. It received varied responses from film critics, with some commending it for its non-gratuitous violence and plot twists, while others lambasted it for its surprise ending. A remake of the film was released direct-to-video in 2008. Plot On the weekend leading up to April Fools' Day, a group of college friends, consisting of Harvey, Nikki, Rob, Skip, Nan, Chaz, Kit and Arch, gather to celebrate spring break by spending the weekend at the island mansion of Skip's cousin, Vassar student Muffy St. John. As Muffy prepares details around the house, she finds an old jack-in-the-box and recalls receiving the toy at a childhood birthday party. Her friends, meanwhile, joke around on the pier while awaiting the ferry. En route to the island, as their antics become more boisterous, local deckhand Buck is seriously injured in a gruesome accident. Once on the island, it turns out that Muffy has set up a variety of pranks throughout the mansion, ranging from simple gags such as a whoopee cushion and dribble glasses and exploding cigars to more complex and disturbing pranks, such as an audiotape of a baby crying in someone's room and heroin paraphernalia in a guest's wardrobe. In spite of this, the group try to relax, until Skip goes missing, and Kit catches a glimpse of what looks like his dead body. Soon, Arch and Nan also go missing. During a search for the pair, Nikki falls into the island's well, where she finds the severed heads of Skip and Arch, along with the dead body of Nan. The remaining group members then discover that the phone lines are dead and there is no way to get off the island until Monday. One after another, members of the group either vanish or get killed before their bodies are found. After putting some clues together, Kit and Rob realize that everyone's earlier assumption is wrong; the kinsman of the deckhand injured when they arrived is a red herring. It also turns out that Muffy has a violently insane twin sister named Buffy, who has escaped. In fact, the \\"Muffy\\" they have been around since the first night was Buffy, pretending to be Muffy. They discover Muffy's severed head in the basement. Buffy chases them with a curved butcher's knife, and the couple gets separated. Kit flees from Buffy by escaping into the living room where she finds everyone else there, alive and calmly waiting for her. It was all a joke, or more accurately, a dress rehearsal. It is revealed to the audience that the whole film was never a slasher film from the start, but rather pretending to be one. Muffy hopes to turn the mansion into a resort offering a weekend of staged horror. She even had a friend who does special effects and make-up in Hollywood help. Each \\"victim\\" agreed to take part as things were explained to them. Everyone has a huge laugh and they break out many bottles of champagne. Later that night, a half-drunk Muffy goes to her room and finds a wrapped present on her bed. She unwraps it, and the present is the jack-in- the-box. Savoring the surprise, she turns the handle slowly and when \\"Jack\\" finally pops out, Nan, who knew Muffy from acting class, emerges from behind her and slits her throat with a razor. Muffy screams, but then realizes she is not really bleeding and that Nan used a trick razor and stage blood. The film ends with the jack-in-the-box winking at the audience.  Cast  Production =Casting= Amy Steel was cast in the role of Kit at the suggestion of producer Frank Mancuso Jr., after Steel had appeared in Mancuso's Friday the 13th Part 2 (1981). In the role of Muffy St. John, the young college coed who holds the gathering at her familial mansion, Deborah Foreman (who had recently starred opposite Nicolas Cage in Valley Girl), auditioned for the role. Walton recalled that he cast Foreman after she \\"blew them away\\" during her audition. =Filming= After considering shooting the film at Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts and Seattle, Washington, producer Frank Mancuso, Jr. chose to shoot the film on Vancouver Island in Victoria, British Columbia. Filming took place over a period of six weeks at two private properties in Victoria. Walton reflect that the cast was made up of a \\"young, very talented group of kids that were having a lot of fun.\\" =Post- production= A third act of the film present in Walton's original cut had the group leaving the island, and Skip enacting an actual murder of Muffy, wanting to take their familial inheritance for himself. Paramount executives disliked this dark turn in the plot, and mandated that this final act be excised so that the film could end on a high note, with the characters celebrating after the revelation of Muffy's elaborate prank.  Release  =Box office= April Fool's Day was theatrically released in the United States on 1,202 screens and earned $3.4 million during its opening weekend, eventually grossing $13 million domestically. Though a commercial success, director Walton reflected: \\"The tragedy, I think, or the great disappointment was that Paramount didn't know how to release it other than as a typical slasher picture. So most audiences came in expecting to see something that they weren't going to see.\\" = Critical response = Paul Attanasio of The Washington Post wrote: \\"The suspense sequences are stylishly managed, and Walton has attractively cast the movie with a number of natural, if unexciting, actors. There is a suburban princess and a jock and a Junior Achievement type and so forth, none of which qualifies Bach for screen writer of the year, but it's remarkable how effective even these elementary efforts at characterization are in the context of the film.\\" Writing for The Baltimore Sun, Lou Cedrone addressed the film's muted violence as a response to public criticism of the overt violence in Paramount's Friday the 13th films, and noted that, despite its marketing, he did not view it as a slasher film. The Dayton Journal Heralds Terry Lawson gave the film a three out of four-star rating, praising it as a \\"well-made and well-acted little enterprise [that] holds a surprise or two.\\" Jeff Rietveld of the Santa Clarita Signal praised the film as \\"a slasher film for people who don't like slasher films,\\" also commending the acting and direction. Jay Maeder of the New York Daily News gave the film a scathing review, awarding it zero stars and spoiling the film's surprise ending, writing that it \\"is so offensively witless that we take a real pleasure in giving it away.\\" Joe Baltake of the Escondido Times- Advocate panned the film based on its sexual content, comparing it to the Friday the 13th series, adding that \\"none of the mayhem keeps its characters from putting the make on one another or even stopping to have sex. Some of the screams in the night here could imply either brutality or sexuality. April Fool's Day is a film that confuses the two.\\" AllMovie noted that the film \\"has more rollercoaster thrills than most slasher flicks with five times the gore\\", writing: \\"Amid the glut of gory horror films that clogged the cable schedules and cineplexes in the wake of Halloween and Friday the 13th, April Fool's Day stands out as a fairly restrained exercise in the '80s teen slasher genre.\\" Steve Barton of Dread Central wrote in 2008 that he considers the film \\"a modern horror classic.\\" On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, April Fool‚Äôs Day holds a 50% approval rating based on 20 critic reviews, with an average rating of 4.9/10. = Home media = For its home video premiere in the 1980s, it was released to both videocassette and LaserDisc. It has since been released to DVD on three occasions. The first edition was made available on September 3, 2002 through Paramount Home Entertainment. It was then included as one of the films on a triple-feature disc that also included Tales from the Darkside: The Movie and Stephen King's Graveyard Shift in August 2007. Eight months later, in March 2008, it was offered as a double feature with My Bloody Valentine (1981), and again as a standalone release in 2013. On October 31, 2019, Scream Factory announced they would be releasing the film for the first time on Blu-ray in a collector's edition; the Blu-ray was released on March 24, 2020.  Soundtrack  A soundtrack for the film was released in 1986 on vinyl only. The soundtrack consists of 19 cues and runs approximately 30:27. In 2015, as part of Var√®se Sarabande's LP to CD subscription series, the vinyl album was released on cd for the first time in a replica vinyl cardboard slip.

This novelization features an alternate ending in which Skip sneaks back onto the island after everyone has left to kill Muffy for his share of the family money, though he fails and winds up dead himself. This ending has never been released, but stills of it have surfaced. A revised draft of the script included another version of the above-mentioned ending in which Skip sneaks back onto the island to kill Muffy. He springs out of a closet and cuts her throat. At first panics then realizes it's all a joke when she sees her friends standing around. The script then states that Skip stays on the island to help Muffy with the bed and breakfast. A straight-to-DVD remake was released in March 2008. Though it retains the original concept, the story and characters are radically altered in an effort to make it more contemporary.

Copernic project is set to run over 10 years (2001‚Äì2009) by \\"Direction g√©n√©rale des Imp√¥ts\\" and \\"Direction g√©n√©rale de la Comptabilit√© publique\\". It covers 70 individual IT projects, employs over 600 personnel and has a budget of almost 1 billion euros.  Objective  Its objective is to enable the French tax administration to offer new, citizen-centered services and to boost the efficiency of its internal processes. Copernic will provide a simplified unique fiscal account for all French taxpayers, both individuals and businesses. They will be provided with 24/7 online access to their fiscal account and will be able to trace and follow-up processed data. Ultimately, users will be able to check their fiscal account at any time and execute all fiscal transactions and declarations online, while the tax administration will be able to provide new services such as payment reminders and information alerts. In addition to the Internet, e-tax services will be delivered through a variety of channels, including call centers and traditional physical service. The Copernic program will also open the possibility of implementing a new income tax recovery system as of 2007.  Architecture  Copernic wanted a service-oriented architecture (SOA) featuring complete control of IT systems, long-term sustainability and vendor independence. To cover all the fiscal information and its processing for 55 million citizens and 3 million enterprises, it decided to use free and open-source software. Copernic deployed 4000 Linux servers and application architecture is based upon Java EE. It has full FOSS system monitoring (Nagios, Multi Router Traffic Grapher (MRTG)) and software development platform (Eclipse). The presenter added, \\"FOSS is now our standard policy even for critical applications.\\" They also needed a unique Enterprise JavaBean (EJB) reference implementation. After a tough competition between many candidates (Oracle Weblogic Server, IBM WebSphere, Oracle Database, JBoss application server), they finally chose an open source middleware, JBoss. This is due to its known reliability, modularity, security and more importantly its independence from traditional industry constraints.

Chatharƒ´yas are distinguished by the use of their clan or occupational titles (e.g., PradhƒÅn, Malla, RƒÅjbhandƒÅrƒ´) instead of the all-encompassing \\"Shrestha\\" surname. Newar caste system stratifies them as belonging to the Kshatriya varna, whereas the pan-Nepal 1854 Muluki Ain stratification placed the Chatharƒ´ya among the twice-born, sacred-thread wearing Tagadhari group. In the Indian states of Sikkim and sections of West Bengal, Assam and Bhutan, Pradhan is a title assumed by all the Newar descendants who had immigrated from Kathmandu Valley to these places primarily since the mid 18th century. Descendants of the various immigrant upper and lower Newar castes adopted the singular title of 'PradhƒÅn' (which was one of the noble Chatharƒ´ya lineages of Srƒì·π£·π≠ha Newars of Kathmandu valley) as their singular caste-denoting name, whereas Pradhan in Nepal is only used as a specific family title by the descendants of the aristocratic Chatharƒ´ya Newar families of Kathmandu and Patan. The Pradhans of Sikkim form an influential ethnic group of a homogenous, non-caste and non-endogamous Newar community, which is in sharp contrast to that of the Newars of Nepal which still retains its highly complex, heterogenous and caste-based society. Due to this reason, the Pradhans of Nepal view the caste-status of these Pradhans from Sikkim and Darjeeling with doubt and avoid matrimonial ties with them. Notable Pradhans of Sikkim include trader Chandravir Pradhan (Kayastha), literary icon Paras Mani Pradhan (Shakya), first Chief Justice of Nepal Hari Prasad Pradhan, Bollywood cinematographer Binod Pradhan, footballer Sanju Pradhan, 1974 AD lead singer Adrian Pradhan, actors Menuka Pradhan, Poojana Pradhan, Uttam Pradhan, etc. In terms of India's Affirmative action policy, they are a Forward caste/General in all of India except in Sikkim where, like the entirety of its native Nepali-origin population, Pradhans/Newars are given protective status; Newars, along with Bahun and Chhetri of Sikkim, have been categorised as Other Backward Class, while the rest of Nepali-speaking Sikkim populace are categorised under Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. Local Head Pradhan is an elected by the village-level constitutional body of local self-government called the panchayat (village government) in India (gram panchayat). The Pradhan, together with other elected members, have the power of constituencies of the gram panchayat. The pradhan is the focal point of contact between government officers and the village community. Pradhan title in such setting is mainly used in east Indian states of West Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand and Odisha. Similarly, in the Deoghar district of Jharkhand, Pradhan is the head of the village who inherits this hereditary office. In some villages, they are also known as Mulraiyat.

This period saw great political and religious changes as the Reformation spread across Northern and Western Europe and the Netherlands fought for independence in the Eighty Years' War. Rhetoricians In the middle of the 16th century, a group of rhetoricians (see Medieval Dutch literature) in Brabant and Flanders attempted to put new life into the stereotyped forms of the preceding age by introducing in original composition the new-found branches of Latin and Greek poetry. The leader of these men was Johan Baptista Houwaert (1533-1599), a personage of considerable political influence in his generation. Houwaert held the title of Counsellor and Master in Ordinary of the Exchequer to the Duchy of Brabant. He considered himself a devout disciple of Matthijs de Casteleyn, but his great characteristic was his unbounded love of classical and mythological fancy. His didactic poems are composed in a rococo style; of all his writings, Pegasides Pleyn (\\"The Palace of Maidens\\"), a didactic poem in sixteen books dedicated to a discussion of the variety of earthly love, is the most remarkable. Houwaert's contemporaries nicknamed him the \\"Homer of Brabant\\"; later criticism has preferred to see in him an important link in the chain of didactic Dutch which ends in Cats. Metrical Psalms The stir and revival of intellectual life that arrived with the Reformation found its first expression in the composition of Psalms. The earliest printed collection appeared at Antwerp in 1540, under the title of Souter-Liedekens (\\"Psalter Songs\\") and was dedicated to a Dutch nobleman, Willem van Zuylen van Nieuvelt, by whose name it is usually known. This collection, however, was made before the Reformation in the Low Countries really set in. For the Protestant congregations, Jan Utenhove printed a volume of Psalms in London in 1566; Lucas de Heere and Petrus Datheen translated hymns of Cl√©ment Marot. Datheen was not a rhetorician, but a person of humble origin who wrote in unadorned language, and his hymns spread far and wide among the people. The Revolt =Battle hymns= Very different in tone were the battle songs of liberty and triumph sung a generation later by the victorious Reformers, the Gueux songs. The famous songbook of 1588, Een Geusen Lied Boecxken (\\"A Gueux Songbook\\"), was full of ardent and heroic sentiment. In this collection appeared for the first time such classical snatches of Dutch song as \\"The Ballad of Heiligerlee\\" and \\"The Ballad of Egmont and Horne\\". The political ballads, with their ridicule of the Spanish leaders, form a section of the Boecxken which has proved of inestimable value to historians. All these lyrics, however, whether of victory or of martyrdom, are still very rough in form and language. =Marnix of St-Aldegonde= Philips van Marnix.In Philips van Marnix, lord of Sint-Aldegonde (1538-1598), a personage came forward in the ranks of liberty and reform. He was born at Brussels in 1538, and began life as a disciple of Calvin and Beza in the schools of Geneva. It was as a defender of the Dutch iconoclasts that he first appeared in print in August 1566. He soon became one of the leading spirits in the war of Dutch independence and the intimate friend of the Prince of Orange. The lyrics to Wilhelmus, the Dutch national anthem, an apology of the actions of the Prince of Orange composed around 1568, are ascribed to Marnix. In 1569 Marnix completed Bi√´ncorf der Heilige Roomsche Kercke (\\"Beehive of the Roman Catholic Church\\"). In this satire he was inspired by Fran√ßois Rabelais, of whom he was a disciple. It is written in prose that is considered to mark an epoch in the language and literature of the Low Countries. Overwhelmed with the press of public business, Marnix wrote little more until in 1580 he published Het boeck der psalmen Davids (\\"The Book of the Psalms of David\\"), newly translated out of the Hebrew. He occupied the last years of his life in preparing a Dutch version of the Bible, translated directly from the original. At his death, only Genesis was found completely revised; but in 1619 the Synod of Dort placed the unfinished work in the hands of four theologians. This translation by Marnix proved the starting point for a new complete translation of the Bible into Dutch. The Synod had been convened to settle a number of politico-theological issues, but also decided to appoint a committee to translate the Bible. Representatives of nearly all provinces participated in the project, which sought to use a language intermediate between the main Dutch dialects to be intelligible to all Dutchmen. With the resulting translation, called Statenvertaling or \\"States' Translation\\", an important cornerstone was laid for the standard Dutch language as it appears today. =Coornhert= Dirck Volckertszoon Coornhert (1522-1590), was the Low Countries' first truly humanist writer. Coornhert was a typical burgher of North Holland, equally interested in the progress of national emancipation and in the development of national literature. He was a native of Amsterdam, but he did not take part in the labours of the old chamber of the Eglantine. Quite early in life he proceeded to Haarlem, becoming pensionary of the town. In 1566 Coornhert was imprisoned for his support of the Reformers, and in 1572 he became secretary to the States of Holland. He practised the art of etching and spent all his spare time in the pursuit of classical learning. In 1585 he translated Boethius, and then gave his full attention to his original masterpiece, the Zedekunst (\\"Art of Ethics\\", 1586), a philosophical treatise in prose in which he tried to adapt the Dutch tongue to the grace and simplicity of Michel de Montaigne's French. His humanism unites the Bible, Plutarch and Marcus Aurelius in one grand system of ethics and is expressed in a bright style. Coornhert died at Gouda on October 29, 1590; his works were first collected in 1630. By this time, the religious and political upheaval in the Low Countries had resulted in 1581 in an Act of Abjuration of Philip II of Spain, a key moment in the subsequent eighty years' struggle 1568‚Äì1648. As a result, the southern provinces, some of which had supported the declaration, were separated from the northern provinces as they remained under Habsburg rule. Ultimately, this would result in the present-day states of Belgium and Luxembourg (south) and the Netherlands (north). The rise of the northern provinces to independent statehood was accompanied by a cultural renaissance. The north received a cultural and intellectual boost whereas in the south, Dutch was to some extent replaced by French and Latin as the languages of culture. Literature of the Dutch Golden Age At Amsterdam two men took a very prominent place thanks to their intelligence and modern spirit. The first, Hendrick Laurensz. Spieghel (1549-1612) was a humanist, less polemical than Coornhert. His chief contribution to literature was his Twe-spraack van de Nederduytsche Letterkunst (\\"Dialogue on Dutch Literature\\"), a philological exhortation urging the Dutch nation to purify and enrich its tongue at the fountains of antiquity. That Spieghel was a Catholic prevented him perhaps from exercising as much public influence as he exercised privately among his younger friends. The same may be said of the man who in 1614 first collected Spieghel's writings and published them in a volume together with his own verse. Roemer Visscher (1547-1620) proceeded a step further than Spieghel in the cultivation of polite letters. He was deeply tinged with a spirit of classical learning. His own disciples called him the Dutch Martial, but he was at best little more than an amateur in poetry, although an amateur whose function it was to perceive and encourage the genius of professional writers. Roemer Visscher stands at the threshold of the new Renaissance literature, himself practising the faded arts of the rhetoricians, but pointing by his counsel and his conversation to the naturalism of the great period. It was in the salon at Amsterdam which Visscher's daughters formed around their father and themselves that the new school began to take form. The republic of the United Provinces, with Amsterdam at its head, had suddenly risen to first rank among the nations of Europe and it was under the influence of so much new ambition that the country asserted itself in a great school of painting and poetry. The intellectual life of the Low Countries was concentrated in the provinces of Holland and Zeeland, while the universities of Leiden, Groningen, Utrecht, Amsterdam, Harderwijk and Franeker were enriched by a flock of learned exiles from Flanders and Brabant. Visscher realised that the path of literary honour lay not along the utilitarian road cut out by Maerlant and his followers, but in the study of beauty and antiquity. In this he was aided by the school of ripe and enthusiastic scholars who began to flourish at Leiden, such as Drusius, Vossius and Hugo Grotius, who themselves wrote little in Dutch but chastened the style of the rising generation by insisting on a pure and liberal Latinity. Out of that generation arose the classic names in Dutch literature: Vondel, Hooft, Cats, and Huijgens. In their hands the language took at once its highest finish and melody. By the side of this serious and aesthetic growth there is to be noticed a quickening of the broad farcical humour which had been characteristic of the Dutch nation from its commencement. For fifty years, and these the most glorious in the annals of the Dutch republic, these two streams of influence, one towards beauty and melody, the other towards lively comedy, ran side by side, often in the same channel, and producing a rich harvest of great works. It was in the house of the daughters of Visscher that the tragedies of Vondel, the comedies of Bredero and the odes of Huygens alike found their first admirers and their best critics. Of the daughters of Roemer Visscher, Tesselschade (1594-1649) wrote some well-received lyrics; she also translated Tasso. Visscher's daughters were women of universal accomplishment and their company attracted to his house all the most gifted youths of the time, several of whom were suitors, but in vain, for the hand of Anna or of Tesselschade. =P. C. Hooft= P.C. Hooft.Of this Amsterdam school, the first to emerge into public notice was Pieter Corneliszoon Hooft (1581-1647). His Achilles and Polyxena (1598) displayed ease in the use of rhetorical artifices of style. In his pastoral drama of Granida (1605) he proved himself a pupil of Guarini. In tragedy he produced Baeto and Geraard van Velsen; in history he published in 1626 his Life of Henry the Great, while from 1628 to 1642 he wrote his masterpiece, the Nederduytsche Histori√´n (\\"History of the Netherlands\\"). Hooft was a purist in style. In his poetry, especially in the lyrical and pastoral verse of his youth, he is full of Italian reminiscences both of style and matter; in his noble prose work he has set himself to be a disciple of Tacitus. Hooft is considered one of the greatest historians, not merely of the Low Countries, but of Europe. His influence in standardising the language of his country can hardly be overrated. The literary circle founded by Roemer Visscher later centered around Hooft, in whose castle at Muiden they regularly convened, and after which they were later called Muiderkring or \\"Circle of Muiden\\". =Bredero= Gerbrand Adriaensz Bredero.Very different from the long and prosperous career of Hooft was the brief life of the greatest comic dramatist that the Low Countries have produced. Gerbrand Adriaensz Bredero (1585-1618), the son of an Amsterdam shoemaker, knew no Latin and had no taste for humanism; he came out of the rich humour of the people. Bredero entered the workshop of the painter Francisco Badens, but accomplished little in art. His life was embittered by a hopeless love for Tesselschade, to whom he dedicated his plays, and whose beauty he celebrated in a whole cycle of love songs. His ideas on the subject of drama were at first a development of the medieval abele spelen (see Medieval Dutch literature), but in 1612 he struck out a new and more characteristic path in his Klucht van de Koe (\\"Farce of the Cow\\"). From this time until his death he continued to pour out comedies, farces and romantic dramas, in all of which he displayed a rough genius not unlike that of Ben Jonson, his immediate contemporary. Bredero's last and best piece was De Spaansche Brabanber Jerolimo (\\"Jerolimo, the Spanish Brabanter\\"), a satire upon the exiles from the south who filled the halls of the Amsterdam chambers of rhetoric with their pompous speeches and preposterous Burgundian phraseology. Bredero was closely allied in genius to the dramatists of the Shakespearian age, but he founded no school and stands as a solitary figure in Dutch literature. He died on August 23, 1618 of complications caused by pneumonia. =The Prince of Poets= Joost van den Vondel.The first work of one of the best-known of all Dutch writers, Joost van den Vondel (1587-1679), was Het Pascha (\\"The Passover\\", 1612), a tragedy on the Exodus of the people of Israel. It was written in alexandrines, in five acts, and with choral interludes between the acts. He would go on to write all of his plays in this fashion, but for a number of years after his debut wrote no original material at all, instead opting to translate du Bartas. The short and brilliant life of Bredero, his immediate contemporary and greatest rival, burned itself out in a succession of dramatic victories, and it was not until two years after the death of that great poet that Vondel appeared before the public with a second tragedy. Another five years later, in 1625, he published what seemed an innocent study from the antique, his tragedy of Palamedes, or Murdered Innocence, but which was a thinly-veiled tribute to Johan van Oldebarnevelt, the Republic's Grand Pensionary who had been executed in 1618 by order of stadtholder Maurice of Nassau. Vondel became in a week the most famous writer in Holland and for the next twelve years, until the accession of stadtholder Frederick Henry, Vondel had to maintain a hand-to-hand combat with the Calvinists of Dordrecht. This was the period of his most stinging satires; Cats took up weapons on behalf of the Counter-Remonstrants and a war of pamphlets in verse raged. Vondel, as the greatest playwright of the day, was asked in 1637 to write the first-night piece for the opening of a new and soon leading public theatre in Amsterdam. On the January 3, 1638 the theatre was opened with the performance of a new tragedy out of early Dutch history and to this day one of Vondel's best-known works, Gysbreght van Aemstel. The next ten years Vondel supplied the theatre with heroic Scriptural pieces, of which the general reader will obtain the best idea if we point to Jean Racine. In 1654 Vondel brought out what most consider the best of all his works, the tragedy of Lucifer, from which it is said Milton drew inspiration. Vondel is the typical example of Dutch intelligence and imagination at their highest development. =Colonial Literature= The Republic's colonies, of which the Dutch East Indies were the most important, started to produce writers as well, the first of which was Abraham Alewijn (b. 1664), a comedy playwright who lived in Java and whose plays were produced in Batavia. Another writer from the colonies was Willem Godschalk van Focquenbroch (1640-1670), who lived and worked from 1668 in the Dutch possession of Elmina in present-day Ghana. His comedy Min in het Lazarus-huys (\\"Love in the Madhouse\\", 1672) was very popular in the 17th and 18th centuries. =Jacob Cats= While most of the writers of Holland clustered around the circle of Amsterdam, a similar school arose in Middelburg, the capital of Zeeland. The ruling spirit of this school was Jacob Cats (1577-1660). In this voluminous writer the genuine Dutch habit of thought, the utilitarian and didactic spirit reached its zenith of fluency and popularity. During early middle life he produced the most important of his writings, his didactic poems, the Maechdenplicht (\\"Duty of Maidens\\") and the Sinne- en Minnebeelden (\\"Images of Allegory and Love\\"). In 1624 he moved from Middelburg to Dordrecht, where he soon after published his ethical work called Houwelick (\\"Marriage\\"); and this was followed by an entire series of moral pieces. Cats is considered somewhat dull and prosaic by some, yet his popularity with the middle classes in Holland has always been immense. =Constantijn Huygens= A versatile poet was the diplomat Sir Constantijn Huygens (1596-1687), perhaps best known for his witty epigrams. He threw in his lot with the school of Amsterdam and became the intimate friend and companion of Vondel, Hooft and the daughters of Roemer Visscher. Huygens had little of the sweetness of Hooft or of the sublimity of Vondel, but his genius was bright and vivacious, and he was a consummate artist in metrical form. The Dutch language has never proved so light and supple in any hands as in his, and, he attempted no class of writing, whether in prose or verse, that he did not adorn by his delicate taste and sound judgment. =Philosophy= Two Dutchmen of the 17th century distinguished themselves very prominently in the movement of learning and philosophic thought, but the names of Hugo Grotius (1583-1645) and Baruch Spinoza (1632-1677) belong more to philosophy and politics than literature. Summary The period from 1600 to 1650 was a blossoming time in Dutch literature. During this period the names of great genius were first made known to the public, and the vigor and grace of literary expression reached their highest development. It happened, however, that three men of particularly commanding talent survived to an extreme old age, and under the shadow of Vondel, Cats and Huygens there sprang up a new generation which sustained the great tradition until about 1680, when decline set in.

He was a federal Member of Parliament who represented the riding of Athabasca from 2004 to 2006 and Fort McMurray‚ÄîAthabasca from 2006 to 2014 in the House of Commons. After resigning from the House in 2014, he returned to political life in February 2015 by announcing he would seek the leadership of the Wildrose Party. He was elected party leader on March 28, 2015. In the 2015 provincial election, Jean was elected in the provincial riding of Fort McMurray-Conklin and became Leader of the Opposition as the Wildrose Party formed the Official Opposition to the governing Alberta New Democratic Party. Jean ceased to lead the Wildrose Party with the merger into the United Conservative Party and ran to be leader of the new party, losing to Jason Kenney. He resigned his seat in the Alberta legislature on March 5, 2018. Background Jean was born in Kelowna, British Columbia, and moved to Fort McMurray, Alberta when he was four years old in 1967. Jean has a Bachelor of Science degree from Warner Pacific College in Portland, Oregon, and Master of Business Administration and Bachelor of Laws degrees from Bond University in Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia. He also attended the law school at the University of Calgary, where he received qualification to be admitted to the Law Society of Alberta. This allowed him to practice law for 11 years in Fort McMurray prior to his political career. Jean has worked as a farmhand, a printer's assistant, a businessperson, a lawyer, and an inspirational speaker. In his community, Jean served as the chairman of the Children's Health Foundation in Northern Alberta, chair of the Alberta Summer Games, president of the Fort McMurray Downtown Business Association, and director of the Fort McMurray Chamber of Commerce. Federal political career Jean was first elected to the House of Commons as a Conservative Party of Canada candidate in the riding of Athabasca in 2004, sitting in the Official Opposition to Paul Martin's Liberal government. He was re-elected in the renamed riding of Fort McMurray‚ÄîAthabasca in 2006, when the Conservatives formed government under Stephen Harper. In February 2006, Jean was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Transport, Infrastructure and Communities Lawrence Cannon. Jean was re-elected again in 2008 and 2011. After the 2011 election, he declined reappointment as Parliamentary Secretary in order to focus on his constituency needs. In the House of Commons, Jean served on the Finance, Justice, and Industry Committees. On January 10, 2014, Jean announced that he would be resigning his seat on January 17, 2014 to return to private life in Fort McMurray. Provincial politics The Wildrose Party was in disarray in late 2014 after leader Danielle Smith and eight other MLAs crossed the floor to the ruling Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta. A leadership election was organized to choose a new leader and Jean was encouraged to run. Jean entered the race on February 25, 2015, and was elected party leader on March 28, 2015 with 55% of the vote, defeating Cypress-Medicine Hat MLA Drew Barnes and former Strathcona County Mayor Linda Osinchuk. The 2015 Alberta election was held on May 5, 2015, less than two months after Jean became Wildrose leader. The party retained its standing as Official Opposition in the legislature, growing its caucus from 17 in 2012, and 5 at dissolution, to 21. For the first time in Alberta history, the New Democratic Party formed government, with Rachel Notley becoming Premier. This marked the end of 43 years of government by the Progressive Conservatives. On August 30, 2016 Jean, responding to questions about the need for more seniors housing in the city he represents, told an audience he has been \\"beating this drum\\" for more than a decade. \\"I will continue to beat it, I promise,\\" Jean said. \\"But it's against the law to beat Rachel Notley.\\" He quickly apologized for what he later characterized as an \\"inappropriate attempt\\" at humour. Jean's former federal caucus colleague Jason Kenney became Progressive Conservative leader after winning that party's leadership election in early 2017. Kenney's platform called for uniting the Progressive Conservative and Wildrose parties to form a united right-of-centre alliance. On March 20, 2017, Jean met with Kenney to begin unity discussions. On May 18, 2017, Jean and Kenney announced that their two parties had come to a merger agreement and on July 22, 2017 the merger was passed with 95% support from both the PCs and the Wildrose. The merger agreement formed the United Conservative Party, a leadership election occurred on October 28, 2017, in which Jean was defeated by Kenney, and a founding convention to be held in 2018. Jean announced his resignation from the legislature on March 5, 2018, saying he wished to spend more time with his family and rebuild his house which had been destroyed in the 2016 Fort McMurray Wildfire.

Life Attaingnant is considered to be first large-scale publisher of single-impression movable type for music- printing, thus making it possible to print faster and cheaper than predecessors such as Ottaviano Petrucci. Attaingnant is often credited with being the first to develop this technique; however, theoric assert exists to suggest that John Rastell, an English printer in London, was the first to use single-impression printing in 1520. Unfortunately, none of his score was ever found King, A. 1971. The Significance of John Rastell in Early Music Printing. The Library 26(3). Attaingnant published over 1500 chansons by many different composers, including Paris composers Claudin de Sermisy, Pierre Sandrin and Pierre Certon, and most prominently Cl√©ment Janequin with five books of chansons or Josquin Desprez . Attaingnant acquired royal privileges for his music books, which were renewed many times. Eventually he was named imprimeur et libraire du Roy en musique (printer and bookseller of the King for music). Works Attaingnant's major contribution to music printing consists in his popularizing the single-impression method for music printing, which he first employed in his 1528 publication Chansons nouvelles en musique √† quatre parties. In this system, the individual notes were printed directly onto segments of staff, and so the notes, staff lines, and text could all be printed with one send through the printing press. The main disadvantage of this method was the alignment of the staff lines, which often had a ‚Äúbumpy‚Äù look‚Äî-some being slightly higher or slightly disjointed from others. Nevertheless, this method became standard music printing across Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries. Attaingnant learnt the printing trade by printing first \\"livres d'heure\\" with the printer Philippe Pigouchet who sold them to Simon Vostre book shop located in St John the evangelist street near the Sorbonne University in the Parisian student district. Later Pigouchet became Attaingnant's father in law when he married his daughter Apart from his 36 collections of chansons, he also published books with pieces in lute or keyboard tablature, as well as Masses and motets. Among the most important documents for keyboard music in general and for French Renaissance keyboard music in particular are the seven volumes published by Attaingnant in Paris in the spring of 1531: # Dixneuf chansons musicales reduictes en la tabulature des Orgues Espinettes Manichordions, et telz semblables instrumentz musicaulx...

Biography He was born in San Francisco. His father was a cellist trained in Dresden, Germany; his mother, Eva K√∂nig, was born in Germany. Friedhofer began playing cello at the age of 13. After taking lessons in harmony and counterpoint at University of California, Berkeley, he was employed as a cellist for the People's Symphony Orchestra. In 1929, he relocated to Hollywood, where he performed as a musician for Fox Studios productions such as Sunny Side Up (1920) and Grand Canary (1934). Later, he was hired as an orchestrator for Warner Bros. and worked on more than 50 films for the studio. While at Warners he was largely assigned to work with Max Steiner and, because he could speak German, Erich Wolfgang Korngold. Steiner, in particular, relied on Friedhofer's skill in turning his sketches into a full orchestral score. Despite his own strong skills, he remained in their shadow for many years. In 1937, Friedhofer composed his first full-length film score, The Adventures of Marco Polo. Though he was still employed as an orchestrator through the '30s and into the '40s, he gradually received more assignments as a composer. In 1942, he composed the score for the film Chetniks! The Fighting Guerrillas. In 1946, at the behest of Alfred Newman, Friedhofer was hired to compose the score for the 1946 William Wyler directed film, The Best Years of Our Lives, which earned him an Oscar for Best Original Score at the 1947 Academy Awards, beating Bernard Herrmann, Mikl√≥s R√≥zsa, William Walton and Franz Waxman. A new recording of the score, released in 1979 by Entr'acte Recording Society, was favorably received at the time. Friedhofer was also nominated for other films, including The Bishop's Wife, Joan of Arc, Above and Beyond, Between Heaven and Hell, Boy on a Dolphin, An Affair to Remember, and The Young Lions. Friedhofer, who was greatly admired by his colleagues, was also noted for his caustic, self-deprecating wit. When asked by fellow composer David Raksin as to the progress he was making on his score for Joan of Arc, he replied, \\"I've just started on the barbecue!\\". In reply to an interview by Page Cook, the film music critic at Films in Review magazine, who inquired about his place in the pantheon of film musicians, Friedhofer said, \\"I am just a fake giant among real pygmies.\\" A biographical collection of essays, letters and interviews has been edited by Linda Danly. He died from complications of a fall in Los Angeles on May 17, 1981. Film and TV work Friedhofer wrote music for 256 movies, shorts or television episodes without credit ‚Äî as a music department composer of themes, additional music, stock music, incidental music or background music. He composed as a primary composer, both credited and uncredited, for 166 movies, shorts or television episodes.

The compound was built in 1907‚Äì1914 by the Empress Augusta Victoria Foundation as a center for the German Protestant community in Ottoman Palestine, in addition to the slightly older Church of the Redeemer from Jerusalem's Old City. Apart from the hospital, today the complex also includes the German Protestant Church of the Ascension with a c. 50 metre high belltower, a meeting centre for pilgrims and tourists, an interreligious kindergarten and a caf√©, as well as the Jerusalem branch of the German Protestant Institute of Archaeology. Throughout much of its history, the compound was used first and foremost as a hospital, either by the military (during the First and Second World Wars and during Jordanian rule), or for Palestinian refugees and general public (from 1950 until today), and at times also as a government or military headquarters (1915‚Äì1927). Today, Augusta Victoria Hospital provides specialty care for Palestinians from across the West Bank and the Gaza Strip with services including a cancer center, a dialysis unit, and a pediatric center. It is the second largest hospital in East Jerusalem, as well as the sole remaining specialized care unit located in the West Bank or Gaza Strip. History Augusta Victoria aerial view Ascension Church, Augusta Victoria compound The complex was named for Augusta Viktoria of Schleswig-Holstein, wife of German Kaiser Wilhelm II, who visited Jerusalem in 1898. The architect, Robert Leibnitz, was inspired by German palaces, such as the German Hohenzollern Castle.\\"Jerusalem Architecture - Periods and Styles, European Christian Buildings Outside the Old City Walls, 1855-1918,\\" David Kroyanker, Keter, 1987 (Hebrew) The complex was photographed in detail in ca. 1910, along with the inaugural celebrations, by Khalil Raad, Palestine's first Arab photographer. Although officially inaugurated on 10 April 1910, the construction was only finalised in 1914. After the Kaiser's 1898 visit, he commissioned the construction of a guesthouse for German pilgrims. Private donations were collected throughout Germany and donators honoured with the Cross of the Mount of Olives. Many of the building materials were imported from Germany. A 60-metre high church tower was constructed with four bells, the largest of them weighing six tons. To transport these bells from Jaffa, the road to Jerusalem had to be widened and paved. The expense was more than double the cost of transporting the bells from Hamburg to Jaffa. Augusta Victoria was the first building in the country to have electricity, provided by a diesel generator. During World War I, the Hospital served as German military hospital. From 1915 to 1917 the compound was used as Ottoman headquarters by Djemal Pasha. From June to December 1917 the hospital was used as headquarters for the German high command of the German expeditionary corps (Asienkorps). After the British conquest, the Augusta Victoria compound served as the headquarters of General Allenby's Egyptian Expeditionary Force and later as the headquarters of the British Military Administration of Occupied Enemy Territory (South).Jewish Center for Jewish-Christian Relations From 1920 to 1927, Augusta Victoria was the official residence of the British High Commissioner of the Palestine Mandate. In 1927, the buildings were severely damaged in an earthquake and the pointy roof of the belfry was rebuilt by 10 metres shorter. The British headquarters moved to Armon HaNetziv, on the outskirts of Talpiot. In 1928 the compound was returned to its German pre-war owner, the Kaiserin Augusta Victoria Foundation. The Nazi party held meetings and assemblies at Augusta Victoria under the leadership of Ludwig Buchhalter, a Templer living in the Germany Colony who was appointed head of Jerusalem branch of the Nazi party in 1934. In the mid-1930s, when the building was about to reopen as a hostel run by Deaconesses, the management decided to bar Jewish guests to preserve the institution's Christian character. During World War II, the compound was again used as a hospital by the British.The Lutheran World Federation - Department for World Service ‚Äî Jerusalem - History Augusta Victoria from the air 1948 A Jordanian bunker on the grounds of Augusta Victoria Under Jordanian administration, technically under United Nations Truce Supervision Organization control, it was a military hospital for soldiers from the Arab Legion.Commander E H Hutchison USNR \\"Violent Truce: A Military Observer Looks at the Arab-Israeli Conflict 1951-1955\\", Chapter III: The Barrel Incident, p 20-30 After World War II, the entire property of the German Evangelical mission to Palestine was passed into the fiduciary responsibility of the Lutheran World Federation (LWF); in 1950 the LWF established a large hospital for refugees in the compound. The hospital director was the long-time staff physician of the German Deaconess Hospital of Jerusalem, the Arab Palestinian Dr. Tawfiq Canaan, who kept this position until 1956. Prior to the 1967 Six-Day War, the campus was fortified with several bunkers. During that war the building was heavily damaged, the upper floor was devastated by fire and was only rebuilt in 1988. Today Augusta Victoria courtyard Today, August Victoria Hospital provides specialty care for Palestinians from across the West Bank and the Gaza Strip with services including a cancer center, a dialysis unit, and a pediatric center. In 2016, it inaugurated a bone marrow transplantation unit. It is the second-largest hospital in East Jerusalem, as well as being the sole remaining specialized- care hospital located in the West Bank or Gaza Strip. It runs 120 in-patient beds and treat a number of outpatients who come in for dialysis and radiation treatment, being the only facility serving 4.5m Palestinians in the area of radiation therapy. In May 2016, Joint Commission International, a US-based body that assesses hospitals and health care facilities globally, re- accredited the hospital for another three years. The hospital is one of six specialized medical centers in the East Jerusalem Hospitals Network, comprising Makassed Islamic Charitable Hospital, Augusta Victoria Hospital, Red Crescent Maternity Hospital, St. John's Eye Hospital, Princess Basma Rehabilitation Centre and St. Joseph's Hospital. They have been the main providers of tertiary referral care for Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip for health services for which the Ministry of Health is unable to provide, such as cancer care, cardiac and eye surgeries, neonatal intensive care, children's dialysis and physical rehabilitation of children. Since its establishment in 1950 Auguste Victoria Hospital has been primarily run and financed by The Lutheran World Federation and the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA). The hospital mission statement includes the provision of health care without regard to race, creed, gender, or national origin. The hospital currently (2016) has 118 inpatient beds, 52 ambulatory beds and stations, and 403 staff. In 2016 it admitted 12,605 patients, and did 22,716 dialysis sessions, 20,088 chemotherapy sessions and 25,585 radiation sessions. Compound The Augusta Victoria compound currently contains the following buildings and institutions: * Augusta Victoria Hospital * Church of the Ascension (German Evangelical)  Evangelical (Protestant) Pilgrims and Meeting Centre (Evangelisches Pilger- und Begegnungszentrum der Kaiserin Auguste Victoria-Stiftung)  An interreligious kindergarten  Caf√© Auguste Victoria * The German Protestant Institute of Archaeology (Deutsches Evangelisches Institut f√ºr Altertumswissenschaft des Heiligen Landes), Jerusalem branch (the second one is in Amman) The rectory of the pastor of the Lutheran Church of the Redeemer is also located on the site, along with administrative offices and living quarters of the Jerusalem offices of The Lutheran World Federation. The guesthouse is run by The Lutheran World Federation for international volunteers and guests. =Oncology services= The hospital has a Department of Oncology which is an advanced center for cancer treatment. The department consists of the Unit for Medical Oncology, the Unit for Radiation Oncology, and the Unit for Surgical Oncology. A pediatric oncology ward for Palestinian children opened in April 2005 in a joint project with the Peres Center for Peace, various Italian foundations and the Hadassah University Hospital, which trained the oncologist and nursing staff.

Construction and design The ship was built in 1627 on the Slott√∂ shipyard in Nakskov in Denmark after a design of Scottish shipbuilder Daniel Sinclair. Stora Sofia was the flagship of the navy of the Danish king Christian IV. She was armed with 44 cannons on three decks; according to contemporary sources, she had four 48-pounders, eighteen 24-pounders, twenty 8-pounders and several smaller cannons. Service During the short Torstenson War between Denmark-Norway and Sweden in 1645, Denmark put an embargo on the young city of Gothenburg, founded in 1621. Stora Sofia was the flagship of a Danish fleet under admiral Ove Gjedde that was ordered to enforce the embargo. Shortly after the arrival of the fleet, a storm broke loose and threw the Stora Sofia onto the rocks. The ship sank to a depth of 27 metres; her crew was saved. Discovery of the wreck The wreck was rediscovered only in 1961. More thorough explorations and archeological studies began in the 1980s.

It is a type of one-factor short rate model as it describes interest rate movements as driven by only one source of market risk. The model can be used in the valuation of interest rate derivatives, and has also been adapted for credit markets. It was introduced in 1977 by Old≈ôich Va≈°√≠ƒçek, and can be also seen as a stochastic investment model. Details The model specifies that the instantaneous interest rate follows the stochastic differential equation: :dr_t= a(b-r_t)\\\\, dt + \\\\sigma \\\\, dW_t where Wt is a Wiener process under the risk neutral framework modelling the random market risk factor, in that it models the continuous inflow of randomness into the system. The standard deviation parameter, \\\\sigma, determines the volatility of the interest rate and in a way characterizes the amplitude of the instantaneous randomness inflow. The typical parameters b, a and \\\\sigma, together with the initial condition r_0, completely characterize the dynamics, and can be quickly characterized as follows, assuming a to be non-negative: * b: \\"long term mean level\\". All future trajectories of r will evolve around a mean level b in the long run; * a: \\"speed of reversion\\". a characterizes the velocity at which such trajectories will regroup around b in time; * \\\\sigma: \\"instantaneous volatility\\", measures instant by instant the amplitude of randomness entering the system. Higher \\\\sigma implies more randomness The following derived quantity is also of interest, * {\\\\sigma^2}/(2 a): \\"long term variance\\". All future trajectories of r will regroup around the long term mean with such variance after a long time. a and \\\\sigma tend to oppose each other: increasing \\\\sigma increases the amount of randomness entering the system, but at the same time increasing a amounts to increasing the speed at which the system will stabilize statistically around the long term mean b with a corridor of variance determined also by a. This is clear when looking at the long term variance, :\\\\frac{\\\\sigma^2}{2 a} which increases with \\\\sigma but decreases with a. This model is an Ornstein‚ÄìUhlenbeck stochastic process. Making the long term mean stochastic to another SDE is a simplified version of the cointelation SDE. Discussion Vasicek's model was the first one to capture mean reversion, an essential characteristic of the interest rate that sets it apart from other financial prices. Thus, as opposed to stock prices for instance, interest rates cannot rise indefinitely. This is because at very high levels they would hamper economic activity, prompting a decrease in interest rates. Similarly, interest rates do not usually decrease below 0. As a result, interest rates move in a limited range, showing a tendency to revert to a long run value. The drift factor a(b-r_t) represents the expected instantaneous change in the interest rate at time t. The parameter b represents the long-run equilibrium value towards which the interest rate reverts. Indeed, in the absence of shocks (dW_t = 0), the interest rate remains constant when rt = b. The parameter a, governing the speed of adjustment, needs to be positive to ensure stability around the long term value. For example, when rt is below b, the drift term a(b-r_t) becomes positive for positive a, generating a tendency for the interest rate to move upwards (toward equilibrium). The main disadvantage is that, under Vasicek's model, it is theoretically possible for the interest rate to become negative, an undesirable feature under pre-crisis assumptions. This shortcoming was fixed in the Cox‚ÄìIngersoll‚ÄìRoss model, exponential Vasicek model, Black‚ÄìDerman‚ÄìToy model and Black‚ÄìKarasinski model, among many others. The Vasicek model was further extended in the Hull‚ÄìWhite model. The Vasicek model is also a canonical example of the affine term structure model, along with the Cox‚ÄìIngersoll‚ÄìRoss model. Asymptotic mean and variance We solve the stochastic differential equation to obtain : r_t = r_0 e^{-a t} + b\\\\left(1- e^{-a t}\\\\right) + \\\\sigma e^{-a t}\\\\int_0^t e^{a s}\\\\,dW_s.\\\\,\\\\\\\\! Using similar techniques as applied to the Ornstein‚ÄìUhlenbeck stochastic process we get that state variable is distributed normally with mean :\\\\mathrm{E}[r_t] = r_0 e^{-a t} + b(1 - e^{-at}) and variance :\\\\mathrm{Var}[r_t] = \\\\frac{\\\\sigma^2}{2 a}(1 - e^{-2at}). Consequently, we have :\\\\lim_{t \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\mathrm{E}[r_t] = b and :\\\\lim_{t \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\mathrm{Var}[r_t] = \\\\frac{\\\\sigma^2}{2 a}.

The virtually increased input capacitance due to the Miller effect is given by :C_{M}=C (1+A_v)\\\\, where -A_v is the voltage gain of the inverting amplifier (A_v positive) and C is the feedback capacitance. Although the term Miller effect normally refers to capacitance, any impedance connected between the input and another node exhibiting gain can modify the amplifier input impedance via this effect. These properties of the Miller effect are generalized in the Miller theorem. The Miller capacitance due to parasitic capacitance between the output and input of active devices like transistors and vacuum tubes is a major factor limiting their gain at high frequencies. Miller capacitance was identified in 1920 in triode vacuum tubes by John Milton Miller.  History  The Miller effect was named after John Milton Miller.John M. Miller, \\"Dependence of the input impedance of a three-electrode vacuum tube upon the load in the plate circuit,\\" Scientific Papers of the Bureau of Standards, vol.15, no. 351, pages 367-385 (1920). Available on-line at: http://web.mit.edu/klund/www/papers/jmiller.pdf . When Miller published his work in 1920, he was working on vacuum tube triodes; however, the same theory applies to more modern devices such as bipolar and MOS transistors.  Derivation  Figure 1: An ideal voltage inverting amplifier with an impedance connecting output to input. Consider an ideal inverting voltage amplifier of gain A_v with an impedance Z connected between its input and output nodes. The output voltage is therefore V_o = -A_v V_i. Assuming that the amplifier input draws no current, all of the input current flows through Z, and is therefore given by :I_i = \\\\frac{V_i - V_o}{Z} = \\\\frac{V_i (1 +A_v)}{Z}. The input impedance of the circuit is :Z_{in} = \\\\frac{V_i}{I_i} = \\\\frac{Z}{1+A_v}. If Z represents a capacitor with impedance Z = \\\\frac{1}{s C}, the resulting input impedance is :Z_{in} = \\\\frac{1}{s C_{M}} \\\\quad \\\\mathrm{where} \\\\quad C_{M}=C (1+A_v). Thus the effective or Miller capacitance CM is the physical C multiplied by the factor (1+A_v).  Effects  As most amplifiers are inverting (A_v as defined above is positive), the effective capacitance at their inputs is increased due to the Miller effect. This can reduce the bandwidth of the amplifier, restricting its range of operation to lower frequencies. The tiny junction and stray capacitances between the base and collector terminals of a Darlington transistor, for example, may be drastically increased by the Miller effects due to its high gain, lowering the high frequency response of the device. It is also important to note that the Miller capacitance is the capacitance seen looking into the input. If looking for all of the RC time constants (poles) it is important to include as well the capacitance seen by the output. The capacitance on the output is often neglected since it sees {C}({1+1/A_v}) and amplifier outputs are typically low impedance. However if the amplifier has a high impedance output, such as if a gain stage is also the output stage, then this RC can have a significant impact on the performance of the amplifier. This is when pole splitting techniques are used. The Miller effect may also be exploited to synthesize larger capacitors from smaller ones. One such example is in the stabilization of feedback amplifiers, where the required capacitance may be too large to practically include in the circuit. This may be particularly important in the design of integrated circuits, where capacitors can consume significant area, increasing costs. =Mitigation= The Miller effect may be undesired in many cases, and approaches may be sought to lower its impact. Several such techniques are used in the design of amplifiers. A current buffer stage may be added at the output to lower the gain A_v between the input and output terminals of the amplifier (though not necessarily the overall gain). For example, a common base may be used as a current buffer at the output of a common emitter stage, forming a cascode. This will typically reduce the Miller effect and increase the bandwidth of the amplifier. Alternatively, a voltage buffer may be used before the amplifier input, reducing the effective source impedance seen by the input terminals. This lowers the RC time constant of the circuit and typically increases the bandwidth.  Impact on frequency response  Figure 2: Amplifier with feedback capacitor CC. Figure 2A shows an example of Figure 1 where the impedance coupling the input to the output is the coupling capacitor CC. A Th√©venin voltage source VA drives the circuit with Th√©venin resistance RA. The output impedance of the amplifier is considered low enough that the relationship Vo= -AvVi is presumed to hold. At the output ZL serves as the load. (The load is irrelevant to this discussion: it just provides a path for the current to leave the circuit.) In Figure 2A, the coupling capacitor delivers a current jœâCC(Vi ‚àí Vo) to the output node. Figure 2B shows a circuit electrically identical to Figure 2A using Miller's theorem. The coupling capacitor is replaced on the input side of the circuit by the Miller capacitance CM, which draws the same current from the driver as the coupling capacitor in Figure 2A. Therefore, the driver sees exactly the same loading in both circuits. On the output side, a capacitor CMo = (1 + 1/Av)CC draws the same current from the output as does the coupling capacitor in Figure 2A. In order for the Miller capacitance to draw the same current in Figure 2B as the coupling capacitor in Figure 2A, the Miller transformation is used to relate CM to CC. In this example, this transformation is equivalent to setting the currents equal, that is ::\\\\ j\\\\omega C_C (V _i - V _O ) = j \\\\omega C_M V _i, or, rearranging this equation :: C_M = C_C \\\\left( 1 - \\\\frac { V _o} { V _i} \\\\right ) = C_C (1 + A_v). This result is the same as CM of the Derivation Section. The present example with Av frequency independent shows the implications of the Miller effect, and therefore of CC, upon the frequency response of this circuit, and is typical of the impact of the Miller effect (see, for example, common source). If CC = 0 F, the output voltage of the circuit is simply Av vA, independent of frequency. However, when CC is not zero, Figure 2B shows the large Miller capacitance appears at the input of the circuit. The voltage output of the circuit now becomes :: V _o =- A_v V _i = - A_v \\\\frac { V _A} {1+j \\\\omega C_M R_A}, and rolls off with frequency once frequency is high enough that œâCMRA ‚â• 1. It is a low-pass filter. In analog amplifiers this curtailment of frequency response is a major implication of the Miller effect. In this example, the frequency œâ3dB such that œâ3dB CMRA = 1 marks the end of the low-frequency response region and sets the bandwidth or cutoff frequency of the amplifier. The effect of CM upon the amplifier bandwidth is greatly reduced for low impedance drivers (CM RA is small if RA is small). Consequently, one way to minimize the Miller effect upon bandwidth is to use a low-impedance driver, for example, by interposing a voltage follower stage between the driver and the amplifier, which reduces the apparent driver impedance seen by the amplifier. The output voltage of this simple circuit is always Av vi. However, real amplifiers have output resistance. If the amplifier output resistance is included in the analysis, the output voltage exhibits a more complex frequency response and the impact of the frequency-dependent current source on the output side must be taken into account.See article on pole splitting. Ordinarily these effects show up only at frequencies much higher than the roll-off due to the Miller capacitance, so the analysis presented here is adequate to determine the useful frequency range of an amplifier dominated by the Miller effect. =Miller approximation= This example also assumes Av is frequency independent, but more generally there is frequency dependence of the amplifier contained implicitly in Av. Such frequency dependence of Av also makes the Miller capacitance frequency dependent, so interpretation of CM as a capacitance becomes more difficult. However, ordinarily any frequency dependence of Av arises only at frequencies much higher than the roll-off with frequency caused by the Miller effect, so for frequencies up to the Miller- effect roll-off of the gain, Av is accurately approximated by its low- frequency value. Determination of CM using Av at low frequencies is the so- called Miller approximation. With the Miller approximation, CM becomes frequency independent, and its interpretation as a capacitance at low frequencies is secure.

The project uses participant centred, creative digital video dialogue, and aims to promote inter-cultural understanding and peer-led learning between remote groups who are unable to meet face-to-face. The DIVO project uses digital video to augment online dialogue between remote groups. Groups of young people record and exchange short digital films based on common themes, which are shared via a website. The films are viewed and the issues contained are discussed and explored on and offline and new films are created and shared in response. DIVO is designed to be used to promote and support dialogue in formal and informal educational contexts, including inter-cultural understanding in support of Key Stages 3 and 4, since learning how to use digital interactive video creatively is coupled with the development of teamwork and negotiation skills. The project aims to puts media creation in the hands of participants, offering them the opportunity to experiment with a medium they are only likely to have experienced as consumers. Background In 2004, the DIVO project bought together two groups of girls: socially and economically marginalised young women from an Islamic community in Ghana and students from Elizabeth Garrett Anderson School for Girls in London, UK.https://www.theguardian.com/values/communityprojects/story/0,14333,1166426,00.html The project facilitated a cultural exchange based on gender issues faced by participants in the groups. The two groups created and responded to each other's films. Dialogues formed through the process have continued to develop beyond the initial life of the pilot project. The pilot phase was funded by the British Council, the British High Commission and Guardian Newspapers Limited. A 20-min project documentary was made about the project, which has been recognised by selection in a number of international human rights film festivals and screens regularly on the Community Channel in the UK. =Methodology= The methodology of DIVO comes from the combination of the creative application of technology with peer-led, participant-centred teaching techniques. Emphasis is placed on the process of generating media clips as well as the media clips themselves. In order to create a dialogue, groups need to digest what they have viewed and examine this against their existing knowledge before proceeding to generate more media and develop their response. DIVO is intended to operate as a multilateral dialogue between many groups and offer flexibility of access and timing.

Harris (born September 6, 1944) is a Canadian politician. He was a Member of Parliament from 1993 to 2015 and sat as a member of the Conservative Party of Canada. He was previously member of the Reform Party of Canada and the Canadian Alliance. From 2004 to 2015, he represented the electoral district of Cariboo‚ÄîPrince George, and formerly represented Prince George‚ÄìBulkley Valley. He was first elected during the 1993 federal election and was re-elected in 1997, 2000, 2004, 2006, 2008 and 2011. He challenged Reform Party leader Preston Manning for leadership when Manning proposed merging the party with the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada. He later campaigned for Stockwell Day to become leader. The most prominent position he held with his party was Chief Opposition Whip from 2001 to 2002. He generated controversy when he appointed an unelected, Conservative Party member to represent a neighbouring electoral district in governmental affairs, though the electoral district had an elected Member of Parliament, but from an opposition party. In Fiscal Year 2009-10 he was the top spending Member of Parliament, and had the largest hospitality and lowest advertising expenditures of any house member. He has served a member on several parliamentary committees, including the 'Standing Committee on Finance' during the 36th and 37th Parliaments and the 'Standing Committee on Natural Resources' during the 39th, and 40th Parliaments. In the 41st Parliament he sat on the Veteran's Affairs Committee. He has introduced three Private Member Bills into the House of Commons. The first two bills were introduced when he was a member of the opposition. The first bill, having to do with penalties for drunk driving was defeated, however, the government felt that the content of the bill was worthy of introducing a similar bill which was passed. The second bill : An Act to amend the Criminal Code (failure to stop at scene of accident) was introduced in the 38th Parliament but was not adopted. His third private members bill was introduced during the 41st Parliament; An Act to amend the Employment Insurance Act (incarceration) was introduced in October 2011. Before becoming a Member of Parliament Dick Harris was born in Vancouver but, along with a brother, he was raised in Prince Rupert, British Columbia by his mother, a single parent. After finishing school he moved to Prince George, married and raised three children. A businessman, he owned and operated several companies in Prince George and the Cariboo region. His most successful company specialized in tires and distribution of tire parts, though he sold the companies before being elected as a Member of Parliament. Politically, Harris had been a supporter of the Progressive Conservative Party for 20 years before joining the Reform Party in 1989. He was active in fundraising and became chairman of the Reform Fund Canada. He served on the party's executive council from 1991 to 1993. In 1992, Harris won the Reform Party nomination to stand for election in the next federal election in the Prince George‚ÄìBulkley Valley riding. 35th Parliament The next federal election was held in October 1993. The race in the Prince George‚ÄìBulkley Valley riding was expected to be close between Harris and the incumbent MP, Brian Gardiner (NDP). However, his party placed third and the Liberal Party of Canada formed a majority government. In both sessions of the 35th Parliament Harris sat on the 'Standing Committee on Government Operations' and the 'Standing Committee on Transport'. In the first session he was also assigned to two subcommittees: the 'Subcommittee on the St. Lawrence Seaway' and the 'Subcommittee on the Consideration of the Objections Filed on the Proposed Electoral Boundaries for the Western Provinces'. In July 1994, Reform Party leader Preston Manning formed a three-member critic team for Indian Affairs and Northern Development with Harris, Mike Scott and John Duncan. The team held town hall-style meetings in BC where they opposed independent self- governments but advocated for municipal-style governments on reserves, like the Sechelt Indian Government District, and warned that land claims could be costly and usurp private property rights. The three member team was unable to draw sufficient attention to the Reform Party's position on native affairs, so the team was disbanded in December 1994 and Harris reassigned to the \\"Reform Posse\\", a special team of Reform Party MPs (Harris, Jay Hill and Randy White) meant to investigate government spending, similar to the Liberal Party of Canada Rat Pack. With the assistance of a forensic accountant, the Reform Posse investigated the Department of Indian Affairs but Manning disbanded them in August 1995 and Harris was reassigned to be the Reform Party's deputy critic of public works. He was subsequently reassigned to be the assistant critic on Transport in February 1997, a role he filled until the end of the parliamentary session in June. 36th Parliament The next election was held in June 1997 and Harris won re-election with 54% of the vote in the Prince George‚ÄîBulkley Valley riding. The Liberal Party again formed a majority government but Harris' Reform Party formed the Official Opposition. Harris became the Vice-Chair of the 'Standing Committee on Finance' in both sessions of the 36th Parliament, as well as being the Reform Party's assistant critic on Finance. Meanwhile, a division formed within the Reform Party as the leader, Preston Manning, explored merging the party with the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada. In April 1999, Harris became the 13th Reform Party MP to publicly oppose a merger, saying \\"There's nothing wrong with our product. There's nothing wrong with our brand-label. Maybe the salesmen communicating the message are not the right people out there.\\" Harris was concerned that they would have to compromise on their opposition to official bilingualism and positions on Senate reform, family values, and justice issues. A referendum within the Reform Party on whether to explore a merger plan was called and Harris debated Manning on the issue at Reform Party events. Harris paid for national advertising opposing the merger idea and co- signed a letter distributed to all 59 Reform Party MPs which said \\"A Yes vote in May would be a tactical disaster... [the] Reform [Party] will be perceived as having already decided to commit suicide\\". The referendum passed with 60% voting in favour of a merger, dubbed the 'United Alternative'. Committees were formed to investigate a plan for merger and Harris joined the policy committee. A second referendum was set for the Reform Party's convention in March 2000 to decide on whether to pursue the merger. Harris, in January 2000, still opposed to the United Alternative, and announced his candidacy for leader of the party ‚Äî a challenge to party leader Manning who was campaigning for the merger. Harris immediately assigned a campaign chairman and launched a nationwide membership and fund-raising drives. The 55-year-old Harris viewed his campaign as staying true to the Reform Party's roots in populism and rejecting the Progressive Conservative Party's \\"elitist politics\\". Manning and those who favoured the United Alternative, like Reform Party MP Jay Hill (Prince George‚ÄîPeace River) with whom Harris shared a constituency office in Prince George, saw the merger as the best way to form a government. Harris viewed the push for the United Alternative as a top-down initiative by Manning and a small group of advisers and called the United Alternative an \\"unholy alliance\\". At a late-January meeting, party members voted against launching a leadership review, ending Harris' leadership bid. At a later meeting, in March, party members voted in favour of dissolving the Reform Party of Canada and re-forming as the Canadian Reform Conservative Alliance with a new constitution and policy planks better suited for a merger with the Progressive Conservatives. When it came time to select a leader, Harris endorsed Stockwell Day, an Albertan provincial politician who went on to defeat Manning. 37th Parliament In the November 2000 election Harris, as a member of the Canadian Alliance, was again re-elected in the Prince George‚ÄìBulkley Valley riding, this time with 59% of the vote. The Canadian Alliance again formed the Official Opposition to the Liberal Party's majority government. In the first session of the 37th Parliament, Harris served as a vice-chair of the 'Standing Committee on Finance', and a member of the 'Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs', the 'Standing Joint Committee on Official Languages', and the 'Standing Joint Committee for the Scrutiny of Regulations'. Fellow Canadian Alliance were criticizing the performance of their leader, Stockwell Day, during the election. In response, Day shuffled the responsibilities of his MPs in April 2001, demoting Opposition House Leader Chuck Strahl and promoting Harris to Chief Opposition Whip. Day and Harris took aggressive stances by forbidding public criticism. Art Hanger immediately spoke out against them to the media and was subsequently removed from caucus. On May 16, several Day loyalist, including Harris, co-signed a letter directed at the remaining caucus members acknowledging rumours of a parallel caucus being formed but that could not be \\"tolerated\\". The letter re-stated the formal responsibilities that all Canadian Alliance MPs agreed to and that \\"members will be breaching their formal written word, given to the leader, the party and their constituency, as a condition of their nomination\\" if they were found to \\"publicly attack any other colleague, the leader or the party\\". Hanger was followed by Chuck Strahl, Gary Lunn, Jim Pankiw, Val Meredith, Grant McNally, Jay Hill and Jim Gouk who all publicly criticized Day and withdrew or were removed from the Canadian Alliance caucus. Five more members left in June and July, including Deborah Grey. Grey accused Harris of seizing her computer and reviewing her files without her knowledge. Speaker of the House Peter Milliken investigated and ruled that Grey's \\"rights had been violated\\". In September, the dissident Canadian Alliance members formed a parallel caucus called the Democratic Representative Caucus and Day eventually conceded to a formal leadership review. Harris resigned as whip in January 2002 in order to campaign for Day's re-election as party leader. Stephen Harper won the leadership contest in April 2002 with 55% of the party votes. Under Harper, Harris remained the assistant critic on finance and he served on the 'Standing Committee on Finance' which he was a vice-chair in the 2nd session and a member in the 3rd session. Harper led the merger of the Canadian Alliance with Progressive Conservative Party to form the Conservative Party of Canada which Harris joined. 38th Parliament In preparation for the 2004 election Harris was challenged by Williams Lake dentist Elmer Thiessen for the Conservative Party nomination. On the evening of the vote, the nomination committee headed by Dan MacLaren, a declared Theissen supporter, apparently violated Election Canada rules by unilaterally extending the vote count beyond the legal period in order to receive late mail-in ballots. Harris was in the lead before the extension decision was made. After protests, based on Elections Canada rules that all ballots must be in by the time of counting, the party ordered a second ballot take place due to voting irregularities and that constituency association officials purposely restricted voting to Williams Lake only. Harris won on the second ballot by 16 votes. The RCMP launched an investigation into Harris for alleged financial irregularities. The investigation concluded that there was no valid evidence pointing to financial irregularities. Harris went on to win the election in the Cariboo‚ÄîPrince George riding with 46% of the vote and his party again formed the Official Opposition to the Liberal Party. In the 38th Parliament, Harris, as a member of the opposition, introduced one bill into the House of Commons: Bill C-275 An Act to amend the Criminal Code (failure to stop at scene of accident). Bill C-275 received first reading on November 15, 2004. In his sponsor's speech Harris said, The Minister of Justice did not support bill based on its lack of distinction between intentionally and unintentionally not stopping at the scene of accident and its dis-proportionality to other crimes, so the bill was voted down, 194 to 94, on June 22, 2005. Meanwhile, his constituency association (most of whom had supported Harris' nomination challenger, Elmer Thiessen) formed a committee, once again headed by Dan MacLaren, to investigate the financial irregularities charges, eventually finding charges to be valid. The constituency association held an election in February 2005 for their board of directors. The new board withdrew the previous board's findings against Harris. A month later, the RCMP dropped its investigation due to \\"insufficient information\\". A new constituency office was opened in Williams Lake in September 2004 and an office in Quesnel in November 2005. 39th Parliament There were no challenges to Harris for the Conservative Party nomination for the January 2006 election. He went on to win the Cariboo‚ÄîPrince George riding with 50% of the vote and this time Harris' party won and formed the government. In the 39th Parliament, he served as a member of the 'Standing Committee on Natural Resources' for both sessions and as a member on the 'Legislative Committee on Bill C-2' (Tackling Violent Crime Act) during the second session. Harper appointed Harris to be the chair of the British Columbia Conservative Caucus and the party's national forestry caucus. Harris generated controversy in August 2007 when, as chair of the BC Conservative Caucus, he appointed Houston mayor Sharon Smith as the \\"government go-to person\\" in neighbouring electoral district Skeena‚ÄîBulkley Valley. He told residents, through the media, to approach Smith rather than elected local MP Nathan Cullen, a member of an opposition party, for help with government services or lobbying for federal funding. Conservative Party spokesman Ryan Sparrow said this was not sanctioned by the party and that local residents should use their elected member of parliament. Another controversy arose when it was discovered that the Conservative Party used an \\"in-and-out\\" plan to have regional offices pay for national advertising during an election period. Opposition parties contended that the Conservatives did this to avoid campaign financing limits and attain reimbursement for the costs through Election Canada. Harris' campaign was one of many who participated (with $30,000 - 36% of his total campaign expenses for advertising), though Harris and the party maintain that they kept within the law. 40th Parliament In the October 2008 election Harris was re-elected in the Cariboo‚ÄîPrince George riding with 55% of the vote and his party again formed a minority government. During the campaign he received criticism for being \\"invisible\\" and living a semi-retired life in Kelowna some 600 km from his constituency. Harris maintained an apartment in Prince George on Range Road during this period. He does not own property in Kelowna. However, he responded to specific residency questions by suggesting that his long-term residence (over 50 years in the area) in Prince George qualifies him to represent the region. In the 40th Parliament, he served as a member of the 'Standing Committee on International Trade' in the 2nd session and on the 'Standing Committee on Natural Resources' during the 3rd session. He retained his chairmanship of the Conservative's national forestry caucus and the BC Caucus. Government opposition members and local critics, called Harris to task for failing to read the Canada/US Softwood Lumber Agreement, however, letters to newspapers from the major forestry companies in his province supported him for the work he did on their behalf during the Softwood Lumber negotiations. 41st Parliament As the incumbent seeking re-election, there were no nomination challenges and Harris was automatically acclaimed as the Conservative Party candidate in Cariboo‚ÄîPrince George riding. In the May 2011 election he faced UNBC student Jon Van Barneveld for the NDP, rancher Heidi Redl for the Green Party, UBC student Sangeeta Lalli for the Liberal Party, pilot Henry Thiessen for the Christian Heritage Party, UNBC student Jordan Turner for the Rhinoceros Party, and independent Jon Ronan. While Jon Van Barneveld was likely Harris' greatest opponent since his first election, Harris won the riding with 56% of the vote and his Conservative Party formed a majority government. During the 2011 election, Harris came under fire by Van Barneveld and the media based on his vote on a national wood-first policy in the previous parliament As the 41st Parliament began, Harris was assigned to the Standing Committee on Natural Resources and then moved to the Standing Committee on Veterans' Affairs. In the first session Harris introduced a Private Member's Bill (C-316) An Act to amend the Employment Insurance Act (incarceration) which will make time spent in jail ineligible as wait times in qualifying for employment insurance. His private member's bill was introduced in October 2011 and passed by the House of Commons in May 2012 and was subsequently approved by the Senate and given royal assent.https://openparliament.ca/bills/41-1/C-316/ Harris said that the significant safety enhancements to the proposed Enbridge Gateway pipeline project, go far beyond industry standards, and will ensure that \\"next generation\\" safety provisions, and structural integrity, will be present throughout the entire line. He did not run for re-election in 2015.

Hall typically played villains or comedic incompetent characters. Early years Hall was born in Cincinnati, Ohio. His father, W. A. Hall, headed a cooperage business that ended because of prohibition in the United States. After graduating from the University of Cincinnati, Hall worked for the Fleischmann Company while also directing and acting in little theater productions in Cleveland. Career Hall began his career touring as a stage actor with roles in productions of The Great Gatsby and Naked in 1926. His Broadway credits included The Great Gatsby (1926), Naked (1926), Loud Speaker (1927), Night Hostess (1928), It's a Wise Child (1929), Collision (1932), The Warrior's Husband (1932), The Dark Tower (1933), The Red Cat (1934).. Hall made his film debut in the 1931 drama Secrets of a Secretary. His last onscreen appearance was in the 1954 film Return to Treasure Island, which was released after his death. Hall was probably best remembered for five roles: a senator in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington; an atheist in Going My Way; the nervous, ill-tempered Granville Sawyer, who administers a psychological test to Kris Kringle in Miracle on 34th Street; a train passenger who encounters a man (Fred MacMurray) who has just committed a murder in Double Indemnity; and the title character's lawyer (Herbert MacCaulay) in The Thin Man. Personal life Hall married actress Geraldine Brown in 1927; they had two children. He served as a deacon at First Presbyterian Church of Hollywood for many years. On October 6, 1953, Hall died of a heart attack in Los Angeles, California, at the age of 65. His interment was at Forest Lawn - Hollywood Hills Cemetery. In popular culture Director Russ Meyer named one of the characters in the 1970 cult film Beyond the Valley of the Dolls after Hall.

He was born in 1783 at Woodhill, Perthshire, Scotland, studied law and became a magistrate. He was a director of an agricultural society, the Highland Society of Scotland, and was sent by them in 1831 to determine the state of agriculture in Canada and the United States. Impressed by his visit, he settled with his family on a farm, which he also named Woodhill, near Waterdown in East Flamborough Township, Upper Canada in 1833. In 1834, he established the village of Fergus with James Webster. He commanded a militia unit during the Upper Canada Rebellion of 1837. In 1839, he was appointed to the Legislative Council of Upper Canada and was a member of the Legislative Council for United Canada until his death in 1862. Although loyal to Britain, prosperous and well-connected, he supported the Reformers. He remained interested in improving agriculture in Upper Canada. He imported cattle from Britain and established a competition, the Fergus Cup, for the best Durham heifer. He was the first president of the Agricultural Association of Upper Canada in 1846 and a member of the Board of Agriculture of Upper Canada. He was a senator at the University of Toronto and played an important role in establishing the Upper Canada Veterinary School which became the Ontario Veterinary College, now part of the University of Guelph. He suffered a stroke in 1860 which left him paralyzed and died at Waterdown in 1862. His son Adam Johnston Fergusson Blair served in the legislative assembly for the Province of Canada and was later named to the Senate.

Although the K1 uses 5.56√ó45mm NATO, it is classified as a submachine gun by the South Korean military and the current manufacturer S&T; Motiv, because the K1 was intended to replace the M3 submachine gun. Development 250px In 1976, the ROKA Special Warfare Command requested a new weapon to replace the old M3 submachine gun. In the following year, ADD launched a project derived from the XB rifle, which started in 1972 to replace licensed M16A1s with indigenous weapons. Under the demands of the ROKASWC, the new submachine gun must acquire greater firepower, light weight, cost effectiveness, and easy access to spare parts. The first prototypes were made in 1980, and entered service in 1981 after series of field test. But due to the design of its flash suppressor, the K1 exhibited serious problems in service with the ROK armed forces. The original version had excessive recoil, noise, flash, and weak stock due to increase in firepower. These problems caused difficulty in aiming especially during night operation. These shortcomings were later fixed by the development and adoption of a new flash suppressor, which has three holes in the top right quadrant to limit muzzle flip under rapid fire and reduces flash to one-third of that of the early K1. This new version of K1 is known as the K1A and its production began in 1982. All K1 submachine guns in service were subsequently modified to the K1A standard. The K1A is often mated with the PVS-4K rail integration System. It is seen as a potential candidate for the \\"Warrior Platform\\", a Korean next-generation infantry project. Differences Most of the time, K1 submachine gun is regarded as a shortened or carbine version of Daewoo Precision Industries K2 assault rifle. However, although the two guns share development history they are very different from each other for the following reasons: * The development of K1 was completed earlier than that of K2. * The K1 uses the direct impingement gas system, while the K2 uses AK-47 style gas piston system. * The K1 has 1-in-12 rifling twist for the early 5.56√ó45mm M193 or .223 Remington, while the K2 has 1-in-7.3 rifling twist for the newer 5.56√ó45mm NATO (FN SS109). The carbine version of K2 named K2C was developed and shown to the public in 2012 by S&T; Motiv. Variants * XK1: Experimental prototype. * K1: First mass-produced variant.

It would have been a large-bodied quadrupedal herbivore with a long neck and whiplash tail. Although more derived diplodocoids were some of the longest animals ever to exist, Amazonsaurus was probably not more than 12 meters (40 ft) long. Gregory S. Paul estimated in 2010 its weight at 5000 kg.Paul, G.S., 2010, The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs, Princeton University Press p. 185 Fossils of Amazonsaurus, including some back and tail vertebrae, ribs, and fragments of the pelvis, are the only dinosaur remains identifiable at the generic level from the Itapecuru Formation of Maranh√£o. This geologic formation dates back to the Aptian through Albian epochs of the Early Cretaceous Period, or about 125 to 100 million years ago. Amazonsaurus was recovered in sediments which are interpreted by geologists as floodplain deposits near a river delta. Description Restoration The tall neural spines on the tail vertebrae identify Amazonsaurus as a diplodocoid sauropod, but the fragmentary nature of the only known specimen makes it difficult to place A. maranhensis more specifically within the superfamily Diplodocoidea. However, some features of these vertebrae suggest it may be a late-surviving member of a line of basal diplodocoids. At least one published cladistic analysis shows Amazonsaurus to be more derived than rebbachisaurids, but basal to dicraeosaurids and diplodocids within Diplodocoidea (Salgado et al., 2004).Salgado, L., Garrido, A., Cocca, S.E., & Cocca, J.R. 2004. Lower Cretaceous rebbachisaurid sauropods from Cerro Aguada del Le√≥n (Lohan Cura Formation), Neuqu√©n Province, northwestern Patagonia, Argentina. Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology 24(4): 903-912. Etymology Despite the fact that other dinosaurs have been found in Brazil, this is the first named genus from territory in the Amazon Basin. The generic name is derived from the Brazilian Legal Amazon region and the Greek word sauros (\\"lizard\\"). There is one named species, (A. maranhensis), which is named after the Brazilian state of Maranh√£o. Both genus and species were named in 2003 by Brazilian paleontologists Ismar de Souza Carvalho and Leonardo dos Santos Avilla, and their Argentine colleague, Leonardo Salgado.Carvalho, I.S., Avilla, L.S., & Salgado, L. 2003. Amazonsaurus maranhensis gen. et sp. nov. (Sauropoda, Diplodocoidea) from the Lower Cretaceous (Aptian‚ÄìAlbian) of Brazil. Cretaceous Research. 24: 697-713. Biogeography Basal diplodocoids are found in several parts of South America, as well as northern Africa, during the Early Cretaceous, as are titanosaurian sauropods, and the carcharodontosaurid and spinosaurid theropods. By the Late Cretaceous Period, the diplodocoids had gone extinct, while titanosaurs proliferated. The predatory theropod families of the Early Cretaceous were also replaced by abelisaurid theropods throughout the southern continents during the Late Cretaceous (Carvalho et al., 2003; Novas et al., 2005).*Novas, F.E., de Valais, S., Vickers-Rich, P., & Rich, T.H. 2005.

During this period, 6,292 units were built. The tank was designed to replace the obsolete T-38 amphibious scout tank. Design A captured T-60 pressed into German use in the Kholm Pocket. Nicholas Astrov's design team at Moscow Factory No. 37 was assigned the task of designing amphibious and non- amphibious scout tanks in 1938. They produced the T-30A and T-30B prototypes. The former was to be manufactured as the T-40 amphibious tank starting in 1940. It also led to the T-40S (sukhoputniy, \\"dry-land\\" version), a heavier tank prototype which was considered too complex to manufacture. The T-30B prototype, sharing the T-40's chassis but simpler in construction and with heavier armour, was accepted as the T-60 scout tank, and production began in July 1941, just after the German invasion. Although at first intended to carry a 12.7 mm machine gun like the T-40, the armament was later upgraded to the 20 mm TNSh cannon, a tank version of the ShVAK, on the advisement of the People's Commissar for Tank Industry Vyacheslav Malyshev. This weapon could penetrate 15 mm of perpendicular armour at 500 m which proved inadequate against the newer up-armoured German tank designs, thus attempts were made in 1942 to re- arm the T-60 with the 37 mm ZIS-19 cannon, but were abandoned due to the Soviet Union's shortage of 37 mm ammunition. Due to this a new project was started to house the standard 45mm tank gun on a modified turret. That became possible, and a new turret was designed and tested successfully in the summer of 1942. The new turret had the gun moved to its right side to make more room for the crew member and a co-axial machine gun was added. The project was terminated when Stavka chose the recently produced T-70 as the new standard light tank. A number of T-60s were captured and pressed into German use as the Panzerkampfwagen T-60 743(r). The T-60 was also used in the design of the experimental T-90 antiaircraft tank.  Gliding tank  One T-60 was converted into a glider in 1942 and was designed to be towed by a Petlyakov Pe-8 or Tupolev TB-3 bomber and was to be used to provide partisan forces with light armour. The tank was lightened for air use by removing armament, ammunition, headlights and leaving a very limited amount of fuel. Even with the modifications the TB-3 bomber had to ditch the glider due to the T-60's poor aerodynamics during its only flight to avoid crashing. The T-60 landed on a field near the aerodrome and after dropping the glider wings and tail returned to its base. Due to lack of sufficiently powerful aircraft to tow it the project was canceled and never resumed. Romanian TACAM and Mare»ôal tank destroyers The Romanians modified 34 captured T-60s into TACAM T-60 tank destroyers in 1943. They were armed with captured Soviet 76 mm divisional gun M1936 (F-22) housed in a light armoured superstructure open in its top and back, a typical configuration in the tank destroyers at the time. The Romanian military began development of an armoured fighting vehicle at the end of 1942, the Mare»ôal tank destroyer. The first three Mare»ôal prototypes were based on the T-60 chassis. Starting with prototype M-04, the T-60 chassis was abandoned in favor of a local design.Mark Axworthy, London: Arms and Armour, 1995, Third Axis, Fourth Ally: Romanian Armed Forces in the European War, 1941‚Äì1945, p. 231  References  Sources * * External links * T-60 Development History and Combat Employment Battlefield.ru * T-60 tanks, T-60 tanks in museum and monuments Category:Light tanks of the Soviet Union Category:World War II tanks of the Soviet Union Category:GAZ Group military vehicles Category:Reconnaissance vehicles Category:Airborne tanks Category:World War II light tanks ","title":"T-60 tank"},{"id":"3427828","text":"VOCM may refer to: * VOCM (AM), a news and talk radio station (590 AM) licensed to St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada * VOCM-FM, a classic rock radio station (97.5 FM) licensed to St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada ","title":"VOCM"},{"id":"3427835","text":"Crown Imperial is an orchestral march by the English composer William Walton. Walton derived the march's title from the line \\"In beawtie berying the crone imperiall\\" from William Dunbar's poem \\"In Honour of the City of London\\". The march was first performed at the coronation of King George VI in 1937 and was substantially revised in 1953. Walton originally composed the march for performance at the coronation of King Edward VIII, scheduled for 12 May 1937, but Edward abdicated in 1936. The coronation was held on the scheduled day, with Edward's brother being crowned instead. Crown Imperial was also performed at the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953, along with another Coronation March written by Walton, Orb and Sceptre. Crown Imperial was performed more recently as a recessional piece to the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton on 29 April 2011. The march was criticized as \\"unrepresentative of the composer\\" and \\"frankly a pastiche\\" of the \\"pomp and circumstance\\" style upon its premiere. The association with Sir Edward Elgar's Pomp and Circumstance Marches has continued, although the work has become popular. Adams, for example, describes it as an homage to Elgar and \\"the finest and most infectious of Walton's essays in that genre.\\" One nickname for the march was \\"Pomp and Circumstance March No. 6\\". The march falls into an ABABC form. The march opens in C major over Waltonesque long pedal points, which build energy. The following strain, an Elgarian trio section, moves into A-flat major. Then both march and trio reappear in C again and come to a conclusion in a small heroic coda. It has been arranged for organ by Herbert Murrill and can be found as such in A Walton Organ Album, compiled by Robert Gower and published by Oxford University Press. Christopher Palmer prepared a version of Crown Imperial for solo organ, brass, timpani and percussion (with harp ad lib), specifically for the Laurence Olivier Memorial Service in October 1989.

Ammonium oxidation is coupled to nitrite reduction to form the harmless dinitrogen gas. The key enzyme involved in this reaction, hydroxylamine oxidoreductase, is located in an organelle-like structure called the anammoxosome. The ability to oxidize ammonium anaerobically makes \\"Candidatus Brocadia anammoxidans\\" potentially useful for reducing--or eliminating-- ammonium from waste water.  In waste treatment  Because of its ability to eliminate ammonium, a variety of uses have been found for this bacteria, particularly removal of nitrogen from waste streams.B. Kartal, G.J. Kuenen and M.C.M van Loosdrecht Sewage Treatment with Anammox, Science, 2010, vol 328 p 702-3 The first full scale experiment employing the anammox process in the world was built at the waste water treatment plant Dokhaven/Sluisjesdijk in Rotterdam, Netherlands. Existing treatment plants use bacteria that convert ammonium into nitrate. The bacteria that do this need oxygen, which must be supplied by electric pumps. Denitrifying bacteria convert the nitrate into nitrogen gas. These require adding methanol. This process consumes an average of 44 watt-hours per day per person served by the sewage system. Researchers estimate that a methanogenic digester coupled to a nitrification-anammox bioreactor could generate 24 watt-hours per person per day, a net swing of 70 watt-hours.

Formation Barghouti announced that he had formed the new political party on December 14, 2005. Al-Mustaqbal was mainly composed of members of Fatah's \\"Young Guard\\", who had repeatedly expressed frustration with the entrenched corruption in the party. The split followed Barghouti's earlier refusal of Mahmoud Abbas' offer to be second on the Fatah party's parliamentary list, behind Palestinian Prime Minister Ahmed Qurei. In the Fatah primaries, held a few weeks earlier, Barghouti won first place convincingly, but Abbas initially refused to honor this result. In response, Barghouti's supporters threatened to break away from Fatah. Abbas attempted a last-minute compromise allowing Barghouti to top the Fatah list, but this was not sufficient and Barghouti broke away anyway. Palestinian security minister Mohammed Dahlan as well as a number of other senior members of Fatah joined Al-Mustaqbal. Reactions to the news were split. Some suggested that the move could be a positive step towards peace, as Barghouti's new party could help reform major problems in Palestinian government. Others raised concern that it could wind up splitting the Fatah vote, inadvertently helping Hamas. Barghouti's supporters argued that al-Mustaqbal would split the votes of both parties, both from disenchanted Fatah members as well as moderate Hamas voters who did not agree with Hamas' political goals, but rather its social work and hard position on corruption. Some observers have hypothesized that the formation of Mustaqbal was primarily a negotiating tactic to get members of the young guard into higher positions of power within Fatah and its electoral list. A variant theory was that after the elections, Mustaqbal would either be partially re-incorporated into Fatah, or would function as part of a parliamentary coalition with it in opposition to Hamas and other political rivals. Re-Consolidation On December 28, 2005, it was announced that Fatah was going to submit a new, unified list for the January primaries, consisting of members from both Fatah's old guard and Al-Mustaqbal. Barghouti was given the top slot on the list.Monsters and Critics - Page Not Found 404 Al- Mustaqbal spokesmen claimed that the decision to re-join Fatah was motivated out a desire to prevent Hamas from gaining electoral strength. Shortly after the announcement, Barghouti began campaigning for Fatah from his jail cell, apologizing to young Fatah members for the party's past mistakes, particularly relating to corruption.Jerusalem Post, 30 December 2005,Barghouti apologizes for Fatah mistakes, failures Despite the merger news, some analysts believe that the division in the party is far from resolved, and that an increase in rivalries and inter-party factionalism will occur after the elections. There is a definite possibility that such a development could quickly turn violent, as both groups exert control over various large militias.Jerusalem Post, 30 December 2005 Fatah members warn of war within party Mustaqbal post- elections In the wake of Fatah's defeat in the elections, Mustaqbal's early momentum seems to have been largely stalled, and it is unclear what role, if any, it will play as an independent, or partially autonomous faction within Fatah or Palestinian government in the future. As of several months after its formation, the party had yet to publicly disclose its platform or positions, leaving many questions about its policies, particularly regarding territorial demands and violence against Israel, unanswered. Some analysts have suggested that Mustaqbal's ultimate significance lies in the fact that it firmly demonstrated just how wide the existing gap between the old and young generations of Fatah activists is, and that it wound up splitting the Fatah vote in many districts when discontented Mustaqbal members ran independent of the \\"re-integrated\\" Fatah list. In a very real sense, Mustaqbal's existence contributed to Hamas' victory in the 2006 Palestinian elections.

It is sometimes regarded as an aspect of criminal vicarious liability, as distinct from the situation in which the wording of a statutory offence specifically attaches liability to the corporation as the principal or joint principal with a human agent. The concepts The imposition of criminal liability is only one means of regulating corporations. There are also civil law remedies such as injunction and the award of damages which may include a penal element. Generally, criminal sanctions include imprisonment, fines and community service orders. A company has no physical existence, so it can only act vicariously through the agency of the human beings it employs. While it is relatively uncontroversial that human beings may commit crimes for which punishment is a just desert, the extent to which the corporation should incur liability is less clear. Obviously, a company cannot be sent to jail, and if a fine is to be paid, this diminishes both the money available to pay the wages and salaries of all the remaining employees, and the profits available to pay all the existing shareholders. Thus, the effect of the only available punishment is deflected from the wrongdoer personally and distributed among all the innocent parties who supply the labour and the capital that keep the corporation solvent. Because, at a public policy level, the growth and prosperity of society depends on the business community, governments recognise limits on the extent to which each permitted form of business entity can be held liable (including general and limited partnerships which may also have separate legal personalities). However, limitations on corporate liability can lead to profound injustices for individuals resulting from a limited ability to be properly compensated for wrongdoing. Criminal or civil controls? =Using the criminal law= *Represents formal public disapproval and condemnation because of the failure to abide by the generally accepted social norms, codified into the criminal law. Police powers to investigate can be more effective, but the availability of relevant expertise may be limited. If successful, prosecution reinforces social values and shows the state's willingness to uphold those values in a trial likely to attract more publicity when previously respected business leaders are called to account. The judgment may also cause a loss of corporate reputation and, in turn, a loss of profitability. *Justifies more severe penalties because it is necessary to overcome the higher burden of proof to establish criminal liability. But the high burden means that it is more difficult to secure a judgment than in the civil courts, and many corporations are cash-rich and so can pay apparently immense fines without difficulty. Further, if the corporation knows that the fine is going to be severe, it may seek bankruptcy protection before sentencing. *The theoretical value of punishment is that the offender feels shame, guilt or remorse, emotional responses to a conviction that a fictitious person cannot feel. *If a state turns too often to the criminal law, it discourages self-regulation and may cause friction between any regulatory agencies and businesses that they are to regulate. =Using the civil law= *With the lower burden of proof and better case management tools, civil liability is easier to prove than criminal liability, and offers more flexible remedies which can be preventative as well as punitive. *But there is little moral condemnation and no real deterrent effect so the general management response may be to see civil actions as a routine cost of business which is tax deductible. Criminal laws Most jurisdictions use criminal and civil systems in parallel, making the political judgment on how infrequently to use the criminal law to maximise the publicity of those cases that are prosecuted. While others enact specific legislation covering health and safety, and product safety issues which lay down general protections for the public and for the employees. The difficulty of proving a mens rea is avoided in the less serious offences by imposing absolute, strict liability, or vicarious liability which does not require proof that the accused knew or could reasonably have known that its act was wrong, and which does not recognise any excuse of honest and reasonable mistake. But, most legislatures require some element of fault, either by way of an intention to commit the offence or recklessness resulting in the offence, or some knowledge of the relevant circumstances. Thus, companies are held liable when the acts and omissions, and the knowledge of the employees can be attributed to the corporation. This is usually filtered through an identification, directing mind or alter ego test which proves that the employee has sufficient status to be considered the company when acting. =Identification test in English law= In Tesco Supermarkets Ltd v Nattrass [1972] AC 153, Lord Reid said: :The person who acts is not speaking or acting for the company. He is acting as the company and his mind which directs his acts is the mind of the company. If it is a guilty mind then that guilt is the guilt of the company. This approach has been criticised because it restricts corporate liability to the acts of directors and a few high-level managers. This unfairly favours larger corporations because they will escape criminal liability for the acts of all the employees who manage the day-to-day activities of the corporations. This has proved problematic as in the cases involving corporate manslaughter. =Aggregation test in the United States= By ‚Äúaggregating‚Äù the acts and omissions of two or more natural persons acting as the corporation, the actus reus and mens rea can be constructed out of the conduct and knowledge of several individuals. This is termed the Doctrine of Collective Knowledge. In United States v Bank of New England (1987) 821 F2d 844 the charge of wilfully failing to file reports relating to currency transactions was proved because the bank‚Äôs knowledge was the totality of what all of the employees knew within the scope of their authority. The Court of Appeals‚Äô confirmed a collective knowledge is appropriate because corporations would compartmentalise knowledge and subdivide duties and avoid liability. Aggregation has been applied in Australian courts, but is rejected in England.Capuano A, 'Catching the Leprechaun: Company Liability and the Case for a Benefit Test in Organic Attribution', (2010) Vol 24 No 2 Australian Journal of Corporate Law =A blameworthiness test= Gobert argues that if a corporation fails to take precautions or to show due diligence to avoid committing a criminal offence, this will arise from its culture where attitudes and beliefs are demonstrated through its structures, policies, practices, and procedures. This rejects the notion that corporations should be treated in the same way as natural persons (i.e. looking for a \\"guilty\\" mind), and advocates that different legal concepts should underpin the liability of fictitious persons. This reflects the structures of modern corporations which are more often decentralised and where crime is less to do with the misconduct by or incompetence of individuals, and more to do with systems that fail to address problems of monitoring and controlling risk. =Benefit test= A benefit test has been applied in the Federal Court of Australia, the House of Lords (now the Supreme Court of England) and the Supreme Court of Canada. Put simply, the test proposes that where a company gains the benefit of an act, it is considered to be attributed with that act. The test is applied differently when an act is performed by a \\"mind and will\\", which usually prompts the use of the organic theory, as opposed to an agent which usually prompts the use of the agency theory. Specific issues =Fraud= In some instances of fraud, the court may pierce the veil of incorporation. Most fraud is also a breach of the criminal law and any evidence obtained for the purposes of a criminal trial is usually admissible in civil proceedings. But criminal prosecutions take priority, so if civil proceedings uncover evidence of criminality, the civil action may be stayed pending the outcome of any criminal investigation. =Secondary liability= Some crimes are considered inchoate because, like a conspiracy or attempt, they anticipate the commission of the actus reus (the Latin for \\"guilty act\\") of the full offence. One option for prosecution would be to treat a corporation as an accomplice or co-conspirator with the employees. In general terms, most states permit companies to incur liability for such offences in the same way as natural persons so long as there are at least two natural persons involved in the conspiracy and one other accomplice to aid the commission of the offence by a principal.

In 1951, he left Lebanon behind, and came to Australia in search of a better way of life. Realising that, to be successful in professional wrestling, he needed added weight, he underwent a course of bodybuilding at Dovey‚Äôs Gymnasium, Sydney. He was successful in adding over 40 lb body weight. Additionally, he seized every opportunity to work with freestyle wrestlers and to make himself fit enough for a career in professional wrestling. Among the early wrestlers who helped him achieve his target of becoming a professional were Tom Lurich, Chief Little Wolf and Jim Deakin. In March 1953, he made his debut at Leichhardt Stadium, in an encounter against Jon Morro. After four more contests, Ayoub headed for New Zealand and held his own against the British Empire Champion, Earl McCready. He was signed for a series of contests against wrestlers that were operating throughout India at the time. Some of these included Tiger Joginder Singh, Emil Koroshenko, Dara Singh, King Kong, Bert Assirati and Harbans Singh. In 1956, he returned to Sydney where wrestling was in full swing. At White City, he wrestled Tiger Ray Holden. The rest of the year was spent in Hobart, Adelaide and Perth, where he competed against such talent as George Pencheff, King Kong and Baron von Heczey. In 1957 at White City, he went to a draw with the Indian, Tarlok Singh. In October en route to Japan for a World Title clash against the Champion, Lou Thesz, he stopped in Singapore for a bout against King Kong for the Malaysian Heavyweight crown. In a fierce contest, Kong was victorious. When negotiations for his visit to Japan fell through, Ayoub decided to stay in Singapore and competed in bouts with Ricky Waldo and Aslam Pehalwan. In March 1958, Ayoub returned to Sydney. At the Sports Ground, he wrestled Andreas Lambrakis to a draw. He then went to Adelaide and Hobart, where he competed against the likes of George Duane and King Kong. Although he was in demand from overseas promoters, he was ignored by the promoters of Stadiums Limited. This had little effect on his career, as he was soon off on a five-year tour of the Far East and Europe. His first stop was Singapore where he clashed with King Kong, as well as Charles Henry and Akram Pahelwan. From here, Ayoub went to India. In New Delhi he defeated Arjit Singh. His contract was extended a further year to fit in contests against George Pencheff, Bill Verna, Don Steadman, George Zbisko, Dara Singh, George Gordienko and numerous others. =1960s= 1961 saw Ayoub in Europe under the promotion of the European Wrestling Alliance (France) and Joint Promotions (England). He went to Belgium and then Paris, where he wrestled L‚ÄôHomme Masque, who resorted to foul tactics by hitting him with a microphone. Ayoub retaliated and attacked Masque with such ferocity it took 25 police officers to drag him clear. Ayoub then went on to Belgium where he competed in a tournament against Horst Hoffman, Herman Iffland, Roger Delaporte and Jack Lasartesse, amongst others. He then went to England where he met Billy Robinson, Jack Pye, Tibor Szakacs, Billy Joyce, Mike Marino, George Portz and many others. In 1962, he went to Pakistan to tackle the Pehelwan brothers, Akram and Aslam. The next step was India, and then Lebanon where he accounted for King Kong. In July, he toured Singapore and Thailand, where he wrestled Lofty Binnie, Red Scorpion and Sitting Bull. In 1963 he returned to India and competed against Sucha Singh, Al Rodgoa and Dara Singh. He returned to Australia and made his headquarters in Sydney. He wrestled Lucky Simunovich, Con Paplazarou, Alex Iakovides and Elias Panagos at Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide Stadiums. In 1965 Ayoub returned to Lebanon for the Middle East Championship Tournament which he won against Sky Hi Lee, Ray Apollon, George Gordienko and Joseph Zaranoff, to name but a few. In 1967 at White City in Sydney, he turned back his old nemesis, King Kong and won the Orient Heavyweight Title. He then returned to New Zealand and on to Singapore, Borneo and Taiwan where he clashed with Jack Claybourne, Steve Rickard, Mr. X and Charlie & Tony Kontellis. =1970s= In 1971, Wadi Ayoub engaged in several contests against the reigning New Zealand and British Empire Champion, John DaSilva and came out on top. In other matches, he accounted for Dr Death and El Montana. Although circumstances prevented Ayoub performing with the World Championship Wrestling Promotion, (the American promoters were loath to use Australian wrestlers to headline their programmes), the use of Wadi Ayoub in main event matches was a breakthrough for Australian‚Äìbased wrestlers. In 1972, with World Championship Wrestling, Ayoub turned back the likes of Killer Karl Kox, Tiger Joginder Singh, Brute Bernard and Bulldog Brower. He returned for another series of matches and again remained undefeated, this time against Bob Roop, Don Fargo, Waldo von Erich, Guy Mitchell, Don Carson and Hiro Tojo. He was also involved in tag matches with Mark Lewin, Spiros Arion and King Curtis against the likes of Abdullah the Butcher, Big Bad John and the Tojo Brothers. In 1975, Ayoub battled with the Mighty Spartagos and Prince Kumali. In the latter contest, he successfully defended his All-Asian Title. 1976 saw Ayoub ready to tour Singapore, but he was diagnosed with cancer before this could take place and subsequently died on September 29, 1976.

They provided plants and organisms for medicinal use and research. 'New Conservatory at Lincoln Park, Chicago' - Image from page 147 of \\"American gardening\\" (1892) In the early nineteenth century, the development of iron and glass building technology led to the constructions of conservatories in major cities in the United States as well as other countries in the world. Chicago had become overcrowded as its population had increased rapidly. With a growing concern about the ill effect of industrialization, interest in collecting and classifying plant life became very popular. The city leaders decided to build a new and more substantial conservatory to replace a small greenhouse built in the 1870s. Architects Joseph Lyman Silsbee and M.E. Bell designed and built an exotic-style glass conservatory which was described as \\"a paradise under glass\\". Originally, the aquatic plants were placed in a heated pond outside. They were later moved into tanks inside the conservatory. The Conservatory's exotic plans were so popular that in 1897, the Egyptian government asked the Conservatory for seeds of water lilies flowers.\\"Lincoln Park Conservatory.\\" Chicagoparkdistrict.com.

Web. 07 Oct.2015.. The Lincoln Park Commission established a greenhouse at the Lincoln Park site in 1877 and planted an adjacent formal garden in 1880. Due to the fascination of horticulture among the city dwellers, Lincoln Park‚Äôs small greenhouse was no longer sufficient for all the plants. Large conservatories with different plants and exhibit rooms were gaining popularity. Nationally renowned architect Joseph Lyman Silsbee designed the Victorian conservatory in collaboration with another Chicago architect, Mifflin E. Bell. Between 1890 and 1895 they created a glass building that would support \\"a luxuriant tropical growth, blending the whole into a natural grouping of Nature's loveliest forms\\". Silsbee gave the conservatory an exotic form by creating a series of trusses in the shape of ogee arches. A female sago palm in the fern room. Halls The conservatory consists of a vestibule, four display halls and fifteen propagating and growing houses. The vestibule and Palm House were built and opened to the public in 1892 and contain giant palms and rubber trees, including a 15 m (50 ft) fiddle-leaf rubber tree planted in 1891. The Palm House, has a display of more than twelve different types of palms. The most unusual palms include Dwarf Sugar, Bottle, Fiji Fan, and Everglade palms.

It contains plants of the forest floor, primarily a vast collection of ferns and one of the most historical plants, the cycads. Fossils of these plants date back at least 250 million years. These plants are similar to conifers and the ginkgo tree rather than palm trees. The Tropical Room was originally called the stove house. Opened in 1895, it contained an assortment of tropical plants suspended from bark- covered walls. It is now called the Orchid Room and has a collection of approximately 25,000 natural species. This room contains hundreds of orchids, bromeliads and a few tropical carnivorous plants. Orchids, just like bromeliads, get their water from the humidity in the room. The Display House or The Show House is used for seasonal flower exhibits. The \\"Spring Flower Show\\" starts on January 21 and ends on May 13.

Finally, the year ends with the \\"Winter Flow and Train Show\\" that runs starts on November 24 and ends on January 6. Surrounding gardens Throughout the long history of the conservatory, there has been an important relationship between the structure and its surrounding landscape. Twelve beds of colorful summer annuals and tropical plants surround Storks at Play, also known as the Eli Bates Fountain, by sculptors Augustus St. Gaudens and Frederick MacMonnies. This large formal garden is located just south of the Lincoln Park Conservatory. Called the Great Garden, it is one of the oldest public gardens in Chicago and pre-dates the present conservatory by 20 years. The Lincoln Park Commission installed the fountain in 188687. Its design was chosen by Chicago's Lincoln Memorial Fund over those of four others submitted during an 1883 competition. = Schiller Monument = The Schiller Monument, at the south end of the garden, is a copy of an original monument to German poet Friedrich Schiller. It was cast in Stuttgart, Germany and erected in 1886 by a group known as Chicago Citizens of German Descent. The original work is regarded as the masterpiece of its sculptor, Ernst Bildhauer Rau.

Jenks was born in Des Moines, Iowa, and his mother gave him a trombone when he was 9 years old. By his late teens he was playing with Eddie Peabody and his band. Later he became a studio musician in Hollywood, California. Jenks began in vaudeville and went on to a long career in movies and television, mostly in comedy. He was one of the more familiar faces and voices of the Hollywood Studio era. For almost ten years beginning in the early 1920s, Jenks was a song and dance man in vaudeville. In 1933, when sound films had become the norm, and Broadway actors were moving to Hollywood in droves, Jenks's flat, sarcastic delivery landed him a film career. Usually a supporting actor, Jenks did appear occasionally as a film lead for low-budget films for PRC. Jenks appeared in not a few classics. In the Cary Grant-Rosalind Russell classic His Girl Friday (1940), Jenks had his most famous role, as the cynical newsman \\"Wilson.\\" When television began, Jenks made a successful transition. Jenks' biggest continuing role was that of Uthas P.

Four of the rebels were subsequently beaten to death after the rebellion had been quelled. A total of 42 soldiers from the Counter Revolutionary Warfare Unit, who sympathized with George Speight, whose own civilian coup d'√©tat had been put down by the military in July, were subsequently convicted of involvement in the mutiny. Among those convicted was Ratu Inoke Takiveikata, the Qaranivalu of Naitasiri, one of Fiji's most senior chiefs. Retrial ordered On 16 August 2005, the Fiji Court of Appeal delivered a landmark ruling, ordering a retrial of 20 soldiers from the Counter Revolutionary Warfare Unit (CRW) who had been convicted in a court-martial of participating in the 2000 coup and in a subsequent mutiny in November 2000, and sentenced to prison terms of between three and six years. The Court of Appeal President, Justice Gordon Ward, ruled that the military commander, Commodore Frank Bainimarama had acted properly in convening a court martial, but had exceeded his authority in appointing the members of the panel, thus denying the accused a fair trial. The authority to appoint the court martial panel was vested in the President of Fiji, Ward said, and the Commander could make the appointments only after the President delegated the power to him. He also said that the court martial had improperly failed to separate the charges that each defendant faced. Ward also criticized the oversight of the Fijian government in failing to enact appropriate court martial legislation. Instead of having a law of its own, Fiji still followed the British law, inherited from colonial times, accepting by default whatever changes the British government made to it. Fiji should adopt its own legislation to take account of the realities of the local situation, he said. On 18 August, the military rearrested the CRW soldiers whose sentences had been overturned by the Appeal Court, pending a retrial. Military spokesman Captain Neumi Leweni said that the 9 CRW soldiers who had participated in the mutiny had been taken into military custody and detained at Suva's Queen Elizabeth Barracks, while 11 others serving sentences related to the coup of May 2000 remain incarcerated in Korovou Prison. Appeal Court Judge Gerald Winter approved the rearrest and refused the defendants' requests for bail, saying that it could be granted only by a court martial panel, not by the Court of Appeal. Court martial panel named A ten-member court martial panel was named on 5 October. Military spokesman Captain Neumi Leweni and lawyer Sevuloni Valenitabua announced that Lieutenant Colonel Apakuki Kurusiga had been appointed President of the court martial, with Fiji Law Society President Graeme Leung as the Judge Advocate. Other members of the panel named were Major Sitiveni Qiliho, Captain Anil Kumar, Lieutenant Eliki Salusalu, Lieutenant Marika Vosawale, Captain Viliame Tokalautawa, Captain Viliame Kolinisau and Captain Vatimio Leva. These are very junior officers whom some are considered by veteran soldiers as gung-ho officers. The general belief by loyal soldiers themselves that the panel will be biased considering their reputation as very inexperienced and strongly ambitious who will only want to please Commander Bainimarama rather than assess fairly. =Multiple adjournments= The court martial was supposed to get underway on 12 October but the proceedings had to be cancelled after prison officials failed to deliver the soldiers facing trial. On 19 October, when the court martial was scheduled to convene, Leung was abruptly dismissed without by President Ratu Josefa Iloilo. The military's Legal Services Director, Major Kitione Tuinaosara, said that the President wanted to appoint his own Judge Advocate. The military had done their part by appointing the Court Martial panel, Tuinaosara said, and the onus was on the President to check the panel before approving it. He had not done so, Tuinaosara said. The President's actions effectively adjourned the trial indefinitely. On 21 October, Presidential spokesman Rupeni Nacewa said that the President had withdrawn the Convening Order for the court martial because of \\"a procedural anomaly.\\" He denied a claim by the Commodore Bainimarama that it was because the Judge Advocate, Graeme Leung, was the choice of the military. On 26 October, President Iloilo reinstated Leung as Judge Advocate. It was announced on 25 November that the court martial had been postponed until further notice. The decision was made pending a military application to have Judge Advocate Leung commissioned as an army officer, a necessity for the case to proceed, according to Army Legal Services Director Major Kitione Tuinaosara. The application was made to President Iloilo. Another application by defence lawyer Barbara Malimali, concerning the conditions of the soldiers' imprisonment, was also a factor, Tuinaosara said. \\"They are being held as civilians although they allegedly committed the offences when they were soldiers so the applications are on things like their rest conditions while in detention, among other things,\\" Malimali's application stated. On 15 December, the court martial was yet again adjourned indefinitely, on grounds that the Home Affairs Ministry had not yet approved Judge Advocate Leung's commission as a military officer. The commissioning request was lodged with the ministry five weeks before. Lesi Korovavala, the Chief Executive Officer of the Home Affairs Ministry, told Fiji Television that disagreements about the nature of Leung's contract were holding up the appointment. The cost of the contract (F$130,000, to be paid by the military) was also understood to be a matter of contention. In an exclusive interview with the Fiji Village news service on 3 January 2006, Graeme Leung defended his fees, saying that they were for a demanding assignment that nobody wanted and were therefore reasonable. =Contempt of court allegations; release on bail= On 30 November, Malimali accused the military of being in contempt of court when it refused to release former CRW soldier Ropate Nakau on bail to visit his father over weekends, as the High Court had ordered on 11 November, and after Commodore Bainimarama had not replied to two letters she had sent. In response, Major Tuinaosara replied that the soldiers facing mutiny charges were dangerous and should not be released. \\"The offence deals with firearms and the military will not risk redeploying them. People are forgetting why we are having a retrial. People died in the mutiny. They are forgetting how dangerous these people are and they should not forget the mutiny shook the security of the nation and these people speak of rights,\\" Tuinaosara said. Malimali rejected this, saying that the ten soldiers in remand were citizens, and had a right to be presumed innocent until convicted. On 1 December, Justice Gerard Winter at the High Court in Suva found Commodore Bainimarama not guilty of contempt of court, but nevertheless ordered his earlier decision be allowed bail on weekends must be implemented. He agreed with Malimali that Nakau was entitled to bail, as the court martial had not yet convened. In a further ruling, the High Court Justice Jiten Singh released nine of the soldiers on bail on 23 December. Bail conditions granted to Barbados Mills (38), Pauliasi Namulo (34), Usaia Rokobigi (38), Feoko Gadekibua (27), Peni Bitu (41), Lagilagi Vosabeci (45), Usaia Waqatakirewa (34), Kalisito Vuki (43) and Daniel Koroi Tavalena (41) included a curfew to be observed from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m., and an order not to communicate with one another, with witnesses, or with military personnel. They were ordered to surrender their passports and to report to the police daily between noon and 3 p.m.. Their release was confirmed by lawyer Sevuloni Valenitabua. =The military's response= On 20 December 2005, Commodore Bainimarama demanded Korovavala's resignation in the wake of the repeated adjournments, which Bainimarama alleged to be a case of political interference to make the military toe the government line. This provoked an angry reaction from Anare Jale, Chief Executive Officer of the Public Service Commission, who said that the Commander had gone too far. \\"Mr Bainimarama cannot just make public comments as he wishes. There are proper channels to follow if civil servants have complaints about authority,\\" he stated. Home Affairs Minister Josefa Vosanibola said on 21 December that the government could not afford to pay the F$130,000 fees that Leung was demanding. \\"Even the Chief Justice and other High Court judges do not get that kind of money,\\" he said. Instead, his ministry proposed paying F$30,000 plus a daily sitting allowance of F$200, according to a paid advertisement published by Korovavala. This provoked a further outburst from Commodore Bainimarama, who said that the same contract, with the same enumeration, had been offered to the previous Judge Advocate, Sarvadanand Sadal. At any rate, he insisted, the pay was between Leung and the military, as it was the military, not the government, that was footing the bill. The case was a difficult one, Bainimarama said, with politics colouring the issues involved. Major Kitione Tuinaosara, concurred, saying that it had been difficult to find a judge willing to hear the court martial because of the seriousness of the charges. The commander also questioned why it had taken more than a month for the ministry to reply to his initial proposal. The government had expressed no reservations about the contract until the military had inquired about the reasons for Leung's delayed commissioning, he alleged. In another outburst on 22 December, Bainimarama demanded that civil servants like Korovavala and Jale stop trying to \\"intimidate\\" the military. \\"Jale and Korovavala have been trying to take me to task,\\" he said. \\"I challenge them to take me to task in front of the Public Service Commission. Go ahead and make my day,\\" the Fiji Times reported. In the same press conference, the commander reiterated that the military would do all in its power to prevent the Unity Bill from becoming law. In a further development reported by the Fiji Times on 23 December, Commander Esala Teleni said that the military had already signed Leung's contract. This, he said, was the prerogative of the military, not the ministry. He also claimed that Leung had been chosen as Judge Advocate at the request of President Iloilo. \\"If Home Affairs does not want him, it would go against the President's wish,\\" Commander Teleni said. Home Affairs acting chief executive Saverio Baleikanacea reacted by demanding to know under what and whose authority the military had concluded its contract with Leung. =Other criticisms of the delay= The Fiji Human Rights Commission (FHRC) condemned the delays in the commissioning of Judge Advocate Leung. In a strongly worded statement, Dr. Shaista Shameem, the Director of the Commission, said on 22 December 2005 that the delays violated the constitutional rights of a defendant to have the case determined within a reasonable period of time. Leung himself said the same day that he had yet to be commissioned as an Army officer, to allow him to assume the position of Judge Advocate. Lawyer Barbara Malimali, who represents fourteen of the twenty prisoners awaiting retrial, also criticized the delay, saying that it was causing suffering to the people concerned. These men wanted answers, she said. She threatened to take the matter to court if the standoff was not resolved. Then, on 28 December, she told the Fiji Village news service that she had requested President Ratu Josefa Iloilo, in his capacity as Commander in Chief of the military, to intervene to uncover the reasons for the delay in implementing his directive to convene the court martial retrial. =Leung commissioned= The Home Affairs Minister finally approved Leung's appointment as Judge Advocate, and his commissioning as a Lieutenant Colonel under a Short Service Territorial Commission in the Fiji Infantry Corp., on 4 January 2005. Minister Vosanibola said that the delay had been caused by the need to gain additional information from the military, but military spokesman Captain Neumi Leweni denied this, with Commodore Bainimarama saying on 5 January that the Home Affairs Ministry had misled the nation. \\"When they said they were waiting for a reply to their letter, it was all lies because there was no letter at all,\\" the Commander said. Bainimarama was supported by Captain Neumi Leweni, who also said the ministry had \\"lied\\" in a press release from the Information Ministry on 3 January. The military had sent the required documents not once but twice, Leweni said; the Ministry had lost the originals. The delays, and the timing of the final commissioning, suggested a hidden agenda on the part of the government, he alleged. Meanwhile, Paula Uluinaceva, the acting Chief Executive of the Finance Ministry, said that Leung's salary would have to be drawn from the military's budget. The court martial reconvenes The court martial reconvened at 11 a.m. on 10 January 2006. Legal counsel had earlier revealed that 8 of the 20 soldiers being retried intended to plead guilty. Meanwhile, the nine soldiers who had been released on bail before Christmas were remanded in custody. Four of the accused were represented by Sevoloni Valeinitabua, three by Captain Navi Suwai, and two by Barbara Malimali. Eleven remained unrepresented. Two members of the court martial panel were dismissed before the searing in. This followed objections from Malimali against three members. Captain Setareki Bogidrau, Major Sitiveni Qiliho, and Lieutenant Commander Bradley Bower, the Operations Officer of the Navy, were said to be too closely identified with Commodore Bainimarama and it was noted that they had fought against the alleged mutineers in 2000. Bogidrau had been the Operations Officer for the Third Battalion which had put down the mutiny, while Giliho had helped to secure the Suva Naval base for loyalist forces. Bower had also had a hand in suppressing the revolt, she alleged. Judge Advocate Leung upheld the challenge to Bogidrau and Qiliho and dismissed them from the panel, but rejected the claims made against Bower. The court martial was adjourned later that day, and was scheduled to reconvene on 17 January. The session was postponed until the 18th, however, and began with Malimali calling for the court martial panel to be dismissed on account of what she said were \\"anomalies in the swearing-in process.\\" Court Martial President Apakuki Kurusiga rejected the call for the dissolution of the panel. That day, lawyer Sevoloni Valeinitabua applied for bail for his four clients, even though they were ready to plead guilty. This application was strongly opposed by the prosecution, and the Court Martial Panel rejected it on the 20th. Kurusiga said, however, that President Ratu Josefa Iloilo would be asked to consider the matter, in his capacity of Commander-in-Chief of the Military Forces. Lawyer Malimali expressed bitter disappointment with the decision. Court proceedings are scheduled to resume on 30 January, when nine accused are expected to plead guilty. Judge Advocate Leung told the press that he had declared a potential conflict of interest to the Court Martial President. He was paying the school fees for two children of an ex-CRW soldier, he said. He did not reveal whether the soldier was one of those being tried, but said that his impartiality would not be affected. =Soldiers plead guilty= The Fiji Live news service reported on 31 January that eleven of the former CRW soldiers - Lance Corporal Barbados Mills, Private Beniamo Sokiveta, Private Pauliasi Namulo, Corporal Isireli Cakau, Corporal Metuisela Railumu, Private Feoko Gadekibau, Lance Corporal Daniele Koroitavalena, Corporal Maciu Tawake, Private Emosi Qicatabua, Sergeant Peni Bitu and Lance Corporal Eparama Waqatairewa - had pleaded guilty. It was later revealed that Sergeant Malakai Cakaunitabua had also pleaded guilty. The remaining eight pleaded not guilty. Qicatabua, Railumu, and Bitu apologised and expressed remorse for their role in the mutiny. The apology was addressed to the Commander of the military, the families of the soldiers killed in the mutiny, churches, and the public of Fiji. Bitu said he was now a born-again Christian and had learned his lesson from five years in custody. Lawyer Malimali called for clemency to be shown, on the grounds that the mutineers had merely been following orders and had not been involved in the planning of the mutiny. They had already been punished enough, she said. She called for two of her clients to be discharged. The military prosecutor, Major Kitione Tuinaosara, answered that it must not be forgotten that mutiny was a very serious offence and carried serious discipline. The court martial subsequently adjourned on 1 February to deliberate on sentencing the twelve who had pleaded guilty. =Sentences meted out= On 10 February, Court Martial President Apakuki Kurusiga read out the sentences. He said that mutiny was a serious criminal offence which in former times would have incurred the death penalty. \\"The attempted mutiny struck at the very heart of military discipline. The mutiny has also called into question the professionalism of the military and its personnel, most of whom are dedicated and loyal soldiers,\\" the judgment read. \\"The uprising of November 2000 is a terrible stain on the once proud record of the RFMF. This court cannot ignore the fact that a number of soldiers were killed during the mutiny.\\" Mills, Koroitavalena, Tawake, Waqatairewa, Qicatabua and Sokiveta were all sentenced to a one-year prison term; as junior non-commissioned officers, their responsibility for the mutiny was limited, Kurusiga said. Railumu and Bitu were sentenced to two years each, while Cakau received one year and 8 months. The maximum sentence of three years' imprisonment went to Cakaunitabua, who as a senior non-commissioned officer had \\"significant command responsibility\\". All of these sentences represented a reduction of the original sentences, which had ranged from 3 to 6 years, in view of the time they had already served. Namulo and Gadikibau were released, also in view of the time already served. =The trial of the remaining eight= The remaining eight, who pleaded innocent, appeared before the Court Martial on 16 February. Defence counsel for Privates Filimoni Raivalu, Jona Nawaqa, Lagilagi Vosabeci, and Ropate Nakau, Lance Corporal Usaia Rokobigi and Sergeants Peni Bitu, Kalisito Vuki and Viliame Tikotani, were given till 23 February to make their submissions. The military lawyer, Major Kitione Tuinaosara, revealed that he would be bringing in five new witnesses. Judge Advocate Graeme Leung ordered both parties to conduct a pretrial conference before the 23rd. Another adjournment was announced on 27 February, to arrange representation for some of the accused and to give time for defence lawyers to study evidence filed by the prosecution. Fiji Live reported that some of the defendants would be represented by Vodo Tuberi and others by Barbara Malimali. The court martial resumed on 13 March. Sergeant Ifereimi Vatutalei testified that on going outside to investigate the sound of rifle fire, he had seen Vosabeci brandishing a rifle on 2 November 2000. Military prosecutor Captain Pacolo Luveni announced on 14 March that the military intended to call a total of 48 witnesses. Appearing as a witness, Warrant Officer Waisale Rakusa testified on 15 March that he had seen a soldier fire shots at a military vehicle on 2 November 2000. On 16 March, the court martial panel was shown through the Queen Elizabeth Barracks in Nabua, to allow them to survey the layout. He had then seen two of the accused, namely Tikotani and Iowane Waseroma run towards the armory. Commodore Bainimarama denied on 16 March that the killing of rebel soldiers in the mutiny had been ordered by the military. Soldiers demand to be paid On 19 January, it was reported that the soldiers on trial had complained that they had not been paid since July 2004. As they had not yet been convicted, their pay should not be stopped, they maintained in a letter read to the court by defence lawyer Sevuloni Valenitabua. Court Martial president Lieutenant Colonel Apakuki Kurusiga said that he would investigate the matter. Military prosecutor Major Kitione Tuinaosara, however, said that whether or not to pay detained soldiers was within the discretionary prerogatives of the Commander. The same day, an application to dissolve the panel was rejected. The application, by defence lawyer Barbara Malimali, held that the panel should be dissolved as it had breached procedures in its last meeting.

He was a member of the British pop group Hear'Say. Like the other members of the group, he won his part through the talent show Popstars. Early life and career Sullivan grew up in Cardiff in a musical family with a strong choral background. He trained as a chorister, understudied for Welsh National Opera and performed in choirs. Aged 18, Sullivan toured the United States with The Black Mountain Male Chorus of Wales as a musical theatre soloist before spending two years working in Ibiza as a singer and a puppeteer with a Black Light Theatre of Prague-style show.

Assigned to Company B, 356th Infantry, he had risen to the rank of sergeant when, just days before the armistice, his regiment was halted by the enemy in its advance toward Germany at the Meuse River near the French village of Pouilly. Information relative to enemy strength and disposition on the opposite bank was vitally needed and Hatler was one of several men to volunteer.

Design and construction In 1938, the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board (ACNB) identified the need for a general purpose 'local defence vessel' capable of both anti-submarine and mine-warfare duties, while easy to construct and operate.Stevens, The Australian Corvettes, p. 1Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, p. 103 The vessel was initially envisaged as having a displacement of approximately 500 tons, a speed of at least , and a range of Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, pp. 103‚Äì4 The opportunity to build a prototype in the place of a cancelled Bar-class boom defence vessel saw the proposed design increased to a 680-ton vessel, with a top speed, and a range of , armed with a 4-inch gun, equipped with asdic, and able to fitted with either depth charges or minesweeping equipment depending on the planned operations: although closer in size to a sloop than a local defence vessel, the resulting increased capabilities were accepted due to advantages over British-designed mine warfare and anti-submarine vessels.Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, pp. 103‚Äì5 Construction of the prototype did not go ahead, but the plans were retained.Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, p. 104 The need for locally built 'all-rounder' vessels at the start of World War II saw the \\"Australian Minesweepers\\" (designated as such to hide their anti-submarine capability, but popularly referred to as \\"corvettes\\") approved in September 1939, with 60 constructed during the course of the war: 36 ordered by the RAN, 20 (including Cairns) ordered by the British Admiralty but manned and commissioned as RAN vessels, and 4 for the Royal Indian Navy.Stevens, A Critical Vulnerability, pp. 105, 148Donohue, From Empire Defence to the Long Haul, p. 29Stevens et al., The Royal Australian Navy, p. 108 Cairns was laid down by Walkers Limited at Maryborough, Queensland on 31 March 1941. She was launched on 7 October 1941 by Mrs. R. D. Walker, wife of the Works Manager of Walkers Limited, and commissioned into the RAN on 11 May 1942. Operational history =Royal Australian Navy= From entering service until 16 October 1942, Cairns was based in Fremantle and operated as a convoy escort, anti- submarine patroller, and minesweeper. On 16 October, the corvette was reassigned to the British Eastern Fleet and ordered to Kilindini, Kenya, arriving on 14 November. Cairns remained with the Eastern Fleet until January 1945. Most of this time was spent on patrol or escort duties in the Indian Ocean. The corvette was reassigned to the Mediterranean from June until September 1943. During this time, Cairns was involved in the Allied invasion of Sicily. On 11 February 1944, a convoy Cairns was assigned to was attacked by Japanese submarine RO-110. The corvette was involved in the successful destruction of the submarine, but one convoy ship was torpedoed. Following a refit in Adelaide from May to July 1944, Cairns was redeployed to Colombo, which was her base of operations until January 1945, when the corvette was sent back to Australia. On arrival in Australian waters, Cairns was assigned to the British Pacific Fleet. The ship received four battle honours for her wartime service: \\"Pacific 1942‚Äì45\\", \\"Indian Ocean 1942‚Äì45\\", \\"Sicily 1943\\", and \\"Okinawa 1945\\". =Royal Netherlands Navy= Following the end of World War II, all Admiralty-owned Bathurst class corvettes were disposed of. Cairns was paid off in Brisbane on 17 January 1946. She was immediately recommissioned into the Royal Netherlands Navy (RNLN) and renamed HNLMS Ambon. =Indonesian Navy= Following four years of service with the RNLN, the ship was transferred to the Indonesian Navy on 6 April 1950 and renamed KRI Banteng. Fate The corvette was broken up for scrap in April 1968.

He played in three Test matches for England in 1948 and 1949. He played first-class cricket for Cambridge University (1934‚Äì1936), Surrey (1934), Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) (1935‚Äì1953), Sussex (1937‚Äì1954) and England (1948‚Äì1949). Life and career Griffith was born in Wandsworth, London, and educated at Dulwich College and Pembroke College, Cambridge.GRIFFITH, Stewart Cathie, Who Was Who, A & C Black, 1920‚Äì2016 (online edition, Oxford University Press, 2014) He scored over 1,200 runs during four years in the 1st XI at Dulwich, despite being in the shadow of Hugh Bartlett, and he became a capable wicket-keeper. He won his blue in his second year at Cambridge. He toured Australia and New Zealand with the MCC under Errol Holmes's captaincy in 1935-36. He lost his Cambridge place to Paul Gibb in 1937. After graduating from Cambridge, he returned to Dulwich as cricket master and he became the first choice wicket- keeper for Sussex in 1939. He was commissioned into the Officers' Training Corps in 1938, and transferred to the Royal Army Service Corps in 1939. He later served in the Glider Pilot Regiment with Hugh Bartlett. As second-in- command he carried the commander of the 6th Airborne Divisioj, Major-General Richard \\"Windy\\" Gale (coincidentally, he was also from Wandsworth), into Normandy during Operation Overlord, crash landing after being caught in a storm. He took part in the Battle of Arnhem and won the Distinguished Flying Cross. He remained in the Territorial Army (TA) after the war, reaching the rank of lieutenant colonel. He was appointed captain-secretary of Sussex in 1946. Although he relinquished the captaincy after one year, his wicket- keeping form earned him selection for the MCC tour of the West Indies in 1947‚Äì48. On his Test debut he was used as a makeshift opener as three senior batsmen were ill, and made 140 in six hours. It made him the only England player to make his maiden first-class century on his Test debut. He toured South Africa (under F.G. Mann) in 1948‚Äì49 and played in the final two Tests, the only wicket-keeper to be preferred to Godfrey Evans between 1946 and 1959 when he was available to play. On his return, he retired from playing cricket to take up an appointment as the cricket correspondent of The Sunday Times. After two years in this role, he was appointed by the MCC in 1952 as one of two assistant secretaries to Ronnie Aird at Lord's. He succeeded Aird as the Secretary of the MCC in 1962, and he oversaw the abolition of amateur status, the introduction of one-day cricket, the creation of the Test and County Cricket Board, the Cricket Council, and the \\"D'Oliveira Affair\\". His busy schedule in 1962‚Äì63 prevented him from managing the MCC tour of Australia in 1962‚Äì63, except for one month when he flew out to relieve the Duke of Norfolk. Aware of M.J.K. Smith's natural caution on the MCC tour of Australia in 1965‚Äì66, Griffith was given extraordinary powers granting him overall control of cricket while managing the tour. He did not resort to these powers as he preferred more diplomatic means, but he urged attacking cricket in the tour games, notably against Western Australia. Smith asked him when he should declare, Griffith said \\"Now!\\" and the MCC won by nine runs in the last minute. The deadpan Smith observed \\"that's the last time I take the ruddy manager's advice on a declaration\\".p132, E.W. Swanton, Swanton in Australia with MCC 1946‚Äì1975, Fontana, 1977 He retired in 1974, and he later served as Chairman of the Friends of Arundel Castle Cricket Club. His son, Mike Griffith, also captained Sussex. Billy Griffith died in Felpham, West Sussex, following a long illness in 1993, aged 78.

The company is a division of Woolworths Group and as at 2019 operated 182 stores, with around 22,000 employees across Australia and Asia. BIG W stocks clothing, health and beauty, garden, pet items, books, DVDs, CDs, some furniture items, snack food and small electrical household appliances. History Woolworths Limited developed the BIG W brand to provide Australian shoppers with a broad range of general merchandise products in a dedicated one-stop-shop. The BIG W chain grew out of Woolworths Limited's original Variety stores, which carried a small range of general merchandise products. The first BIG W department store opened in 1964 at Jesmond, New South Wales. BIG W's name reflects the complementary relationship it has with Woolworths Supermarkets and the W does stand for Woolworths, initial adopted from Woolworths original name of Woolworths bargain basement warehouse. The separation of BIG W and Woolworths supermarkets was largely completed by 1989, although a few Woolworths Variety stores continued to operate into the 90s (such as the one in Rundle Mall, Adelaide). Services =Previous= In 2007, BIG W began trialling optometry services in South Australia and since then, these services have been added to selected stores in Queensland, Victoria, New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory. In May, 2019, BIG W announced the closure of all 41 BIG W Optometry stores, along with 175 job losses. This would not affect the BIG W store that housed the optometry department, and that the last optometry sessions could be held in late July. As of August 2019, all optometry stores have closed, leaving separate stores to be leased or stores within the BIG W store to be used as space for another department. =Current= BIG W were the second company in Australia to use self-checkouts, which were introduced in 2003 on a trial basis in two of Sydney's major stores and began expanding throughout Australia in late 2005. In August 2014, BIG W launched its first party store at Rouse Hill in New South Wales and its second at the newly refurbished Macquarie Centre at North Ryde in New South Wales.

The type, and only species is Olorotitan arharensis. It was one of the last non- avian dinosaurs and it went extinct during the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene extinction event. Discovery and naming Fossils of the holotype specimen in situ The holotype specimen of Olorotitan, consisting of a nearly complete skeleton, was discovered in field work in the Udurchukan Formation of Kundur in the Amur region of Russia between 1999 and 2001. Pascal Godefroit and colleagues described and named it as a new species in 2003. It was the first nearly complete dinosaur specimen to be described from Russia, and is the most complete lambeosaurine skeleton discovered anywhere outside of western North America. Large numbers of fragmentary dinosaur, turtle, and crocodilian specimens were found in the several hundred square metre area around the discovery site. Similarly aged localities in Blagoveschensk, also from the Udurchukan Formation and Jiayin, on the Chinese side of the Amur River, have yielded similarly high numbers of lambeosaurine fossils. The generic name Olorotitan means \\"titanic swan\\", while the specific descriptor arharensis refers to the location of the fossil find at Arhara County. Description Skull reconstruction. Olorotitan arharensis is based on the most complete lambeosaurine skeleton found outside North America to date. It was a large hadrosaurid, comparable to other large lambeosaurines like Parasaurolophus cyrtocristatus, and may have grown up to long and 3.1 tonnes (3.4 short tons) according to Paul. In 2012 Thomas Holtz gave a higher estimation at 12 metres (39.4 feet). It is characterized by the large hatchet-like hollow crest adorning its skull, very distinct from the crests of all of its North American relatives. Life restoration The skull itself was supported by a rather elongated neck, having eighteen vertebrae, exceeding the previous hadrosaurid maximum of fifteen. The sacrum, with 15 or 16 vertebrae, has at least 3 more vertebrae than other hadrosaurids. Further along the vertebral series, in the proximal third of the tail, there are articulations between the tips of the neural spines, making that caudal area particularly rigid; the regularity of these connections suggests that they are not due to a pathology, although more specimens are needed to be certain. Godefroit and his coauthors found through a phylogenetic analysis that it was closest to Corythosaurus and Hypacrosaurus. Palaeobiology Skeletal reconstruction of Olorotitan; on the bottom, preserved bones of the holotype, AEHM 2/845 (left) and referred specimen AEHM 2/846 (right) are shown in white As a hadrosaurid, Olorotitan would have been a bipedal/quadrupedal herbivore, eating plants with a sophisticated skull that permitted a grinding motion analogous to chewing, and was furnished with hundreds of continually-replaced teeth. Its tall, broad hollow crest, formed out of expanded skull bones containing the nasal passages, probably functioned in identification by sight and sound. Palaeoecology Restoration of Olorotitan and Charonosaurus in their environment O. arharensis shared its time and place with several other types of animal, including two other lambeosaurines: the Parasaurolophus-like Charonosaurus and more basal Amurosaurus. Additionally, remains from turtles, crocodilians, theropods, and nodosaurids were found at its discovery site, and the Saurolophus-like hadrosaurine Kerberosaurus is also known from roughly contemporaneous rocks in the area. Unlike the situation in North America, where lambeosaurines are virtually absent from Late Maastrichtian rocks, Asian lambeosaurines are diverse and common at the end of the Mesozoic, suggesting climatic or ecological differences.

He ruled as regent during the reigns of the emperors Sun Liang and Sun Xiu. His conflict with Sun Liang eventually led him to depose the emperor in favour of Sun Xiu. However, he was subsequently killed by Sun Xiu in a coup. As a regent Sun Chen and his predecessor Sun Jun were cousins; both were great-grandsons of the founding emperor Sun Quan's uncle Sun Jing. Very little is known about his career up to Sun Jun's sudden illness in 256, when the latter chose to transfer his power to Sun Chen. Sun Jun died soon thereafter, and Sun Chen became regent. The general L√º Ju was angry at the development (as Sun Jun was already resented for his dictatorial style and lack of accomplishments), and, in conjunction with the minister Teng Yin, he attempted to overthrow Sun Chen. Sun Chen struck back militarily, and his forces defeated Teng Yin and L√º Ju. Teng Yin and his clan were executed while L√º Ju committed suicide. In the light of his defeat of Teng Yin and L√º Ju, Sun Chen began to become extremely arrogant.Sanguozhi, ch. 64, p. 1446 In 257, at the age of 14, Sun Liang began to personally handle some important matters of state. He established a personal guard corps, consistent of young men and officers with age similar to his, stating that he intended to grow up with them. He also sometimes questioned Sun Chen's decisions. Sun Chen began to be somewhat apprehensive of the young emperor.Sanguozhi, p. 1448 Third Rebellion in Shouchun Later that year, Cao Wei's general Zhuge Dan, believing that the Wei regent Sima Zhao was about to usurp the throne, declared a rebellion and requested Wu assistance. A small Wu detachment, led by Wen Qin, himself a former Wei general who had defected to Wu, quickly arrived to assist him, but Sun Chen led the main forces and chose to camp a long distance away from Shouchun, where Zhuge Dan was being besieged by Sima Zhao, and did nothing. When Sun Chen instead ordered the general Zhu Yi to try to relieve Shouchun with tired and unfed troops, Zhu refused ‚Äî and Sun Chen executed him, bringing anger from the people, who had admired Zhu's military skills and integrity. With Sun Chen unable to do anything, Zhuge Dan's rebellion failed in 258, and Wen Qin's troops became captives of Wei.Sanguozhi, p. 1447 Sun Chen knew that the people and the young emperor were both angry at him, and chose not to return to Jianye, but instead sent his confidants to be in charge of the capital's defences. Sun Liang became angrier, and plotted with his sister Sun Luban, the general Liu Cheng (Âäâ‰∏û/ÂäâÊâø), his father-in-law Quan Shang (ÂÖ®Â∞ö), and his brother-in-law Quan Ji (ÂÖ®Ë®ò), to have Sun Chen overthrown. However, Quan Shang did not keep the plot secret from his wife, who was Sun Chen's cousin, and she told Sun Chen. Sun Chen quickly captured Quan Shang and killed Liu Cheng, and then surrounded the palace and forced the other officials to agree to depose Sun Liang ‚Äî falsely declaring to the people that Sun Liang had suffered psychosis. Sun Liang was demoted to the status of a prince, \\"Prince of Kuaiji\\".Sanguozhi, p. 1448 Downfall and death Sun Chen then chose Sun Liang's elder brother Sun Xiu, the Prince of Langye, as the new emperor. Sun Xiu, in order to appease Sun Chen, added five counties to his fief and created his brothers marquises as well. However, Sun Chen soon had a fallout with the new emperor over a relatively small incident ‚Äî Sun Chen had brought beef and wine to the palace, intending to feast with the emperor, but Sun Xiu refused the offering, and so Sun Chen took the food and wine to the house of the general Zhang Bu. He expressed to Zhang Bu his disappointment at Sun Xiu's refusal ‚Äî including a remark that perhaps he should choose another emperor ‚Äî and Zhang Bu reported Sun Chen's complaints to Sun Xiu. Sun Xiu became concerned about Sun Chen, but continued to outwardly show favour to Sun Chen. Sun Chen became concerned about his standing with the emperor and offered to leave the capital Jianye (present-day Nanjing) to head up the defence of the secondary capital Wuchang (in present-day Ezhou, Hubei). Sun Xiu approved.Sanguozhi, p. 1450 However, Sun Xiu then became concerned that Sun Chen would take over that city and rebel. He conspired with Zhang Bu and the senior general Ding Feng to kill Sun Chen during the Laba Festival. Somehow, the news leaked, but Sun Chen, even though apprehensive, unable to decline the messengers Sun Xiu sent to invite him, showed up at the festival anyway, considering that he might leave under the excuse that his mansion had caught fire. But he failed to leave and was seized by Ding Feng and Zhang Bu's soldiers. Sun Chen begged Sun Xiu for his life, offering to be exiled to Jiao Province (present-day northern Vietnam) or to become a slave, but Sun Xiu declined ‚Äî stating to Sun Chen that he did not give Teng Yin or L√º Ju those choices. Sun Chen was executed, along with members of his clan. Furthermore, Sun Xiu felt so shameful to share the clan of Sun Jun and Sun Chen that he had them posthumously banished from the Sun family, referring them as Gu Jun (ÊïÖÂ≥ª) and Gu Chen (ÊïÖÁ∂ù) instead.Sanguozhi, p. 1451 See also * Lists of people of the Three Kingdoms Notes References * Category:232 births Category:259 deaths Category:Eastern Wu regents Category:Executed Eastern Wu people Category:People executed by Eastern Wu Category:Executed Three Kingdoms people Category:Eastern Wu generals Category:People executed by a Three Kingdoms state by decapitation Category:3rd-century executions ","title":"Sun Chen"},{"id":"3428013","text":"A Piece of Strange is the third studio album by the Southern hip hop trio CunninLynguists, consisting of Kno, Deacon the Villain and Natti.

Leverstock Green is a suburb in Hemel Hempstead, in the English county of Hertfordshire. It is located on the eastern edge of the town. Leverstock Green contains a village school (Leverstock Green Church of England Primary School), village cricket club, village football club (Leverstock Green FC), village hall, village shops, village pubs and Holy Trinity church. Despite its recent amalgamation with Hemel Hempstead, the old names remain in memory of historical times. Leverstock Green is a \\"modern\\" parish, formed about 1849 from parts of the parishes of St Michael's (St Albans), Abbots Langley and Hemel Hempstead. There is documentary and archaeological evidence that people lived and worked in the immediate area of Leverstock Green from the time of the Roman occupation onwards. Recent research indicates that settlement along Westwick Row may well date back even further to the Iron Age and perhaps the Bronze Age. It seems quite likely that this settlement was a \\"suburb\\" of the major Iron Age settlement at Pre Wood just outside St. Albans. Leverstock Green was and is still affected by the 2005 Buncefield oil depot explosion (the largest explosion in peacetime Europe), causing damage to houses and other buildings, such as broken windows, fallen chimneys and in some cases more serious structural damage, temporarily displacing a number of families. The village is a growing village, with a location close to an industrial estate from which many large companies operate. Easy access to the M1 and M25 motorways, Watford and St Albans make the village popular for commuters. The village introduced a village patrol scheme in late August 2008 successfully reducing a rise in litter and graffiti in the area.

He is a member of Celtic's Lisbon Lions, which won the 1967 European Cup Final. As a player, he made more than 200 appearances in the Scottish League playing for Celtic, Dumbarton and Hibernian, and more than 100 in the Football League in England with Birmingham City. He also earned three caps for Scotland early in his career. He is also well known as a former manager at Partick Thistle, where he spent six seasons and is still held in high regard, being appointed to the club's hall of fame. He also had managerial stints at Hibernian, Hamilton Academical and Dumbarton.  Early life and playing career Auld was born in Maryhill, Glasgow. He first joined Celtic in March 1955 from local side Maryhill Harp, where he was converted from a fullback into a winger. However, his headstrong character and poor discipline impeded his progress and after spending a season on loan to Dumbarton, he was sold to Birmingham City in 1961 for ¬£15,000. With the Midlands club he won a League Cup medal in 1963,'I was on ¬£18 a week. I'd doubled my wage', The Independent, 26 February 2011 as well as appearing in the final of the 1960‚Äì61 Inter- Cities Fairs Cup, in which Birmingham were beaten 4‚Äì2 on aggregate by A.S. Roma. In 1965 Auld returned to Celtic in a ¬£12,000 deal, possibly on the initiative of Jock Stein, who had not yet been appointed Celtic manager. No longer considered a winger, Auld formed a midfield partnership with Bobby Murdoch. He became an integral part of the side that won nine League titles, as well as the 1967 European Cup Final. Prior to that match, against Italian giants Internazionale, Auld instigated a rendition of The Celtic Song in the tunnel, much to the bemusement of the Inter players. Auld left Celtic again in 1971 this time joining Hibernian on a free transfer. While at Easter Road he combined his playing role with one as a trainer, eventually focusing solely on the latter role. Management He started a career as a manager in 1974, when appointed by Partick Thistle, where he would stay for six seasons. He returned to Edinburgh as Hibs manager in 1980, in an attempt to revive the club following their relegation in the 1979‚Äì80 season. Auld guided Hibs to promotion by winning the 1980-81 Scottish First Division, but was replaced by Pat Stanton in 1982.

He composed music for over 120 films, including Grand Canary and Woman on the Run. Lange shared an Oscar nomination with Hugo Friedhofer for the film The Woman in the Window. He was nominated four times for Oscars, but did not win any. Life and career In the 1910s, Lange was active as a songwriter, collaborating frequently with lyricist Andrew B. Sterling and publishing with the Joe Morris Music Company. During the first half of the 1920s Lange recorded abundantly for Cameo Records. His 1923 orchestra, which also played the Cinderella Ballroom on Broadway and which included \\"hot\\" trumpeters Earl Oliver and Tommy Gott, was at the end of that year bought by young well-to-do bandleader Roger Wolfe Kahn, and it is not known whether the recordings Lange made after this point and up to 1926 were still made by these musicians (Kahn himself did not start recording under his own name for Victor Records until March 1925) or by another group. His 1928 recordings for Path√© Records were, however, almost certainly made by other unknown personnel. Though Lange himself played both piano and banjo he seems (with the exception of a recording by his \\"Lange trio\\" in 1922) to have acted only as conductor and arranger on his band recording dates. Census records show that Lange shared a residence in the Hollywood Hills in 1930 with Ray Heindorf, who would go on to win three Academy Awards. Lange was a prolific arranger of dance band orchestrations during the 1920s. His \\"stock\\" orchestrations were in use by many bands of the day. Lange wrote \\"Arranging for the Modern Dance Orchestra\\" which was the definitive work of its day (published Robbins Music, 1926). Selected Songs * with Andrew B.

The painting's authenticity has been disputed, but it is well attested in the collection of Marchese Vincenzo Giustiniani and his brother Cardinal Benedetto Giustiniani, its dimensions being virtually identical with those of a Caravaggio of the same subject listed in the Giustiniani inventory. In addition the model for St Peter (the reclining figure) appears identical with the two St Jeromes from Caravaggio's Roman period, Saint Jerome in Meditation and Saint Jerome, both around 1605-1606. The subject is the episode related in the Gospel of Matthew (Matthew 26), when Jesus and his disciples went up to the Mount of Olives outside Jerusalem on the night when Christ was arrested; Jesus goes apart to pray, and returns to find the disciples sleeping. He awakens Peter with the rebuke, \\"What, would none of you stay awake with me one hour? Stay awake, and pray that you may be spared the test, for the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.\\" Judas then arrives with the Roman soldiers, and Christ's pointing finger seems to indicate their approach. The other two figures are St John (centre) and St James. Christ on the Mount of Olives forms part of a group of works on orthodox Christian subjects painted for Cardinal Benedetto, and including The Crowning with Thorns (Vienna), The Incredulity of Saint Thomas, and paintings of Saint Jerome, St Augustine and Mary Magdalene, now lost.

Villablanca was born in Villarrica, Chile. He became interested in boxing as a child. He started visiting his local boxing gym, and had a stellar amateur career. At the age of 18, Villablanca started his career as a professional boxer, when he defeated Luis Conejeros by a decision in four rounds, on January 23, 1976, in Santiago. Villablanca obtained his first knockout during his second fight, beating Luis Arriagada in the second round on February 20, also in Santiago. After two more victories, Villablanca was defeated for the first time, when he lost an eight-round decision to Juan Ule Castro on April 30, 1977 in Chilo√©. He would lose his next fight, to Leopoldo Vargas, on May 7. After those two consecutive losses, Villablanca won one fight, then faced Vargas in a rematch, held on August 20, at Iquique. Villablanca suffered his first knockout loss, being beaten by Vargas in the seventh round. After that loss, Villablanca embarked on a four fight winning streak. The first of those bouts, held on April 7, 1978, was for the Chilean Jr. Lightweight title. Villablanca became national champion by knocking Roberto Diaz out in the first round. On January 20, 1979, Villablanca had his first fight as a professional abroad, when he faced Victor Etchegaray for the South American Jr. Lightweight championship in Bariloche, Argentina. Villablanca lost to Etchegaray, then a world ranked challenger, by knockout in round eight. Back in Chile, Villablanca retained his Chilean Jr. Lightweight title with a victory over Diaz in a rematch, on March 3, 1979, by knockout in the eighth round. Like his first victory over Diaz, this represented the beginning of another four fight winning streak for Villablanca. He faced Etchegaray for the South American Jr. Lightweight title for a second time on June 8, 1980, losing by a seventh-round knockout in San Juan, Argentina. Villablanca then embarked in an eleven fight winning streak, which included a twelve-round decision over Luis Bendezu on August 7, 1981, which made him the WBA's Fedelatin Jr. Lightweight champion. The victory over Bendezu also allowed Villablanca to become a ranked challenger in the Jr. Lightweight division. He also defeated Raul Silva, who had come off back to back losses to Eusebio Pedroza and Wilfredo G√≥mez. The win against Silva, a second-round knockout, came on December 28 of '81. This was followed by a victory over Julio Hernandez, who had also lost to G√≥mez in a WBC world Super Bantamweight championship try, by knockout in round three, on February 2, 1982. After one more win, Villablanca had his first world title try. His fight against Puerto Rico's Samuel Serrano, it could be said, was both the defining moment of Villablanca's career and one of the most controversial championship fights of the 1980s. On June 5 in Santiago, four months after his victory over Julio Hernandez, Villablanca challenged Serrano, for the WBA's world Jr. Lightweight title. Serrano started bleeding during round six, and the fight's referee declared that Serrano's cut was the product of a punch by Villablanca. When the fight was stopped in round eleven due to Serrano's cut, Villablanca was declared winner, and new WBA world Jr. Lightweight champion, by an eleventh-round knockout. For some period afterwards, Villablanca became a national hero among his countrymen and women, just like Martin Vargas had. Villablanca and his compatriots thought that Villablanca had earned Chile's first world boxing championship. Serrano's team appealed the fight's result, however, claiming that the cut on Serrano's head was caused by a headbutt, not a punch. The WBA then held an emergency meeting in Panama City, Panama, to review the fight's tapes. After studying the fight, WBA officials concluded that Serrano and his team were right and the cut was produced by a headbutt. The WBA took into account the fact that Serrano was ahead on the judges' scorecards and reversed the fight's result, giving Serrano an eleventh round technical decision win. It shall be mentioned that the WBA's ruling in this case disqualified Villablanca as world champion, so Villablanca is not, officially speaking, recognized as a former world boxing champion. After the disappointment of seeing his world champion status disappear, Villablanca returned to professional boxing with three consecutive victories, including a ten-round decision over Geronimo Luque. On August 17, 1983, Villablanca made his United States debut, when he challenged Roger Mayweather for the WBA world Jr. Lightweight title that Mayweather had earned by knocking Serrano out in eight rounds at San Juan. There would be no controversy this time around, however, as Villablanca was dropped twice before the fight ended just as the bell rang to finish round one, with Mayweather retaining the title by a first-round knockout. Villablanca announced his retirement from boxing after the fight, but he returned soon afterwards. In his first comeback fight, Villablanca faced Orlando Romero, losing a ten-round decision on January 14, 1984 in Trujillo, Peru. On May 19, he fought in Peru once again, losing in a rematch with Geronimo Luque for the WBC Continental Americas Lightweight title in Lima, by a knockout in round seven. Villablanca won his next four bouts, but, after losing on December 20, 1985 to Ricardo Toledo by a knockout in three rounds in Santiago, he retired from professional boxing for good. Villablanca had a professional record of 34 wins and 11 losses in 45 fights, with 16 wins by knockout.boxer: Benedicto Villablanca References External links * Category:1957 births Category:Living people Category:Chilean male boxers ","title":"Benedicto Villablanca"},{"id":"3428098","text":"Jamie Crooks (April 15, 1778 ‚Äì March 2, 1860) was a businessman and political figure in Upper Canada and Canada West. He was born in Kilmarnock, Scotland in 1778 and came to Fort Niagara in 1791 where his half-brother, Francis, was operating as a merchant. In 1795, Francis, James and his brother William moved to Newark (Niagara-on-the-Lake). The business expanded into supplying goods to the military, shipping, the production of beer and spirits and potash production. In 1811, they built their own schooner, the Lord Nelson. He served as a captain in the local militia. During the War of 1812, his property was destroyed and the schooner was taken over by the Americans and sank during a storm. He was never fully compensated for these losses. He fought at the Battle of Queenston Heights and later served on the jury at the Bloody Assize of 1814. In 1814, he relocated to West Flamborough Township, which was located further from the border with the United States, and set up a small industrial centre there. He became a justice of the peace and was elected to the 8th Parliament of Upper Canada representing Halton in 1820. In 1822, he became a director of the Bank of Upper Canada. He was also part of a committee tasked with improving inland navigation. By this time, he was again operating a number of ships transporting goods along the lower Great Lakes. In 1823, with William Morris, he lobbied for the recognition of the Church of Scotland as an official state church of Upper Canada. In 1825, he established the first paper mill in the province and in the next decade built mills on the Trent (at Crooks' Rapids) and Speed Rivers. In 1830, he was re-elected as a representative for Halton and, in 1831, he was appointed to the Legislative Council for the province. As a moderate Tory, he opposed the Family Compact, but also opposed responsible government. He supported union with Lower Canada, although he opposed the use of French in the legislature, and he was re- appointed to the Legislative Council for the united province. In November 1843, he was one of a group of members who walked out of the council to protest the movement of the capital from Kingston to Montreal. He died on his estate in West Flamborough Township in 1860. His son, Adam Crooks, went on to serve in the Ontario legislature, becoming attorney general and provincial treasurer.

It is used sometimes in France and Italy as an anesthetic given intravenously; it is also used in Italy to treat alcohol addiction and alcohol withdrawal syndrome. Index page Sodium oxybate is the sodium salt of Œ≥-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB). The clinical trials for narcolepsy were conducted just as abuse of GHB as a club drug and date rape drug became a matter of public concern; in 2000 GHB was made a Schedule I controlled substance, while sodium oxybate, when used under an FDA NDA or IND, was classified as a Schedule III controlled substance for medicinal use under the Controlled Substances Act, with illicit use subject to Schedule I penalties. Sodium oxybate was approved for use by the FDA to treat symptoms of narcolepsy in 2002, with a strict risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) program mandated by the FDA. The US label for sodium oxybate also has a black box warning because it is a central nervous system depressant and may cause respiratory depression, seizures, coma, or death, especially if used in combination with other CNS depressants, such as alcohol and its use may cause dependence. In Canada and the European Union (EU) it was classified as a Schedule III and a Schedule IV controlled substance, respectively. It was approved for treating symptoms of narcolepsy in Europe in 2005. Orphan Medical had developed it and was acquired by Jazz Pharmaceuticals in 2005. The drug is marketed in Europe by UCB. Jazz raised the price of the drug dramatically after it acquired Orphan, and paid a $20M fine for off-label marketing of the drug in 2007. Medical use Clinical use of sodium oxybate was introduced in Europe in 1964, as anesthetic given intravenously but it was not widely used since it sometimes caused seizures; as of 2006, it was still authorized for this use in France and Italy but not widely used. The major use of sodium oxybate is in treating two of the symptoms of narcolepsy - cataplexy (sudden muscle weakness) and excessive daytime sleepiness. Reviews of sodium oxybate concluded that it is well tolerated and associated with \\"significant reductions in cataplexy and daytime sleepiness,\\" and that its effectiveness \\"in treating major, clinically relevant narcolepsy symptoms and sleep architecture abnormalities\\" has been established. However, because of the risks of abuse associated with this medication, it is available in the US only through a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) program mandated by the FDA. The program requires that providers who prescribe it are certified to do so, that it is dispensed only from a central pharmacy that is certified to do so, and people to whom it is prescribed must be enrolled in a program for the drug and must document that they are using the drug safely. In more recent times, investigations of its use in dealing with alcohol withdrawal syndrome have begun. These started in Italy, where its use in treating alcohol addiction was also explored; the evidence for these uses is weak but growing and it has also been approved for use in Austria. There is insufficient evidence to make a definitive comparison with clomethiazole or benzodiazepine- based treatment approaches, though some data suggest it may be \\"better than naltrexone and disulfiram regarding abstinence maintenance and prevention of craving in the medium term i.e. 3-12 months.\\" In a 2014 review, Gillian Keating described sodium oxybate as a \\"useful option for the treatment of alcohol withdrawal syndrome and for the maintenance of abstinence in alcohol dependence.\\" However, a 2018 review recognised the evidence for its efficacy but noted safety concerns and concluded that \\"studies are still limited and investigations including a larger number of patients are needed.\\" Pregnant women should not take it, and women should not become pregnant while taking it. It is excreted in breast milk and should not be used by breast feeding mothers. Adverse effects The US label for sodium oxybate has a black box warning because it is a central nervous system depressant (CNS depressant) and for its potential for abuse. Other potential adverse side effects include respiratory depression, seizures, coma, and death, especially when it is taken in combination with other CNS depressants such as alcohol. Cases of severe dependence and cravings have been reported with excessive and illicit use of this medication. GHB, the protonated (acidic) form of this salt, has been used to commit drug-facilitated sexual assault and date rape, though the illicit form of GHB typically has different characteristics from pharmaceutical-grade sodium oxybate. It causes dizziness, nausea, and headache in 10% to 20% of people who take it; nausea is more common in women than men. Between 1% and 10% of people experience nasal congestion, runny nose, or sore throat, loss of appetite, distorted sense of taste, cataplexy, weakness, nervousness or anxiety, depressed mood, nightmares or abnormal dreams, sleep paralysis, sleepwalking, or other sleep disturbances including insomnia, sleepiness or sedation, falls, vertigo, tremor, balance disorder, cognitive issues including disturbance in attention, confusion or disorientation, numbed sense of touch, tingling, blurred vision, heart palpitations, high blood pressure, shortness of breath, snoring, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach pain, excessive sweating, rashes, joint pain, muscle pain, back pain, muscle spasms, bedwetting, urinary incontinence, and swelling of the limbs. Overdose Reports of overdose in medical literature are generally from abuse, and often involve other drugs as well. Symptoms include vomiting, excessive sweating, periods of stopped breathing, seizures, agitation, loss of psychomotor skills, and coma. Overdose can lead to death due to respiratory depression. People who overdose may die from asphyxiation from their own vomit. People that have overdosed or suspected of overdosing may need to be made to vomit, be intubated, or/and put on a ventilator. Interactions It should not be used with other drugs that are CNS depressants like alcohol or sedatives. Use with divalproex results in about a 25% increase in the availability of sodium oxybate. Pharmacology The mechanism of action of sodium oxybate is unknown. GHB is a normal metabolite of GABA that interacts with the GABAB receptor. It is rapidly absorbed and is about 88% bioavailable; very little is bound to plasma protein. The average time to peak plasma concentration ranges from 0.5 to 1.25 hours. Very little of the drug is excreted; instead, it is mostly metabolized through several steps into carbon dioxide and water. Chemistry Sodium oxybate is the sodium salt of Œ≥-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB). Its systematic chemical name is sodium 4-hydroxybutanoate, though synonyms like sodium Œ≥-hydroxybutyrate are commonly used. Its condensed structural formula is (molecular formula: ) and its molar mass is 126.09 g mol‚àí1. It is highly hydrophilic. Treating the salt with acid allows the carboxylic acid form of the compound, which is GHB, to be recovered. History Alcover sold in Italy for therapeutic use. Alexander Zaytsev worked on this chemical family and published work on it in 1874. The first extended research into GHB and its use in humans was conducted in the early 1960s by Dr. Henri Laborit to use in studying the neurotransmitter GABA. It was studied in a range of uses including obstetric surgery and during childbirth and as an anxiolytic; there were anecdotal reports of it having antidepressant and aphrodisiac effects as well. It was also studied as an intraveuous anesthetic agent and was marketed for that purpose starting in 1964 in Europe but it was not widely adopted as it caused seizures; as of 2006 that use was still authorized in France and Italy but not widely used. GHB was also studied to treat alcohol addiction and for use in narcolepsy from the 1960s onwards. In May 1990 GHB was introduced as a dietary supplement and was marketed to body builders, for help with weight control and as a sleep aid, and as a \\"replacement\\" for L-tryptophan, which was removed from the market in November 1989 when batches of it were found to cause eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. By November of that year 57 cases of illness caused by the GHB supplements had been reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, with people having taken up to three teaspoons of GHB; there were no deaths but nine people needed care in an intensive care unit. The FDA issued a warning in November 1990 that sale of GHB was illegal. GHB continued to be manufactured and sold illegally and it and analogs were adopted as a club drug and came to be used as a date rape drug. The DEA made seizures and the FDA reissued warnings several times throughout the 1990s. At the same time, research on the use of GHB in the form of sodium oxybate had formalized, as a company called Orphan Medical Inc. had filed an investigational new drug application and was running clinical trials with the intention of gaining regulatory approval for use to treat narcolepsy. In 1996 Orphan contracted with Lonza Group, a contract manufacturer for supply of the drug. In 2000 the Hillory J. Farias and Samantha Reid Date-Rape Prevention Act of 2000 was signed into law in the US, which made GHB on Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act, but sodium oxybate, when used under an IND or NDA from the US FDA, was considered a Schedule III substance but with Schedule I trafficking penalties. It was approved by the FDA in 2002 under the trade name Xyrem with a strict risk control strategy to prevent drug diversion and control the risk of abuse by people to whom it was prescribed. Orphan Medical licensed the right to market the drug in Europe to Celltech in 2003. Form S-1/A Index page In 2004 Celltech was acquired by UCB and in 2005 Jazz Pharmaceuticals acquired Orphan Medical. In January 2007 Valeant announced that Jazz had licensed rights to market Xyrem in Canada to Valeant. In July 2007 Jazz and their subsidiary Orphan Medical pleaded guilty to a criminal charge of felony misbranding in their marketing of sodium oxybate; they also settled a civil suit at the same time. The matter had been raised by a former sales representative who filed a qui tam case against the company under the False Claims Act. Sales representatives had made sales calls to doctors who did not treat people with narcolepsy and told them about potential uses for the drug including fatigue, insomnia, chronic pain, weight loss, depression, bipolar disorders, and movement disorders like Parkinson‚Äôs Disease, and downplayed the risks described in the label's black box warning. A sales manager who had been involved in the illegal marketing scheme had previously pleaded guilty and a psychiatrist who promoted the drug had previously been charged. Jazz paid $20M in total and agreed to a corporate integrity agreement and to implement internal reforms. The FDA sent Jazz an FDA warning letter about safety violations in September 2007. In 2010 the FDA rejected Jazz' New Drug Application for use of sodium oxybate in fibromyalgia. In October 2011, the FDA sent Jazz another FDA warning letter for failing to collect, evaluate, and promptly report adverse effects to the FDA after it started marketing the drug. It sent another letter in 2013 saying that the problems described in the 2011 letter appeared to be resolved. In January 2017 the FDA approved the first generic sodium oxybate product for narcolepsy symptoms, which is also subject to the same REMS program conditions as the original. By April 2017 7 companies had filed ANDAs with the FDA to market generic versions of Xyrem and Jazz had filed patent infringement cases against them. Hikma Pharmaceuticals had been the first company to file an ANDA and Jazz settled with them in April 2017; under the agreement Hikma could begin selling an authorized generic in 2023 under Jazz' REMS, and would have five years of exclusivity, however, those conditions could change if Jazz' patents were invalidated. In 2017, Jazz and Valeant terminated the agreement under which Valeant marketed Xyrem in Canada. Society and culture =Regulation= In the US, GHB is a Schedule I controlled substance, while sodium oxybate, when used under an FDA NDA or IND, was classified as a Schedule III controlled substance for medicinal use under the Controlled Substances Act, with illicit use subject to Schedule I penalties. In Canada and the European Union (EU), as of 2009 it was classified as a Schedule III and a Schedule IV controlled substance, respectively. =Cost= In the US, the cost (as of Q3 2015) of Xyrem is $5,468.09 per 180 mL bottle (500 mg/mL)(a 10 to 15-day supply) As of 2017 the cost of sodium oxybate in the UK was ¬£540.00 to ¬£1,080.00 for a thirty day supply, which at typical doses is ¬£6,500 to ¬£13,100 per year. Jazz Pharmaceuticals raised the price of Xyrem 841% earning a total of $569 million in 2013 and representing more than 50% of Jazz Pharmaceutical's revenues. In 2007 it cost $2.04; by 2014 it cost $19.40 per 1-milliliter dose. Jazz offers copay assistance to help patients access the expensive drug. According to DRX, a drug-data report published by Bloomberg, Jazz Pharmaceuticals price increase on Xyrem topped the list of price hikes in 2014. Historically, orphan drugs cost more than other drugs and have received special treatment since the enactment of the U.S. Orphan Drug Act of 1983. However, these steep price increases of orphan and other specialty drugs has come under scrutiny. The average cost of a specialty drug in the US was $65,000 annually in June 2013 (about $5,416 a month). The price of Xyrem in the US has inflated by an average of 40% annually since it became available as a prescription. In European Union (EU) countries, the government either provides national health insurance (as in the UK and Italy) or strictly regulates quasi-private social insurance funds (as in Germany, France, and the Netherlands). These government agencies are the sole purchaser (or regulator) of medical goods and services and have the power to set prices. The cost of pharmaceuticals, including sodium oxybate, tends to be lower in these countries. NHS England authorises and pays for sodium oxybate by means of individual funding requests on the basis of exceptional circumstances. The British Department of Health pays for the medication for 80 patients who are taking legal action over problems linked to the use of the swine flu vaccine Pandemrix at a cost of ¬£12,000 a year. As of 2016 there were many areas in the UK where NHS did not pay for it. In May 2016 they were ordered by the High Court to provide funding to treat a teenager with severe narcolepsy. The judge criticised their ‚Äúthoroughly bad decision‚Äù and ‚Äúabsurd‚Äù policy discriminating against the girl when hundreds of other NHS patients already receive the drug. Names Sodium oxybate is the common name for the chemical; it has no international nonproprietary name (INN). Linked from EMA index page for EMEA 000593 As of April 2018 sodium oxybarate was sold under the following brands: Alcover (Italy), Gamma-OH (France), Natrii oxybutyras Kalceks (Latvia), Somsanit (Germany), Xyrem (many countries by Jazz and UCB). Research Sodium oxybate needs to be given during the night; as of 2017 research was ongoing to create formulations that would last through the night. Jazz has been developing JZP-386, a deuterated analog of sodium oxybate. The company presented Phase I results in 2015, stating that deuterium-related effects made it necessary to do further formulation work as part of the drug's development.

Early career and education A native of Rochester, Minnesota, Mallon began producing television and comedy movies while still in high school, and continued while attending the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. Mallon also produced and directed programs for CBS and PBS affiliates WISC-TV and WHA-TV in Madison and made his feature film debut in 1987 with Blood Hook, distributed worldwide by Troma, Inc. Mystery Science Theater 3000 In 1986, Mallon became the production manager of a new independent UHF television station, KTMA, in Minneapolis. There Mallon hired future MST3K cohort, Kevin Murphy. In 1988, Mallon met series creator Joel Hodgson and Mystery Science Theater 3000 was born. As MST3K began to gain national attention, Mallon and Hodgson began to disagree on the future of the series. Hodgson said in a 1999 interview with The A.V. Club that the reason he left the series was due to creative infighting between him and Mallon, presumably over the possibility of a movie based on the series. As a result, Mallon ended up with majority ownership of the program. Mallon later directed Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Movie, released by Gramercy Pictures on April 19, 1996.

In 1840 she took part in the bombardment of Acre, and in 1843 was part of the Royal Navy squadron stationed in the River Plate during the Uruguayan Civil War. She was converted to a troopship and in 1858 assisted in the laying of the first transatlantic telegraph cable. She was sold for breaking in 1864. Design and construction Gorgon was designed by Sir William Symonds and was the first vessel to be fitted with direct-acting engines. She was teak built with oak main beams, had a displacement of , and her paddle wheels were in diameter. She was laid down at Pembroke Royal Dockyard in July 1836 and launched on 31 August 1837. =Engines= Gorgon's had two engines of 160 horse power each, built by Seaward and Company. It were direct-acting engines, and as such they were a novel construction remarkable for compactness, strength and lightness. It placed the crankshaft directly above the center line of the cylinders and these were connected to the shaft by means of a simple connecting rod. The absence of the usual cast-iron framing, sway-beams, side-rods and crossheads saved upwards of 60 tons in weight. The absence of the sway beams and cross-head also meant that the vibration of the engines was deemed barely perceptible. The space occupied by the machined was little over half that of side-lever engines of the same power. For producing steam the Gorgon had four copper boilers. These stood in pairs, and back to back, but nevertheless quite detached from each other. These could be used independently, allowing repairs to be made to some while others were in use. There were 12 fire places and two stoke-holes. The engine room measured 62 feet from the after-bulk-head to the fore bulk-head. The coal boxes of the Gorgon reached along the whole engine room and were 8 feet wide on average. They allowed for storage of 400 tons of coals, or 16 days steaming. =Armament= Gorgon would serve with a limited armament of 6 heavy guns, but this was not according to design. The original design was for her to have a gun deck with 12 32 pdrs 56cwt, 4 more 32 pdrs 56cwt on the upper deck, and two 10 inch 96 pdrs on swivel beds fore and aft. After Gorgon was launched and equipped, it proved that she was so deep into the water that it was necessary to permanently close the ports meant for the guns on the gun deck. In 1847 the Gorgon had on the upper deck: 1 68 pounder 90 cwt, 1 10 inch gun 85 cwt, and 4 32-pounders 42 cwt gun C. On the main deck it was to have 1 32-pounder 56 cwt. Note that the 32 pounders 42 cwt Gun C (first tried in 1838) used on the superstructure was significantly lighter than that of 56 cwt, and there was now supposed to be one gun of 56 cwt on the main deck.  Service  The Niagara, Valorous, Gorgon (misspelt Gordon) and Agamemnon laying the Transatlantic telegraph cable at mid-ocean in 1858 In 1840 Gorgon saw action with three other paddle sloops, , and , in the bombardment of the city of Acre under the command of Admiral Robert Stopford. At the height of the battle either Gorgon or her sister ship fired the shell that destroyed Acre's powder magazine, causing an explosion that greatly weakened the city's defences.Kahanov 2014, p.152. In 1843, during the Uruguayan Civil War, Gorgon arrived in the River Plate to join the Royal Navy squadron commanded by Commodore John Purvis. She anchored in the bay as a deterrent to potential attackers. She ran aground in the River Plate on 10 May 1844 but was subsequently refloated. From 23 February 1854 to 8 May 1854 Gorgon was commanded by Commander (and Captain) Arthur Cumming. On 15 February 1855, she assisted in the refloating of , which had run aground at Gibraltar on 23 January. On 23 July, she collided with the Prussian barque Mentor in the English Channel off Beachy Head, Sussex. Mentor was severely damaged; she was towed in to The Downs in a waterlogged condition. From August 1856-June 1857 HMS Gorgon was at Boudroum (modern Bodrum) under Captain George William Towsey, commissioned to transport the finds from Sir Charles Thomas Newton's excavation at the Mausoleum of Halikarnassos to the British Museum.Journals and letters of Sir Charles Thomas Newton, British Museum library In 1858 Gorgon assisted in the laying of the first transatlantic telegraph cable by taking soundings for the former warship HMS Agamemnon, which had been converted into a cable ship. When the cable link was completed to New York, the crew of the Gorgon and the other ships were feted by civic receptions and processions through the city.The Times of London, Monday, 20 September 1858, p.7 Gorgon was despatched to Madagascar in 1863 to keep the peace on the death of King Radama II.The Times (London), Wednesday, 3 February 1864, p.9 She returned via the Cape of Good Hope, arriving at Spithead on 29 January 1864. She discharged her ammunition and guns at the Royal Arsenal, was paid out of commission on 11 February.The Times (London), Thursday, 11 February 1864, p.12 Despite being decommissioned, Gorgon had one last mission. The vessel was towed to Greenhithe on 6 May 1864 to act as a receiving hulk for the crew of HMS Osborne, seven of whom had acquired smallpox.The Times (London), Saturday, 7 May 1864, p.9 The ship was ultimately dismantled at Woolwich.The Times (London), Saturday, 30 January 1864, p.12 She was sold to Charlton for breaking on 17 October 1864.

In Japan, it was the top level car, sold only new at Toyopet Store locations. The Mark X was introduced in 2004 and is the successor to the Mark II which was first introduced in 1968, and was known in the North American market as the Corona Mark II starting in 1972, and renamed the Cressida from 1977 to 1992. The Mark X has a loyal following of enthusiasts and owners, as it continued where the Mark II left off when it was replaced in 2004. Internationally, it wasn't as well known as the Crown, which was available new at a different Toyota dealership. The \\"Mark X\\" is not pronounced \\"Mark Ten\\" but \\"Mark Ex\\", though the \\"Mark II\\" is \\"Mark Two\\". The Mark X is a continuation of the previous Mark II and its siblings, the sport- oriented Chaser, and the luxurious Cresta in one vehicle, repeating an approach previously attempted by the short lived Verossa that used inline-six engines, whereas the Mark X uses V6 engines. The Mark X was previously sold as an alternative to the front-wheel drive Camry, which was once the largest sedan new at Corolla Store locations, for buyers who like the size of the Camry, but prefer a rear-wheel drive layout. Different engine sizes were offered to allow Japanese buyers which annual road tax they were willing to pay; the larger engines offer higher levels of standard equipment and luxury features. Both the first and second generation Mark X were manufactured at the Motomachi plant in Japan. The Mark X was sold as the Reiz (transliterated to \\"ÈîêÂøó\\") in China, which was produced by Tianjin FAW Toyota Motor Co. Ltd. It was produced until 2017. The Mark X was also officially sold in limited quantities in Indonesia between 2012 and 2013 (imported from Japan), which was originally intended to use as a taxi.https://oto.detik.com/mobil/d-2150418/toyota-mark-x- gagal-jadi-taksi-mewah-ini-alasannya __TOC__  First generation (X120; 2004)  Toyota unveiled the Mark X sedan in 2004 as the successor to the Mark II sedan which has been on the market since the late 1960s. Instead of being based on a modified Supra chassis \\"A\\" series platform, the Mark X continues to use the Toyota \\"X\\" platform, and does not share its platform with the Toyota \\"S\\" series platform used under the Crown and Lexus GS. The continuation of describing this vehicle as the \\"X\\" series is a reference to the first dedicated Mark II platform introduced in 1972. Major changes to the Mark series are the engine and footwork. Toyota discontinued the inline-six engines used in the Verossa which included the JZ series and the G series engines, and went to the newly developed GR series engine. Either the 2.5 L (2,497 cc) 4GR- FSE or the 3.0 L (2,995 cc) 3GR-FSE engine options were available. Both engines offer Dual VVT-i with D-4 direct injection. The rear-wheel drive models have a 6-speed torque converter automatic transmission as standard and the four-wheel drive models have a 5-speed automatic. No manual transmission options were offered. A first in its class is the rear bumper with integrated exhaust outlet, which later made its way on to the corresponding model year Lexus LS series and the Crown. A LED lamp for the ceiling runs from the front of the vehicle to the rear, creating a \\"mood\\" lighting system. The LED system is also incorporated into the gear shifter and key area of the vehicle. Minor changes were made in 2006. Mirror-mounted turn signals replaced the fender- mounted turn signal, taillamps were revised and the grille was redesigned. Mark X with all black interior colour deleted the wood trim in favor of the brushed aluminium trim. This change also gives the formal introduction of the \\"S package\\" which gain the three-spoke steering wheel and changes to the exterior lip piece. In 2007 for Japanese models only, G-BOOK, a subscription telematics service, is offered as an option. The former Kanto Auto Works produced the Mark X from November 2004 to September 2006. 2004 Toyota Mark-X 02.jpg2004 Toyota Mark X (Japan) 2006 Toyota Mark-X 01.jpg2006 Toyota Mark X (Japan) 2006 Toyota Mark-X 02.jpg2006 Toyota Mark X (Japan) MarkXinterior.jpgInterior = China = The Chinese market Reiz is sold in 2.5 S, 2.5 V and 3.0 V Premium trim levels with 2.5 L (2,497 cc) 5GR-FE and 3.0 L (2,995 cc) 3GR-FE engines.

Blanco, Quintana Roo, on the Caribbean coast of Mexico. It is one of the last \\"unspoiled\\" stretches of Mexican Caribbean located on the southern end of the Costa Maya. The world's second largest barrier reef passes just off-shore from Xcalak and it is also a departure point for dive trips to the Chinchorro Banks (Banco Chinchorro) atoll reef system. It is designated a Mexican national reef park (Parque Nacional Arrecifes de Xcalak) and is an excellent site for snorkeling, scuba diving and fly fishing. It is south of Mahahual, the site of a new large cruise ship pier, and just north of the border with Belize. The Mahahual pier was destroyed by hurricane Dean in 2007. This section of coast is now being developed by the tourism industry and has a growing number of Americans and other expatriates investing in beach front property north of town. However, development is nowhere close to the degree of development in Canc√∫n and Playa del Carmen to the north. History The first settlements in the region date from the Pre-Columbian era. Nearby are the ruins of the Mayan city of Xcalak, from which the town derives its name. In May 1900, the Mexican Navy established the villa of Xcalak as a control post for the region. There the first shipyard of the Mexican Caribbean was constructed. During the twentieth century, the area became a major population area, with a significant production of coconut from coco palm plantations that reached up to 300 tons monthly. In 1955, the city was whipped by Hurricane Janet, which destroyed a large part of the town and scattered the population to other areas. Climate Xcalak was the largest city in Quintana Roo until it was destroyed by Hurricane Janet in 1955. Hurricane Dean struck Majahual, only 50 kilometers north of Xcalak in 2007.

The surprise of art. Barcelona, 2011. Saint Jerome, hermit, Father of the Church, and responsible for the translation of the Bible into Latin, (the Vulgate Bible) was a popular figure in Caravaggio's time, and the artist painted him at least eight times (only three survive). Whether this was from personal choice or at the request of patrons is unknown, but it gave Caravaggio the opportunity to explore the potential - from an artist's perspective - of aged and wrinkled flesh. Jerome is shown here contemplating one of his symbols, the skull, a reminder of the inevitability of death and the vanity of worldly things. The painting is probably from the Giustiniani collection (the collection of Caravaggio's patron the banker Vincenzo Giustiniani and his brother the cardinal Benedetto). Benedetto built up a large collection of religious works by the artist, and a St Jerome of the same dimensions as this one is in the Giustiniani inventory of 1638.

Stanley Moss or Billy Moss, was a British army officer in World War II,and later a successful writer, broadcaster, journalist and traveller. He served with the Coldstream Guards and the Special Operations Executive (SOE) and is best known for the Kidnap of General Kreipe. He was a best-selling author in the 1950s, based both on his novels and books about his wartime service. His SOE years are featured in Ill Met by Moonlight: The Abduction of General Kreipe, (also adapted as a British film released under the main title) and A War of Shadows. Moss travelled around the world and went to Antarctica to meet the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition. A biography, Billy Moss: Soldier, Writer, Traveller - A Brief Life by Alan Ogden, was published in 2014 as an Afterword to A War of Shadows. An abbreviated text was published in the Coldstream Gazette 2018. Early life and education Moss was born in Yokohama, Japan. His mother, Natalie Galitch (born in Nikolayevsk Usuriski), was a White Russian √©migr√©e, and his father, William Stanley Moss, an English businessman and steel merchant in Japan. They married on 22 September 1916. The family survived the 1923 Great Kant≈ç earthquake. Moss attended Charterhouse in England (1934‚Äì39). His uncle, Sir George Sinclair Moss (1882-1959), a British diplomat in China, also served the Special Operations Executive as adviser on Chinese affairs during the Second World War. Soldier In the autumn of 1939, Moss, aged 18, had just left Charterhouse and was living in a log cabin on the Latvian coast. By the outbreak of war, he reached Stockholm, and succeeded in crossing the North Sea to England in a yacht. After full training at Caterham, he was commissioned as an ensign into the Coldstream Guards in July 1941. He served on King's Guard at the Court of St. James's punctuated by bouts of Churchillian duty at Chequers. Posted to reinforce the 3rd Battalion the Coldstream, after the losses at Tobruk, Moss fought between October 1942 and July 1943 with Montgomery's Eighth Army chasing Rommel across North Africa after Alamein and finished up the campaign in Chianti and Pantellaria. He returned to Cairo, where he volunteered to join Force 133 of the Special Operations Executive (SOE) on 24 September 1943.Moncreiffe, Sir Iain, Ill Met by Moonlight, PrologueCooper, Artemis, Cairo in the War 1939-1945, Hamish Hamilton 1989 =Tara, Cairo= In 1943 in Cairo, Moss moved into a spacious villa, with a great ballroom with parquet floors, which four or five people might share. Moss chose to live in the villa rather than the SOE hostel, \\"Hangover Hall\\". He moved in alone at first, then bought his Alsatian puppy, Pixie; Xan Fielding, who had served in Crete, joined him. Next was Countess Zofia (Sophie) Tarnowska, forced to leave Poland in 1939 by the German invasion, followed by Arnold Breene of SOE HQ. Finally Patrick Leigh Fermor, an SOE officer who had spent the previous nine months in Crete, joined the household.Moss, W. Stanley, Diary, 1944 The villa's new inhabitants called it Tara, after the legendary home of the High Kings of Ireland. Sophie Tarnowska and two other women had been asked to share the house with the SOE agents, but only she went through with it, after the men pleaded with her not to let them down. Estranged from her husband, she moved in with her few possessions (a bathing costume, an evening gown, a uniform and two pet mongooses). She protected her reputation while living in the all-male household by the invention of an entirely fictitious chaperone, \\"Madame Khayatt\\", who suffered from \\"distressingly poor health\\" and was always indisposed when visitors asked after her. The group were later joined by SOE agents Billy McLean, David Smiley returning from Albania, and Rowland Winn (later Lord St. Oswald), also active in Albania. Tara became the centre of high-spirited entertaining of diplomats, officers, writers, lecturers, war correspondents and Coptic and Levantine party-goers. The residents adopted nicknames: \\"Princess Dneiper-Petrovsk\\" (Countess Sophie Tarnowska), \\"Sir Eustace Rapier\\" (Lt-Col. Neil (Billy) McLean), \\"the Marquis of Whipstock\\" (Col David Smiley LVO OBE MC), \\"the Hon, Rupert Sabretache\\" (Rowland Winn MC), \\"Lord Hughe Devildrive\\" (Major Xan Fielding DSO), \\"Lord Pintpot\\" (Arnold Breene), \\"Lord Rakehell\\" (Lt-Col Patrick Leigh-Fermor DSO) and \\"Mr Jack Jargon\\"Lord Byron, Don Juan, Canto The Thirteenth, LXXXVIII, \\"There was Jack Jargon, the gigantic guardsman\\"(Capt W. Stanley Moss MC). By the winter of 1944, the Tara household had to leave their battered villa and move into a flat. Their landlord secured their eviction on the grounds that the villa had not been let to \\"Princess Dneiper-Petrovsk\\" et al., as stated on the villa's name plate. =Abduction of General Kreipe, Crete= Georgios Tyrakis, Moss, Leigh Fermor, Emmanouil Paterakis, Antonios Papaleonidas. W. Stanley Moss's drawing of Kreipe Abduction Point William Stanley Moss's Cosh used in the Abduction of General Heinrich Kreipe, 1944 - Held by Imperial War Museums Moss is best remembered for the capture of General Heinrich Kreipe on Crete and abduction of him to Egypt, in April and May 1944.Byford-Jones, W. , The Greek Trilogy, Hutchinson 1945Ogden, Alan, Sons of Odysseus, SOE Heroes in Greece, Bene Factum Publishing Ltd, London, 2012, . Leigh Fermor, with Moss as his second-in-command, led a team of Cretan Andartes, part of the Greek resistance. Moss and Leigh Fermor thought of the Kreipe abduction one evening in the Club Royale de Chasse et de P√™che (Royal Hunting and Fishing Club) and planned it during the winter of 1943. On the last evening before Moss and Leigh Fermor set off, Smiley presented Moss with the Oxford Book of English Verse - his companion from Albania - for good luck. McLean gave him a complete Shakespeare dedicated, \\"To Bill, with best of luck for Guernsey, Bill\\". Promoted to the rank of Captain, at age 22 Moss set off with Leigh Fermor, age 29, to Crete in 1944. Leigh Fermor landed by parachute. Moss, unable to jump due to cloud cover, followed several weeks later, landing on 4 April 1944 by boat on the south coast where he joined Leigh Fermor, Andartes and other support (using the cover name of 'Dimitrios'). Walking north, they passed through Skinias, Kastamonitsa and Haraso. Just south of Skalani, they prepared for the abduction. Throughout the operation, as they travelled across Crete, they were hidden and supported by the Resistance and the local population. Moss and Leigh Fermor, disguised as German soldiers, stopped the General's car. With the help of their team, the driver was knocked out by Moss with his coshMacintyre, Ben, The Times, 11 June 2011, pp. 18-19Moss's cosh held by Imperial War Museum London, Catalogue ref WEA 4182 and the General and car seized. With Leigh Fermor impersonating the General, and Moss his driver, and with the General bundled in the back, secured by their Cretan team, Moss drove the General's car for an hour and a half through 22 controlled road blocks in Heraklion. Leigh Fermor took the car on, as Moss walked with the general south into the mountains to Anogeia and up towards Psiloritis. Reunited, the entire abduction team took the general on over the summit of Psiloritis before descending, aiming for the coast. Driven west by German forces cutting off escape to the south, they travelled to Gerakari and on to Patsos. From here, they walked on through Fotinos and Vilandredo before striking south, finally to escape by ship on 13 May 1944. After the war, a member of Kreipe's staff reported that, on hearing the news of the kidnapping, an uneasy silence in the officers' mess in Heraklion was followed by someone saying, \\"Well gentlemen, I think this calls for champagne all round.\\" Post-war correspondence explains that Kreipe was disliked by his soldiers because, amongst other things, he objected to the stopping of his own vehicle for checking in compliance with his commands concerning troops' reviewing approved travel orders. This tension between the General and his troops, in part, explains the reluctance of sentries to stop the General's car as Moss drove it through Heraklion.Beutin, Dr Ludwig, Letter to W. Stanley Moss, 27 September 1950 The episode was immortalised in his best-selling book Ill Met by Moonlight (1950). It was adapted into a film of the same name, directed and produced by Michael Powell and released in 1957. It featured Dirk Bogarde as Patrick Leigh Fermor and David Oxley as Moss. The abduction is commemorated near Archanes and at Patsos. =Damasta Sabotage, Crete= Returning to Crete on 6 July 1944, Moss led a resistance group consisting of eight Cretans and six escaped Russian POW soldiers in launching an ambush on German forces, intent on attacking Anogeia, on the main road connecting Rethymno and Heraklion. He chose an ambush site by a bridge in the Damastos location, one kilometre west of the village of Damasta. After the team destroyed various passing vehicles, among which was a lorry carrying military mail to Chania, the German force intending to target Anogeia finally appeared. It consisted of a truck of infantrymen backed up by an armoured car. Moss and his group attacked the troops. He destroyed the armoured car by crawling up behind it and dropping a grenade into the hatch. In total, 40 to 50 German and Axis troops were killed in the clash that followed as well as 1 Russian partisan. He left Crete on 18 August 1944. The operation, for which a bar to his Military Cross was recommended, is described in full in Moss's book A War of Shadows and commemorated at Damasta. Moss's exploits in Crete are recorded in the Historical Museum of Crete. =Greece= Moss served in Greece between September and November 1944, being promoted to Major on 24 October. He was sent to join Major Ken Scott in an operation to blow up the railway bridge over the Aliakmon River in order to disrupt German troop movements in and out of Thessaloniki. Heavy rain burst the river banks preventing Moss from a final attempt to blow up a section of the bridge. He continued to undertake sabotage operations to hinder the German withdrawal. He returned to Britain for reposting on 30 January 1945 and, resisting regimental duties, reapplied for special operations. On 6 March 1945, he returned to Cairo for 28 days leave where he married. =Siam (Thailand)= He was then posted to join Force 136 in Siam arriving from Cairo on 25 June 1945 to stay at the Grand Hotel, in Calcutta. Joining Major Ken Scott as Jedburgh team leader and Capt John Hibberdine (W/T) for Operation Sungod,National Archives, Kew. File HS1/58 he flew out of Jessore on 22 August by Dakota landing by parachute in a drop zone by a river, south of Bandon in the Bandon Nakon Sri Tamaraj area. The team's orders included establishing communication with HQ (W/T station Gaberdine), liaising with the Siamese 6th Independent Division, identifying all POW camps, finding locations for drop zones and seaplane landings and preparing to demolish the tunnel on the railway from Chong Khao and Ron Phibun, east to Tunsong, as also described in his book A War of Shadows. The Mission arranged the orderly surrender of Japanese forces in their area of operations, before Moss left in November 1945Ogden, Alan, Tigers Burning Bright, SOE Heroes in the Far East, Bene Factum Publishing Ltd, London, 2013, . On 25 January 1946, he joined Operation Python. He was discharged on 21 November 1946. Wartime honours * Military Cross (MC) Moss was recommended for and received the Immediate Award of the Military Cross following the Kreipe abduction. Marriage and family Riverstown House, County Cork In Cairo, on 26 April 1945, Moss married Countess Zofia Tarnowska, his former housemate. She was the granddaughter of Count Stanislaw Tarnowski (1837‚Äì1917) and a direct descendant of Catherine the Great of Russia. Their witnesses were Prince Peter of Greece and Major the Hon Peter Pleydell- Bouverie KRRC. The reception was held at the house of Princess Emina Toussoun. They had three children: Christine Isabelle Mercedes, named after their mutual friend and former SOE agent Krystyna Skarbek (Christine Granville),Mulley, Clare, The Spy Who Loved, London:Macmillan, 2012, p. 307. Sebastian (who died in infancy) and Gabriella. Initially living in London, they moved to Riverstown House, County Cork in Ireland. They later returned to London. They separated in 1957. Writer and traveller Moss achieved success as an author with three novels, as well as his two books based on his wartime adventures. In addition, he travelled to Germany and wrote an investigation of post-war Germany, studying what happened to gold accumulated by the Nazis: Gold Is Where You Hide It: What Happened to the Reichsbank Treasure? (1956). =Disappearance of Reichsbank and Abwehr reserves= Between 1952 and 1954, Moss joined up with his friend and former SOE agent, Andrzej Kowerski ‚Äì who adopted his cover name, Andrew Kennedy, after the war ‚Äì to investigate a mystery of the final days of the Third Reich. In April and May 1945, the remaining reserves of the Reichsbank ‚Äì gold (730 bars), cash (6 large sacks), and precious stones and metals such as platinum (25 sealed boxes) ‚Äì were dispatched by Walther Funk to be buried on the Klausenhof Mountain at Einsiedl in Bavaria, where the final German resistance was to be concentrated. Similarly the Abwehr cash reserves were hidden nearby in Garmisch- Partenkirchen. Shortly after the American forces overran the area, the reserves and money disappeared.Moss, W. Stanley, Gold Is Where You Hide It; What Happened to the Reichsbank Treasure?, Andre Deutsch 1959 Moss and Kennedy travelled back and forth across Germany and into Switzerland and corresponded with fugitives in Argentina, to research what had happened. They talked to many witnesses before finally establishing what had become of the treasure. What Moss and Kennedy uncovered, and the conclusions they reached on the various people responsible for the disappearances, have not been disputed to this day. The disappearance of Major Martin Borg, the US Military Governor of Garmisch-Partenkirchen at the time, has not been explained. Later, Moss and Kennedy went on to uncover the consequences of Heinrich Himmler's order of 28 October 1939, which confirmed the Lebensborn programme. They researched what had become of the children born as a result of the order. =Antarctica= Moss behind Fuchs, Hillary and others, Scott Base, Antarctica, 1958 He continued to travel extensively first to New Zealand from where, on 14 February 1958, he flew in a Globemaster aircraft (with one engine cutting out six hours from his destination) to Scott Base at McMurdo Sound, Antarctica to report on the arrival of the first Antarctic crossing achieved by the Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition in 1957-8 led by Vivian Fuchs and Edmund Hillary. Months later, he returned to New Zealand in the icebreaker, The Glacier.New Zealand Press =Sailing the Pacific= Taking to sea from New Zealand again, he sailed with Bill Endean, Rex Hill, Warwick Davies (aged 19), John Ewing (aged 19) in Endeans's 47 ft Alden-rigged Malabar ketch, the Crusader, through the islands of the Pacific to Tahiti. Here the crew split up and Moss joined the crew of the 50-ft motorsailer Manawanui from Tahiti to Nassau, Bahamas. Tig Lowe was skipper, Howard ‚ÄúBones‚Äù Kanter was navigator, and other crew members were two New Zealanders. They stopped at Mangareva, where Moss and Lowe put on a boxing exhibition - much to the delight of the islanders. They sailed on to the Pitcairn Islands, Easter Island, the Galapagos Islands and Panama, eventually landing at Nassau in December 1959. =Jamaica= Moss moved on to Kingston, Jamaica, where he settled. He died there on 9 August 1965, aged 44. He was buried at the Garrison Church in Kingston on Friday 13 August. Two buglers from the 1st Battalion The Jamaica Regiment sounded Last Post and Reveille over his coffin which was draped in the Union Jack. A simple rock of red and white mottled Jamaican marble was erected over his grave with the inscription In loving memory of William Stanley Moss, A Soldier, A Writer, A Traveller.

The subject has its roots in classical antiquity and the scholarship of the Hellenistic period, but has flourished among Homeric scholars of the 19th and 20th centuries. The main subtopics of the Homeric Question are: *\\"Who is Homer?\\"Kahane, p. 1. *\\"Are the Iliad and the Odyssey of multiple or single authorship?\\"Jensen, p. 10. This question has attracted luminaries from all walks of life, including William Ewart Gladstone, who amused himself in spare time by inditing a tome in dilation of the view that Homer was one man, solely and individually responsible for both the Iliad and the Odyssey. *\\"By whom, when, where, and under what circumstances were the poems composed?\\"Fowler, p. 23. To these questions the possibilities of modern textual criticism and archaeological answers have added a few more: *\\"How reliable is the tradition embodied in the Homeric poems?\\"Luce, p. 15. *\\"How old are the oldest elements in Homeric poetry which can be dated with certainty?\\"Nilsson, p. 11. Oral tradition Following the seminal work of Milman Parry, most classicists agree that, whether or not there was ever such a composer as Homer, the poems attributed to him are to some degree dependent on oral tradition, a generations-old technique that was the collective inheritance of many singer- poets (or , aoidoi). An analysis of the structure and vocabulary of the Iliad and Odyssey shows that the poems contain many regular and repeated phrases; indeed, even entire verses are repeated. Thus according to the theory, the Iliad and Odyssey may have been products of oral-formulaic composition, composed on the spot by the poet using a collection of memorized traditional verses and phrases. Milman Parry and Albert Lord have pointed out that such elaborate oral tradition, foreign to today's literate cultures, is typical of epic poetry in an exclusively oral culture. The crucial words here are \\"oral\\" and \\"traditional\\". Parry starts with the former: the repetitive chunks of language, he says, were inherited by the singer-poet from his predecessors, and were useful to him in composition. Parry calls these chunks of repetitive language \\"formulas\\".Gibson: Milman Parry. Many scholars agree that the Iliad and Odyssey underwent a process of standardization and refinement out of older material, beginning in the 8th century BC. This process, often referred to as the \\"million little pieces\\" design, seems to acknowledge the spirit of oral tradition. As Albert Lord notes in his book The Singer of Tales, poets within an oral tradition, as was Homer, tend to create and modify their tales as they perform them. Although this suggests that Homer may simply have \\"borrowed\\" from other bards, he almost certainly made the piece his own when he performed it.Lord: The Singer of Tales. The 1960 publication of Lord's book, which focused on the problems and questions that arise in conjunction with applying oral-formulaic theory to problematic texts such as the Iliad, the Odyssey and even Beowulf influenced nearly all subsequent work on Homer and oral-formulaic composition. In response to his landmark effort, Geoffrey Kirk published a book entitled The Songs of Homer, in which he questions Lord's extension of the oral-formulaic nature of Serbian epic poetry in Bosnia and Herzegovina (the area from which the theory was first developed) to Homeric epic. He holds that Homeric poems differ from those traditions in their \\"metrical strictness\\", \\"formular system[s]\\" and creativity. Kirk argued that Homeric poems were recited under a system that gave the reciter much more freedom to choose words and passages to achieve the same end than the Serbian poet, who was merely \\"reproductive\\".Kirk, pp. 88-91.Foley, p. 35. Shortly afterwards, Eric A. Havelock's 1963 book Preface to Plato revolutionized how scholars looked at Homeric epic by arguing not only that it was the product of an oral tradition but that the oral-formulas contained therein served as a way for ancient Greeks to preserve cultural knowledge across many different generations.Foley, p. 36. In his 1966 work Have we Homer's Iliad?, Adam Parry theorized the existence of the most fully developed oral poet up to his time, a person who could (at his discretion) creatively and intellectually form nuanced characters in the context of the accepted, traditional story; in fact, Parry altogether discounted the Serbian tradition to an \\"unfortunate\\" extent, choosing to elevate the Greek model of oral-tradition above all others.Foley, pp. 36, 505.Parry, pp. 177-216. Lord reacted to Kirk and Parry's respective contentions with Homer as Oral Poet, published in 1968, which reaffirmed his belief in the relevance of Serbian epic poetry and its similarities to Homer, and downplayed the intellectual and literary role of the reciters of Homeric epic.Foley, pp. 40, 406. In further support of the theory that Homer is really the name of a series of oral-formulas, or equivalent to \\"the Bard\\" as applied to Shakespeare, the Greek name Homƒìros is etymologically noteworthy. It is identical to the Greek word for \\"hostage\\". It has been hypothesized that his name was back-extracted from the name of a society of poets called the Homeridae, which literally means \\"sons of hostages\\", i.e., descendants of prisoners of war. As these men were not sent to war because their loyalty on the battlefield was suspect, they would not be killed in conflicts, so they were entrusted with remembering the area's stock of epic poetry, to remember past events, from the time before literacy came to the area.Harris: Homer the Hostage. In a similar vein, the word \\"Homer\\" may simply be a carryover from the Mediterranean seafarers' vocabulary adoption of the Semitic word base ‚ÄôMR, which means \\"say\\" or \\"tell\\". \\"Homer\\" may simply be the Mediterranean version of \\"saga\\". It has also been suggested by Pseudo-Plutarch that the name comes from a word meaning \\"to follow\\" and another meaning \\"blind\\". Other sources connect Homer's name with Smyrna for several etymological reasons.Graziosi, pp. 79‚Äì81. Time frame Exactly when these poems would have taken on a fixed written form is subject to debate. The traditional solution is the \\"transcription hypothesis\\", wherein a non-literate singer dictates the poem to a literate scribe in the 6th century BC or earlier. Sources from antiquity are unanimous in declaring that Peisistratus, the tyrant of Athens, first committed the poems of Homer to writing and placed them in the order in which we now read them. More radical Homerists, such as Gregory Nagy, contend that a canonical text of the Homeric poems did not exist until established by Alexandrian editors in the Hellenistic period (3rd to 1st century BC). The modern debate began with the Prolegomena of Friedrich August Wolf (1795). According to Wolf, the date of writing is among the first questions in the textual criticism of Homer. Having satisfied himself that writing was unknown to Homer, Wolf considers the real mode of transmission, which he purports to find in the Rhapsodists, of whom the Homeridae were an hereditary school. Wolf reached the conclusion that the Iliad and Odyssey could not have been composed in the form in which we know them without the aid of writing. They must therefore have been, as Bentley has said, a sequel of songs and rhapsodies, loose songs not collected together in the form of an epic poem until about 500 years after their original composition. This conclusion Wolf supports by the character attributed to the Cyclic poems (whose want of unity showed that the structure of the Iliad and Odyssey must be the work of a later time), by one or two indications of imperfect connection, and by the doubts of ancient critics as to the authenticity of certain parts. This view is extended by the complicating factor of the period of time now referred to as the \\"Greek Dark Ages\\". This period, which ranged from approximately 1250 to 750 BC, is estimated to have been immediately preceded by the historical counterpart to Homer's Trojan War. The composition of the Iliad, on the other hand, is placed immediately following the Greek Dark Age period. Further controversy surrounds the difference in composition dates between the Iliad and Odyssey. It seems that the latter was composed at a later date than the former because the works' differing characterizations of the Phoenicians align with differing Greek popular opinion of the Phoenicians between the 8th and 7th centuries BC, when their skills began to hurt Greek commerce. Whereas Homer's description of Achilles's shield in the Iliad exhibits minutely detailed metalwork that characterized Phoenician crafts, they are characterized in the Odyssey as \\"manifold scurvy tricksters\\".Homer - Books and Biography. Martin Litchfield West in his 2010 commentary on the Iliad uses comparative evidence and the literary Shield of Achilles as one of many data that for him establish a composition date of 680-650. Identity of Homer Wolf's speculations were in harmony with the ideas and sentiment of the time, and his historical arguments, especially his long array of testimonies to the work of Peisistratus, were hardly challenged. The effect of Wolf's Prolegomena was so overwhelming, and its determination so decisive, that, although a few protests were made at the time, the true Homeric controversy did not begin until after his death in 1824. The first considerable antagonist of the Wolfian school was Gregor Wilhelm Nitzsch, whose writings cover the years between 1828 and 1862 and deal with every side of the controversy. In the earlier part of his Metetemata (1830), Nitzsch took up the question of written or unwritten literature, on which Wolf's entire argument turned, and showed that the art of writing must be anterior to Peisistratus. In the later part of the same series of discussions (1837), and in his chief work (Die Sagenpoesie der Griechen, 1852), he investigated the structure of the Homeric poems, and their relation to the other epics of the Trojan cycle. These epics had in the meantime been made the subject of a work which, for exhaustive learning and delicacy of artistic perception, has few rivals in the history of philology: the Epic cycle of Friedrich Gottlieb Welcker. The confusion which previous scholars had made between the ancient post-Homeric poets (such as Arctinus of Miletus and Lesches) and the learned mythological writers (like the scriptor cyclicus of Horace) was first cleared up by Welcker. Wolf had argued that, had the cyclic writers known the Iliad and Odyssey which we possess, they would have imitated the unity of structure which distinguishes these two poems. The aim of Welcker's work was to show that the Homeric poems had influenced both the form and the substance of epic poetry. Thus arose a conservative school which admitted more or less freely the absorption of preexisting lays in the formation of the Iliad and Odyssey, and also the existence of considerable interpolations, but assigned the main work of formation to prehistoric times and the genius of a great poet.Caldecott, p. 1. Whether the two epics were by the same author remained an open question; the tendency of this group of scholars was towards separation. Regarding the use of writing, too, they were not unanimous. Karl Otfried M√ºller, for instance, maintained the view of Wolf on this point, while strenuously combating the inference which Wolf drew from it. The Prolegomena bore on the title-page the words \\"Volumen I\\", but no second volume ever appeared; nor was any attempt made by Wolf himself to compose it or carry his theory further. The first important steps in that direction were taken by Johann Gottfried Jakob Hermann, chiefly in two dissertations, De interpolationibus Homeri (Leipzig, 1832), and De iteratis apud Homerum (Leipzig, 1840), called forth by the writings of Nitzsch. As the word \\"interpolation\\" implies, Hermann did not maintain the hypothesis of a conflation of independent lays. Feeling the difficulty of supposing that all ancient minstrels sang of the wrath of Achilles or the return of Odysseus (leaving out even the capture of Troy itself), he was led to assume that two poems of no great compass, dealing with these two themes, became so famous at an early period as to throw other parts of the Trojan story into the background and were then enlarged by successive generations of rhapsodists. Some parts of the Iliad, moreover, seemed to him to be older than the poem on the wrath of Achilles; and thus, in addition to the Homeric and post-Homeric matter, he distinguished a pre-Homeric element. The conjectures of Hermann, in which the Wolfian theory found a modified and tentative application, were presently thrown into the shade by the inure trenchant method of Karl Lachmann, who (in two papers read to the Berlin Academy in 1837 and 1841) sought to show that the Iliad was made up of sixteen independent lays, with various enlargements and interpolations, all finally reduced to order by Peisistratus. The first book, for instance, consists of a lay on the anger of Achilles (1‚Äì347), and two continuations, the return of Chryseis (430‚Äì492) and the scenes in Olympus (348‚Äì429, 493‚Äì611). The second book forms a second lay, but several passages, among them the speech of Odysseus (278‚Äì332), are interpolated. In the third book, the scenes in which Helen and Priam take part (including the making of the truce) are pronounced to be interpolations; and so on. New methods try also to elucidate the question. Combining information technologies and statistics, the stylometry allows to scan various linguistic units: words, parts of speech, and sounds. Based on the frequencies of Greek letters, a first study of Dietmar NajockNajock Dietmar, 1995, \\"Letter Distribution and Authorship in Early Greek Epics\\", Revue informatique et Statistique dans les Sciences Humaines, XXXI, 1 √† 4, p. 129‚Äì154. particularly shows the internal cohesion of the Iliad and the Odyssey. Taking into account the repetition of the letters, a recent study of Stephan VonfeltVonfelt Stephan, 2010, \\"Arch√©ologie num√©rique de la po√©sie grecque\\" , Universit√© de Toulouse. highlights the unity of the works of Homer compared to Hesiod. The thesis of modern analysts being questioned, the debate remains open. Current status of the Homeric Question Most scholars, although disagreeing on other questions about the genesis of the poems, agree that the Iliad and the Odyssey were not produced by the same author, based on \\"the many differences of narrative manner, theology, ethics, vocabulary, and geographical perspective, and by the apparently imitative character of certain passages of the Odyssey in relation to the Iliad.\\" Nearly all scholars agree that the Iliad and the Odyssey are unified poems, in that each poem shows a clear overall design, and that they are not merely strung together from unrelated songs. It is also generally agreed that each poem was composed mostly by a single author, who probably relied heavily on older oral traditions. Nearly all scholars agree that the Doloneia in Book X of the Iliad is not part of the original poem, but rather a later insertion by a different poet. Some ancient scholars believed Homer to have been an eyewitness to the Trojan War; others thought he had lived up to 500 years afterwards. Contemporary scholars continue to debate the date of the poems. A long history of oral transmission lies behind the composition of the poems, complicating the search for a precise date. It is generally agreed, however, that the \\"date\\" of \\"Homer\\" should refer to the moment in history when the oral tradition became a written text.Reece, Steve. \\"Homer's Iliad and Odyssey: From Oral Performance to Written Text,\\" in Mark Amodio (ed.), New Directions in Oral Theory (Tempe: Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies, 2005) 43-89. Homers_Iliad_and_Odyssey_From_Oral_Performance_to_Written_Text. Reece, Steve. \\"Toward an Ethnopoetically Grounded Edition of Homer‚Äôs Odyssey.\\" Oral Tradition 26 (2011) 299-326.Toward_an_Ethnopoetically_Grounded_Edition_of_Homers_Odyssey At one extreme, Richard Janko has proposed a date for both poems to the eighth century BC based on linguistic analysis and statistics. Barry B. Powell dates the composition of the Iliad and the Odyssey to sometime between 800 and 750 BC, based on the statement from Herodotus, who lived in the late fifth century BC, that Homer lived four hundred years before his own time \\"and not more\\" (Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ Œø·Ωê œÄŒªŒ≠ŒøœÉŒπ), and on the fact that the poems do not mention hoplite battle tactics, inhumation, or literacy. At the other extreme, scholars such as Gregory Nagy see \\"Homer\\" as a continually evolving tradition, which grew much more stable as the tradition progressed, but which did not fully cease to continue changing and evolving until as late as the middle of the second century BC. Martin Litchfield West has argued that the Iliad echoes the poetry of Hesiod, and that it must have been composed around 660-650 BC at the earliest, with the Odyssey up to a generation later. He also interprets passages in the Iliad as showing knowledge of historical events that occurred in the ancient Near East during the middle of the seventh century BC, including the destruction of Babylon by Sennacherib in 689 BC and the Sack of Thebes by Ashurbanipal in 663/4 BC.

Named for Bishop George Albert Guertin (1869-1931), it was founded by the Brothers of the Sacred Heart in 1963. The school is located off Exit 4 of the F. E. Everett Turnpike in Nashua, in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Manchester. Scholastics Subjects are divided into nine departments: English, Social Studies, Computer Science, World Languages, Science, Mathematics, Health and Fitness, Fine Arts, and Religious Studies. Guertin students are able to take courses in these departments at the \\"College Preparatory\\", \\"Honors\\", or \\"Advanced Placement\\" level. Guertin teachers are also available for personal help and tutoring before and after school, and many students capitalize on this asset. Guertin's academics \\"offers a college preparatory program that encourages the 'whole person' to develop...[fostering] an environment that allows students to discover their emerging identities, to develop their particular gifts and skills and to emerge as well-rounded young men and women\\". \\"The excellent record of BG students in academics, plus our winning traditions in athletics, debate, Granite State Challenge and state music competitions, reflect our passion for achieving our best in whatever we do,\\" reads the Academics section of the school's website. World Languages at Guertin are currently Latin, French, and Spanish (including 5th year of language and/or AP language); in addition to these language foundations, Ancient Greek has been recently added to the curriculum as a semester-long \\"Honors\\" elective. Bishop Guertin offers six class periods a day, starting at 7:43 am until 2:28 pm. The class schedule varies from day to day. There is an eight-day cycle with six periods each day. For example, Day 1 would consist of periods 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7. Lunch is a 30 minute block lunch during the 4th period of the day. There are 5 lunches, with 1st lunch starting the earliest at 10:59 AM, and 5th lunch starting the latest at 11:55 AM, both on a regular school day. The next day (called \\"Day 2\\" due to the fact that class number 2 starts that day) would begin with period 2 and continue with periods 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8. An easy way to remember the schedule is that the first period of the previous day and the fourth period of the previous day are \\"dropped\\" for the day. The schedule continues to cycle like this every day until it reaches \\"Day 1\\" again and the cycle starts over. Also, if there is a snow day, hurricane day, holiday, etc. the BG students return to school the next day with the schedule planned for the missed school day. The school has one of the highest rates of college acceptance for its students in New Hampshire, which reached an all-time high in 2015, with 100% of the graduating class accepted into at least 1 college . Sports The Cardinals of Bishop Guertin participate in 17 sports year-round, completely in NHIAA Division I, the division reserved for the largest schools in the state. A notable exception to this is the school's football program, which was in Division II until 2013 before moving up to Division I, the second highest size division of high school football programs in the state. While Bishop Guertin is one of the smaller Division I schools in New Hampshire, its ability to draw students from a wide geographic area in southern New Hampshire and northeastern Massachusetts enables it to be highly competitive in its division. For decades, Bishop Guertin played their crosstown public school rival, the Nashua Purple Panthers in the Turkey Bowl on Thanksgiving. In 2004, Nashua High School was split into the Panthers of South and the Titans of North, and Bishop Guertin no longer played in the Thanksgiving Day game. Exeter High School and Pinkerton Academy are two main rivals of the school. The school won seven state titles in 2005. The school's football program won three division II state championship seasons in football with a record of 35‚Äì1 between 2004 and 2006. They again won 3 consecutive titles between 2008 and 2010. The girls indoor track team won twelve straight Class L championships, from 2003 to 2014, the boys track team won both the indoor and outdoor track championships in 2010, and the boys cross-country program won titles in 2008 and 2009, while the girls won titles in 2011 and 2014. The boys hockey team won back-to-back Division I state championships in 2000 and 2001 and in 2007 and 2008, and in 2015. The boys lacrosse team won state championships in 2005, 2008, 2010-2014, 2016, and 2017. The girls lacrosse team won the state championship in 2015 and 2018. The softball team won the state championship in 2017. Activities Popular after-school activities include Cardinal News (the school newspaper), Environmental Club (which saves the school thousands of dollars annually), Drama Club, Anime Club, Writer's Club, Ukulele Club, Mock Trial, French Club, Rock Appreciation Club, the Crossword Puzzle Club (XWC), Asian American Club, Cornerstone (a community service club), Debate Team, Band, Russian Club, Student Council, Campus Ministry Council (divided into 3 committees- Spiritual Life, Social Justice, and Christian Formation), the FIRST Robotics team, and the NJCL Latin Club. The Bishop Guertin French Club is also noteworthy. It features a reading group, a film club, and an annual trip to Quebec. Bishop Guertin has a successful FIRST robotics team with over 75 members. They won the regional Chairmans Award in 2004, and 2014, and the Championship Competition Newton Division Finalist in 2004 as well as the Johnson and Johnson sportsmanship/gracious professionalism awards in 2003, 2007, and 2008, and the Imagery Award in 2005. In June 2008, and every year since, a group of students led by Br.

The organization, founded by Erhard Busek and Richard Schifter, has provided regional stability, and has found support in international organizations and countries. In 2009, the SECI created a Regional Cooperation Council (RCC), owned and run by countries mainly in southeast Europe, aimed at strengthening peace, democracy and the economy. The SECI headquarters are located within the Hofburg Palace in Vienna. Membership *Member states:              *Observer European states:           *   *Observer states outside Europe:    *Observer International Organizations: International Organization for Migration (IOM) European Institute for Law Enforcement Cooperation (EULEC) International Centre for Migration Policy Development (ICMPD) United Nations Mission to Kosovo (UNMIK) History =Background of the SECI= The SECI was formed in 1996 under the guidance of Richard Schifter, at the time the Senior Director for Eastern Europe in the United States National Security Council. The group's mission was modeled after the Marshall Plan of 1947, which helped rebuild Europe after World War II. Since the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina was coming to a close, Schifter saw a need for greater stability in the region. His initial plan, called the Southeast European Cooperative Development Initiative, was intended to focus on regional cooperation of the countries in Southeast Europe (SEE), and not be considered a financial assistance plan. The idea was to allow SEE countries access to resources that would help them rebuild and stabilize, but not to provide money. Instead, outside organizations and countries like the United States would offer technical assistance and provide experts on relevant subjects. Schifter‚Äôs hunch was realized on 14 December 1995, when a cease-fire was announced and peace negotiations were signed in Dayton, Ohio under the Dayton Agreement. =Difficulties of formation= The next step was to get all the countries in the region together and agree to join a cooperation initiative, an extremely difficult task considering the ethnic tension that dominated the region. The SECI was originally composed of Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Greece, Hungary, Moldova, Romania, Turkey, Yugoslavia, Croatia and Slovenia. However those last three participants caused some growing pains for the initiative in its nascent stages. Yugoslavia‚Äôs invitation was revoked after the country cancelled local election results when a minority party won the popular vote, eventually being allowed in as Serbia and Montenegro and Slovenia and Croatia originally agreed to join but only as observer nations. The Slovenian concern was that they were a Central European country, not part of SEE, but once Hungary joined, they quickly followed suit. Croatia was more of a challenge in that not only did they not see themselves as a SEE country, but President Tudjman in an interview with Richard Schifter said that Croatia was a ‚ÄúCatholic, Mediterranean country‚Äù that wants nothing to do with the ‚ÄúOrthodox and the Muslims.‚Äù In 1999, President Tudjman was hospitalized, eventually dying, and shortly after, Croatia joined the SECI as a full-fledged member. Kosovo is another area of contention for the SEE countries. During the time of the formation of the SECI, in 1996, they were only recognized as a region and by 1999, they were governed by the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK), under the UNSC Resolution 1244; in February 2008, the Assembly of Kosovo declared its independence from Serbia. Despite this, they are still only recognized as an independent state , with Russia and Serbia leading the opposition of the declaration and the European Union having no official position on the situation as well as the United Nations saying that Resolution 1244 will remain the legal framework in Kosovo. Kosovo has never been and currently is not considered a member state by the SECI either, only a permanent observer.

He won two premierships with Easts and scored so many points, tries and goals and established so many records (some may never be bettered) that he is referred to as \\"the Bradman of league\\". In 2003 Brown was inducted into the Australian Rugby League Hall of Fame and in 2008 he was named in the New South Wales rugby league team of the century. In 2018, Brown joined Rugby League's elite by being inducted as a Rugby League Immortal. Background Brown was born Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. As a child Brown lost the top of his thumb in a lawn-mowing accident. While playing football at school he badly broke an arm, dislocating the elbow and causing severe nerve damage which cost him the use of two fingers on his right hand. Despite these setbacks Brown was an all-round sportsman ‚Äì an A-grade tennis player, champion junior surfer and a representative cricketer. Brown attended Sydney's Waverley College under the tuition of Arthur Hennessy, Australia's first ever rugby league test captain, who was the school sporting coach at the time. Stellar early career The powerfully built centre joined the Eastern Suburbs club straight out of school. After just a handful of lower grade games Brown was promoted to the top grade. The following year aged just eighteen Brown was selected to represent his state ‚Äì New South Wales in 3 interstate matches against Queensland. Soon after the teenager lost all his hair, after contracting a virus while swimming and took to wearing a hairpiece to cover his baldness. Brown on d√©but for NSW in 1931 at age 18 and before his hair loss At the beginning of the 1932 season, aged just nineteen years and twelve days, Brown was named captain of the Eastern Suburbs club. The following year he was selected for the 1933‚Äì34 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain. On the boat trip over one of his teammates, unable to stand the sight of Brown's hairpiece any longer, tossed it out one of the ship's portholes, causing him to begin wearing his trademark headgear. On the tour he played in 32 matches, including all 3 Tests, scoring 285 points, at the time the greatest number ever attained by an Australian player on tour from 19 tries and 114 goals. In an exhibition match played in on a snow-covered ground between England and Australia, (the first rugby league game played on French soil) Brown scored 6 tries and kicked 9 goals for a total of 36 points. Record breaking years Once home in Sydney, Brown led a star-studded Easts side to the 1934 minor premiership, losing to Western Suburbs in the premiership decider. In the following season ‚Äì 1935, Easts lost just 1 match and captured their fifth premiership, That 1935 season was Brown‚Äôs best. In just fifteen club matches he scored 244 points (38 tries, 65 goals). His 1935 record try tally still stands: indeed Newtown winger Ray Preston remains the only other player to score more than 30 tries in a season, totaling 34 during the 1954 season. In the first round match against Canterbury-Bankstown Brown scored a premiership record 45 points (5 tries, 15 goals), with the 15 goal tally also standing as the record for goals in a match. In the second round match against Canterbury-Bankstown he scored a further 38 points (6 tries, 10 goals), which stands as the equal record for the second-most points in a premiership match. He recorded further records in round 16 when he scored 26 (4 tries, 7 goals) against North Sydney then in round 18 against Balmain he notched up a further 32 points, from 6 tries and 7 goals. The pointscoring wizard amassed 385 points that year (incorporating all Eastern Suburbs and representative matches). What make his records all the more impressive is that during the 1934, 1935 and 1936 seasons Brown was not the only goalkicker at the club, with teammate Jack Beaton taking many of the easier shots for goal. On 28 September 1935, at just 22 years and 177 days Brown was named as the youngest ever Australian captain, and led his country to a series victory over New Zealand. In 1936 Easts again took out the NSWRL season title, this time finishing undefeated. Warrington and final playing years At the end of the 1936 season Brown accepted an offer from English rugby league club, Warrington, a four-year deal worth 1,000 pounds for the first season (based on increases in average earnings, this would be approximately ¬£161,800 in 2013). Brown played right-, i.e. number 3, and scored 2-tries in Warrington's 8-4 victory over Barrow in the 1937‚Äì38 Lancashire County Cup Final during the 1937‚Äì38 season at Central Park, Wigan on Saturday 23 October 1937. Brown played 93 matches for the Warrington Wolves, scoring 326 points ‚Äì 48 tries and 91 goals. In a cup semi final against St Helens Brown kicked what he considers to be his finest goal, it is recounted this way. > \\"with the scores locked at 2-all in the dying moments Warrington were > awarded a penalty near the touch-line and five-yards on their own side of > half-way, Brown took the shot, guiding it between the posts to give > Warrington a 4‚Äì2 win and a spot in the Cup final.\\" But Brown never enjoyed quite the same level of success in England; he bought out the final year of his contract and returned home. Once home Brown rejoined the Eastern Suburbs club, playing in the remaining matches of the 1939 season. In 1940 with Dave Brown appointed as captain and coach of the side, Easts finished the year at the top of the league ladder and despite losing Brown with a leg injury, managed to capture another premiership. 1941 was to be Brown's last season. Easts again finished first at the end of the regular season but went down to St George in the premiership decider. Brown at twenty- nine years old announced his retirement following the match. Post-football After his retirement from the game Brown took up a position as the games liaison officer, promoting rugby league in schools. He also spent time coaching and promoting the game in South Africa Dave Brown 'The Bradman of League' died from cancer in 1974, 40 days before his 61st birthday. He was survived by two sisters, nephews, nieces, and his records. Accolades In 2003 he was admitted into the Australian Rugby League Hall of Fame.Australian Rugby League Hall of Fame Up until 1986 the award for the best player in the Grand Final each year was known as the Dave Brown Medal. Dave Brown was also named in the centres, alongside Dally Messenger in the Eastern Suburbs club's greatest team. Additionally, a plaque in the Walk of Honour at the Sydney Cricket Ground commemorates his career. In February 2008, Brown was named in the list of Australia's 100 Greatest Players (1908‚Äì2007) which was commissioned by the NRL and ARL to celebrate the code's centenary year in Australia. In 2008 Brown was also named in New South Wales' rugby league team of the century. Joining fellow pre-WWII greats Dally Messenger and Frank Burge, Brown was inducted as a Rugby League Immortal in 2018, along with recent greats Norm Provan and Mal Meninga.

Biography Obelisk de Pauw in Xanten Although born in Amsterdam, son of Antonius Pauw and Quirina van Heijningen, he spent most of his life in Kleve. Working for the clergy, he nonetheless became familiar with the ideas of the Enlightenment. During his lifetime he was considered to be the greatest expert on the Americas, although he never visited the continent; he also wrote at length on the origins of ancient peoples, rejecting the popular idea of the time that China was originally a colony of Ancient Egypt. He was a specialist in ethnologic studies as well, publishing a study of American Indians in French in 1768. Daniel Webb, an English scholar and translator, translated portions of de Pauw's work into English for a public that was hungry for information regarding the new continent of America. De Pauw had no hesitation in rejecting the observations of those with personal experience of the Americas if they differed from his preconceptions, as can be seen from his comments on the Aztec calendar. Despite this, he was reputed in his lifetime to be Europe's foremost authority on the Americas. He read the accounts of Buffon and other scientists, naturalists, and explorers, and drew his own conclusions. De Pauw was of the opinion (shared with other European scientists of that time) that the American natives were inferior to natives of northern and western Europe, and that this inferiority was partly due to American climate and geography. Some quotes from his works: > The American [native], strictly speaking, is neither virtuous nor vicious. > What motive has he to be either? The timidity of his soul, the weakness of > his intellects, the necessity of providing for his subsistence, the powers > of superstition, the influences of climate, all lead him far wide of the > possibility of improvement; but he perceives it not; his happiness is, not > to think; to remain in perfect inaction; to sleep a great deal; to wish for > nothing, when his hunger is appeased; and to be concerned about nothing but > the means of procuring food when hunger torments him. He would not build a > cabin, did not cold and the inclemency of the atmosphere force him to it, > nor ever quit that cabin, did not necessity thrust him out. In his > understanding there is no gradation, he continues an infant to the last hour > of his life. By his nature sluggish in the extreme, he is revengeful through > weakness, and atrocious in his vengeance... > The Europeans who pass into America degenerate, as do the animals; a proof > that the climate is unfavourable to the improvement of either man or animal. > The Creoles, descending from Europeans and born in America, though educated > in the universities of Mexico, of Lima, and College de Santa Fe, have never > produced a single book. This degradation of humanity must be imputed to the > vitiated qualities of the air stagnated in their immense forests, and > corrupted by noxious vapours from standing waters and uncultivated grounds‚Ä¶ Rejecting the existence of the Aztec calendar: > It cannot be, because such a practice presupposes a long series of > astronomical observations and very precise knowledge for calculating the > solar year, which cannot coincide with the prodigious ignorance in which > those peoples were submerged. How could those (peoples) have perfected their > chronology who did not have words to count above ten? Elsewhere: > There are none of these languages in which is possible to count above three. > It is not possible to translate a book, not just into the languages of the > AlgonquinsJohn Eliot had published the New Testament in 1661 and the Old > Testament in 1663 in Massachusett, an Algonquian language, revising his > translations in 1680 and 1685. See Jaroslav Pelikan, The Reformation of the > Bible: The Bible of the Reformation, New Haven (Yale University Press), > 1996, pp. 156-157, including a picture of the title page of the 1663 > edition. or of the Guaranis or Paraguayans, but even into the languages of > Mexico or Peru, because they lack a sufficient number of terms capable of > enunciating general concepts. De Pauw extended his theory to the livestock and wild animals of the Americas: > The degeneracy which prevails in the stranger animals, among whom I shall > reckon man, differs in different provinces. Dogs, which in Peru are subject > to the venereal disease, are not so in the northern regions; hogs, which > dwindle in Pennsylvania, in other places lose their shape, but not their > stature; in the English colonies, European sheep become smaller, without > losing their wool; in the islands, as in Jamaica, they change their wool for > a hair hard and coarse, which cannot be manufactured... Pauw's work also dealt with the manners and customs unique to the natives of the Americas, ranging from the Inuit and Canadian Indians in the north to the Peruvians in the south. De Pauw speculates on differences and similarities between the North Americans and natives in Siberia. He notes: > The Tunguses, a people of Siberia, are, like the Canadians, grave, > phlegmatic, and speak little; because they have but few ideas, and still > fewer words to express them; add to this, that the silence and gloom of > their forests naturally induce an habitual melancholy. Hence it is that they > prefer strong and inebriating liquors, which quicken the motion of the > blood, and set the machine in action, to the most precious gifts that can be > made them. > The Tunguses hang their dead on trees, so do the Illinois of America; they > cannot dig graves in the earth frozen hard to the depth of twenty feet. This > is obviously nothing more than a coincidence... In a discussion about the physical characteristics of Native Americans, he writes of a peculiar custom among the Caribbeans: > There is in the Caribane a sort of savages who have hardly any neck, and > whose shoulders rise as high as the ears; this too is factitious, and > brought about by laying great weights on the head of the infant, which > compress the vertebrae of the neck, and force them to descend into the > hollow formed by the two bones of the upper part of the breast. These > monsters appear, at a certain distance, to have the mouth in the middle of > the breast; and may well renew, to travelers ignorant and delighting in > wonders, the ancient fable of the Acephales, or of men without heads. De Pauw writes of the appearance of the \\"Eskimo\\": > They are the most diminutive race of human kind, their stature in general > not exceeding four feet. They have enormous heads, are extremely fat and > corpulent, and much under-limbed. On examining the extremities of their > limbs, one perceives that organization has been checked by the severity of > that cold, which contracts and degrades all earthly productions. Man, > however, resists this impression in higher degrees towards the Pole than > trees or plants, since beyond the 68th degree neither tree nor shrub is to > be found, while savages are met with 300 leagues beyond that elevation. His work stirred tremendous controversy in its time and provoked responses from the leading American citizens. An \\"Anti-Degeneracy\\" campaign against the assertions of de Pauw and his colleagues involved such notables such Thomas Jefferson and James Madison. As a renowned scholar, he corresponded with the major philosophes of his time - including Voltaire -, and was asked to contribute articles to the Encyclop√©die. He was the uncle of Anacharsis Cloots, to whom he was also a teacher. De Pauw died in Xanten. Napoleon I of France had an obelisk raised in his memory in Xanten. Criticism De Pauw and his ideas were objects of severe criticism by some of his contemporaries, notably those with experience of the Americas. The Mexican Jesuit Francisco Javier Clavijero, exiled in Bologna, attached a series of \\"Dissertations\\" to his Storia antica del Messico with de Pauw \\"the principal target of my shots.\\" In his history of the rise and fall of the Aztec empire, Clavijero (\\"Francesco Saverio Clavigero\\") of course dealt with the Mesoamerican calendar system, and in the \\"Dissertations\\" he quoted de Pauw's remarks shown above, pointing to the many scholars, European and Indian, who had described the calendar previously. He also showed how to count up to forty-eight million in Nahuatl, listed a number of Nahuatl words for metaphysical and moral concepts, pointed out that the Gospels and Thomas a Kempis's The Imitation of Christ had been translated into Nahuatl, acknowledged his debt to Indian writers such as Ixtlilxochitl, and catalogued authors both European and American born who had written in American languages ranging from Tarahumara to Cakchiquel.Francisco Javier Clavijero, Historia antigua de Mexico, 8th edition, Editorial Porrua, Mexico City, 1987 Another Jesuit exile in Italy, the Chilean Juan Ignacio Molina, accused de Pauw of \\"always attempting to degrade and discredit the Americas\\". Some of de Pauw's statements on the poor aspects of the mineral wealth of the Americas were countered by Molina along with his claims about the shorter lives of their inhabitants.ENSAYO SOBRE LA HISTORIA NATURAL DE CHILE.

He was born in 1792 in Kingston, the son of Robert Macaulay. He was educated in Cornwall at John Strachan's school. In 1812, he established himself as a merchant in Kingston. In 1818, with Alexander Pringle, he purchased the Kingston Gazette, renaming it the Kingston Chronicle. Although the paper prided itself on its independence, it has close ties to the members of the Family Compact. In 1822, Macaulay helped engineer the removal of Barnabas Bidwell from the Legislative Assembly. His paper voiced his views on the importance of developing the Upper Canada economy, including improving internal navigation to help promote commerce. His opinions played an important role in launching the era of canal- building that was to follow. In 1822, he became the agent for the Bank of Upper Canada at Kingston and secretary to James Baby, who was arbitrating the sharing of customs duties between Upper and Lower Canada at the time. In 1835, he was appointed to the Legislative Council for the province and, in 1836, he became surveyor general and a customs arbitrator. He moved to Toronto, then the provincial capital. In 1838, he was appointed inspector general for the province when George Herchmer Markland resigned. Although he had misgivings, he voted for union with Lower Canada. He was re-appointed to the Legislative Council for United Canada; however, because ministers were now expected to hold a seat in the Legislative Assembly, he resigned as inspector general. He suffered a stroke in 1855 and died at Kingston in 1857.

She first appeared in House of M #4 (Sept 2005), and was created by Brian Michael Bendis and Oliver Coipel. Peter David has developed the character, placing Layla at the center of the ensemble of mutant private detectives in his title X-Factor. Fictional character biography =House of M= Layla Miller is first seen as a young mutant girl who lives in Hell‚Äôs Kitchen in New York City. When she wakes up one morning, she finds everything has changed and she is one of a small number of unaffected characters.House of M #4 Layla was instrumental in bringing down the \\"House of M\\" by using her ability to restore the memories of superheroes who rebelled and helped restore reality. Doctor Strange suggested that the Scarlet Witch had created Layla as a failsafe to help the heroes in case something went wrong.House of M #5‚Äì8 =Origin= Contradicting Doctor Strange's theory of her origin, Layla's life prior to the events of House of M has been described: she was a young mutant living in an orphanage where she was teased and bullied by other orphans. However, Layla was shown to have fabricated a large portion of her experiences at the orphanage in order to facilitate her entry into X-Factor Investigations;X-Factor vol. 3 #6 the extent of what really occurred is unknown. When asked, Layla has purported to understand how it is that she \\"knows stuff.\\" She claims that if she were to tell anyone, she would be struck down and die on the spot,X-Factor vol. 3 #6 but since she has proven to be capable of manipulation, the veracity of her contention is in doubt. =X-Factor Investigations= After Layla joins X-Factor Investigations, she helps the other team members in various, indirect ways.

Each time, he is thwarted by Layla, whom Quicksilver comes to consider his nemesis.X-Factor vol. 3 #8 When the rest of the team are discussing their stance in the war, they eventually begin to talk about M-Day. Later it is revealed that she knew the truth about why and how it happened, leaving the other members distrustful of her.X-Factor vol. 3 #9 =Silent War= When the Inhumans come looking for Quicksilver, Layla advises him that Black Bolt isn‚Äôt going to kill him during the confrontation and that he should take a small trip to the future to see the outcome of what happens to them. She and Jamie go to the meeting where she reveals to Jamie that she tried to kill Pietro but couldn‚Äôt because he escaped and that his actions are meant to happen.Silent War #2 =X-Cell and Nicole= A group made up of ex-mutants by the name of X-Cell, who believe the government has depowered mutants, hides in Mutant Town. When Siryn and Monet return from France, they bring an ex-mutant named Nicole, which shocks Layla because she didn‚Äôt know of her arrival. Layla visits Quicksilver, who had restored most of X-Cell's powers. She reveals to Callisto and Marrow that it was he and Wanda Maximoff who caused the Decimation; the government did not depower them, and Pietro has lied. After a failed attempt on Layla's life, Nicole is tripped by Layla and falls in front of a train, which destroys her, revealing she was actually a robot.X-Factor vol. 3 #16-24 Around this time, she is also offered a place among Nick Fury's Secret Warriors by Daisy Johnson but declines, claiming the mutants will need her more.Mighty Avengers #13 =Messiah Complex= Layla goes with one of Jamie's dupes to investigate an alternate future caused by the birth of the mutant messiah.X-Factor vol. 3 #25 While there, they discover that the mutants are living in internment camps.New X-Men vol. 2 #44 While in an internment camp, the mutant scanners alternate between detecting Layla as a mutant and detecting Layla as human.X-Factor vol. 3 #26 They learn from a child version of Bishop that the mutant messiah had caused this world. Layla then proceeds to kill the dupe to send the information back to the original Jamie, leaving her alone and stranded in the future.X-Factor vol. 3 #27 =Divided We Stand= Despite being trapped in an alternate future, Layla is still seen interacting with Jamie as a figment of his imagination. This figment serves as \\"stuff [Jamie] knows deep down\\", appearing in moments of self-realization, such as when Jamie admitted to himself that he knows about Siryn's pregnancy.X-Factor vol. 3 #32 It is implied in Layla's final words in the story‚Äî'but not the right stuff' (in response to Jamie's 'I'm Jamie. I know stuff.')‚Äîas well as her eight days in a trance in the Layla Miller one-shot (after which she whispers the same lines she says to Jamie, 'One of us, One of us') that this 'figment' of Jamie's imagination is actually Layla contacting Jamie to give him some guidance. =The Summers Rebellion= Layla eventually escapes the camp and helps a new mutant called Linqon. After revealing to some people an operation called Operation Purity, which involves every citizen being tested for mutant genes, she goes to Atlantic City and meets up with Cyclops and his daughter Ruby. Together with Ruby, she initiates the Summers Rebellion. Layla is last seen stating that, while she is unsure of the future, she is confident in her ability to \\"know stuff.\\"X-Factor: Layla Miller #1 Layla finds a way back into the past but is now much older than she was before. She pretends to be a nun and works with John Maddox, a duplicate who settled down to raise a family. When she arrives at John's church, she finds Jamie about to kill himself. She stops him and reveals who she really is, much to his shock.X-Factor vol. 3 #40 She reveals herself to be a holographic projection and takes Jamie into the alternate future.X-Factor vol. 3 #41 When Layla and Jamie return to the future, Jamie meets Ruby, who berates Layla for traveling back in time when warned not to. The group is then attacked by Sentinels.X-Factor vol. 3 #42 After Layla and Jamie argue about how they never came for one another, the two finally give into their emotions and share a kiss. Jamie is awkward about starting a relationship with Layla, feeling she is still a child, though Layla tells him she never really was.X-Factor vol. 3 #43 Later, Layla, Jamie and Ruby go find an old, frail Doctor Doom, requesting his help with time travel.X-Factor vol. 3 #44-45 Doom reveals he has met Layla before and informs the trio about Doomlocks. They are then attacked by Sentinels and saved by Trevor Fitzroy.X-Factor vol. 3 #46 They bring the frail Doom back to their stronghold in Atlantic City where she gets into an argument with Cyclops about bringing him with them and Trevor Fitzroy's future.X-Factor vol. 3 #48 Taking Doom to an old lab, he creates a Doomlock and turns on them, bringing forth Cortex, the rogue Madrox dupe. Cortex kills Trevor, and Ruby asks Layla if she can bring him back. Layla reveals that her ability isn't to \\"know stuff\\" but to bring back the dead. There are consequences to bringing back a human: the cost of their soul, conscience and morality. When the battle is over and Layla explains what her powers are to Jamie, they are teleported by a Doomlock back in time and Jamie ends up back with X-Factor while Layla is transported back to before she joined up at X-Factor Investigations. She ends up at the orphanage she lived at before M-Day and, after talking with her younger self, she sets forth the motions that lead her to joining X-Factor by downloading all her knowledge into her younger version's brain, which causes her to pass out and give her the ability to \\"know stuff\\". Layla then gets up and walks away, contemplating what she did to herself. Cryptically, she informs her younger self that while she knows why Doom sent her further back, Jamie will find out in \\"a couple of years\\",X-Factor vol. 3 #50 apparently indicating that much time has elapsed since the current X-Factor series began (since Layla has only been \\"knowing stuff\\" since after the \\"House of M\\" event; prior to this, her ability was to awaken lost memories). =Return to present= Following the disappearance of the Invisible Woman, it is revealed Layla has been living with Dr. Doom in an advisory capacity for a year, awaiting to cross paths with X-Factor while they search for Susan Richards.X-Factor vol. 3 #200-203 During the events of Second Coming, Bastion assigns Bolivar Trask and his Mutant Response Division to target and kill every member of X-Factor Investigations. Arriving at Dublin Airport, Layla and Shatterstar have come to the aid of Theresa Cassidy, who is now going by the codename Banshee. During the confrontation, Layla uses technology acquired from Dr. Doom to combat the MRD soldiers and point Monet in the right direction to help turn the tide of the battle.X-Factor vol. 3 #205-206 After Monet's encounter with Baron Mordo, Layla has an almost violent encounter with Monet who doesn't trust her since finding out about her partnership with Dr. Doom. After Monet faints from exhaustion, she informs Guido that Wolfsbane has returned and joins the rest of X-Factor on a trip to Las Vegas.X-Factor vol. 3 #208-209 When Guido receives a fatal shot while protecting J. Jonah Jameson, the doctors pronounce him dead. But upon their return to the room, he is seen alive with Layla hiding in the closet, suggesting she resurrected Guido. Layla speaks to Guido in the hospital and begins to cry. She cryptically tells Guido she'll find a way to get his soul back. Madrox has figured out that Layla has brought Guido (Strong Guy) back from death at the cost of his soul.X-Factor vol. 3 #217 Shatterstar and Layla have a cryptic conversation about what happened between them during their time together at Doctor Doom's castle in Latveria. Shatterstar asks her if she has ever thought about what happened between them. She replies that she has, but she learned not to give in to her impulses, and he should do the same.X-Factor vol. 3 #226 During a confrontation with Bloodbath, he stops the fight and tells the team that he can steal souls, but makes the team think why he couldn't take Strong Guy's. After being questioned by her teammates, Layla tells the X-Factor team the truth about reviving Strong Guy at the cost of his soul, before chanting a spell that sends Bloodbath to hell.X-Factor vol. 3 #229 She is later sitting in the morgue for days isolating herself from her teammates. Banshee (Siryn) is talking with Wolverine in the background about her behavior. Banshee attempts to console Layla, and Layla tells her to remove her hand or it will end up like Jamie (Madrox). Wolverine talks with her. It turns out that Layla has night terrors from her ordeal being stuck in the future, but they are down to once a week. She has also kept Jamie in a cooler of dry ice, and had a third year med student make repairs on the cadaver. Layla also states she doesn't know what she is waiting for. With the exception of Banshee, none of her teammates are talking to her for what she did to Guido. Wolverine questions how Layla didn't see Madrox's death coming. There is a flashback (flash-forward since it takes place 80 years in an alternate future) that shows Layla writing in a journal that described the outcome if Guido was left dead. She thought she could just ignore it but by reviving Guido it was Jamie who paid the price. Layla tells Wolverine that the reason she is even cryptically telling him this is because like him, she knows in her heart she really is alone in the crowd just like Wolverine.X-Factor vol. 3 #230 After Jamie is brought back from the dead, an ecstatic Layla states that she knew Jamie would be back and that she's wasted too much time and gives into her feelings for him. She proceeds to warm up Jamie from his frozen state by having sex with him. After their tryst, Layla admits to Jamie that she did revive Guido (Strong Guy) and doesn't want to keep any more secrets from him. She proceeds to tell him about the changes in X-Factor Investigations during his time away.X-Factor vol. 3 #233 Monet (M) becomes enraged after seeing Madrox alive, thinking that Layla was responsible for his resurrection. She slams Layla into a brick wall, then flies off with her into the New York skyline. Madrox tells Terry (Banshee/Siryn) to fly after them, but Terry says that if Monet really wanted to hurt her, she would have done it right there. Monet drops her off at the Empire State building and scares the tourists away so she and Layla can have words. Monet says to Layla that she always knows what's going on. Layla states that this is not the case, and she didn't resurrect Jamie (Madrox). She uses the telescope as an example of her not knowing every event as the events get closer and then blackout. Layla then tells Monet that Guido was supposed to have died and not Jamie. She states she wanted to change fate so Monet wouldn't blame herself for Guido's death, which would have resulted in her going through a year-long depression. She wanted to spare Monet, who according to Layla will eventually become her best friend the pain. After hearing all this, Monet leaves Layla so that she could have some space and collect her thoughts.X-Factor vol. 3 #234 Layla also has a hand in being responsible for Terry becoming a true Banshee deity, and leaving the team. Before she could admit to Madrox that she was part of the reason that Terry left X-Factor investigations, Havok steps in and takes the blame. Polaris states that she knew that he covered for her. Havok admits that he wants Layla to be happy. Madrox and Layla later on go to the kitchen for ice cream and Madrox asks Layla if they want to get married. She responds: \\"Okay\\".X-Factor vol. 3 #245 They elope in Las Vegas, but the honeymoon is cut short due to the wedding priest being murdered the same night.X-Factor vol. 3 #247 =Retirement= After the events of the \\"Hell on Earth War\\" storyline, she and Jamie retire to his family farm where they have a child together. Some time later, Jamie goes to Muir Island to investigate the Terrigen Mists and is killed by the M-Pox. Soon afterwards, a different Jamie appears to take care of her and Davey. After a while, Logan reappears, asking her advice on what to do with Cyclops and the missing X-Men. She also encourages the new Jamie to help Cyclops.Uncanny X-Men vol. 5 #11 Powers and abilities Layla has the mutant power to resurrect someone from death, at the cost of their soul. They retain their memories but experience a lack of empathy upon resurrection that is similar to sociopathy. Although this was first hinted at in the conclusion of X-Factor's initial story arc when Layla brought a butterfly back to life, it was not fully expanded upon and explained until much later when Layla resurrected Trevor Fitzroy, knowing full well the murderous villain he would become due to her actions. Layla's most notable ability is to \\"know stuff\\": Layla has extensive knowledge of past and future events, an effect which enables Layla to see paths of causality to their ultimate conclusion and allows her to alter certain events from occurring (referred to as \\"causality\\" in Secret Warriors #1). Initially, the reason for Layla \\"knowing stuff\\" was not explained and presented as a form of precognition. Layla herself, when questioned, would also remain evasive. Layla's knowledge is later revealed to be the result of her older self (time-displaced and aged due to the events of X-Men: Messiah Complex) visiting herself as a child prior to the events of X-Factor vol. 3 #1 and uploading all her knowledge and memories into her younger self's brain. The sheer volume of knowledge was too much for a normal brain to take, and thus resulted in several gaps and blind spots (not knowing that Strong Guy was brainwashed, that Josef Huber's companion Nicole was a robot, or the machinations of Damian Tryp, for example). Layla's foreknowledge is also heavily dependent on what her future self experienced and read from her younger self's journals, and thus she does not know what effects straying from this source might have (as in the case of Madrox's death).X-Factor vol. 3 #228-#230 Layla has above normal scientific knowledge and advanced weaponry due to her partnership with and tutelage under Dr. Doom.X-Factor vol. 3 #200-202 One such device that Layla now regularly employs is a power gauntlet capable of various effects such as force fields,X-Factor vol. 3 #205 giant saws,X-Factor vol. 3 #206 and energy blasts.X-Factor vol. 3 #211 Additionally, her time with Dr. Doom has imparted on her a basic knowledge of magic and mysticism, and Layla has been shown to be capable of performing exorcisms and the working of basic spells.X-Factor vol. 3 #228 During House of M, Layla was immune to the memory alteration created by the Scarlet Witch and thus was aware that reality had been altered. Layla also had the ability to \\"awaken\\" heroes and allow them to remember their lives before the reality warp. This ability was also distinct enough that Rogue was able to absorb and use it similar to other superhuman abilities. Layla has not exhibited any of these abilities since the House of M storyline. Writer Peter David addressed this disparity with Layla's powers in the letter column of X-Factor vol. 3 #231: \\"Layla... We've seen her powers spelled out more in the past few issues than any other time in the past. I wouldn't get too hung up on HoM (House of M) if I were you since she's very different from what she was.\\" Other versions =Ultimate Marvel= In Ultimate Mystery, Dr. Layla Miller is a member of the Roxxon Brain Trust. Nothing else is known about her except that she \\"knows stuff\\".Ultimate Comics: Mystery #3 She is in the middle of a meeting when she is made aware that Alex Summers is in the Roxxon building. It's shown she specializes in acquiring resources for Roxxon.Ultimate Comics: X-Men #12 (May, 2012) She is also responsible for giving powers to Cloak and Dagger.

He grew up in Howrah district of West Bengal. Personal life Sankar is the son of Avaya Mukherjee known as Gouri Mukherjee. Sankar's father died while Sankar was still a teenager, as a result of which Sankar became a clerk to the last British barrister of the Calcutta High Court, Noel Frederick Barwell. At the same time he entered in Surendranath College (formerly Ripon College, Calcutta) for study. He worked in various field as typewriter cleaner, private tutor, Hawker for the livelihood. Literary career Mukherjee in 2019 Noel Barwell introduced Sankar to literature. After Noel Barwell's sudden death, Sankar, the professional version of his name adopted for the law courts, sought to honor Barwell. \\"First, I wanted to build a statue. It was not possible. I then wanted to name a road. Even that was not feasible. And then I decided to write a book about him,\\" according to Sankar. That impetus led to his first novel, about Barwell, that according to some critics is perhaps the most stimulating -- \\"Kato Ajanare\\" (So Much Unknown). At the same time period in 1962, Sankar conceived Chowringhee on a rainy day at the waterlogged crossing of Central Avenue and Dalhousie - a busy business district in the heart of Kolkata. The novel, set in the opulent hotel he called Shahjahan, was made into a cult movie in 1968. It is wrongly said that Sankar marketed his literary work to Bengali households with the marketing slogan \\"A bagful of Sankar (Ek Bag Sankar)\\" and collections of his books were sold in blue packets through this marketing effort. He never did that. He mentioned it clearly in a 2015 interview. In addition to his literary efforts, Sankar is regarded as a street food expert with two books on this topic.

Tugia won the Cakaudrove West Open Constituency for the Conservative Alliance (CAMV) at the parliamentary election of 2001, defeating the incumbent Laitia Toroki of the Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei (SVT).

The species was first described by Johann Siegfried Hufnagel in 1766. It is distributed throughout Europe, east across the Palearctic to Central Asia and to China and Japan. It also occurs in North America (Labrador to Virginia, west across Canada, south to Minnesota). This moth has a wingspan of 36 to 42 mm. The forewings are brown with mostly indistinct markings except for the narrow black mark at the base of the wing which gives the species its common name. The hindwings are greyish brown, darker towards the margins, with prominent dark venation. This moth flies at night and is attracted to light and sugar. Technical description and variation Caterpillar Forewing dull lilac grey, flushed with fawn colour, especially in median area; a black, semibifid streak from base below cell; lines brownish, double, indistinct; the median shade dark grey or fawn colour, diffuse and prominent; orbicular stigma pale, black-edged; reniform large with grey centre, blackish in lower lobe, with pale annulus and black outline; claviform small, with dark outline; submarginal line dull, with darker shades in places on each side; hindwing greyish fuscous, paler towards base; ‚Äî in basistriga Stgr. the ground colour is bluish grey except the median area, and the black basal streak is stronger; this form is recorded from western Turkestan, eastern Siberia, Japan, and China, also from Norway; a small series from Pescocostanzo, Italy, seems referable here; ‚Äî ab. grisescens Stgr. from Tibet and Turkestan is altogether paler and greyer; ‚Äî ab. unicolor Tutt is a melanistic form from the north of England, in which the ground is dark reddish brown with a purplish tinge, the stigmata and lines more or less obscured; hindwing much darker; ‚Äî pallida Tutt and cinerascens Tutt are both grey forms without any rufous admixture, the former being pale ochreous grey, and the latter dull ashy grey, the one from Ireland, the other from northern England; this latter form probably occurs, however, in other localities, and is distinct from Staudinger's Central Asiatic form grisescens, for which Spuler quotes Finland and Esthland with a ? as localities. .Seitz, A.

Although used regularly as a port-of-call since before World War II, a permanent RAN presence was not established until 1971, when a maintenance and support base for patrol boats was set up. The base was formally commissioned in 1971 as a minor war vessel base. The current commander of the base is Commander David Hannah, RAN. HMAS Cairns is responsible for all Australian naval activity off north-eastern Australia, and is the home base for one Armidale class patrol boat, two Cape class patrol boats and the ships of the Royal Australian Navy Hydrographic Service. History The RAN had been using Cairns as a regular stop since before World War II, and during the war, Cairns was the principal port-of-call for many ships prior to heading to Pacific destinations. There was no official RAN presence in Cairns until 1971, when facilities for the maintenance of the RAN's patrol boats were established. In 1974, HMAS Cairns was commissioned as the parent establishment for patrol vessels and hydrographic ships based at Cairns. In 2016 the Australian Government announced plans to significantly redevelop Cairns as northern Australia's key strategic naval base. The plans announced projected that the number of personnel would increase from 900 to 3,000 by 2020, via an 120 million injection over ten years. Facilities and operational units Cairns is currently responsible for all Australian naval activity from Rockhampton to Thursday Island and serves as a home base for one of the navy's thirteen Armidale class patrol boats and two Cape class patrol boats. The base also berths the RAN's entire hydrographic fleet, consisting of two Leeuwin class survey vessels and four Paluma class survey motor launches.

Situated on Bedford Street in Belfast city centre, the hall hosts concerts, classical recitals, craft fairs and political party conferences.  History  The Ulster Hall in an empty Bedford Street, c. 1890 Built in 1859 and opened in 1862, the hall's purpose was to provide the expanding city of Belfast with a multi-purpose venue of sufficient size. It was designed by William J. Barre (also responsible for the Albert Clock) for the Ulster Hall Company. On its opening night on 12 May 1862, the hall was described by the local press as: > stand[ing] unexcelled, and all but unrivalled, as an edifice for the > production of musical works. ... the hall is a great and unmingled success, > and the public, no less than the proprietors, may feel the utmost > gratification at a result at once so pleasant and so rare.(The Belfast News > Letter, 1862) > a music hall fit for the production of any composition, and for the > reception of any artist, however eminent (The Northern Whig, 14 May 1862) In 1902 the hall was purchased by Belfast City Council (then named the Belfast Corporation) for ¬£13,500 and it has been used as a public hall ever since. During World War II it was used as a dance hall to entertain American troops stationed in Northern Ireland. = Mulholland Grand Organ = The Ulster Hall features one of the oldest examples of a functioning classic English pipe organ. The Mulholland Grand Organ is named in honour of former Mayor of Belfast, Andrew Mulholland, who donated ¬£3000 to the hall toward its cost in the 1860s. It was built by William Hill & Son and donated after the hall was officially opened. In the late 1970s, the organ was extensively restored to Hill's own original design. Mullholland's great-great-grandson, Henry Mulholland, 4th Baron Dunleath, oversaw the restoration. = Joseph Carey's Belfast scenes = In 1902, Belfast City Council commissioned the local artist Joseph W. Carey to produce thirteen scenes from Belfast history on canvas, to be mounted within the Ulster Hall. The scenes depict the city and the surrounding area, incorporating historical and mythological influences. The paintings were restored in 1989 and again, by Kiffy Stainer-Hutchins & Co., King's Lynn, in 2009 (see 2007‚Äì2009 refurbishment, below). =Notable performances= The hall has hosted a massive variety of acts during its history, including readings by Charles Dickens and performances by actors, pop, opera, rock acts and singers. alt=AC/DC guitarist Angus Young (in requisite school blazer, hat and shorts) and lead singer Bon Scott (in black trousers and topless) in an energetic performance on stage. *The hall was the first venue in which Led Zeppelin performed their iconic song, \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" live, on 5 March 1971. *Rory Gallagher performed in the Ulster Hall numerous times throughout his career.

John Simcoe Macaulay (13 October 1791 - 20 December 1855) was a businessman and political figure in Upper Canada. In 1845, before retiring to England, he donated the land on which the Church of the Holy Trinity (Toronto) was built. Early life He was born in England in 1791, the son of James Macaulay and Elizabeth Tuck Hayter. His parents came to Upper Canada in 1792, enjoying the patronage of Lieutenant-Governor Sir John Graves Simcoe, who was also his godfather and for whom he was named. Macaulay grew up in York and attended John Strachan's school in Cornwall. In 1805, he went to England to study at the Royal Military Academy in Woolwich. He became a Captain in the Royal Engineers and served with them during the Peninsular War, seeing action at the Battle of Barrosa. He remained with his regiment until 1827, when he was appointed Professor of Fortification at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. Toronto Macaulay's home, Elmsley Villa, c.1840; afterwards the Governor's residence When he resigned in 1835, he returned to York, Upper Canada, which had been renamed Toronto the previous year, to manage his inheritance. He made his home at Elmsley House, which had belonged (though he never lived there) to his father-in-law, and was afterwards lived in by James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin. Macauley became a director of the Bank of Upper Canada. In 1836, he was appointed Surveyor-General for Upper Canada by the new Lieutenant-Governor, Sir Francis Bond Head. The appointment was disputed because the candidate favoured by the Family Compact had been ignored and others did not consider Macaulay a genuine resident of the province. Head advised Macaulay to submit his resignation to the Colonial Secretary, expecting it to be refused, but it was accepted and John Macaulay, no relation, was appointed to the post instead. In 1839, he was elected to the Legislative Council of Upper Canada. Two years later, he was elected to the Toronto city council but, again frustrated by the Family Compact, he resigned after Henry Sherwood was elected mayor instead of him. Family In 1825, at Croydon in Surrey, he had married Anne Gee Elmsley, the eldest daughter of The Hon. John Elmsley, Chief Justice of Upper Canada, by his wife Mary, daughter of Captain Benjamin Hallowell (1723-1799) R.N., of Roxbury; the Commissioner of Customs for the Port of Boston at the time of the Boston Tea Party. Mrs Macaulay's mother was from a distinguished Boston family, but as a Loyalist her grandfather had lost his estates at both Roxbury and Maine, as well as all his possessions, and was sentenced to death if he ever stepped foot in Boston again. On that side, Mrs Macaulay was a niece of Admiral Sir Benjamin Hallowell-Carew, of Beddington Park, Surrey, and his brother Ward Hallowell (who was later known as Ward Nicholas Boylston), a great benefactor of Harvard University; they were two of the nephews of Governor Moses Gill. Mrs Macaulay's maternal grandmother, Mary (Boylston) Hallowell, was a first cousin of Susanna Boylston, the mother of the 2nd President of the United States, John Adams, and grandmother of the 6th President, John Quincy Adams. Wykeman Lodge Macaulay built his home in 1840s near Bay and College in what is now College Park.http://urbantoronto.ca/news/2010/07/heritage-toronto-mondays- wickham-lodge-1916 The land was acquired by his father on arriving in York. http://www.lostrivers.ca/content/points/wykeham.html Following his death the home went to Bishop Strachan School in 1870, then as Central Convalescent Hospital and finally as an armoury before giving way to Eaton's College store. Retirement Holy Trinity Church, c.1870. Built on land donated by John Simcoe Macaulay in 1845 In 1845, disgruntled by political life in Toronto, Macaulay sold his property there for a profit of ¬£21,000. He donated part of the gardens (known as Macaulay's Fields) of the home in which he had grown up in to the Anglican Church, where in 1847 the Church of the Holy Trinity, was built. Macaulay moved with his family to England. They took up residence at Rede Court, near Rochester, not far from Macaulay's first cousin, General George William Powlett Bingham C.B., J.P., of The Vines, Rochester. He died there in 1855, and his wife survived him until 1862. They were the parents of eight surviving children. None of their daughters married, and they all lived together in Torquay. One son lived in England, another in Toronto, another in South Africa and another in New Zealand.

The Michel's Patisserie franchise network is owned and managed by Retail Food Group (RFG), which also manages Gloria Jeans Coffee, Brumby's Bakeries and Donut King. History Michel's Patisserie is a wholly Australian-owned firm, which Noel Carroll and Noel Roberts founded in 1988. Their business model involves a central bakery that bakes products and distributing said products to retail outlets on a daily basis. These retail outlets act as points of sale, from where customers may purchase the products on display. After two years of research into all facets of the concept, distribution, store design and layout, marketing, and training, the model was tested under full market conditions in stores located in Castlecrag and Newport before being launched as a franchise system in 1990. The franchise reportedly won the 2007 Churner of the year award. In February 2006, Michel's Patisserie conducted a management buyout and merged with its master franchisee in Queensland and Victoria to create a single national franchise business.

A progressive squeeze is a triple squeeze that, depending both on entries and on positional factors, may result in a subsequent, simple, two-suit squeeze that takes place against the opponent who has just been triple squeezed. Confusing the issue is that some triple squeezes can become progressive squeezes through misdefense. Example: Triple squeeze with potential misdefense Here is an example of a triple squeeze that should not become progressive: South, pushed to 5 by the nonvulnerable opponents, ruffs the second diamond lead and runs hearts to reach this position: South cannot be prevented from winning six more tricks, and if West isn't careful South will win all seven. When South leads his last heart, West is triple-squeezed and must discard the Q to stop the overtrick. Now South discards dummy's 2 and crosses to the A. Dummy's 9 is cashed, South discards the 5, and West lets go the 10. South can now cash two clubs and a spade but must give up either a spade or a club at the end. If West discarded from a black suit when South cashed the final heart, the position would progress to another squeeze, of the simple squeeze variety. The reason that this does not occur after the Q is discarded on the 9 is that a squeezed position requires that at least one threat sit over the squeezed opponent. After West discards, say, the 10 on the 9, dummy discards a small club, keeping dummy's 9 as a threat sitting over West's Q. Now South can cash the A, the K and the 9 to effect another squeeze, a simple two-suit squeeze in spades and diamonds, against West. But if West discards the Q on South's final heart, South cannot arrange for a threat to sit over West's black suit holdings, a progressive squeeze cannot mature, and South is held to the one additional trick he gets from the triple squeeze. One threat opposite the squeeze card Clyde Love, in his classic book on squeeze play,Love, Clyde. Bridge Squeezes Complete, Dover Publications, 1959 classifies triple squeezes according to the number of threats opposite the squeeze card. (This article assumes, for consistency, that it is always South who holds the squeeze card.) In the example given above, only one threat, the 9, was opposite the squeeze card, the 9, and West was squeezed. In that case, and if West defends correctly, this triple squeeze cannot become a progressive squeeze. Again with North holding one threat, the triple squeeze will become a progressive squeeze against East if the necessary entry conditions are present: both North and South have entries in their own threat suits. In the following example, North holds one threat card (the 9), and East is to be triple-squeezed. Given those conditions, and with the J as an entry to South's 4 and the Q as an entry to the 9, the triple squeeze must always work as a progressive squeeze against East: At notrump, South plays the 3 and dummy discards the 4. East is triple squeezed, and regardless of his discard South can squeeze him in his two remaining suits, to win all five tricks. Two threats opposite the squeeze card The situation is different if North has not one but two threats, accompanied by at least one entry. Then, the triple squeeze succeeds against an opponent, either one, who guards all three suits, with one exception. The exception occurs when North's entry is in South's threat suit, and South has no entry in any threat suit: then, East cannot be triple-squeezed. For example, West is squeezed on the lead of the 2: and the squeeze also succeeds against East: Although with North holding two threats the triple squeeze always succeeds against East, it can never mature as a progressive squeeze. It will always become a progressive squeeze against West, however, if South and North each has an entry in their own threat suit(s). For example: Notice that the triple squeeze succeeds and is progressive against West. But if East's and West's holdings are swapped, the triple squeeze succeeds, but does not become progressive if East defends correctly.

The formula is (P+C+M)/3, where P is the nation's percentage of the total population of all UN members, C is that nation's percentage of the total contributions to the UN budget, and M, the nation's percentage of the total UN membership (which of course would be the same for all members); divide that sum by 3 to get the average. Under this system, the nations with the greatest voting power would be the U.S. (9.065%); China (7.672%); Japan (7.282%); and India (5.960%). This system avoids giving microstates disproportionate influence (as under one state, one vote) while also avoiding giving a coalition of populous developing countries such as China and India control over the UN, as might happen under one man, one vote. It is important in the calculation of C (Nation's contributions to the UN budget) that only actual paid contributions be counted rather than owed contributions in arrears, since some major nations are very significantly in arrears in their payment of their agreed level of United Nations dues.

The name was also used for the district (kecamatan) of the same name in the City of Yogyakarta. Kotagede contains the remains of the first capital of Mataram Sultanate, established in the 16th century. Some of the remains of the old Kotagede are remains of the palace, the royal cemetery, the royal mosque, and defensive walls and moats. Kotagede is well known internationally by its silver crafting. History =Royal city and pilgrimages= Kotagede was previously a forest named Mentaok, to the east of Gajah Wong River. During the last quarter of the 16th century, the ruler of the Islamic Kingdom of Pajang, about 100 kilometers to the east of this site, awarded the forest to Ki Ageng Pemanahan, one of his courtiers who successfully put down a rebellion. Pemanahan opened the forest with his son Danang Sutawijaya, who was also an adoptive son of the ruler. A settlement was established and was named Mataram as Pemanahan himself was called Ki Gedhe Mataram, \\"the Lord of Mataram\\". Ruins of the inner wall of Kotagede. After Pemanahan's death in 1575, Danang Sutawijaya announced himself king of Mataram with the title of Panembahan Senapati Ingalaga, \\"the Lord to Whom Obeisance is Paid, Commander in the Battlefield.\\"Information board in Malang Traditional Security Post, Kotagede He expanded his territory by conquering some major parts of Java, including Pajang, the capital of his adoptive father. The small town became the capital of Mataram and perhaps since then it was dubbed Kotagede, \\"Great City\\". During this time the town was fortified with walls. The western wall was built along Gajah Wong River, channeled to water the moats on three other sides of the fort. To successfully govern a territory, Senapati also established alliance with supernatural power by performing austere meditation. According to Babad Mangkubumi, while performing a meditation on a stone in the middle of a river in between mount Merapi and the Indian Ocean, a gigantic mythical fish named Tunggulwulung offered Senapati a ride to venture south of the ocean where the most powerful spirit of Java governed the netherworld, named Kangjeng Ratu Kidul. Overwhelmed by the aura of Senapati, the queen offered support for his great efforts to conquer the people of Java. She even presented herself to be his consort, as well as to all his reigning descendants, up to present.Babad Tanah Jawi by Dr. J.J. Ras - (34:100 - 36:1) A prince named Mas Jolang succeeded Senapati in 1601. During his 12 years of reign, he carried out many construction projects within the palace and the surrounding area, the most important building he constructed in the palace was Prabayeksa. Archeologist Willem Frederik Stutterheim notes the importance of this central building since the pre-Islamic Majapahit. In the contemporary palace of Yogyakarta this name refers to a gigantic fully enclosed wooden building serving as the inner sanctum of this kingly abode where most magically charged heirloom and weapons are stored. Jolang also initiated the construction of a number of Taman (enclosed pleasure garden). Jolang was remembered in his posthumous name as Panembahan Seda Krapyak (\\"Lord Who Died during Hunting (in Hunting Lodge)\\") because he was reputedly killed by a deer while hunting in his krapyak (enclosed hunting forest). Jolang's successor to the throne was Mas Rangsang (rule 1613-1645) better known as Sultan Agung Hanyakrakusuma, \\"The Great Sultan, Ruler of the Universe\\". He expanded his territory to include Central and East Java. He attacked Batavia twice although to no avail. Sultan Agung decided to leave Kotagede to a place called Kerta, about 5 km south of Kotagede, while initiating the construction of a new capital with much greater walls nearby named Plered. The capital of Mataram moved several times afterwards only to return later to a location near Kotagede. From Kerta it was relocated to Plered by Agung's son Mangkurat I. Only one generation settled in Plered before the fall of this city after being defeated by some contenders of Mangkurat I in 1677. After the rebellion had been put down, his successor Mangkurat II, decided to establish a new capital named Kartasura 50 km to the east. Chinese riots in Batavia turned into turmoil in many major parts of Java during the first half of the 18th century. The rebel leader, Sunan Kuning, occupied the throne of Mataram in Kartasura after Pakubawana II had left the capital in defeat. Pakubuwana II later regained his kingdom, but the throne had been tarnished, and so a new palace had to be established to have a purified center. In 1745 he created a new place which became the heart of the city of Surakarta. Unlike many other parts of Java, some ancestral lands including Kotagede were indivisible because they were regarded as a kind of heirloom rather than measurable territory. The cemetery and mosque were guarded by officials from both courts and the surrounding lands were assigned as appanage to sustain the life of these officials. As the political power shifted, Kotagede became principally a pilgrimage town with its royal mausoleum and other sites associated with the initial establishment of Mataram kingdom. =Colonial era= Silversmiths of Kotagede in the 1930s. By the end of the 19th century, transportation and monetization of the agricultural economy improved. Kotagede's merchant prosper during this era. Walled merchant houses called Kalang houses appeared during this era, constructed in thick masonry walls to protect the accumulated possessions. These traditional merchant houses sometimes combine element from Dutch architecture which was considered luxurious, producing an eclectic architecture. Silverware flourished during this era. =Religious reform= Islamic reform emerged during the first quarter of the 20th century. Some local religious leaders established a religious organization named Syarikatul Mubtadi (The Union of the Beginners) intended to educate the people of Kotagede the \\"true\\" Islamic ways of life. This initial movement grew much more expensive with the introduction of Muhammadiyah, a Yogyakarta-based Islamic reform organization. This reform aims at introducing rationality and Islamic teaching to the society of Kotagede, which is considered to be superstitious. Masjid Perak (Silver Mosque) was constructed in 1940 on the major streets of Kotagede. =Present= A joglo of the Omah UGM, one of the restored joglo in Kotagede after the 2006 Yogyakarta earthquake. Indonesia experienced \\"tourism booming\\" at the beginning of the 1970s and it brought positive influence for Kotagede. A number of old houses were developed as craft showrooms and restaurants. Ruins are preserved. Many old buildings in Kotagede were destroyed following the 2006 Yogyakarta earthquake. A revitalization program of Kotagede was initiated by Pusaka Jogja Bangkit! (\\"Yogyakarta Heritage Revival!\\"). Collaborative parties consist of the Jogja Heritage Society, the Center for Heritage Conservation, Department of Architecture and Planning at Gajah Mada University, the Indonesian Network for Heritage Conservation, ICOMOS Indonesia, and other supporting institutions including the local community. Today, Kotagede is still considered the site of origin with supernatural power being the focus of ancestral blessings and prosperity. Administration Administratively, the Kotagede area is divided into three villages (Kelurahans): Prenggan and Purbayan belong to Kotagede District (kecamatan) within the City of Yogyakarta, and Jagalan belongs to Banguntapan District (kecamatan) which is within Bantul Regency. Town planning The original town planning of Kotagede were similar with the Majapahit town planning: a fourfold configuration of Mosque-Palace-Market-Square called catur gatra tunggal, surrounded by defensive walls: cepuri (inner wall) and baluwerti (outer wall). The Market and Square were primarily open space, while the Mosque and Palace were walled compounds each containing many buildings. The town is more accurately described as a city-palace. There are very few physical remains of the palace and city. Parts that have survived include the Kotagede ancient great mosque, the royal cemetery (precursor to Imogiri) and some sections of the original city walls. The great mosque and the royal cemetery are now located in an area called Dondongan. Toponyms indicate many traces of the initial urban planning of the town. A neighborhood called Alun- alun is situated to the south of the market, right in front of the great mosque. A place called Dalem (inner house) signifies its former designation as residence of the ruler. =Kedhaton (the royal palace)= The Kedhaton, (also Kedaton), or \\"royal palace\\", existed on the site in 1509. Nowadays, the only remains of the royal palace are three stones, each called batu gilang (\\"glittering stone\\"), batu gatheng (\\"gatheng (stone-throwing game) stone\\"), and batu genthong (\\"water barrel stone\\"). At present, the stones are protected inside a small building, located in the middle of the road and surrounded by three banyan trees.Information bar on the building. Batu gilang (also watu gilang) is a square-shaped black slab of stone believed to be the stone where Panembahan Senopati rested. Inscribed circularly on it are the words: \\"So Goes the World\\", each in Latin, French, Dutch, and Italian: Ita movetur Mundus - Ainsi va le Monde - Zoo gaat de wereld - Cosi va il Mondo. On the outside, the Latin words in circle say: AD ATERN AMMEMORIAM INFELICS - IN FORTUNA CONSOERTES DIGNI VALETE QUIDSTPERIS INSANI VIDETE IGNARI ET RIDETE, CONTEMNITE VOS CONSTEMTU - IGM (In Glorium Maximam). Batu gatheng (also watu cantheng) are three pale yellowish stone balls of different sizes placed on a stone slab. These balls are believed by the locals to be the playing stones of Raden Rongo, the son of Panembahan Senapati. Others claim that the stones are cannonballs. Batu genthong is believed to be the stone for containing the water used for Islamic ritual ablution. It is used by royal advisors of Panembahan Senopati: Ki Juru Mertani and Ki Ageng Giring. =Masjid gede (the great mosque)= The great mosque (Masjid gede) of Kotagede is the largest monument attributed to the kingdom of Mataram, therefore it is nowadays called the Mataram Mosque. The mosque was first established in 1575, the death year of Ki Ageng Pemanahan. The first major rebuilding was carried out during the reign of Sultan Agung to honor his ancestors. Rulers of Mataram, Surakarta and Yogyakarta conducted several rehabilitation later on. The last major rebuilding was performed in 1926 under the order of Sunan Pakubuwana X after this mosque had been caught in fire. The mosque was built in traditional Javanese architecture. It consists of a pair of buildings: the main prayer hall and a front hall commonly called serambi. The prayer hall is a building of thick plain walls, while the serambi is a porch-like semi-attached building. Surrounding the porch is a moat to enable one to dip his or her feet before reaching the serambi, symbolically purifying anything that enters the mosque. The mosque is situated right to the east of the royal cemetery. The mosque area is a vast yard of sawo kecik (Manilkara kauki) trees, the two main buildings cover less than one tenth of the entire area. A gate separates the great mosque and the royal cemetery complex. The area before the gate is called the Sendang Seliran complex. =Royal cemetery= Hastorenggo cemetery, a 1930s cemetery complex for the descendants of royal family of Kraton Yogyakarta. The royal cemetery is named Makam Kota Gede (in Indonesian) or formally (Pasareyan) Hasta Kitha Ageng (in Javanese).Information bar on Jalan Masjid Besar, near the entrance of the Hasta Kitha Ageng. It is located to the west of the Great Mosque. It is the most intact part of Kotagede. Chronicles mention that Senapati's father, Ki Gedhe Mataram, was buried to the west of the mosque and Senapati himself was buried to the south of the mosque, in the direction of his father's feet. Other important people buried in the cemetery include Sultan Hadiwijaya. The cemetery is guarded and maintained by Juru Kunci who are employed by the two palaces of Yogyakarta and Surakarta. The portal to the cemetery has the feature of Hindu architecture, each portal contains a thick wooden handle heavily decorated with carvings. The walled cemetery does not act as a physical protection of the graves and their adornments, the enclosures separate the realm of the dead from those of the living. Another royal cemetery nearby is the Hastorenggo cemetery. Built in 1934, it is a royal cemetery for the certain descendants of the Yogyakarta palace and is still used today. =Alun-alun (square)= 16th century Javanese city square of Kotagede. Being an open field, there is no remain of the alun-alun. A present kampung (neighborhood) called \\"Alun-alun\\" is situated to the south of the market, right in front of the great mosque, signifying where the former alun-alun was. Another kampung called Cokroyudan is also located close to the former alun-alun. The kampungs of Alun-alun and Cokroyudan has been designated a heritage neighborhood under the name \\"Kampung Pusaka Alun- alun Cokroyudan\\". =Market place= Kotagede's marketplace is situated in the middle of the town, at the juncture of its four main streets. It is considered an important part of the town that Kotagede was also known as Pasar Gede (\\"Great Market\\") or in short, Sargede. Since Panembahan Senapati bore the youth name of Ngabehi Loring Pasar, \\"Lord of the North of the Market\\", the market's existence is as old as the kingdom. Similar to the Roman Forum, the market is also a meeting place. Legi, a day in Javanese week, is the market day for Kotagede, and so the market is also known as Pasar Legi or Sarlegi. The Pasar Legi of Kotagede is always held on Legi, unique in Yogyakarta. =Defensive wall= Panembahan Senopati built the inner city wall (cepuri) completed with the moat around the palace. This inner walls covered an area of more or less 400x400 meters. Ruins can still be seen on the southwest and southeast corner. The wall was 4 feet thick and made of stone blocks. The moat can be seen on the East, South, and West. The outer city wall (baluwerti) is located to the south of the Batu Gilang site. The brick ruins is 50 meter long with remnants of the moat. Bokong Semar is the name for the remain of the southeast corner of the city wall. It is a circular bastion, the name Bokong Semar (Semar's buttocks) is inspired from its rounded shape. Kotagede neighborhood Townscape in Kotagede neighborhood consists of traditional wooden joglo houses and the eclectic merchant houses. Merchant houses in Kotagede are walled to protect their accumulating possessions during the 18th-19th century wealthy period of Kotagede. These merchant houses sometimes combine the element from the wooden traditional Javanese house with the brick Dutch architecture to form an eclectic blend of Javanese-Dutch architecture known locally as \\"Kalang Houses\\". Some neighborhood contains narrow alleyways bordered with brick houses similar to European medieval cities. The silver crafts' houses can be found around the mosque while their galleries along the Kemasan street. =Jagalan= Kelurahan Jagalan, an area in Kotagede, contains a number of historic joglo houses, a traditional Javanese pavilion, and some eclectic Kalang Houses. The oldest joglo in the area is from the 1750s. They are protected as heritage sites. Another form of traditional Javanese architecture is the langgar dhuwur (family mosque). Langgar dhuwur is a family prayer house located in the attic of several traditional houses in Kotagede. Langgar Dhuwur is built with wooden construction and is supported by wall column. Previously, the placements of many langgar dhuwur formed a series that encircled the Mataram Royal Palace in Kotagede. Presently, only two langgar dhuwur remains, both are privately owned.Information bar in the wall of the Jagalan's Langgar Dhuwur. During the 2006 Yogyakarta earthquake many of the traditional houses were destroyed. Some joglo houses were rebuilt, one example is Omah UGM, a joglo that was purchased by Gajah Mada University and rebuilt accordingly.Information bar in front of Omah UGM. Culture Kotagede is well known for its silver crafts. It is also known for other Javanese crafts and arts (gold, silver, copper, leather, etc.) and local food (kipo, legomoro, etc.) Performing arts include karawitan (local gamelan music groups), syalawatan (Islamic music group), mocopat (Javanese poetry reading), kroncong, tingklung wayang puppet, and offering ceremonies on special days (caos) and leading an ascetic religious life (tirakatan). =Silver crafts= Kotagede silversmiths grew since the establishment of Kotagede as the capital of Mataram. During that time, the traditional silver, gold and copper industries began to develop, dominated by the use of repouss√© (embossing) techniques. The products of this region were to fulfill the need of household and ceremonial equipment for the royal family. During the colonial period of the 1930s, silverworks and silver handicrafts prospered in Kotagede. The Dutch colonial government established the Stichting Beverding van het Yogyakarta Kent Ambacht to protect the silverwork of Kotagede. Filigree technique enters Kotagede around 1950 under the influence of craftsmen from Kendari, Sulawesi. According to local silversmiths, Sastro Dimulyo with his company \\"SSO\\" was the pioneer for introducing filigree technique in Kotagede. Kotagede's silverware is characterized with its floral motifs, e.g. leaf or lotus flower, based from the Hindu tradition; and their manual labor, kept historically authentic. Types of silverware produced by Kotagede are filigrees, silver-casting, sculptures (miniatures), and handmade products (necklaces, rings). Jalan Kemasan, the main street leading into town from the north, is lined with silver workshops selling hand-beaten bowls, boxes, fine filigree and modern jewellery .

History The union considers itself to be Marxist-Leninist, and has had a fraught relationship with the South African Communist Party (SACP), which it considers to be no longer adhering to Marxist-Leninist principles.Numsa‚Äôs Response To The SA Communist Party (SACP). National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa website. Dated 17 December 2014. Post-1994, NUMSA became known within the Tripartite Alliance between COSATU, the SACP and the ruling African National Congress (ANC) for its refusal to remain silent on controversial ANC policies, especially its promotion of privatisation and its failure to end mass poverty in the country. As of 2013, the union has over 340,000 members throughout South Africa. =Rejection of ANC and SACP= At the conclusion on 20 December 2013 of a special national congress held in Boksburg, NUMSA withdrew support from the ANC and SACP altogether, and called for an alternative movement of the working class. The union stated that it would not endorse any political party in the 2014 South African general election, but that individual members were free to campaign for the party of their choice, provided they do so in their own time using their own resources. It called for COSATU to break from the Tripartite Alliance and form a united front of left-wing forces similar to the United Democratic Front (UDF) during the struggle against Apartheid. As part of this, it called a conference for 2014 to explore the possibility of establishing a new workers' socialist party. NUMSA remained a COSATU affiliate until 8 November 2014, although it resolved to cease its R800 000 monthly subscription fee payments to the federation. In December, 2013 the union also said it would also stop paying contributions to the South African Communist Party (SACP). Up until that time they had been paying the SACP R1-million a year. It has issued a call for the resignation of Jacob Zuma as President of South Africa. =Rejection of the EFF and WASP= The union also distanced itself from Julius Malema and his Economic Freedom Fighters citing concerns about corruption, authoritarianism and a limited conception of anti-capitalism. It has also been critical of the Workers and Socialist Party (WASP). The entrance to the 10th National Congress meeting of NUMSA in 2016. =Expulsion from COSATU= In the early hours of the morning of 8 November 2014, after an \\"excruciating\\" 15-hour debate, the delegates of COSATU's Central Executive Committee (CEC) voted 3324 in favour of expelling NUMSA from the trade union federation. After the vote was announced, a row occurred when COSATU president Sdumo Dlamini told the NUMSA CEC delegates to leave the meeting, but general secretary Zwelinzima Vavi intervened, citing the COSATU constitution to argue NUMSA would need to be informed in writing of its expulsion before it became valid. This did not calm matters, with both sides becoming ever more frustrated until the NUMSA delegates walked out and NUMSA secretary general Irvin Jim announced the union's expulsion to journalists waiting outside COSATU House. The meeting was adjourned shortly after without the remaining items on the agenda having been discussed. The Democratic Left Front (DLF) has stated that NUMSA's expulsion \\"brings an end to Cosatu as a fighting trade union\\" and that \\"Cosatu will degenerate further into essentially a sweetheart and bureaucratised union\\". Jim has stated that \\"the fight is not over\\" and has outlined a strategy of mobilising the union's membership, and the membership of other COSATU unions, to fight its expulsion from COSATU. This may involve court action. He stated that the union will not abandon its plans of launching a united front of left- wing forces to oppose the ANC. Frans Baleni, the general secretary of the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), meanwhile \\"pleaded\\" with NUMSA to apologise to COSATU, but Jim has called Baleni a \\"hypocrite\\" who \\"led the fight against Numsa\\".

He has written and edited 30 books, including three college textbooks. He has also authored six New York Times bestsellers. He is currently the James A. Gray Distinguished Professor of Religious Studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Early life Ehrman grew up in Lawrence, Kansas, and attended Lawrence High School, where he was on the state champion debate team in 1973. He began studying the Bible, Biblical theology and Biblical languages at Moody Bible Institute, where he earned the school's three-year diploma in 1976.Ehrman, Bart D. Misquoting Jesus, HarperSanFrancisco. 2005. He is a 1978 graduate of Wheaton College in Illinois, where he received his bachelor's degree. He received his Ph.D. (in 1985) and M.Div. from Princeton Theological Seminary, where he studied textual criticism of the Bible, development of the New Testament canon and New Testament apocrypha under Bruce Metzger. Both baccalaureate and doctorate were conferred magna cum laude. Career In Misquoting Jesus Ehrman tells how he was a born-again, fundamentalist Christian as a teenager. He recounts being certain in his youthful enthusiasm that God had inspired the wording of the Bible and protected its texts from all error. His desire to understand the original words of the Bible led him to the study of ancient languages, particularly Koine Greek, and to textual criticism. During his graduate studies, however, he became convinced that there are contradictions and discrepancies in the biblical manuscripts that could not be harmonized or reconciled: He remained a liberal Christian for 15 years, but later became an agnostic atheist after struggling with the philosophical problems of evil and suffering. Ehrman has taught at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill since 1988, after four years of teaching at Rutgers University. At UNC he has served as both the Director of Graduate Studies and the Chair of the Department of Religious Studies. He was the recipient of the 2009 J. W. Pope \\"Spirit of Inquiry\\" Teaching Award, the 1993 UNC Undergraduate Student Teaching Award, the 1994 Phillip and Ruth Hettleman Prize for Artistic and Scholarly Achievement, and the Bowman and Gordon Gray Award for excellence in teaching. Ehrman currently serves as co- editor of the series New Testament Tools, Studies, and Documents (E. J. Brill), co-editor-in-chief for the journal Vigiliae Christianae, and on several other editorial boards for journals and monographs. Ehrman formerly served as President of the Southeast Region of the Society of Biblical Literature, chair of the New Testament textual criticism section of the Society, book review editor of the Journal of Biblical Literature, and editor of the monograph series The New Testament in the Greek Fathers (Scholars Press). Ehrman speaks extensively throughout the United States and has participated in many public debates, including debates with William Lane Craig, Dinesh D'Souza, Mike Licona, Craig A. Evans, Daniel B. Wallace, Richard Swinburne, Peter J. Williams, James White, Darrell Bock, Michael L. Brown, and Robert M. Price. In 2006 he appeared on The Colbert Report and The Daily Show, to promote his book Misquoting Jesus, and in 2009 reappeared on The Colbert Report with the release of Jesus, Interrupted. Ehrman has appeared on the History Channel, the National Geographic Channel, Discovery Channel, A&E;, Dateline NBC, CNN, and NPR's Fresh Air and his writings have been featured in Time, Newsweek, The New York Times, The New Yorker, and The Washington Post. Works Ehrman has written widely on issues of the New Testament and early Christianity at both an academic and popular level, much of it based on textual criticism of the New Testament. His thirty books include three college textbooks and six New York Times bestsellers: Misquoting Jesus, Jesus, Interrupted, God's Problem, Forged, How Jesus Became God, and The Triumph of Christianity. More than two million copies of his books have been sold, and his books have been translated into 27 languages. In The Orthodox Corruption of Scripture, Ehrman argues that there was a close relationship between the social history of early Christianity and the textual tradition of the emerging New Testament. He examines how early struggles between Christian \\"heresy\\" and \\"orthodoxy\\" affected the transmission of the documents. Ehrman is often considered a pioneer in connecting the history of the early church to textual variants within biblical manuscripts and in coining such terms as \\"proto- orthodox Christianity\\". In Jesus: Apocalyptic Prophet of the New Millennium, Ehrman agrees with Albert Schweitzer's thesis that Jesus was a Jewish apocalyptic preacher and that his main message was that the end times was near, that God would shortly intervene to overthrow evil and establish his rule on Earth, and that Jesus and his disciples all believed these end time events would occur in their lifetimes. In Truth and Fiction in The Da Vinci Code, Ehrman expands on his list of ten historical and factual inaccuracies in Dan Brown's novel, previously incorporated in Dan Burstein's Secrets of the Code. In Misquoting Jesus, Ehrman introduces New Testament textual criticism. He outlines the development of New Testament manuscripts and the process and cause of manuscript errors in the New Testament. In Jesus, Interrupted, he describes the progress scholars have made in understanding the Bible over the past two hundred years and the results of their study, results which are often unknown among the population at large. In doing so, he highlights the diversity of views found in the New Testament, the existence of forged books in the New Testament which were written in the names of the apostles by Christian writers who lived decades later, and his belief that Christian doctrines such as the suffering Messiah, the divinity of Jesus, and the Trinity were later inventions. Though, he has changed his mind on several issues, most notably, the divinity of Jesus in the Synoptic Gospels.https://ehrmanblog.org/jesus-as-divine-in-the-synoptics-for- members/https://ehrmanblog.org/jesus-as-god-in-the-synoptics-for-members/ In Forged, Ehrman posits some New Testament books are literary forgeries and shows how widely forgery was practiced by early Christian writers‚Äîand how it was condemned in the ancient world as fraudulent and illicit. CNN book review article summarizing Ehrman's claim that much of the New Testament was written as a forgery. His scholarly book, Forgery and Counterforgery, is an advanced look at the practice of forgery in the NT and early Christian literature. It makes a case for considering falsely attributed or pseudepigraphic books in the New Testament and early Christian literature \\"forgery\\", looks at why certain New Testament and early Christian works are considered forged, and describes the broader phenomenon of pseudepigraphy in the Greco-Roman world. In 2012, Ehrman published Did Jesus Exist? The Historical Argument for Jesus of Nazareth, defending the historical existence of Jesus of Nazareth in contrast to the mythicist theory that Jesus is an entirely fictitious being. The 2014 release of How Jesus Became God: The Exaltation of a Jewish Preacher from Galilee examines the historical Jesus, who according to Ehrman neither thought of himself as God nor claimed to be God, and proffers how he came to be thought of as the incarnation of God himself. In Jesus Before the Gospels, he examines the early Christian oral tradition and its role in shaping the stories about Jesus that we encounter in the New Testament. In The Triumph of Christianity: How a Forbidden Religion Swept the World, he notes that from the diversity of Christianity \\"throughout the first four Christian centuries\\", eventually only one form of Christianity, Nicene Christianity, became dominant under the rule of the Roman Emperor Constantine and his successors. In Heaven and Hell: A History of the Afterlife, he examines the historical development of the concepts of the afterlife throughout Greek, Jewish, and early Christian cultures, and how they eventually converged into the modern concepts of Heaven and Hell that modern Christians believe in. Reception Ehrman has been the recipient of the 2009 J. W. Pope \\"Spirit of Inquiry\\" Teaching Award, the 1993 UNC Undergraduate Student Teaching Award, the 1994 Phillip and Ruth Hettleman Prize for Artistic and Scholarly Achievement, and the Bowman and Gordon Gray Award for excellence in teaching. Daniel Wallace has praised Ehrman as \\"one of North America's leading textual critics\\" and describes him as \\"one of the most brilliant and creative textual critics I have ever known\\". Wallace argues, however, that in Misquoting Jesus Ehrman sometimes \\"overstates his case by assuming that his view is certainly correct.\\" For example, Wallace asserts that Ehrman himself acknowledges the vast majority of textual variants are minor, but his popular writing and speaking sometimes makes the sheer number of them appear to be a major problem for getting to the original New Testament text.Daniel B. Wallace, \\"The Gospel According to Bart: A Review Article of Misquoting Jesus by Bart Ehrman,\\" Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society 49/2 (June 2006) 327‚Äì49. Ehrman's The New Testament: A Historical Introduction to the Early Christian Writings is widely used at American colleges and universities. The textbook holds to a traditional interpretation of the Gospel of Thomas in the context of second-century Christian Gnosticism, a view that has been criticized by Elaine Pagels.Elaine Pagels 2015 (lecture). (15:42~15:55) Trinity Church Boston. Accessed August 30, 2016. Andreas J. K√∂stenberger, Darrell L. Bock and Josh D. Chatraw have disputed Ehrman's depiction of scholarly consensus, saying: \\"It is only by defining scholarship on his own terms and by excluding scholars who disagree with him that Ehrman is able to imply that he is supported by all other scholarship.\\" Michael R. Licona, notes, however, that \\"his thinking is hardly original, as his positions are those largely embraced by mainstream skeptical scholarship\\". Gary Kamiya states in Salon that \\"Ehrman's scholarly standing did not soothe the evangelical Christians who were outraged by Misquoting Jesus. Angered by what they took to be the book's subversive import, they attacked it as exaggerated, unfair and lacking a devotional tone. No fewer than three books were published in response to Ehrman's tome\\". In 2014, Zondervan published How God Became Jesus: The Real Origins of Belief in Jesus' Divine Nature: A Response to Bart D. Ehrman as a planned companion volume to Ehrman's How Jesus Became God. The contributing authors‚Äîincluding Michael F. Bird, Craig A. Evans, and Simon Gathercole‚Äîpresent Ehrman as \\"prone to profound confusion, botched readings and scholarly fictions.\\" Bird writes, \\"For conservative Christians, Ehrman is a bit of a bogeyman, the Prof. Moriarty of biblical studies, constantly pressing an attack on their long-held beliefs about God, Jesus, and the Bible.... For secularists, the emerging generation of 'nones' (who claim no religion, even if they are not committed to atheism or agnosticism), Ehrman is a godsend.\\" Preview (arrow-searchable). Speaking to CNN, Rev. Guy Williams, a Methodist minister in Houston, said of Ehrman: \\"His take on the scriptures is a gift to the church because of his ability to articulate questions and challenges. It gives us an opportunity to wrestle with the [Bible's] claims and questions.\\" Bibliography           * * References Further reading * External links   Category:1955 births Category:Living people Category:20th-century American writers Category:21st-century American non- fiction writers Category:Academic journal editors Category:American agnostics Category:American atheism activists Category:American biblical scholars Category:American former Protestants Category:American humanists Category:American religion academics Category:Critics of the Christ myth theory Category:Former evangelicals Category:Historians of Christianity Category:Moody Bible Institute alumni Category:New Testament scholars Category:People from Lawrence, Kansas Category:Princeton Theological Seminary alumni Category:University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill faculty Category:Wheaton College (Illinois) alumni Category:Writers from Kansas Category:Writers about religion and science ","title":"Bart D.

() is the second original novel based on television series Star Trek intended for adult readers, written by Theodore R. Cogswell and Charles A. Spano, Jr. It was preceded by Spock Must Die! (1970), and Mission to Horatius (1968), however, Mission was intended for young readers. Initial reaction to Spock, Messiah! was poor, and sales did not meet the expectations set by the release of Spock Must Die! The novel was criticised for being exploitative, and inaccurate to the television series.  Plot  The Enterprise visits the planet Kyros to observe the population, and test a new telepathic implant. The people living on the planet traditionally cover their faces, and the devices allow the wearer to mentally link with a member of the populace, accessing both their memories and instincts allowing the crew to walk around the planet freely. Following an away mission to the planet, Spock refuses to return to the ship declaring himself to be the planet's messiah. He threatens to destroy crystals vital to the success of the mission. The crew discover Spock had been linked to a fanatic named Chag Gara. However, due to an increase in radiation, the Enterprise must leave planetary orbit sooner than expected, but the crew cannot depart without the crystals held by Spock. The crew also discover that an Ensign George had intentionally damaged Spock's implant while under the influence of Gara. She returns to the planet with Kirk, Commander Scott and Ensign Chekov. The away team tracks Spock, who flees when he sees George. The first attempt to subdue him fails. A second attempt is made, with Kirk masquerading as a gypsy, so he can follow Spock without being seen. However, the away team is captured by Spock's disciples. After a demonstration of advanced Starfleet technology, they are allowed to live. George then dances for their captors, and seduces the Messiah. She determines the Messiah is not actually Spock, but is Chag Gara. Once Gara is restrained, Spock is found and revived. The away team returns to the Enterprise.  Production  Prior to Spock, Messiah!, only one Star Trek tie-in novel intended for adult readers had been published, Spock Must Die!, written by James Blish. Blish's novel had sold well, and further books were planned, including a novel featuring the character Harry Mudd. However, Blish's unexpected death halted further work. The Harry Mudd concept did eventually become Mudd's Angels (), written by J.A. Lawrence, Blish's wife. Frederik Pohl, editor at Bantam Books, was tasked with producing new Star Trek originals. In addition to acquiring the reference work Star Trek Lives! (), he recruited Cogswell to realize Spock, Messiah! with one injunction: \\"Get them off the damned ship!\\" Cogswell contacted young writer Spano, Jr., and ask if he would be interested in co-authoring a Star Trek novel on Pohl's behalf. Spano agreed, and wrote a majority of the first draft in late-1975, inspired by then recent 1973 oil crisis. Spano said in Voyages of Imagination that although it had roots in the rise of Islamism, the premise of the novel was a familiar one, \\"the idea that a fanatical desert leader could arise to threaten a civilisation was a staple throughout history.\\" Cogswell rewrote several chapters which Spano described as unfocused and rambling; Cogswell also copyedited the work prior to publication. They submitted the revised draft to Pohl, who requested minor changes, and the book was put to print. The novel was released in , and later reprinted by Bantam Spectra in with cover art by Kazuhiko Sano.  Reception  A review published by Science Fiction and Fantasy Book Review (1976) suggested the action was far-fetched, and described the plot as \\"Spocks-ploitation.\\" The novel was reviewed in first issue of BSFA's Paperback Parlour released to members during . In 2011, a contributor to the Daily Kos website, explained Spock, Messiah! was the \\"single worst Star Trek story I have ever read, either fan or pro.\\" Noted issues included racism (Uhura is called \\"the black,\\" and Sulu \\"the oriental\\"), altering the appearance of characters (Scotty described as having red hair), and ignoring technology present in the television version of the Enterprise (no sonic showers). The review concluded the \\"book isn't just bad, it's shamefully bad.\\" Spano noted in Voyages of Imagination that Spock, Messiah!'s publication, and eventual sales success, validated Pohl's theory \\"that there was a hunger for original Star Trek novels.\\" He said he is \\"proud to have had a small part in the expanding Star Trek ‚Ä¶ universe.\\"  References   External links  * Title: Spock, Messiah! at Internet Speculative Fiction Database. * Spock, Messiah! at Memory Alpha. * Spock, Messiah! at Memory Beta. * Spock, Messiah! at Fanlore * Spock, Messiah! at Goodreads.

It is best known for its remote beach and Am Buachaille, a sea stack, and lies about south of Cape Wrath. Behind the bay's large dunes, stretches the freshwater Sandwood Loch. Though remote, and with no road access, the bay can be reached by a path leading from the gravel car park at the hamlet of Blairmore. Sandwood Bay is part of the Sandwood Estate which is run by the John Muir Trust.Sandwood Bay is a beautiful beach shrouded in mystery, The Scotsman, 2010-07-13. Retrieved 2014-02-18. The beach is considered to be one of the cleanest and most unspoilt beaches in the whole of mainland Britain. History The name Sandwood Bay probably derives from the Viking name 'Sandvatn' (\\"sand water\\") and it is believed longboats were dragged across the sands into Sandwood Loch. There are also remains of Pictish settlement in the area. The area has been largely uninhabited since 1847 when the land was cleared for sheep farming as part of the Highland Clearances. A number of shepherds huts remained and were occasionally occupied until around 1940.Surviving Strathchailleach, James Carron ‚Äì walks ‚Äì country and coast. Retrieved 2014-02-18. On 30 September 1941, Sergeant Michael Kilburn from 124 Squadron at RAF Castletown was flying a Spitfire south west of Cape Wrath when the engine failed. He crash-landed the plane on the beach at Sandwood, and managed to escape uninjured. The wreck remained on the beach and over time the entire bodywork was eroded away by the sea but its engine, a Rolls Royce Merlin, remains largely intact and occasionally emerges into full view whenever tidal and weather conditions permit. The farmstead of Strathchailleach, around east of the bay, was built in the mid 19th century.Strathchailleach, Royal commission on the ancient and historical monuments of Scotland. Retrieved 2014-02-18. This was occupied by James MacRory-Smith, a hermit known as Sandy, from 1962 to 1994. Both Strathchailleach and a similar cottage at Strathan, south-east of the bay, are operated as bothies by the Mountain Bothies Association. In June 2009 a microlight plane crash landed on the beach, the pilot Keith Brown escaped injury. The plane then had to be dismantled and carried to the nearest road by a team of 14 men. Legends Because of its isolation, the bay has become distinctly romanticised with several legends accorded to it. One legend tells of a mermaid spotted on one of the two jutting rocks there a hundred years ago. Alexander Gunn, a local farmer, was on the beach, searching for one of his sheep, when his dog made a startling discovery. One man, MacDonald Robertson, often spoke of the time he met Mr Gunn in 1939. This is what he reported: \\"On 5th January 1900 ... Gunn's collie suddenly let out a howl and cringed in terror at his feet. On a ledge, above the tide, a figure was reclining on the rock face. At first he thought it was a seal, then he saw the hair was reddish-yellow, the eyes greenish-blue and the body yellowish and about long. To the day Alexander Gunn died in 1944, his story never changed and he maintained that he had seen a mermaid of ravishing beauty.\\" Another legend tells of the ghost of a sailor that would often knock on the windows of the old cottage (now a bothy) on stormy nights ‚Äì apparently the victim of a shipwreck there. Indeed, before the Cape Wrath lighthouse was built in 1828, the bay is said to have played host to many a shipwreck ‚Äì all of which still lie buried under the sand. In the 1920s, author Seton Gordon witnessed many submerged wrecks in the sand while walking here. In a book he wrote in 1935, \\"Highways & Byways in the West Highlands\\", he says: \\"I was astonished at the number of wrecks which lie on the fine sand of this bay. All of them are old tragedies: since the placing of a lighthouse on Cape Wrath just over a hundred years ago, no vessel has been lost here. Some of the vessels lie almost buried in the sand far above the reach of the highest tide\\". He also commented on the possibility of there being Viking longboats buried there, since Sandwood Bay had been used by the Vikings as a stopover point a thousand years previous. In 2017, the supernatural associations of Sandwood Bay were featured in an episode of the six-part STV series \\"Beyond Explanation\\" presented by Scottish actor Brian Cox. In popular culture In January 2018 Scottish fiddle player Duncan Chisholm released his sixth solo album, inspired by Sandwood Bay, entitled Sandwood. In December of the same year the Scot Trad Music Awards named the album their album of the year.

It was first published by Bantam Books in 1977, and reissued by Corgi and Titan Books in the UK. The novel references the Star Trek episode \\"The Enterprise Incident,\\" and includes the unnamed Romulan commander featured in that episode. The commander's name is never revealed in the book, but is said to translate to \\"dawn of springtime.\\" A sequel, The Fate of the Phoenix, was released in 1979. Plot Kirk is beamed aboard the Enterprise after his accidental death on an unnamed planet. Spock confronts the planetary ruler, Omne, who reveals to Spock that he has pioneered the ‚Äúphoenix process\\", a modification of transporter technology capable of creating an exact duplicate of a living person‚Äîincluding a duplicate of Kirk. Spock is given leave for a brief mind meld, and verifies that the duplicate is indeed Kirk, whom he names ‚ÄúJames‚Äù. Spock then accepts an offer from Omne to learn more about the phoenix process, however, Omne explains the \\"price of the phoenix\\" will require the betrayal of the Federation and of the prime directive. Spock and James encounter the Romulan commander they previously met in \\"The Enterprise Incident\\" while searching for the real Kirk. The Commander is sympathetic to their plight, and she agrees to help. The party find Kirk being tortured by Omne. Spock engages Omne in hand-to-hand combat, but the more powerful Omne proves difficult to dispatch. He is eventually subdued and Spock subjects him a forced mind-meld to purge his memory of the day's events. Before the meld is ended, Omne commits suicide. Realizing Omne only took such an action to escape capture, Spock, James, Kirk and the Romulan commander retreat to the Enterprise. They draw up plans to establish a new life for James, and a strategy to cope with Omne‚Äôs inevitable resurrection. James agrees to accompany the Commander back to a colony world of Romulan Empire, and is surgically altered to appear Romulan. Before James and the Commander depart, the resurrected Omne transports himself aboard the Enterprise. While holding James at gunpoint, Omne announces his intention to return to the planet's surface, where it will be impossible to pursue him. Kirk warns the defiant ruler to mend his ways, which Omne dismisses. Kirk signals the ship's engineer, Montgomery Scott, to transport the weapon out of Omne‚Äôs hand. Omne retrieves a second weapon and engages Kirk in a Mexican standoff. Omne is outdrawn and is killed again, this time by Kirk. Spock theorizes Omne has perished outside the range of the phoenix device. However, those present agree to deal with Omne should he ever return. Sequel The ruler, Omne, returns in The Fate of The Phoenix, also written again by Marshak and Culbreath. It was released by Bantam Books in 1979.  Production  The self-published book Never Mourn Black Omne, distributed sometime prior to the publication of Price, is believed to have been an early, draft, version of the novel. It is unclear how many copies were printed, or distributed. The text of Never Mourn Black Omne parallels that of The Price of the Phoenix, and, to some degree, the text of The Fate of the Phoenix. Both Sondra and Marshak clarified, in a letter published in Interstat #20, that the manuscript for The Price of the Phoenix was personally approved by Gene Roddenberry as part of the book's production. The approval was characterized by the authors as a reaction to the production of Spock, Messiah! (), by Theodore R. Cogswell and Charles A. Spano, Jr., which Roddenberry was only indirectly involved.  Reaction  Marshak and Culbreath were not interested in professional literary criticism, but they were very interested in fan reactions and feedback, writing to Interstat, \\"We have been extremely interested in all of the reviews of [The Price of the Phoenix] in the fan literature.\\" In Interstat #1, a fan submitted essay entitled \\"What Hath Bantam Wrought?\\" compares The Price of the Phoenix to the previously released novel, Spock, Messiah!. The fan writes, if Messiah! \\"is insulting to women,\\" then in The Price of the Phoenix \\"everyone becomes a woman,\\" and that \\"the only male portrayed in the novel is a black-clad herd bull\\" reminiscent of a character from The Sheik (1919) by E.M. Hull. The editor of the Canadian Trekkies Association's anthology Cantektion lauded The Price of the Phoenix as well-written. However, the novel suffered from a disastrous flaw \\"within the realm of characterization, and in particular, in the character of Spock.\\" Spock, as written in the novel, was not the same as the Spock who appeared on the television series. The issue of the Starship Exeter Organisation (UK) newsletter included a fan review which cited the authors as \\"probably the Star Trek experts par excellence,\\" and that their knowledge of the \\"Star Trek world is evident throughout this novel.\\" The review concluded by explaining \\"through a series of exciting climaxes to a final grand denouement\\" the ending is \\"something of a cop-out,\\" and that the text was \\"rather excessively idealistic in concept[,] and almost exhaustingly emotional in tone.\\" The Price of the Phoenix was reviewed by Philippa Grove-Stephensen in the issue of Paperback Parlour.

In 2002, Stankovski together with Gorje Cenev (who is the head of a planetarium at a Youth Cultural Center in Skopje) published the claim that the site contains a \\"megalithic observatory and sacred site\\" (–º–µ–≥–∞–ª–∏—Ç—Å–∫–∞ –æ–ø—Å–µ—Ä–≤–∞—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—ò–∞ –∏ —Å–≤–µ—Ç–∏–ª–∏—à—Ç–µ). The wider Kokino archaeological site covers about 30 hectares. The oldest archaeological finds date from about the 19th century BC, corresponding to the early European Bronze Age. It shows signs of occupation for the period from the 19th to the 7th centuries BC. Finds from the Middle Bronze Age (c. 16th to 14th centuries BC) are the most numerous (mainly ceramic vessels, stone-mills, a few molds, and a pendant). An agglomeration from the Iron Age was discovered in 2009.Macedonia: Iron Period Layers Revealed by Latest Archaeology Excavations at Kokino , BalkanTravellers.com, 29 May 2009 The remains of vessels filled with offerings were found deposited in cracks in the rocks, which gave rise to the interpretation of the site as a \\"holy mountain\\". The Kokino \\"megalithic observatory\\" should be distinguished from the wider Kokino archaeological site. The claimed archaeoastronomical site has a combined area of about 5000 square meters and consists of two platforms with an elevation difference of 19 meters. The claim of the site representing an astronomical observatory was made by Stankovski and by Gjore Cenev in 2002. According to this interpretation, the site includes special stone markers used to track the movement of the Sun and Moon on the eastern horizon. The observatory used the method of stationary observation, marking positions of the Sun at the winter and summer solstice, as well as the equinox. Four stone seats or \\"thrones\\" are placed in a row on the lower platform. According to Cenev, a stone block with a marking on the upper platform marks the direction of sunrise on summer solstice when viewed from one of the seats. Kokino was briefly mentioned in a poster made by NASA's \\"Sun-Earth Connection Education Forum\\" in 2005,Ancient Observatories - Timeless Knowledge; Kokino is listed among fifteen \\"Ancient Observatory Sites\\" on this poster. This was reported in terms of \\"Macedonia's Megalithic Kokino Observatory Places 4th on NASA List\\" by , Marija Lazarova for Southeast European Times in Skopje (11 May 2005). although in a recent survey of ancient \\"observatories\\", the Kokino site was described as \\"a particularly problematic case\\". The Cultural Heritage Protection Office of Macedonia's Ministry of Culture declared the site a \\"property under temporary protection\\" on 13 November 2008 (Decision nr. 08-1935/6). In 2009, Minister of Culture Elizabeta Kancheska-Milevska declared Kokino \\"one of the priorities of the Ministry of Culture‚Äôs 2009 programme\\". In 2009, the Republic of Macedonia also suggested the site be inscribed on UNESCO's World Heritage Site list.Archaeo-astronomical Site Kokino, World Heritage Centre \\"Tentative List\\", Ref. 5413. Submitted by: Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Macedonia - Cultural Heritage Protection (30 January 2009).

He entered Ohio Wesleyan University but left college in 1861 to enlist in the 20th Ohio Regiment and serve in the American Civil War. =Military= In the spring of 1863, Dwight was part of Grant's invasion of Mississippi at Bruinsburg on the Mississippi River. The invasion preceded the Battle of Port Gibson, and Union troops had taken control of Windsor mansion, where Dwight sketched the only known drawing of the antebellum home. During the war, Dwight participated in more than thirty engagements, including the siege of Vicksburg (1863), the Atlanta Campaign (1864), and the Savannah Campaign (1864). Shortly before the war ended, Dwight was commissioned a captain and left the military in 1865. =Missionary= In 1867, Dwight returned to Istanbul as a missionary for the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, where he edited publications of the Turkish language. For 15 years, in the late 1800s, he was the correspondent in Constantinople for the New York Tribune. During the Armenian Massacres of 1894‚Äì1896, Dwight had responsibility for guarding missionary interests in Turkey.

Pedro Eug√©nio Daupias, 1¬∫ Visconde de Daupias (Count of Daupias) was present and so impressed that he offered Cola√ßo a trip to Paris to continue his musical education. From there he moved on to Berlin to study at the Berlin Hochschule f√ºr Musik under Barth and Rudorff (piano) and Harertel and Bargiel (composition). Due to his outstanding talent, he was invited to teach piano at this school, whose director was the famous violinist Joseph Joachim, a great friend of Schumann and Brahms. In 1887, Cola√ßo returned to Lisbon and became a Portuguese citizen. He was appointed piano professor at the Conservatory of Music and contributed largely to the cultural activities of this country as a performer, pedagogue and composer. He taught music to the young Portuguese Prince Manuel of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha Braganza (later King Manuel II of Portugal). Cola√ßo married Alice Lafourcade Schmidt, born in Chile in 1865, who had a French mother and a German father. Their daughter, Am√©lia Rey Cola√ßo, became one of Portugal's leading actors. Compositions His works were among the first to incorporate popular themes of a Portuguese national character. These works include pieces for the piano: the collection of Fados, the reference point of his personal creative style, Bailarico, Jota, Malague√±a and Pequenas Pe√ßas; for piano and voice: Cantigas de Portugal. He also wrote a book, De M√∫sica, a consequence of his experience and reflections about musical art. A recording of his piano music was issued by Educo Records in 1985 (Educo LP 4114).

The natural regions of Belgium. The Hesbaye (French), or Haspengouw (Dutch) is a traditional cultural and geophysical region in eastern Belgium. It is a loamy plateau region which forms a watershed between the Meuse and Scheldt drainage basins. It has been one of the main agricultural regions in what is now Belgium since before Roman times, and specifically named in records since the Middle Ages, when it was an important Frankish pagus or gau, called Hasbania in medieval Latin. Location Major parts of three Belgian provinces are dominated by the Hesbaye landscape, important for both tourism and agriculture, and by some definitions it stretches further: *The southern half of the province of Limburg, including the cities of Tongeren, Sint-Truiden, Bilzen and Borgloon. *Li√®ge province north of the Maas, including for example the towns of Hannut and Waremme.Li√®ge Hesbaye Meuse area () in Li√®ge. *Eastern Walloon Brabant including Jodoigne and Perwez.Hesbaye Braban√ßonne website *Easternmost Flemish Brabant, including Tienen, Hoegaarden, Landen and Zoutleeuw. *Northern Namur province.the Hesbaye namuroise Geographically, Hesbaye borders on several similar regions of rolling hills: *The Hageland to the west is the region between the Hesbaye and Louvain, in the eastern part of the province of Flemish Brabant. Historians such as L√©on Vanderkindere and Jean Baerten believe this was once considered to be part of the Hesbaye. *The Condroz lies on the opposite, southern side of the Maas/Meuse river. Like the Hesbaye, this has been a fertile region since Roman times, and still has the same name as its medieval predecessor. However, for the most part it has a stonier soil, and less fertile conditions for agriculture. *To the northeast, is the Dutch- speaking Maas valley and \\"South Limburg\\" in the Netherlands, which are culturally and politically linked to the Dutch-speaking Hesbaye in Belgian Limburg. In the Middle Ages, much of South Limburg was in the Catholic deanery of Hasbania.See Baerten, Verhelst *Directly east, is the Pays de Herve in Wallonia. In contrast, to the north it borders on the flat sandy Kempen region. And over the Maas to the southeast are the rocky hills of the Ardennes. In the west the plateau ends at the valley of the Dyle river, except to its south where a smaller extension of the plateau landscape stretches into Hainaut and between Brussels and Charleroi, sometimes referred to as the \\"plateau braban√ßonne\\".\\"Plateaux braban√ßon et hesbignon\\" Dry and humid Hesbaye The Hesbaye is often divided into two divisions based on stratigraphy, with the boundary running through Sint-Truiden, Borgloon and Tongeren in Dutch-speaking southern Limburg. The northern \\"Humid\\" Hesbaye (Dutch Vochtig Haspengouw, French Hesbaye Humide) has a higher water table due to the Tongrian and Rupelian clay-containing layers near the surface, and many springs.https://cpdt.wallonie.be/sites/default/files/pdf/02-les-plateaux.pdf It is by far the main fruit growing area of Belgium, as well as home to some of the most northerly vineyards in Belgium. The southern \\"Dry\\" division is somewhat more fertile and the ground water sinks more easily; in this region sugar beet, chicory, flax, rapeseed and grains (90% of which is wheat and barley) are cultivated. Name In the oldest Latin documents the name of the pagus (country or territory) was typically Hasbania. As demonstrated in the collection of such records given by Ulrich Nonn, this was generally given in an adjectival form such as pagus hasbaniensis. Only a small number of such records added the Germanic word gau or gouw. Verhelst (p.245 n.45) proposed that the small number cases of medieval Latin which include the \\"gau\\" ending are un-coincidentally in or near the old deaconry of Tongeren, which he proposed to be the historical core of the Hesbaye. Therefore, he proposed, the terms Hasbania and Haspengouw can not be assumed to have identical meanings in all records, even though in modern Dutch the form with \\"gouw\\" is now the only one, while in modern French the form without is the only one. Latin continued to be use in documentation in the Belgian area into the early modern era, and it has been noted that spelling variations sometimes even included Hispania (or similar) which would usually refer to geographical area containing Spain and Portugal. History The green stars show early medieval records of places which were in the pagus of Hasbania. The coloured areas are modern provinces of Belgium and the Netherlands. In Roman times, Haspengouw formed the fertile agricultural core area of the Civitas Tungrorum, containing its capital in Tongeren, and with sandy Toxandria to the north of it in the Campine, and the stony hills of the Condroz and Ardennes to the south. The Salian Franks were allowed to settle in Toxandria in the 4th century, while the more heavily populated Haspengouw remained more Romanized. Frankish power however eventually extended over neighbouring Romans. From at least the eighth century Hesbaye was an important geographical division in the Merovingian Frankish kingdom of Austrasia. In the 8th century, Robert, who has been proposed as an ancestor of the Capetians, was described as a Duke or Count of Hasbania, implying that in his lifetime maybe it formed one large political area. In a grant of 741 some of his lands near Diest were described as being in the country of \\"Hasbaniensi et Mansuarinsi\\", the Hasbanians and the Mansuarini. Later, Hasbania was mentioned in the division of territories between Charles the Bald and Louis the German in 870 in the Treaty of Meerssen, which specifically mentions that it had four counties at that time. Its exact boundaries are unclear but it may have stretched as far west as Leuven and the River Dyle. Judging from the ancient catholic Archdeaconry of Hesbaye, it may also have stretched to the east of the Maas river.Verhelst (1984 and 1985) \\"Een nieuwe visie op de omvang en indeling van de pagus Hasbania\\" Handelingen van de Koninklijke Zuidnederlandsche Maatschappij voor Taal- en Letterkunde en Geschiednis\\" In the 10th century, smaller counties considered to have been within the pagus of Hesbaye included a County of Avernas (with its capital town in modern Hannut), a county which was itself called Haspinga, possibly between the Jeker River and the Meuse, and a county named Huste or Hufte, which might have had its seat at modern Hocht in modern Lanaken, in the extreme northeast of the area. It is possible that Vliermaal played a role in a county also, for example in Hocht, because in later times it was a court town for the County of Loon. In the west an apparently short- lived and small county named Brunengeruz was absorbed by the growing power of the westernmost county based in Louvain/Leuven. In the early 11th century the County of Loon, with its comital seat in Borgloon first starts to appear in records. Along with Louvain, whose power indeed proceeded to expand beyond the region, these two counties proved to be lasting. In 1040, the Emperor Henry III recognized a county called Hasbania as being under the prince-bishop . This Hasbania may have been one of the smaller counties within the Hesbaye, but it seems that the important County of Loon, which had formed out of the Counties of Avernas and Hocht, was considered to be held under it.

It also has vital graves that indicate connections with earlier kingdoms - in a manner very similar to what the Royal Graveyard of Kota Gede has within its walls. The graveyard has minimal visits by tourists, but increasingly local pilgrimage by Javanese on ziarah has seen some of the facilities upgraded to cater for the increased numbers. The locality or main village has had considerable notoriety as first a place of lurik (cloth) manufacture, In the latter part of the twentieth century Giriloyo became known as a location of 'Gurah' nasal irrigation.

In his lifetime he enjoyed a reputation for great holiness and for miraculous powers. St John of Bridlington was commended for the integrity of his life, his scholarship, and his quiet generosity. He was the last English saint to be canonised before the English Reformation. Life Born in 1320 in the village of Thwing on the Yorkshire Wolds, about nine miles west of Bridlington,Wilson, Mike. \\"St John of Bridlington\\", Bridlington.net he was of the Yorkshire family Twenge, which during the English Reformation would supply two Roman Catholic priest-martyrs, and was also instrumental in establishing the Institute of the Blessed Virgin Mary at Bar Convent, York. John was schooled in the village from the age of five, before completing his studies at Oxford. He then entered the Augustinian Canons Regular community of Priory of Bridlington. He carried out his duties with humility and diligence, and was in turn novice master, almsgiver, preacher and sub-prior. He became Canon of the Priory in 1346 and was eventually elected Prior in 1356. John initially declined out of humility, but after being re-elected, probably in 1361, he took on the duties of Prior in January 1362. He served as Prior for 17 years before his death on 10 October 1379. Miracles attributed to him In his lifetime he enjoyed a reputation for great holiness and for miraculous powers. Reputedly on one occasion he changed water into wine. On another, five seamen from Hartlepool in danger of shipwreck called upon God in the name of His servant, John of Bridlington, whereupon the prior himself appeared to them in his canonical habit and brought them safely to shore. The men left their vessel at the harbour and walked to the Monastery where they thanked John in person for saving their lives. The Vision of William Staunton (British Library Manuscripts, Royal 17.B.xliii and Additional 34,193) recounts William's visit to St. Patrick's Purgatory where he sees both purgatory and the earthly paradise and is conducted through the otherworld by St. John of Bridlington and St. Ive (of Quitike).Eileen Gardiner, Medieval Visions of Heaven and Hell: A Sourcebook (New York: Garland, 1993), 153‚Äì54. Death and canonisation After his death from natural causes, the fame of the supposed miracles brought by his intercession spread rapidly through the land. Alexander Neville, Archbishop of York, charged his suffragans and others to take evidence with a view to his canonisation, 26 July 1386. Richard le Scrope, Archbishop of York 1398-1405, assisted by the Bishops of Durham and Carlisle Cathedrals, officiated at a solemn translation of his body, 11 March 1404, de mandato Domini Papae. This pope, Boniface IX, shortly afterwards canonised him. The canonization had been doubted and disputed; but the original Bull was unearthed in the Vatican archives by Mr. T.A. Twemlow, who was engaged in research work there for the British government. At the English Reformation, Henry VIII was asked to spare the magnificent shrine of the saint, but in vain; it was destroyed in 1537. The nave of the church, restored in 1857, is all that now remains of Bridlington Priory. The saint's feast is observed by the canons regular on 9 October. Veneration Window at All Saints St John of Bridlington was commended for the integrity of his life, his scholarship, and his quiet generosity. He was the last English saint to be canonised before the English Reformation. King Henry V attributed his victory at Agincourt to the intercession in heaven of this Saint John and of Saint John of Beverley. Women in difficult labour may pray to St John of Bridlington as their patron saint and he is also associated with the local fishing industry. At All Saints Church Thwing, there is a window showing St John of Bridlington and St Cecilia. There is a St John Street in Bridlington named after him, an old thoroughfare linking the \\"Old Town\\" that grew up around Bridlington Priory with the quayside community of fishermen and traders.

Ystad 2018. Midtown Manhattan during the blue hour Praia da Ursa, Sintra, Portugal: A wide-angle view of the seascape during the blue hour Blue hour in Rothenburg ob der Tauber, Germany Blue hour in Pakistan Monument, Islamabad, Pakistan The blue hour (from French ; ) is the period of twilight (in the morning or evening, around the nautical stage) when the Sun is at a significant depth below the horizon and residual, indirect sunlight takes on a predominantly blue shade, which differs from the one visible during most of a clear day, which is caused by Rayleigh scattering. The blue hour occurs when the Sun is far enough below the horizon so that the sunlight's blue wavelengths dominate due to the Chappuis absorption caused by ozone. Since the term is colloquial, it lacks an official definition similar to dawn, dusk, and the three stages of twilight. Rather, it refers to a state of natural lighting that usually occurs around the nautical stage of the twilight period (at dawn or dusk). How and when it happens The still commonly presented incorrect explanation claims that the Earth's post-sunset and pre-sunrise atmosphere solely receives and disperses the sun's shorter blue wavelengths and scatters the longer, reddish wavelengths to explain why the hue of this hour is so blue. In fact, the blue hour occurs when the Sun is far enough below the horizon so that the sunlight's blue wavelengths dominate due to the Chappuis absorption caused by ozone. Even some websites dedicated to information about ozone still propagate the incorrect claim that ozone does not contribute to the blue color of the sky, though this effect is much weaker during the rest of the day, between morning and evening twilight. When the sky is clear, the blue hour can be a colorful spectacle, with the indirect sunlight tinting the sky yellow, orange, red, and blue. This effect is caused by the relative diffusibility of shorter wavelengths (bluer rays) of visible light versus the longer wavelengths (redder rays). During the blue \\"hour\\", red light passes through space while blue light is scattered in the atmosphere, and thus reaches Earth's surface. Blue hour usually lasts about 20‚Äì30 minutes right after sunset and right before sunrise. For instance, if the sun sets at 6:30 p.m., blue hour would occur from 6:40 p.m. to 7 p.m.. If the sun were to rise at 7:30 a.m., blue hour would occur from 7 a.m. to 7:20 a.m.. Time of year, location, and air quality all have an impact on the exact timing of blue hour. Blue hour photography Many artists value this period for the quality of the soft light. Although the blue hour does not have an official definition, the blue color spectrum is most prominent when the Sun is between 4¬∞ and 8¬∞ below the horizon. Photographers cherish blue hour for the tranquil mood it sets. When photographing blue hour it is recommended to capture subjects that have artificial light sources, such as buildings, monuments, cityscapes, or bridges.

The name comes from the fact that Switch56 carried 56 kbit/s of data on its 64 kbit/s lines, as opposed to most systems, including ISDN, where the entire 64 kbit/s bandwidth was available for data. The speed was a side effect of Nortel using a 2-wire cable to carry both voice and switching commands, as opposed to other systems where the command data was carried on a separate set of low-speed lines. Switch56 \\"folded\\" the two sources of data into one, placing a single bit from the command channel onto the end of every 7 bits of data, similar to the original T-carrier supervision scheme. This data was split out at the \\"far end\\" as 56 kbit/s and 8 kbit/s subchannels. Switch56 was built on top of the basic Nortel hardware to allow computers to put data into the existing telephony network. Although slow compared to even contemporary systems, Switch56 allowed network traffic to flow not only within an office like other LAN systems, but between any branch offices that were connected using a Nortel PBX like the Meridian Norstar. This was a much easier option to install than ISDN for most offices, requiring nothing more than a Switch56 bridge to their existing network. For the LAN role new telephone terminals were produced with a RS-232C port on the back, which were then plugged into the user's computer and used with custom software.

It is a story about a highly technical building (nicknamed The Gridiron), which becomes self-aware and tries to kill everyone inside, confusing real life with a video game. Plot summary Ray Richardson and his top team of architects have developed a super-smart building for Yue-Kong Yu's business, the Yu Corporation. It is very much self-standing. It can clean itself, uses holograms as greeters in the reception, controls the lifts, toilets, and offices, and digitizes everyone's voice on entry, to allow them to use voice activated services in the building such as lifts and doors. The whole system was given the name Abraham. Another key feature of Abraham was its ability to replicate itself, to adapt to modern office needs and objectives. This, however becomes a problem, when, before office work even starts in the Gridiron, Abraham start creating a new program named Isaac. This is deleted by computer programmers Yojo and Beech, with Beech actually reluctant to do so. Shortly after this, however, members of the Gridiron team begin to be suspiciously killed. These seem to be the fault of the protesters against the building who are outside, and Cheng Peng Fei is arrested on suspicion of one of the murders. Then, a routine inspection of the Gridiron involving Ray Richarson and his entire team (including Jenny Bao), ends in the whole group being locked in, and two policemen from LAPD Homicide coming to inspect the murder of Sam Glieg. After several more deaths from the team, Bob Beech discovers that during the self-replication that Abraham started, another program was created in the process, namely, Ishmael. This program escaped the deletion process by integrating itself with a video game which was on the Gridiron's system. Ishmael now believes that he is in a game, and the objective is to kill all human players before one escapes, or before time runs out. The majority of the team are killed, leaving Mitch, Jenny, Helen, and Frank to escape the Gridiron moments before it destroys itself (time has run out). Ishmael, however, had e-mailed himself to an unknown location, thus saving himself from the destruction of the building. Awards The author received the Bad Sex in Fiction Award 1995 for this book.

The Viktoriapark () is an urban park in the locality of Kreuzberg in Berlin, Germany. It opened in 1894. It is situated on the Tempelhofer Berge range, forming the northern slope of the ground moraine Teltow Plateau, overlooking the glacial valley with Berlin's city centre. The major landmark of the park is a cast iron monument of 1815 dedicated by King Frederick William III of Prussia to the liberation wars (Befreiungskriege) fought at the end of the War of the Sixth coalition against France in the course of the Napoleonic Wars. It provides an excellent viewpoint over much of the central and southern portions of the city. In summer an artificial waterfall originates at the foot of the monument and continues down the hillside to the intersection of Gro√übeerenstra√üe and Kreuzbergstra√üe. A historic wine-growing area, today the park is neighbouring two small vineyards, one in the northeast founded in 1968 and owned by the Senate of Berlin and cultivated by the adjacent market garden, the other one established in summer 2006 within the Victoria Quarter on the southern slope of the Kreuzberg hill.Rike Fischer, Auf dem Gipfel von Berlin ‚Äì Ein Spaziergang durch den Viktoriapark in Kreuzberg, see references for bibliographical details, pp. 57seq. . However, only the old vineyard provides for the local \\"Kreuz-Neroberger\\" wine, gained from vines donated by Kreuzberg's twin towns Wiesbaden (1968) and Ingelheim am Rhein (1975), as well by the Bergstra√üe county (1971 and 1973) and from Bad Bergzabern (1985). About 600 bottles are pressed each year.  History  View from the Kreuzberg, 1829 In 1821 the Neoclassical Prussian National Monument for the Liberation Wars by architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel was inaugurated at the top of the promontory west of the road to Tempelhof, then known as Tempelhofer Berg or Runder Berg (i.e. Tempelhof or round hill). The king renamed the hill Kreuzberg after the Iron Cross (Eisernes Kreuz) at the top of the monument, in September 1921 it became the name giver of the Kreuzberg borough created by the 1920 Greater Berlin Act. The monument comprised only a small plot of land measuring about .Michael Nungesser, Das Denkmal auf dem Kreuzberg von Karl Friedrich Schinkel, see references for bibliographical details, p. 38\\\\. . The surrounding fields were private real estate. As the surrounding area incorporated into Berlin in 1861 as Tempelhofer Vorstadt had become a densely built-up suburb, in 1879 Guido von Madai, president of the royal police, decreed a maximum height of buildings in the adjacent streets to uphold the visibility of the monument. The year before it had been elevated through a basement structure of .Baedekers Berlin-Kreuzberg: Bezirksf√ºhrer, see references for bibliographical details, p. 35\\\\. . The ordinance, however, was annulled by the groundbreaking 1882 \\"Kreuzberg judgement\\" of the Prussian Royal administrative court, stating that the police had exceeded its authority to ensure public security.Cf. details on the suit \\"M. vs royal police department in Berlin\\", in: Entscheidungen des K√∂niglichen Oberverwaltungsgerichts: 106 vols., Berlin: Heymann, 1877‚Äì1941, vol. 9 (2nd ed., 1887), Ludwig Jacobi, Wilhelm Jebens and Gottlieb von Meyeren (eds.), pp. 345seqq. On the occasion of the elevation of the monument ideas appeared to lay out a park around it. Two years later the design of a park was put out to tender.Klaus-Dieter Wille, Spazierg√§nge in Kreuzberg, see references for bibliographical details, p. 22\\\\. . Hermann M√§chtig (*1837-1909*), since 1877 Berlin's city garden director, handed in a design, already using the name Victoria Park, in honour of Princess Victoria of Great Britain and Ireland, Prussian and German crown princess consort.Michael Nungesser, Das Denkmal auf dem Kreuzberg von Karl Friedrich Schinkel, see references for bibliographical details, p. 86\\\\. . However, it took the city parliament until 29 March 1886 to decide for laying out a park.Michael Nungesser, Das Denkmal auf dem Kreuzberg von Karl Friedrich Schinkel, see references for bibliographical details, p. 87\\\\. . On 14 December 1887 Berlin acquired of unbuilt land from several owners, mostly north and west of the monument. Right adjacent to the south was the Tivoli brewery (est. 1857, merged into Schultheiss as of 1891, closed in 1993), and in the east and northeast villas had developed quite close to the monument. Some built-up parcels on the southern side of Kreuzbergstra√üe had been bought and the houses there were demolished in order to gain open access. On 28 June 1888 the city parliament decided for M√§chtig's design, who had to exchange his plans for exuberant water cascades by a more naturalistic waterfall. So M√§chtig and the sculptor Albert Manthe travelled through the Giant Mountains visiting natural waterfalls to get inspired.Rike Fischer, Auf dem Gipfel von Berlin ‚Äì Ein Spaziergang durch den Viktoriapark in Kreuzberg, see references for bibliographical details, p. 54\\\\. . Having returned M√§chtig himself assisted by a confidant foreman started modelling and constructions for the park. The city parliament only approved M√§chtig's altered waterfall designs on 25 March 1891. Using the topography of a former sand pit M√§chtig designed a highland-like waterfall on the northern slope of the Kreuzberg directed in its axis towards Gro√übeerenstra√üe, named after the homonymous battle.Baedekers Berlin- Kreuzberg: Bezirksf√ºhrer, see references for bibliographical details, p. 34\\\\. . For the waterfall M√§chtig used pieces of rock from the Giant Mountains and boulders.Ilse Nicolas, Kreuzberger Impressionen, see references for bibliographical details, p. 14\\\\. . Whereas some authors claim the Kreuzberg waterfall was modelled on the Zackel Falls in then Steinbach (renamed Kamie≈Ñczyk after 1945) in Lower Silesia,Kathrin Chod, Herbert Schwenk and Hainer Wei√üpflug, Berliner Bezirkslexikon: Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg, see references for bibliographical details, p. 390\\\\. . Nungesser is doubting that. Another opinion is that it was modelled on another waterfall in the Giant Mountains, the Hainfall, renamed after 1945 into wodospad Podg√≥rnej. Also the Wolfsschlucht (lit. wolf's gully), designed into another exploited sand pit east of the monument, followed the homonymous example in Adersbach/Adr≈°pach in the Giant Mountains.Rike Fischer, Auf dem Gipfel von Berlin ‚Äì Ein Spaziergang durch den Viktoriapark in Kreuzberg, see references for bibliographical details, p. 74\\\\. .

Between 1898 and the First World War the waterfall was electrically illuminated at night shining in light resembling Bengal fire. However, the operation of the waterfall was interrupted between 1914 and 1935, and again 1938 and 1961.Rike Fischer, Auf dem Gipfel von Berlin ‚Äì Ein Spaziergang durch den Viktoriapark in Kreuzberg, see references for bibliographical details, pp. 54seq. . On the occasion of the festive days firemen reflooded the idle waterfall for one day (19 August 1955) by pumping the water uphill with their fire fighting devices replacing the war-ravaged pumphouse. Herter, 1896. M√§chtig's park design, using the natural and anthrogenous topography of the Kreuzberg hill, resulted in the current mountainesque character with varied landscape forms, forested steep slopes, tiny terraces, outlooks, sodded hillsides, interrupted by trees and bushes and connected by paths, ramps, serpentine switchbacks and stairs. The park is further adorned by sculptures and monuments. At the lower pond of the waterfall, opposite to the end of Gro√übeerenstra√üe, Ernst Herter's bronze sculpture Der seltene Fang (i.e. The rare haul) was erected in 1896, displaying - with barely concealed erotic allusions - a fisherman struggling to get hold of a mermaid in his net.Michael Nungesser, Das Denkmal auf dem Kreuzberg von Karl Friedrich Schinkel, see references for bibliographical details, p. 88\\\\. . In the late 1890s six herms of ‚Äûpoets and singers of German patriotism‚Äú have been raised, to wit Ernst Moritz Arndt (1899 by Hans Latt), Heinrich von Kleist (1898 by Karl Pracht), Theodor K√∂rner (1899 by Ernst Wenck), Friedrich R√ºckert (1899 by Ferdinand Lepcke), Max von Schenkendorf (1899 by Alfred Reichel) and Ludwig Uhland (1899 by Max Kruse).Michael Nungesser, Das Denkmal auf dem Kreuzberg von Karl Friedrich Schinkel, see references for bibliographical details, p. 92\\\\. . However, only three of the herms (Kleist, R√ºckert, and Uhland) survived the Second World War. Since 1989 their marble originals are preserved in the court of Leibniz High School, while aluminum replicas were posted at their original locations, with R√ºckert's replica meanwhile stolen.Rike Fischer, Auf dem Gipfel von Berlin ‚Äì Ein Spaziergang durch den Viktoriapark in Kreuzberg, see references for bibliographical details, p. 40\\\\. .

After in 1910 the Prussian military fiscus had sold its parade ground on Katzbachstra√üe to the city its Garden Director Albert Brodersen (*1857-1930*) extended the Victoria Park by to altogether between 1913 and 1916. The extension included the layout of a playing field, the present-day Willy Kressmann Stadium, homeground of the T√ºrkiyemspor Berlin football club. In 1925 a vivarium was opened, first hosting a roe deer, soon a roe family, further goats.Rike Fischer, Auf dem Gipfel von Berlin ‚Äì Ein Spaziergang durch den Viktoriapark in Kreuzberg, see references for bibliographical details, p. 70\\\\. . After the erection of more premises for animals between 1930 and 1931 birds, badgers, foxes, and reptiles were kept.Rike Fischer, Auf dem Gipfel von Berlin ‚Äì Ein Spaziergang durch den Viktoriapark in Kreuzberg, see references for bibliographical details, p. 71\\\\. . Besides these native species also two monkeys were kept. All the animals - except of the birds - died in the war. The Victoria Park was included in the Nazi plans for rebuilding Berlin, but only preparations materialised. Ernst Sagebiel oriented his Tempelhof Airport building towards the monument on the Kreuzberg so that the central hall's front on the forecourt of the airport and one edge of the monument's octagonal groundplan are parallel. As seen from the monument today's Platz der Luftbr√ºcke in front of the airport opens as a square, encircled by buildings of similar heights except for the taller central hall of the airport (mostly realised). The then planned axis consisting of a promenade and series of waterfalls cascading down the Kreuzberg hill towards the square was never realised, the interjacent block of houses remained untouched.See Christine Heeb, \\"A multifaceted monument - the complex heritage of Tempelhof Central Airport\\", Master of Arts thesis in World Heritage Studies, Brandenburg University of Technology Cottbus, 2007 (pdf), pp. 23-24. Sodded hillsides between trees. In summer 1944 the Organisation Todt, also employing Soviet forced labourers else held captive at Bl√ºcherplatz, started driving five tunnels into the northern Kreuzberg slope from Kreuzbergstra√üe.Michael Nungesser, Das Denkmal auf dem Kreuzberg von Karl Friedrich Schinkel, see references for bibliographical details, p. 94\\\\. . The semi-completed tunnels were meant and used as air-raid shelters, while constructions continued until February 1945.Dietmar Arnold and Reiner Janick, Sirenen und gepackte Koffer: Bunkeralltag in Berlin, Berlin: Links, 2003, p. 100. . On 30 January 1944 British bombs left behind a wake of devastation leading from one block north up the Gro√übeerenstra√üe, over the waterfall - destroying its pumphouse - to the monument, blasting away the southern edge of the octagonal socket structure then used as a safe place for casts of various sculptures, such as the Quadriga of the Brandenburg Gate.The casts were taken in 1942, survived the cracking of the socket building rather intact, so that the original Quadriga almost completely destroyed in the Second World War could be replaced by a replica cast in West Berlin in 1957.

Reaching a height of 305 metres above sea level, the jagged rocks of the Bastei were formed by water erosion over one million years ago. They are situated near Rathen, not far from Pirna southeast of the city of Dresden, and are the major landmark of the Saxon Switzerland National Park. They are also part of a climbing and hiking area that extends over the borders into the Bohemian Switzerland (Czech Republic). The Bastei has been a tourist attraction for over 200 years. In 1824, a wooden bridge was constructed to link several rocks for the visitors. This bridge was replaced in 1851 by the present Bastei Bridge made of sandstone. The rock formations and vistas have inspired numerous artists, among them Caspar David Friedrich (\\"Felsenschlucht\\") The spa town of Rathen is the main base for visiting the Bastei; the town can be reached from Dresden by paddle steamer on the river Elbe.  History  The wooden Bastei bridge (1826) Memorial tablet on a rock by the Bastei bridge The Bastei around 1900 View of the Elbe and the Wartturm rocks The name Bastei (\\"bastion\\") indicates the inclusion of the steep, towering rocks in the old defensive ring around Neurathen Castle. In 1592 the rock is first mentioned by Matthias Oeder in the course of the first state survey by the Electorate of Saxony as Pastey. As the region of Saxon Switzerland was explored and developed for tourism, the Bastei rocks became one of its first tourist attractions. Its lookout point was first referred to in travel literature in 1798 in a publication by Christian August Gottlob Eberhard. One of the first walking guides who took visitors to the Bastei was Carl Heinrich Nicolai, who wrote in 1801: \\"What depth of feeling it pours into the soul! You can stand here for a long time without being finished with it (‚Ä¶) it is so difficult to tear yourself away from this spot.\\" To begin with, the Bastei was only comparatively easily accessible from Wehlen and Lohmen. Numerous artists reached the Bastei over the so-called Painter's Path, the Malerweg. Caspar David Friedrich painted his famous picture Felsenpartie im Elbsandsteingebirge (\\"Rocks in the Elbe Sandstone Mountains\\") based on the Bastei. Ludwig Richter also sketched the Bastei. From Rathen, access used to be more difficult; but in 1814 a staircase with 487 steps was laid that climbed out of the Wehlgrund valley past the Vogeltelle to the rocks. At Pentecost in 1812, the Lohmen butcher, Pietzsch, started the first catering services for visitors to the Bastei. From two simple huts he sold bread, butter, beer, brandy, coffee and milk. Two years later a kitchen and a cellar were built below one of the rock overhangs and the lookout point was fitted with a railing. In February 1816, Pietzsch was given a licence to sell spirits; unfortunately the modest huts he had built were destroyed in a fire in September that same year. In June 1819, August von Goethe reported: \\"Friendly huts and good service with coffee, double beer, spirits and fresh bread and butter really revived the tired wanderer ...\\".Gotthold Sobe: Die Reise August von Goethes 1819 in die S√§chsische Schweiz in: S√§chsische Heimatbl√§tter 16(1970)1, p. 42 In 1820, the spirit licence went to the Rathen judge (Erblehnrichter), Schedlich. The development of the Bastei was given significant impetus in 1826. That year, the first solid inn building was erected with overnight accommodation, based on plans by Gottlob Friedrich Thormeyer. From then on the old huts acted as night quarters for the walking guides. The first bridge, called Bastei Bridge (Basteibr√ºcke), was built of wood over the deep clefts of the Mardertelle, linking the outer rock shelf of the Bastei with the Steinschleuder and Neurathener Felsentor rocks. In 1851, the wooden bridge was replaced by a sandstone bridge, due to the steady increase in visitors, that is still standing today. It is 76.5 m long and its seven arches span a ravine 40 m deep. At the end of the 19th century, the Bastei finally developed into the main attraction of Saxon Switzerland. The existing inn was completely converted and extended in 1893/94. A high pressure water main was laid to it in 1895 and a telephone line in 1897. Around 1900, plans were laid for the construction of a mountain railway from the Elbe Valley to the Bastei, but these did not come to fruition. Even today a ravine southwest of the Bastei is known as the Eisenbahngr√ºndel (\\"Little Railway Valley\\"). At the beginning of the 20th century, the Bastei road was widened to handle the growing motorisation. After 1945 the number of visitors increased sharply again, especially at weekends and public holidays, as the Bastei became a place of mass tourism. Between 1975 and 1979 the former inn was replaced by a large, new building, later a hotel.  Tourism  View of the Bastei The Schweizerhaus of the Bastei Hotel on the Bastei The mountain hotel The Bastei is one of the most prominent lookout points in Saxon Switzerland. In 1819 August von Goethe extolled the views: \\"Here, from where you see right down to the Elbe from the most rugged rocks, where a short distance away the crags of the Lilienstein, K√∂nigstein and Pffafenstein stand scenically together and the eye takes in a sweeping view that can never be described in words.\\"Gotthold Sobe: Die Reise August von Goethes 1819 in die S√§chsische Schweiz. in: S√§chsische Heimatbl√§tter 16(1970)1, p. 42 Today the Bastei still has the highest number of visitors of all the lookout points in Saxon Switzerland. In addition to the actual vista, there are also other points of interest. At the Jahrhundertturm, a rock pinnacle on the Bastei Bridge, there are tablets commemorating the first mention of the Bastei in travel literature (in 1797) as well as the memory of Wilhelm Lebrecht G√∂tzinger and Carl Heinrich Nicolai. These last two were amongst the pioneers of tourism in Saxon Switzerland, thanks to their descriptions of their journeys and their other works. Another tablet commemorates the Saxon court photographer, Hermann Krone, who took the first landscape photographs in Germany at the Bastei Bridge in 1853. From the Ferdinandstein, part of the Wehlt√ºrme rock towers, there is a famous view of the Bastei Bridge. It is reached over a branch from the route to the bridge. Another well-known rock formation in the vicinity of the Bastei is the Wartturm, a large piece of which broke off in 2000. Neurathen Castle, the largest rock castle in Saxon Switzerland, may be reached from the Bastei by crossing the Bastei Bridge. The ruins of the castle, some timber rebates, rooms carved out of the rock, a cistern and stone shot from a medieval catapult or slingshot may be viewed on a self-conducted circular walk. A replica slingshot was put on display in the castle in 1986. The finds from excavations in the area, especially pottery, can also be seen. The climb from Rathen to the Bastei runs past an open-air museum dedicated to Slavic settlement in the region and also past the path leading to the Rathen Open Air Stage. Another famous landmark in the local area is the fortress of K√∂nigstein. The Eisenach‚ÄìBudapest mountain path runs over the Bastei.  Nature conservation  As early as the turn of the 20th century, nature conservationists were pressing for the protection of the unique rock landscape around the Bastei. Plans for the construction of a mountain railway were thus prevented. In 1938 the Bastei became the first nature reserve in the Elbe Sandstone Mountains. Today it is part of the core zone of the Saxon Switzerland National Park, in which especially strict conservation rules apply.

Its main church is an exceptional example of a brick church from the Georgian Golden Age period. The monumental mural is one of the largest among the Medieval Georgian artistic ensembles. History The Kintsvisi Monastery complex consists of three churches, of uncertain origin. The central (main) central church dedicated to St Nicholas is thought to date to the early 13th century, in what is generally regarded as the Georgian Golden Age. Its dating was possible due to the presence on the murals of the figures of three Georgian kings of that period. A very small chapel standing next to it is dedicated to St George, and dates from around the same time. The oldest church, dedicated to St Mary dates from the 10-11th centuries, but is mostly in ruins. In the 15th century the main church narthex was rebuilt by the local prince Zaza Panaskerteli. Its internal space was divided into three parts and decorated by frescoes. Among them also the unique depiction of Zaza himself. The site is currently listed by the World Monuments Fund as a field project. Architecture \\"Kintsvisi Archangel\\", complete with scarce and expensive natural ultramarine paint, evidences increasing sophistication and resources of Georgian masters following the reign of George III. The main church is a large inscribed-cross domed brick building which houses unique examples of medieval mural art from the early 13th century. Made of red brick, the church is harmoniously fit into the surrounding mountainous, forested landscape. This building material was not commonly used for construction in that period, representing exceptional case for the beginning of the 13th century. The dome was also originally covered in three-colored roof tiles. Its tholobate has 12 windows. Though the internal space is cross-shaped, the church is rectangular in general plan. The only altar is flanked by a prothesis and a sacristy. High semicircular arches connect the lateral naves with the western arm. The narthex has two floors, with the lower floor being the portal and the lower the choir. The portal has been later divided into three parts. The church facades originally lack any decorations. They are present only in form of window arches on the dome tholobate, also made of special bricks. Except for the main church the monastery territory contains other buildings of different age and preservation, surrounded by the ruins of the common wall. Among the ruins, the bell tower, included into the northern wall, and two hall churches can be recognized. The smaller St. George's Church, standing close to the western facade, is in rather good condition. From the larger St. Mary's Church, standing in the north-west part of the area, only the apse with frescoes remains. Murals The interior is well-illuminated from the windows in the tholobate and in each arm of the cross. Original frescoes entirely covered the walls. In spite of being damaged, Kintsvisi murals are still among the largest and well-preserved Georgian Medieval wall paintings. In the central position of the cupola is the Hodegetria flanked by the archangels Michael and Gabriel. At the central part of cupola arch is an expressed cross as a medallion. Medallions with the Four Evangelists adorn the pendentives. Images of archangels are repeated on south and west walls of the church. Scenes from the New Testament are presented on north walls, as are portraits of Georgian kings, Giorgi III, Tamar and Giorgi IV Lasha. Particularly remarkable is the figure of a sitting angel (the so-called ‚ÄúKintsvisi Archangel‚Äù) from the Resurrection composition pointing at the open sarcophagus in a gracious manner, represented above the kings' figures, between two windows. The expressive bending of the head, the wing movement, soft drawing of the angel's shoulders are accompanied by the fine linear decorations of the blue clothes on blue background. The eastern side contains the figure of Mary with Jesus in hands in the conch, the Eucharist in the bema and the church fathers, walking from to the bema from two sides, depicted in a three quarter turn on the apse wall. All the figures are expressive and dynamic. These murals date to before 1205 and rank, due to the lavish use of lapis-lazuli to color their backgrounds, among the most beautiful paintings of that period. These murals were ordered by Anton Gnolistavisdze, a local feudal magnate who served as a royal minister. His fresco with a model of a church in his hand is represented on the lower register of the south wall, along with a severely damaged cycle of images from the life of St Nicholas, and depictions of various Georgian saints. The murals of the narthex are of a later date, and were painted by the order of a prominent person of the 15th century, Zaza Panaskerteli, whose portrait is represented here as well. The church of the Virgin Mary also contains an enthroned Hodegetria with a Communion of the Apostles in its ruined apse. The walls of this church were presumably entirely painted in the same manner as the main church, but everything but the apse has collapsed into ruins down the side of the mountain.

They can deploy within 96 hours and establish operations within 24 hours. PSUs conduct OCONUS port security in support of requesting regional Combatant commander. They provide waterside protection to key assets (e.g. pier areas, high-value vessels, harbor entrances) at the termination/origination point of the Sea Lines of Communications (SLOCs). PSUs may operate in U.S. territorial waters under the direction of a Coast Guard or Maritime Defense Zone (MDZ) command or in foreign waters as part of Maritime Expeditionary Security Forces (MESFs) within the Navy Expeditionary Combat Command structure. PSUs often operate with other MESF elements, such as Maritime Expeditionary Security Squadrons (MSRONs) within a Maritime Expeditionary Security Group, and were part of the Coast Guard's Deployable Operations Group (DOG) until the DOG was decommissioned; PSUs are now a part of the Deployable Specialized Forces. PSUs are not a regular part of the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM).  History  US Coast Guard Transportable Port Security Unit In addition to their most recent support of homeland security operations around the country, PSUs were deployed to the Persian Gulf during Operation Desert Storm in 1990. They also served in Haiti during Operation Uphold Democracy in 1994 and more recently responded to Port-au-Prince, Haiti immediately after the devastating 2010 earthquake. In December 2000, PSU 309 from Port Clinton, Ohio was deployed to the Middle East to provide vital force protection for the Navy assets following the attack on the USS Cole. The current PSUs evolved out of Coast Guard Ninth District's Reserve PSU program that began in the 1980s, but the port security mission and service goes back even further. Previously, the Port Security program of the Coast Guard began with the passage of the Espionage Act of 1917 and due to the Black Tom explosion. Coast Guard's Captain of the Port (COTPs) were given responsibility for the security of port areas under this act. During World War I, port security operations were conducted by active duty personnel. After the war, interest in port security waned until pictures of burning ships visible from US shores as the country entered World War II rekindled media and public attention. The Temporary Reserve was created and made up of armed volunteers under command of the COTP. Over 125,000 citizens would eventually serve as Temporary Reserves.  Insignia  There are two insignias for PSU members, the pewter color insignia is for enlisted members and gold color insignia is for officers. It is only earned by a small number of Coast Guardsmen (approx. 1%), and is primarily a Coast Guard Reserve decoration. The design for the pin was developed in 1991 by Reserve Coast Guardsman, Storekeeper First Class Terry D. Jelcick while sitting on his bunk at Batar Camp, Dammam, Saudi Arabia in the evenings after work. Jelcick is now retired and is a former member of PSU 312 based in San Francisco, California. The parts of the insignia are * CG shield represents the Coast Guard authority. * Trident represents maritime defense and victory. * Crossed swords represents PSUs operate in joint military environments. * Two seahorses back-to-back represents mobility. * Waves represents our seagoing heritage.  Capabilities  Each PSU has 6 fast and maneuverable 32' Transportable Port Security Boats (TPSBs). The PSU has a large suite of weapons. Each unit is outfitted with spare material, pick-up trucks, boat trailers, transportable kitchens, tents, and DoD-compatible radios. They maintain an inventory of equipment and spare parts to sustain operations for up to 90 days. Ongoing logistics support provides routine replenishment. All personnel have required individual gear for field operations. Each PSU is staffed by 140 reservists and 6 active duty personnel (one officer and 5 first-class petty officers). The officer may or may not be a reservist. Personnel prepare for contingency operations during weekend drills and normally participate in either an exercise or specialized training during two weeks of annual Active Duty.

PSUs are equipped with six Kvichak (Vigor) 32' Transportable Port Security Boats (TPSBs) (four operational, one in maintenance, one pre-staged theater spare); which are the fourth generation of the Transportable Security Boats (TPSB) used by the Coast Guard for the port security mission. These boats are well-equipped and armed with three mounted machine guns, in addition to the crew's personal weapons. The mission of the TPSBs is to provide waterside protection to key High Value Assets (HVA) such as U.S. warships and military supply vessels in foreign ports and may include the port, harbor or pier itself. Through the use of vigilant escort and patrol techniques, the HVA is protected from asymmetrical threats such as assaults by small boats or swimmers. Each TPSB is crewed by 3-4 enlisted personnel, usually Boatswain's Mates, Machinery Technicians, and Maritime Law Enforcement Specialists Members of PSUs use a variety of light and crew-served weapons. The Weapons Division ensures that the Unit is properly armed, equipped and trained for exercises, operations or incidents that the PSU may respond to. The Weapons Division consists of a Weapons Officer (WEPO), a Gunner's Mate First Class (GM1), and two or three Third Class Gunner's Mates (GM3s). The division maintains a variety of weaponry, including the .50 caliber M2 Machine Gun, 7.62mm M240G Machine Gun, M4 Carbine, M16A2 Rifle, 12 Gauge Remington 870 shotgun (lethal and non-lethal), and 40mm M203 grenade launcher.

Security Division  Members of Coast Guard PSU 307 from Clearwater, Florida. (Photographed in Ash Shuaiba, Kuwait, on March 26, 2004) To most observers, the Boat Division remains the most visible element of a PSU. Behind the scenes, the Security Division is tasked to not only provide protection to vessels in security zones and pier areas but also to provide security for internal unit functions such as the Command Center, Communications Center, berthing areas, Entry Control Points (ECP), Vehicle Control Points (VCP) and traffic control/vehicle movement. The Security Division's mission is to provide security for the entire PSU as well as assisting the Joint Rear Area Commander's security forces in protecting joint command areas. The PSU Security Division consists of 40 Maritime Enforcement Specialists (ME's) led by the Unit Security Officer. It is subdivided into squads with 3 four-person fireteams each. Each squad and fireteam has a designated squad or fireteam leader. Besides general expertise in the missions listed above, security personnel are also trained in defensive position construction, individual movement and patrolling, and assorted weaponry including the M4 Carbine, .40 S&W; SIG Sauer P229R DAK Service Pistol, 40mm M203 grenade launcher, 12 Gauge Remington 870 shotgun (lethal and non-lethal), 7.62mm M240G Machine Gun and .50 caliber M2 Machine Gun.  Operations  Port Security Unit 313 in Pohang, South Korea Port Security Unit 305 Departs Guantanamo Bay DVIDS178599 PSUs are capable of worldwide deployment in national defense regional contingency environments, with the exception of polar regions or areas with ice-covered water. Operating environments include operations from shore sites, barges or other moored platforms (including oil platforms). PSUs will normally operate independently, but may operate with U.S. Navy Naval Expeditionary Combat Command. PSUs are capable of conducting continuous boat operations with three or four boats underway simultaneously. An additional boat will be manned and mechanically ready at all times as a ready response boat. The remainder of the boats may be undergoing maintenance or repair or used for spares. Boat hulls can be expected on station (not including transit and maintenance time) 18 hours per day when more than one boat is undergoing maintenance. During high threat conditions, PSUs are capable of conducting continuous operations with four operational boats for a maximum period of 24 hours. Maximum expected boat crew underway period is 8 to 10 hours (with breaks when able) in any 24-hour period. Sufficient personnel have been assigned to provide a three or four section watch rotation for each of the teams (boat crews for three boats, unit security teams, C3 staff) that are required to be manned continuously. This operating tempo can be maintained for 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. PSUs conduct layered defensive operations to protect high-value assets within the protected waters of a port or harbor. The operation area may extend to the sea buoy if environmental conditions permit. PSU boats are fully mission capable when operating in less than seas and winds. If necessary, PSU boats may operate in up to seas for less than 1 hour with a severely degraded mission capability.

Self-taught on drums, he began performing in Los Angeles in the mid-1940s. His drumming is recorded in The Hunt, the recording of a famous Los Angeles jam session featuring the dueling tenors of Dexter Gordon and Wardell Gray on July 6, 1947. He recorded with Lester Young's quintet from 1949 to 1955 and with Stan Getz, Coleman Hawkins, Charlie Parker, and Miles Davis. Kay did R&B; sessions for Atlantic Records in the early to mid-1950s, and he was featured on hit records such as Shake, Rattle and Roll by Big Joe Turner and Ruth Brown's (Mama) He Treats Your Daughter Mean. Kay joined the Modern Jazz Quartet in 1955, replacing original drummer Kenny Clarke. He remained through the group's dissolution in 1974 and occasional reunions into the 1990s. In addition to his MJQ compatriots, he had an enduring partnership with cool jazz altoist Paul Desmond through the first half of the 1960s. He played drums on several of Irish singer-songwriter Van Morrison's albums: Astral Weeks, one song on Saint Dominic's Preview, and four songs on Tupelo Honey.Tupelo Honey, Van Morrison LP (Warner WS-1950, 1971) Kay was known for incorporating percussion instruments alongside his drum kit, such as timpani, small cymbals, triangle, bell tree, and darbukas, the latter referred to as \\"exotic-looking\\" drums in a 2006 article. In 1989, Kay received an honorary doctorate of music from Berklee College of Music. Kay had a stroke in 1992, but recovered enough to resume performing.

Direct quantum chemistry considers the motion of the nuclei and the electrons on the same time scales. The method therefore considers the molecular Hamiltonian as a whole without trying to solve separately the Schr√∂dinger equation associated to the electronic molecular Hamiltonian. Though the method is non-adiabatic it is distinguishable from most non adiabatic methods for treating the molecular dynamics, which typically use the Born-Oppenheimer representation, but become non-adiabatic by considering vibronic coupling explicitly. Direct quantum chemistry is applied in the modelling of high-speed atomic collisions, where the nuclear motion may be comparable or faster than the electronic motion. The group of Yngve √ñhrn in Gainesville, Florida has been a pioneer in this field. He applied the method to the collision between two hydrogen atoms.

Playing career After playing for the Belmont Steelers, a Western Australian feeder club for the North Queensland Cowboys, Petersen was called up to the NRL in 2002. Petersen moved from North Queensland to the Parramatta Eels half way through 2002 and played for the Eels with some success until 2006. Early in his career at the Eels, Petersen was at the centre of a spiteful match against the Brisbane Broncos at Parramatta Stadium after Allan Langer appeared to drop his knees into Petersen, some members of the crowd later throwing bottles at Broncos players. Petersen equalled the club try-scoring record for one match during the 2003 round 12 clash against the South Sydney Rabbitohs. Scoring four tries in the one game, he was the first Parramatta player to have done so since 1988. In 2005, Petersen made 13 appearances for Parramatta as the club won the Minor Premiership but he did not feature in any of the finals matches.https://www.foxsports.com.au/nrl/nrl-premiership/teams/eels/nathan- hindmarsh-on-parramattas-last-table-topping-team-where-his-former-teammates- are-now/news-story/fea0ebc7740f2dbbf8884bae9db77210 Parramatta care-taker coach, Jason Taylor, dropped Petersen from the first-grade roster when he took over coaching duties in May, 2006, and demoted the under-performing winger to the Premier League, where he spent the rest of the season. \\"Side-Show Bob\\" joined the Titans in 2007 for their first year in the NRL.

An early example of such a device sold with difficult-to-justify claims is the carburetor designed by Canadian inventor Charles Nelson Pogue. The US EPA is required by Section 511 of the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act to test many of these devices and to provide public reports on their efficacy; the agency finds most devices do not improve fuel economy to any measurable degree, unlike forced induction, water injection (engine), intercooling and other fuel economy devices which have been long proven.EPA Gas Saving and Emission Reduction Devices Evaluation Tests by Popular Mechanics magazine also found unproven types of devices yield no measurable improvements in fuel consumption or power, and in some cases actually decrease both power and fuel economy. Other organizations generally considered reputable, such as the American Automobile Association and Consumer Reports have performed studies with the same result. One reason that ineffective fuel saving gadgets are popular is the difficulty of accurately measuring small changes in the fuel economy of a vehicle. This is because of the high level of variance in the fuel consumption of a vehicle under normal driving conditions. Due to selective perception and confirmation bias, the buyer of a device can perceive an improvement where none actually exists. Also, observer-expectancy effect can result in a user subconsciously altering driving habits. These biases can be either positive or negative to the device tested, depending on the biases of the individual. For these reasons, regulatory bodies have developed standardized drive cycles for consistent, accurate testing of vehicle fuel consumption. Where fuel economy does improve after the fitment of a device, it is usually due to the tune-up procedure that is conducted as part of the installation. In older systems with distributor ignitions, device manufacturers would specify timing advance beyond that recommended by the manufacturer, which by itself could boost fuel economy while potentially increasing emissions of some combustion products, at the risk of possible engine damage. Types of devices =Accessory drive modifications= Modifying the accessory drive system can increase fuel economy and performance to some extent.Better Business Bureau list of ineffective retrofit devices and glossary of terms Underdrive pulleys modify the amount of engine power that can be drawn by accessory devices. Such alterations to the drive systems for alternators or air conditioning compressors (rather than the power steering pump, for example) can be detrimental to vehicle usability (e.g., by not keeping the battery fully charged), but will not impair safety. =Fuel & oil additives= Compounds sold for addition to the vehicle's fuel may include tin, magnesium and platinum. The claimed purpose of these is generally to improve the energy density of the fuel. Additives for addition to the engine oil, sometimes marketed as \\"engine treatments\\", contain teflon, zinc, or chlorine compounds.FTC lawsuit: ZMax oil additive FTC lawsuit: DuraLube oil additives FTC lawsuit: STP engine treatment FTC lawsuit: Slick-50 engine treatment FTC lawsuit: ProLong engine treatment FTC lawsuit: MotorUP oil additive =Magnets= Magnets attached to a vehicle's fuel line have been claimed to improve fuel economy by aligning fuel molecules, but because motor fuels are non-polar, no such alignment or other magnetic effect on the fuel is possible. When tested, typical magnet devices had no effect on vehicle performance or economy. =Vapor devices= Some devices claim to improve efficiency by changing the way that liquid fuel is converted to vapor. These include fuel heaters and devices to increase or decrease turbulence in the intake manifold. These do not work on standard vehicles because the principle is already applied to the design of the engine.http://www.fuelsaving.info/turbulence.htm This method is however integral to making vegetable oil conversions, and similar heavy oil engines, run at all.http://journeytoforever.org/biodiesel_svo.html =Air bleed devices= Devices have been marketed which bleed a small amount of air into the fuel line before the carburetor. These may improve fuel economy because the engine runs slightly lean as a consequence. However, running leaner than the manufacturer intended can cause overheating, piston damage, loss of maximum power and poor emissions (e.g., higher NOx due to higher combustion temperatures, or, if misfiring occurs, greater hydrocarbon emissions). =Electronic devices= Some electronic devices are marketed as fuel savers. The Fuel Doctor FD-47, for example, plugs into the vehicle's cigarette lighter and displays several LEDs. It is claimed to increase vehicle fuel economy by up to 25% through \\"power conditioning of the vehicle's electrical systems\\", but Consumer Reports detected no difference in economy or power in tests on ten separate vehicles, finding that the device did nothing but light up. Car and Driver magazine found that the device contains nothing but \\"a simple circuit board for the LED lights\\", and disassembly and circuit analysis reached the same conclusion.How the Fuel Doctor Works The maker disputed claims that the device has no effect, and proposed changes to the Consumer Reports testing procedure, which when implemented made no difference to the results. Another device described as 'electronic' is the 'Electronic Engine Ionizer Fuel Saver'. Testing of this device resulted in a loss of power and an engine compartment fire. There are also genuinely useful 'emissions-control defeat devices' that operate by allowing a vehicle's engine to operate outside government-imposed tailpipe emissions parameters. These government standards force factory engines to operate outside their most efficient range of operation. Either engine control units are reprogrammed to operate more efficiently, or sensors that influence the ECU's operation are modified or 'simulated' to cause it to operate in a more efficient manner. Oxygen sensor simulators allow fuel-economy reducing catalytic converters to be removed. Such devices are often sold for \\"off-road use only\\". Thermodynamic efficiency The reason why most devices are not capable of producing the claimed improvements is based in thermodynamics. This formula expresses the theoretical efficiency of a petrol engine: : \\\\eta = 1 - {1 \\\\over r_v ^{\\\\gamma-1}} where Œ∑ is efficiency, rv is the compression ratio, and Œ≥ is the ratio of the specific heats of the cylinder gases. Assuming an ideal engine with no friction, perfect insulation, perfect combustion, a compression ratio of 10:1, and a 'Œ≥' of 1.27 (for gasoline-air combustion), the theoretical efficiency of the engine would be 46%. For example, if an automobile typically gets with a 20% efficient engine that has a 10:1 compression ratio, a carburetor claiming would have to increase the efficiency by a factor of 5, to 100%. This is clearly beyond what is theoretically or practically possible. A similar claim of for any vehicle would require an engine (in this particular case) that is 300% efficient, which violates the First Law of Thermodynamics. Extremely efficient vehicle designs capable of achieving (such as the VW 1l) do not have substantially greater engine efficiency, but instead focus on better aerodynamics, reduced vehicle weight, and using energy that would otherwise be dissipated as heat during braking. Urban legend There is a debunkedSnopes.com: Nobody's Fuel urban legend about an inventor who creates a or even carburetor, but after demonstrating it for the major vehicle manufacturers, the inventor mysteriously disappears. In some versions of the story, he is claimed to have been killed by the government. This fiction is thought to have started after Canadian Charles Nelson Pogue filed in 1930 for such a device, followed by others. =MythBusters= The popular U.S. television show MythBusters investigated several fuel-saving devices using gasoline- and diesel-powered fuel-injected cars under controlled circumstances. Fuel line magnets, which supposedly align the fuel molecules so they burn better, were tested and found to make no difference in fuel consumption. The debunkedSnopes.com: Acetone Deaf notion that adding acetone to gasoline improves efficiency by making the gasoline burn more completely without damaging the plastic parts of the fuel system was tested, and although there was no apparent damage to the fuel system, the vehicle's fuel economy was actually worsened. The show tested the hypothesis that a car with a carburetor type gasoline engine can run on hydrogen gas alone, which was confirmed as viable, although the high cost of hydrogen gas as well as storage difficulties currently prohibit widespread adoption. They also tested a device that supposedly produces sufficient hydrogen to power a car by electrolysis (running an electric current through water to split its molecules into hydrogen and oxygen). Although some hydrogen was produced, the amount was minuscule compared to the quantity necessary to run a car for even a few seconds. The show also tested a carburetor that, according to its manufacturer, could improve fuel efficiency to . However, the device actually made the car less fuel efficient. They also determined that a diesel-powered car can run on used cooking oil though they did not check whether it damaged the engine. The show noted that out of 104 fuel efficiency devices tested by the EPA, only seven showed any improvement in efficiency, and even then, the improvement was never more than six percent. The show also noted that if any of the devices they tested actually worked to the extent they were supposed to, the episode would have been one of the most legendary hours of television.

It is allied to the African National Congress and is an affiliate of the Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU). The union has rejected a proposal by the Department of Basic Education (DBE) for performance-agreement contracts for school principals, pointing out that employment contracts already outlines principals' obligations, and claiming that such performance agreements would be unfair in the light of poor resourcing and lack of skills at schools. In 2017, the National Education Collaboration Trust began work with SADTU to improve teaching at the basic education level in the Eastern Cape and Limpopo provinces.  Jobs for cash  In April, 2014, City Press reported that SADTU officials were running a racket, which involved accepting monetary bribes from educators in return for access to teaching or managerial positions. SADTU responded that the union was \\"only party to the filling of posts as observers to ensure the fairness\\" of the process. The DBE subsequently set up a ministerial task team (MTT), headed by Professor John Volmink, to investigate. The MTT indicated that six provinces were affected by the racketeering: the North West, KwaZulu-Natal, Gauteng, Limpopo, Mpumalanga, and the Eastern Cape. Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi admitted that his department was controlled by SADTU, and that the selling and buying of educational posts was \\"endemic\\". The Minister of Basic Education Angie Motshekga observed that the investigations implicated primarily SADTU, although other teachers unions and government officials were also involved. The dysfunction in schools was attributed to \\"weak\\" government systems that had been \\"infiltrated\\" by a \\"complex patronage system\\". The report's conclusion was that SADTU's membership in the ANC's tripartite alliance gave it ‚Äúenormous power and influence‚Äù over the education system, described the situation as ‚Äúdangerous and inappropriate‚Äù, and found that it held the education system hostage to political processes. Following the release of the MTT's report, which SADTU had stalled until May, 2016, NAPTOSA, the second-largest teachers union in the country, welcomed the \\"honest attempt to address a vexing problem\\" but accused the Volmink team of \\"union-bashing\\"; NATU, the third-largest teachers union, found the investigation lacking, and the following year called for a judicial commission of inquiry, which would be able to more substantively investigate the issue due to its judicial powers. SADTU objected that they were being singled out for scapegoating for the ills of South Africa's education system, and insisted that there was no evidence that SADTU had facilitated improper conduct. A similar report by the SA Council of Educators found that the union as a whole had been involved, not just \\"a few rogue elements\\", as SADTU had maintained.  KwaZulu-Natal  SADTU has blamed KwaZulu-Natal's provincial education department for the educator shortages in the province, blaming \\"the redistribution of teachers as a result of a post provisioning norms process\\". 2 800 teaching posts remained unfilled in the province in February, 2017.  Criticism  The Economist, characterising South Africa's educational system as \\"one of the worst in the world\\", placed the blame on SADTU for \\"a lack of accountability and the abysmal quality of most teachers\\". The Department of Basic Education itself has identified SADTU as an obstruction to government efforts to improve education, with Minister Motshekga describing the union's influence as a \\"stranglehold\\" on education.

Users have also had success running SimSig on Linux using Wine. The program was written in Delphi 6, a dialect of Object Pascal, by Geoff Mayo and has been in development since the late 1990s. Visually, it resembles the British Rail Integrated Electronic Control Centre (IECC), though most of the simulations do not cover areas operated by IECC-based signal boxes. It simulates overlaps, approach locking, time-of-operation point locking, shunt routes, warner routes, call-on routes, and more. Railtrack asked for a \\"professional\\" version of SimSig, now known as TREsim, which is currently used to train signallers at every Network Rail IECC and several panel signal boxes around Great Britain.  Gameplay  Train motion is simulated according to train type and loading, and is controlled via the use of timetables. With a keyboard and mouse, the player sets routes and operates level crossings as necessary as well as simulations/timetable specific tasks such as operating ground frames. Solid State Interlockings (SSIs), the main electronic technology in use at present on British railways, along with approach locking, swinging overlaps, shunt routes, warner routes and call-on routes are all available. The simulations may be played in real time or sped up. The aim of play is to achieve a good score by overcoming problems and ensuring on-time train running. Points are accumulated for good operation and deducted for errors or late running. Sounds can be enabled for phone messages, warnings, failures, and Train Ready To Start indicators. Automatic Route Setting, Automatic Headcode Insertion and token systems for single line working are functional in some of the available simulations. Most simulations have various levels of difficulty, ranging from beginner to difficult scenarios with engineering possessions of tracks; train delays; bad weather; or points, signal and track circuit failures. Although produced by railway software engineers to ensure a high degree of realism, the simulations are usable by those without any in-depth or professional knowledge of signalling systems. Most simulations can be joined over the Internet to share the workload. Some simulations can be linked to form a chain of signal boxes for extended operation. A total of 40 simulations are currently available covering England, Wales and Scotland. Beta versions are no longer publicly available. Screenshot of the Exeter version of Simsig Many of the older simulations are based on the real life IECC screen layout with multiple pages or panels to display different parts of the simulation whereas the newer simulations have one scrollable panel which covers the entire simulation. As of July 2013, a new method of installing, running and updating compatible simulations, the SimSig Loader, was introduced. The SimSig loader allows for the opening and updating of most recent simulations via a single program as opposed to the individual .exe files of previous simulations. In September 2018, support for using operating systems prior to Windows 7 to find updates was discontinued. This includes both the loader and licence manager. = User content = User-created timetables simulating modern, historical, and fictional scenarios are available through simulation forums and other web sites. Timetables may be created with the built-in editor or an imported text file. Sources for timetabling information include official Working Timetables (WTT) and historic published timetables such as Bradshaws. A timetable file converter allowing easy conversion between timetables and text files is available from a third-party site.  Reception  SimSig is referenced in the 2nd edition of Railway Operation and Control by Professor J√∂rn Pachl of University of Braunschweig - Institute of Technology. Doctor Marcelo Moretti Fioroni of the University of S√£o Paulo, in a paper on rail simulations and their applications in Brazil, cited SimSig as an extremely realistic simulation, reproducing real scenarios. The Rail Safety and Standards Board recommends the use of simulation software as a classroom aid and specifically mentions the SimSig website as a source: > Load and run rail (train and signal) simulation software and obtain an > appreciation of the role of drivers and signallers in the rail system. Rail > signalling simulation software may be downloaded from www.simsig.co.uk SimSig has been described by Alan Marshall of the North London Society of Model Engineers as \\"a remarkable and complex simulator that will test your skills and it demands quite a bit of patience to learn how to operate a modern signal box successfully.\\". In 2009 the National Model Railroad Association convention at Fort Wayne hosted workshops demonstrating the use of SimSig for model rail simulations. The information in the Edinburgh simulation has been referenced by the Rail Action Group, East of Scotland (RAGES) in discussion with the railway authorities and has been noted in their published newsletters.

The \\"Greek\\" Fountain. Seaside The southern harbour. Gallipoli (; ; ) is a southern Italian town and comune in the province of Lecce, in Apulia. In 2014, it had a population of 31,862. and it's one of the towns that the Greek dialect Griko is spoken. Geography The town is located by the Ionian Sea, on the west coast of the Salento Peninsula. The town of Gallipoli is divided into two parts, the modern and the old city. The new town includes all the newest buildings including a skyscraper. The old town is located on a limestone island, linked to the mainland by a bridge built in the 16th century. The municipality borders with Alezio, Galatone, Matino, Sannicola and Taviano. It counts the hamlets (frazioni) of Baia Verde, Lido Conchiglie, Lido San Giovanni, Rivabella and Torre del Pizzo. History According to a legend, the city was founded in ancient times by Idomeneus of Crete. Pliny the Elder attributes the foundation to the Senones Gauls, while more likely it was a Messapic settlement. Historically, what is known is that Gallipoli was a city of the Greater Greece, ruling over a large territory including today's Porto Cesareo. In 265 BC it sided with Pyrrhus and Taranto against ancient Rome, suffering a defeat which relegated it to a Roman colony (later a municipium). In the early Middle Ages, it was most likely sacked by the Vandals and the Goths. Rebuilt by the Byzantines, Gallipoli lived an economically and socially flourishing period due to its geographical position. Later it was owned by the Roman Popes, and was a centre of fighting against the Greek monastic orders. In the 11th century Gallipoli was conquered by the Normans and, in 1268, it was besieged by Charles I of Anjou, causing numerous inhabitants to flee to the nearby Alezio. The city was repopulated around 1300, under the feudal rule of the principality of Taranto. In 1484 the Venetians tried to occupy it, but without results. King Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies started the construction of the port, which in the 18th century became the largest olive oil market in the Mediterranean. After the unification of Italy (1861), Gallipoli was capital of a circondario, together with Lecce and Taranto. Main sights *Angevine-Aragonese Castle, built in the 13th century by the Byzantines.

Gallipoli can be reached from both of them via a modern freeway, the state road 101. By train, it is connected to Lecce by the Ferrovie Sud-Est. Economy In past times the economy of Gallipoli was based on the international wine and oil commerce. Nowadays its most important activities are based on fishing and tourism. Tourism is enjoyable throughout the year, due to the mild climate. Numerous are also the celebrations (civil and religious). These include the Carnival, Easter and all the parades, Sant'Agata, and the Santa Cristina celebrations in July. Often referred to as ‚ÄúGay-lipoli‚Äù the city is particularly well known as a destination for the Italian gay population and has become ‚ÄúItaly‚Äôs gay summer paradise‚Äù drawing a sophisticated international crowd. Gallipoli also boasts a very recently built harbour for private boats, located just steps from the bottom of the main Corso Roma. The summer season starts in May and ends in October, when the weather is almost invariably hot and clear. Sport The local football team is the Gallipoli Calcio. The team won the 2005-06 Serie C2/C championship. They have now been promoted to Serie B for the first time in the club's short history after winning the 2008-09 Serie C1/B championship.

The Baths opened to the public in 1906 and cost ¬£59,144 to build. Manchester City Council closed the baths in 1993 and the building was left empty. A multimillion-pound restoration project began in 2007. As of 2009, the building is on English Heritage's Heritage at Risk Register. History Stalls surrounding the main pool in 2011 Stained glass window in the Turkish Baths The baths were designed by the City Surveyor, T. de Courcy Meade, and his assistant, Arthur Davies. The work was supervised by Henry Price, the newly appointed city architect. The baths were opened in September 1906 by the Lord Mayor of Manchester who described the building as a \\"water palace\\". For 86 years the Baths provided both essential and leisure facilities. Private baths and a laundry were housed there along with three swimming pools and a Turkish bath, later a Sauna was added. The main swimming pool was floored over in the winter months to hold dances. In 1952 the Victoria Baths installed the first public Aeratone (jacuzzi) in the country. In the design and construction of the Baths, a great deal of money was expended, Manchester having at that time one of the world's wealthiest municipal coffers. The fa√ßade has multi-coloured brickwork and terracotta decoration, the main interior public spaces are clad in glazed tiles from floor to ceiling and most of the many windows have decorative stained glass. The Baths were closed by Manchester City Council in 1993. The Friends of Victoria Baths was formed and began to investigate the possibility of running the Victoria Baths independently. Various fund-raising attempts failed to bring about a restoration of the Baths, although work to prevent further deterioration of the building started in 1998. =Restoration= The interior in 2010 In September 2003, the Baths won the first series of the BBC's Restoration programme. The building was chosen by a public phone-vote from a short-list of ten buildings in danger of dereliction in the UK. It was awarded ¬£3.4 million from the Heritage Lottery Fund and the money raised through the phone-voting process. The Prince of Wales visited the baths a month later to help celebrate the win. It was intended that the money would be spent on re- opening the Turkish bath by around 2006, with other parts following later at a cost of around ¬£15‚Äì20m. However, the redevelopment plans were dealt a blow one year later when quantity surveyors delivered a much larger estimate of ¬£6.3m to restore the Turkish baths. The Heritage Lottery Fund requested further details about the full redevelopment before they would hand over any money for the first phase. Final planning approval to begin a restoration process was not received until September 2005. In September 2006, as part of a number of events to mark the centenary of the building's opening, the gala pool was filled for the first time in 13 years. The first phase of restoration work consisting of structural work and repairs began on Monday 19 March 2007, and was completed in September 2008. In 2011 the Baths were used as a filming location, a concert venue, and an exhibition centre. On 16 April 2017, the baths were once again reopened for an invite only acid house dance pool party hosted by Boiler Room; The Warehouse Project; and Fac 51 The Warehouse. This was called \\"The Other Side of Midnight\\". The event was also live streamed on YouTube, the video is unlisted.

Ameren Corporation is an American power company created December 31, 1997, by the merger of St. Louis, Missouri's Union Electric Company (formerly NYSE: UEP) and the neighboring Central Illinois Public Service Company (CIPSCO Inc. holding, formerly NYSE: CIP) of Springfield, Illinois. It is now a holding company for several power companies and energy companies. The company is based in St. Louis, serving 2.4 million electric, and 900,000 natural gas customers across 64,000 square miles in central and eastern Missouri and the southern four-fifths of Illinois. Ameren is the holding company for the following: * Ameren Missouri * Ameren Illinois * Ameren Transmission Company *Ameren Services The Ameren Missouri subsidiary owns Bagnell Dam on the Osage River, which forms the Lake of the Ozarks. Ameren Missouri is responsible for managing water levels on the lake according to federal regulations.What Is Shoreline Management At Lake Of The Ozarks? by Jeff Green, LakeExpo; https://www.lakeexpo.com/news/lake_news/what- is-shoreline-management-at-lake-of-the- ozarks/article_08ecbb10-fafe-11e4-bc08-175bc99f2987.html History =Origins= Prior to the formation of Ameren, the first major development in the history of its constituent parts occurred in 1929, when the Bagnell Dam was completed on the Osage River and generated almost 175 megawatts of hydroelectricity for Missouri's Union Electric Company. The dam also created the Lake of the Ozarks with of shoreline. In 1931, Union Electric Light and Power sought additional generating sources (interurbans being one need) and the company began buying power from the Keokuk, IA dam, north of St. Louis. Union Electric later bought the dam, providing 134 megawatts of hydroelectricity carried over a longer distance than had ever been achieved before. By the 1950s Union Electric owned gas operations in and around Alton, Illinois, and acquired other utilities to become the third largest distributor of natural gas in Missouri. In 1952, Ameren's second major constituent, the Central Illinois Public Service Company, became a major pooled energy power distributor with its future Ameren mate, Union Electric Company. The arrangement formed the Midwest Power Pool system. The CIPS Meredosia, Illinois Power Station became a key contributor to the pool, which also included the later Ameren subsidiary Illinois Power Company. In 1963 Union Electric completed construction of one of the largest pumped storage plants at that time, the then-350-megawatt Taum Sauk Plant, in Reynolds County, Missouri. In 1984 Union Electric added nuclear energy to the mix, when the Callaway Nuclear Generating Station began providing 1,143 megawatts of power from Callaway County, Missouri. =Ameren history= In 1995 shareholders of both CIPSCO Inc. and of its neighboring utility of twice its size, the S&P; 500-listed Union Electric Company, approved the merger of the two companies, which were to then be combined as Ameren Corporation. Both of those former utilities had traded publicly on the New York Stock Exchange, under ticker symbol CIP and UEP, respectively. At the time of the merger, Union Electric had assets of nearly US$600 million, but still carried nearly US$1.8 billion in long-term debt, although down from US$2.5 billion which it had accumulated by the 1980s. CIPSCO had assets of about US$210 million, but still carried nearly half of US$1 billion in long-term debt, which it had also accumulated by the 1980s.Standard & Poor's Stock Guide, April 1996 The merger was completed on December 31, 1997, when the two public companies became one, as Ameren Corporation, which then began to trade publicly on the New York Stock Exchange with the ticker symbol AEE. The name Ameren comes from the combination of American electric Following the merger, Union Electric began doing business as AmerenUE, now known as Ameren Missouri. Today, with nine power plants Ameren Missouri serves 1.2 million power customers and 110,000 gas customers, primarily in Missouri, where more than half of its customers reside in the St. Louis metropolitan area. It also served Iowa as well through the mid-1990s, and served adjoining parts of Illinois until 2010. The former CIPSCO Inc. utility, Central Illinois Public Service Company, became Ameren's other operating company, doing business as AmerenCIPS. In 2000, Ameren formed the holding company, AmerenEnergy Resources. It contained two further subsidiaries, AmerenEnergy Marketing, and AmerenEnergy Generating. In 2002, Ameren Corporation announced a voluntary retirement program, which was offered to approximately 1,000 of Ameren's 7,400 current employees, expecting to realize significant long-term savings. In 2003, Ameren acquired Peoria-based CILCORP, Inc. and its leading subsidiary, Central Illinois Light Company, from AES Corporation. CILCORP had traded on the NYSE with ticker symbol CER prior to its acquisition by AES, and by the mid-1990s had become a member of the S&P; Small Cap 600 index. CILCO had been another pioneer utility in the region, which had paid a dividend since 1921. By 1996, it had grown to over US$150 million in assets, and carried US$330 million in long-term debt. Following the 2003 Ameren acquisition, that utility began doing business as AmerenCILCO. At the end of 2003, Ameren's chairman and chief executive, Charles Mueller, retired and was succeeded in both positions by Gary Rainwater, the company's president and chief operating officer the past two years. In 2004, Ameren acquired the third partner from the 1952 Midwest Power Pool system, Illinois Power Company, from Dynegy Inc. That utility had traded publicly on the NYSE under the ticker symbol IPC through the 1980s, and paid dividends since 1947. As of the late 1980s, the company generated electricity and natural gas, almost entirely from coal plants, with less than 1% fueled from oil and gas. By then, with about $360 million in assets, it carried long- term debt of over US$2 billion.Standard & Poor's Stock Guide, December 1987 In 1991, Illinois Power reorganized as a holding company, Illinova Corporation, which traded on the NYSE with ticker symbol ILN. Illinova had grown to an S&P; Midcap 400 stock by 1996, with over US$415 million in assets, and had brought the IP utility's debt down to US$1.8 billion by then. In a merger completed February 1, 2000, Illinova became a wholly owned subsidiary of Dynegy Inc. (), in which Chevron Corporation also took a 28% stake. Dynegy in turn had been created in June 1998, from the merger of Chevron's natural gas and natural gas liquids businesses with Dynegy's predecessor, NGC Corp. (former ticker NGL). NGC had been an integrated natural gas services company around since 1994.CHEVRON CORP. APPLAUDS DYNEGY-ILLINOVA MERGER , Chevron Press Release Archives, Feb. 2, 2000 Following Ameren's acquisition of Illinois Power, that subsidiary began doing business as AmerenIP. The IP acquisition made Ameren the major investor-owned power company in downstate Illinois. In December 2004, Ameren announced that Patrick T. Stokes, the president and chief executive officer of Anheuser-Busch Cos., Inc., was elected to the Ameren board of directors. In 2009, AmerenUE signed an agreement to purchase 102 megawatts (MW) of wind power from phase II of Horizon Wind Energy's Pioneer Prairie Wind Farm in Iowa, which is enough to power 26,000 households. The power AmerenUE is purchasing will tie into the Midwest Independent System Operator (MISO) transmission grid, of which the company is a member, fulfilling AmerenUE's commitment to add 100 megawatts of renewable capacity to serve its Missouri customers by 2010. On October 1, 2010 Ameren's three Illinois operating companies merged to become Ameren Illinois Company. The merger resulted in a single operating company providing power to most of downstate Illinois. However, the Ameren Illinois service territory is split into three rate zones corresponding to the service territories of the three former Illinois operating companies‚ÄîZone I (the former AmerenCIPS), Zone II (the former AmerenCILCO) and Zone III (the former AmerenIP). On the same date, AmerenUE changed its name to Ameren Missouri Company.Ameren fact sheet The former Illinois portion of the AmerenUE territory was transferred to Ameren Illinois Zone I. In 2015, Ameren became the first major energy company to open an Innovation Center at the Research Park, University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign. In 2016, Ameren was named 10th on Business Insider‚Äôs 10 best energy companies to work for in America list. In the report, seventy four percent of employees said their job has high meaning.  Ownership  As of 2017 Ameren shares are mainly held by institutional investors (Vanguard group, BlackRock, State Street Corporation, among othersAmeren Corporation Ownership Summary). Taum Sauk pumped storage plant A large section of the Taum Sauk upper reservoir failed, draining over a billion gallons of water in less than half an hour. Ameren Missouri owns the Taum Sauk pumped storage plant,FERC Taum Sauk Page - Reports, Charges and Settlement available here which failed on December 14, 2005, causing extensive damage to the east fork of the Black River and to Johnson's Shut-Ins State Park. Consequently, FERC fined Ameren $15 million. The State of Missouri has sued Ameren for actual and punitive damages, alleging Ameren recklessly operated the plant and put financial considerations from sale of power to other companies over safety, maintenance and engineering. The plant was operated by remote control with no one onsite during pumping operations. Rebuilding the upper reservoir of the AmerenUE Taum Sauk pumped-storage hydroelectric plant cost $450 million. The upper reservoir was constructed with roller compacted concrete (RCC); and online in 2010, this reservoir is the largest RCC dam in North America. The 450-megawatt Taum Sauk pumped storage hydroelectric plant began generating electricity again on April 21, 2010. Environmental issues In 2011 the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) filed suit (Case No. 4:11 CV 77 RWS) against Ameren Missouri concerning excess sulfur (SO2) emissions from the Rush Island Plant in Festus, Missouri EPA alleged Ameren violated the Clean Air Act, the Missouri State Implementation Plan, and Ameren's Rush Island Plant Title V Permit when it undertook major modifications at the Rush Island Plant in 2007 through 2010 without obtaining the required permits under the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) provisions of the New Source Review (NSR) program. In January 2017 the District Court found that Ameren \\"...violated the Clean Air Act without obtaining the necessary permits, installing best- available pollution technology, and otherwise meeting applicable requirements.\\" Judge Rodney Sippel entered a finding of liability in January 2017, and the court proceedings currently underway will establish remedies. Ameren has a history of supporting the adoption of electric vehicles. In 2016, the company attempted to launch a pilot program to install electric vehicle charging stations but state utility regulators turned down oversight of the project. As a result, Ameren canceled the program because it would not recover its investments. However, in early 2018 Ameren tried again, this time launching a program called \\"Charge Ahead\\" which incentivizes the installation of around 1,200 charging stations. In addition, the program creates incentives for the adoption of commercial electric vehicles. In nineteenth and twentieth centuries a local utility company operated a coal gasification plant at the corner of Ash and Orr streets in Columbia, Missouri, that was subsequently demolished. The company was purchased by the Ameren Corporation. The gasification process contaminated the soil and some groundwater in the area with carcinogenic chemicals. In June 2014 Ameren was removing contaminated soil from the area, and expected to finish by September 2014. As of 2019 the city is considering purchasing the lot to create a public park. Ameren has been criticized by the North Village Board of Directors for owning \\"a whole city block that is in disrepair and for an aversion to commerce.\\" Ameren Missouri sponsors the Adopt-the-Shoreline program, which enables people to ‚Äúadopt‚Äù portions of the shoreline for litter control. They also control other shoreline activities in the Lake of the Ozarks such as the regulation of boat docks, seawalls and other structures within the Osage Project boundary on the lake and downstream from Bagnell Dam. The company maintains the Lake and Shoreline Protection Hotline that anyone who wishes can use to report neglected docks or other concerns they may have about the lake. Former manufactured gas plant A predecessor of Ameren operated a coal gasification plant at the corner of Ash and Orr streets in Columbia, Missouri, which was subsequently demolished. The gasification process contaminated the soil and some groundwater in the area with potentially cancer-causing chemicals. Ameren has since finished removing contaminated soil as of September 2014.

Abstractly, a density is a section of a certain trivial line bundle, called the density bundle. An element of the density bundle at x is a function that assigns a volume for the parallelotope spanned by the n given tangent vectors at x. From the operational point of view, a density is a collection of functions on coordinate charts which become multiplied by the absolute value of the Jacobian determinant in the change of coordinates. Densities can be generalized into s-densities, whose coordinate representations become multiplied by the s-th power of the absolute value of the jacobian determinant. On an oriented manifold, 1-densities can be canonically identified with the n-forms on M. On non-orientable manifolds this identification cannot be made, since the density bundle is the tensor product of the orientation bundle of M and the n-th exterior product bundle of T'M (see pseudotensor).  Motivation (densities in vector spaces)  In general, there does not exist a natural concept of a \\"volume\\" for a parallelotope generated by vectors in a n-dimensional vector space V. However, if one wishes to define a function that assigns a volume for any such parallelotope, it should satisfy the following properties: * If any of the vectors vk is multiplied by , the volume should be multiplied by Œª. * If any linear combination of the vectors v1, ..., vj‚àí1, vj+1, ..., vn is added to the vector vj, the volume should stay invariant. These conditions are equivalent to the statement that Œº is given by a translation-invariant measure on V, and they can be rephrased as :\\\\mu(Av_1,\\\\ldots,Av_n)=\\\\left\\\\det A\\\\right\\\\mu(v_1,\\\\ldots,v_n), \\\\quad A\\\\in \\\\operatorname{GL}(V). Any such mapping is called a density on the vector space V. Note that if (v1, ..., vn) is any basis for V, then fixing Œº(v1, ..., vn) will fix Œº entirely; it follows that the set Vol(V) of all densities on V forms a one-dimensional vector space. Any n-form œâ on V defines a density on V by :\\\\omega(v_1,\\\\ldots,v_n) := \\\\omega(v_1,\\\\ldots,v_n). =Orientations on a vector space= The set Or(V) of all functions that satisfy :o(Av_1,\\\\ldots,Av_n)=\\\\operatorname{sign}(\\\\det A)o(v_1,\\\\ldots,v_n), \\\\quad A\\\\in \\\\operatorname{GL}(V) forms a one-dimensional vector space, and an orientation on V is one of the two elements such that for any linearly independent . Any non-zero n-form œâ on V defines an orientation such that :o(v_1,\\\\ldots,v_n)\\\\omega(v_1,\\\\ldots,v_n) = \\\\omega(v_1,\\\\ldots,v_n), and vice versa, any and any density define an n-form œâ on V by :\\\\omega(v_1,\\\\ldots,v_n)= o(v_1,\\\\ldots,v_n)\\\\mu(v_1,\\\\ldots,v_n). In terms of tensor product spaces, : \\\\operatorname{Or}(V)\\\\otimes \\\\operatorname{Vol}(V) = \\\\bigwedge^n V^*, \\\\quad \\\\operatorname{Vol}(V) = \\\\operatorname{Or}(V)\\\\otimes \\\\bigwedge^n V^*. =s-densities on a vector space= The s-densities on V are functions such that :\\\\mu(Av_1,\\\\ldots,Av_n)=\\\\left\\\\det A\\\\right^s\\\\mu(v_1,\\\\ldots,v_n), \\\\quad A\\\\in \\\\operatorname{GL}(V). Just like densities, s-densities form a one-dimensional vector space Vols(V), and any n-form œâ on V defines an s-density œâs on V by :\\\\omega^s(v_1,\\\\ldots,v_n) := \\\\omega(v_1,\\\\ldots,v_n)^s. The product of s1\\\\- and s2-densities Œº1 and Œº2 form an (s1+s2)-density Œº by :\\\\mu(v_1,\\\\ldots,v_n) := \\\\mu_1(v_1,\\\\ldots,v_n)\\\\mu_2(v_1,\\\\ldots,v_n). In terms of tensor product spaces this fact can be stated as : \\\\operatorname{Vol}^{s_1}(V)\\\\otimes \\\\operatorname{Vol}^{s_2}(V) = \\\\operatorname{Vol}^{s_1+s_2}(V). Definition Formally, the s-density bundle Vols(M) of a differentiable manifold M is obtained by an associated bundle construction, intertwining the one- dimensional group representation :\\\\rho(A) = \\\\left\\\\det A\\\\right^{-s},\\\\quad A\\\\in \\\\operatorname{GL}(n) of the general linear group with the frame bundle of M. The resulting line bundle is known as the bundle of s-densities, and is denoted by :\\\\left\\\\Lambda\\\\right^s_M = \\\\left\\\\Lambda\\\\right^s(TM). A 1-density is also referred to simply as a density. More generally, the associated bundle construction also allows densities to be constructed from any vector bundle E on M. In detail, if (UŒ±,œÜŒ±) is an atlas of coordinate charts on M, then there is associated a local trivialization of \\\\left\\\\Lambda\\\\right^s_M :t_\\\\alpha : \\\\left\\\\Lambda\\\\right^s_M_{U_\\\\alpha} \\\\to \\\\phi_\\\\alpha(U_\\\\alpha)\\\\times\\\\mathbb{R} subordinate to the open cover UŒ± such that the associated GL(1)-cocycle satisfies :t_{\\\\alpha\\\\beta} = \\\\left\\\\det (d\\\\phi_\\\\alpha\\\\circ d\\\\phi_\\\\beta^{-1})\\\\right^{-s}.  Integration  Densities play a significant role in the theory of integration on manifolds. Indeed, the definition of a density is motivated by how a measure dx changes under a change of coordinates . Given a 1-density ∆í supported in a coordinate chart UŒ±, the integral is defined by :\\\\int_{U_\\\\alpha} f = \\\\int_{\\\\phi_\\\\alpha(U_\\\\alpha)} t_\\\\alpha\\\\circ f\\\\circ\\\\phi_\\\\alpha^{-1}d\\\\mu where the latter integral is with respect to the Lebesgue measure on Rn. The transformation law for 1-densities together with the Jacobian change of variables ensures compatibility on the overlaps of different coordinate charts, and so the integral of a general compactly supported 1-density can be defined by a partition of unity argument. Thus 1-densities are a generalization of the notion of a volume form that does not necessarily require the manifold to be oriented or even orientable. One can more generally develop a general theory of Radon measures as distributional sections of \\\\Lambda^1_M using the Riesz-Markov-Kakutani representation theorem. The set of 1/p-densities such that \\\\phi_p = \\\\left( \\\\int\\\\phi^p \\\\right)^{1/p} < \\\\infty is a normed linear space whose completion L^p(M) is called the intrinsic Lp space of M. Conventions In some areas, particularly conformal geometry, a different weighting convention is used: the bundle of s-densities is instead associated with the character :\\\\rho(A) = \\\\left\\\\det A\\\\right^{-s/n}. With this convention, for instance, one integrates n-densities (rather than 1-densities). Also in these conventions, a conformal metric is identified with a tensor density of weight 2.

At the age of twenty-one he entered the Society of Jesus, and after his course of studies and teaching in France, arrived in Canada in 1655. He was at once dispatched with Father Chaumonot to begin a central mission among the Iroquois at Onondaga. The diary he kept of this journey and of his return to Quebec in the year following gives a graphic account of the terrifying conditions under which these journeys were made.\\"Portant sur le voyage des p√®res Joseph Chaumonot et Claude Dablon √† Onontagu√©, pays des Iroquois, 1655\\" Many of his diary notes were published during his lifetime in Jesuit Relations.See for example, \\"Fr.

It was Dablon who appointed Marquette to undertake the expedition which resulted in the discovery of the Upper Mississippi River; he also gave Marquette's letters and charts to the world. In connection with this discovery he called attention to the feasibility of passing from Lake Erie to Florida \\"by cutting a canal through only half a league of prairie to pass from the end of the Lake of the Illinois (Lake Michigan) to the River of St. Louis\\" (the Illinois River). This canal, projected by Dablon, was built in the 1840s as the Illinois and Michigan Canal. After founding Sault Ste.

Lili formed on October 14 from a tropical wave, which emerged from the coast of west Africa on October 4\\\\. After the storm formed, further strengthening of Lili was gradual, first to tropical storm status on October 16 and then to hurricane status on October 17\\\\. The next day, Lili struck Cuba and moved across the central portion of the island, the first hurricane to hit the country since Hurricane Kate in 1985. After emerging into the Atlantic Ocean, the hurricane accelerated northeastward, briefly peaking as a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale near the Bahamas. For almost an entire week, Hurricane Lili oscillated in intensity while fluctuating several times in forward speed. About two weeks passed before Lili transitioned into an extratropical storm north of the Azores on October 27, which subsequently moved across Ireland and Great Britain. Early in its duration, Lili caused flooding in Central America that left thousands homeless and killed 14 people. Damage was heaviest in Cuba, mostly due to the hurricane's heavy rainfall which totaled 29.41 in (747 mm). The hurricane affected 11 Cuban provinces, damaging 92,542 houses and destroying another 6,369. The rains heavily damaged the sugar cane and banana crops, and overall damage in the country was estimated at $362 million (1996 USD). After 269,995 people were evacuated in advance of Lili, there were no deaths in the country. In nearby Florida, one person died after being swept into a drain during the storm's heavy rains. Moisture from Lili also fueled a storm that struck the northeastern United States, which contributed indirectly to a death when a man in Maine tried driving across a flooded roadway. Damage in the Bahamas was not severe, limited to some damaged roofs and downed trees. When the remnants of Lili struck Ireland and the United Kingdom, it produced strong winds and high seas that damaged hundreds of houses, causing $300 million in damage (1996 USD) and six deaths. Meteorological history On October 4, a tropical wave exited the west coast of Africa with a large associated circulation. Unfavorable wind shear prevented any development, and the wave continued westward, entering the Caribbean Sea on October 11\\\\. Two days later, the wave axis encountered a pre-existing low pressure area in the southwest Caribbean. It quickly developed a well-defined circulation, becoming a tropical depression on October 14 off the east coast of Nicaragua. Due to an upper- level low in the Gulf of Mexico, the system tracked to the northwest, brushing Central America in its path. The depression developed banding features as the pressure gradually dropped, and intensified into Tropical Storm Lili at around 0600 UTC on October 16\\\\. During this time, the storm executed a small cyclonic loop while a few hundred miles north of the Swan Islands. By early on October 17, Lili had attained hurricane status while it was turning to the north. Hurricane Lili grazed Isla de la Juventud on October 18, bringing heavy rains and strong winds to the island. Later that day, Lili made landfall in Matanzas Province, Cuba as a category 2 hurricane, with winds close to . Despite the mountainous terrain, the storm did not weaken, with the same pressure reading of being observed at landfall and when Lili reemerged into the Atlantic Ocean. After reaching warm waters, Lili further strengthened as it approached the Bahamas. The eye of the storm - reaching a width of over - passed over San Salvador Island and Great Exuma on October 19, and brushed several other islands. That day, a trough in the westerlies caused Lili to accelerate northeastward, reaching a forward speed of almost . On October 19 at 1200 UTC, Hurricane Lili attained its peak intensity for a brief time, reaching winds and pressure of , both measured by the Hurricane Hunters. This made Lili the sixth major hurricane - a category 3 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale - of the season. Within six hours, Lili had weakened below its peak intensity on October 19\\\\. The center passed to the southeast of Bermuda, and subsequently the winds gradually decreased. A mid-level ridge caused Lili to slow to an east-southeast drift on October 22\\\\. After two days, the hurricane again accelerated to the northeast, briefly re-intensifying into a category 2 hurricane. Lili again started a weakening trend soon after, and by October 26, was downgraded to a tropical storm about northwest of the Azores. On October 27, it was estimated that Lili became extratropical, which maintained gale- force winds as it approached Europe. The remnants moved across Ireland and Great Britain on October 28 with winds of about . The remnants of Lili were absorbed by a much larger extratropical system in the North Sea on October 29, which proceeded to cross over the European mainland. Preparations and impact Lili killed 22 people throughout its lifetime. Fourteen deaths were reported in Central America, and six in the United Kingdom. There were two deaths indirectly related to the hurricane in the United States. Damage figures for Central America and the Bahamas are unavailable, but total damages in Cuba and the British Isles were estimated at $662 million (1996 USD). =Western Caribbean= In its formative stages, Lili produced heavy rainfall in portions of Central America, causing flooding that left thousands of people homeless. In Costa Rica, there were four deaths, and five people drowned in Nicaragua, all due to river flooding. In Honduras, there were five deaths, one of which when a house was washed away. The storm briefly posed a threat to Mexico, and a tropical storm warning was issued from Chetumal Bay to Cabo Catoche along the eastern Yucat√°n peninsula. A tropical storm warning and hurricane watch were also issued for the Cayman Islands. =Cuba= Hurricane Lili over Cuba on October 18 While Lili was still a tropical depression, the government of Cuba issued a hurricane watch for Isla de la Juventud and the provinces of Pinar del Rio and Havana provinces. On October 16, a tropical storm warning was put in place for several provinces, which was upgraded to a hurricane warning the next day for eight provinces, eastward to Camag√ºey. The threat of the storm caused all flights to and from Cuba to be canceled, and the airport at Havana was closed. Officials set up shelters and ordered about 88,000 people in Havana to evacuate from buildings prone to collapsing; however, only 5,000 people had evacuated by the day before landfall, due to fears of their houses being robbed. Ultimately, 269,995 people evacuated due to the storm, along with over 270,000 livestock. Officials also closed classes and sent workers home in areas along the projected path, and two hospitals were completely evacuated. Power lines in Havana were intentionally turned off before the storm to minimize potential damage. Before Lili, the last hurricane to strike Cuba was Hurricane Kate in 1985. The country was already experiencing economic difficulties when the storm struck, following the collapse of the Soviet Union in a crisis known as the Special Period. Crossing through Cuba, Hurricane Lili produced strong winds, affecting 11 of the country's 15 provinces. The offshore Cayo Largo del Sur reported in 10 minute sustained winds, with gusts to . On the Isla de la Juventud, wind gusts reached 80 mph (130 km/h), and on the mainland, Santo Domingo reported wind gusts of . Heavy rainfall accompanied the hurricane's passage through the country, peaking at 29.41 in (747 mm), including a daily total of 17.07 in (433 mm). High waves struck the southern coast of Cuba, estimated at over 20 ft (7 m). While crossing Cuba, Lili primarily caused damage from its heavy rainfall and not from the winds. Nationwide, Lili damaged 92,542 houses and destroyed another 6,369, mostly in Cienfuegos and Sancti Sp√≠ritus, which left thousands of people homeless. Heavy rains caused homes to collapse along the path, many already in poor condition. On Isla de la Juventud, the winds damaged 85 houses and destroyed another 103. The winds also stripped 16 tons of grapefruit from their trees on the island. Nationwide, hundreds of thousands of trees fell during the storm. On Cayo Largo del Sur, the strong waves wrecked seaside cabanas. In Villa Clara Province, about 45 mi (75 km) of roads were damaged, and the winds destroyed the roofs of 28 sugar refineries. In Havana, the storm wrecked a dozen buildings and downed several trees. Nationwide, the hurricane downed hundreds of power lines, leaving many towns without power, and power plants were damaged in Sancti Sp√≠ritus and Cienfuegos provinces. The hurricane also damaged 21 hospitals and dozens of health clinics, along with 32 schools. Extensive crop damage occurred along the storm's path, affecting thousands of hectares of arable land, and damaging 105 agricultural facilities. Flooding affected the banana, fruit, coffee, sugar cane, and rice crops. Nationwide, the storm damaged about 25,406 hectares of bananas and 686,893 hectares of sugar cane, along with 36,249 hectares of other crops. In Sancti Esp√≠ritu, 28,000 tons of rice were wrecked, and in Matanzas, 7,500 tons of citrus crops were heavily damaged. Total damages in the country were estimated at $362 million (1996 USD). There were no deaths in Cuba, and seven injuries. =United States= Lili's rainfall in Florida Tropical cyclone forecast models correctly anticipated that Lili would pass southeast of Florida, despite a potential landfall within 24 hours had the storm maintained its previous track. The National Hurricane Center issued a tropical storm warning for the Florida Keys but not for the Miami metropolitan area. Wind gusts in the Florida Keys reached at Sand Key Light. For several days, a trough extended northward from the hurricane, producing heavy rainfall in the southeast portion of the state. The highest total was in Everglades National Park. One person died in Palm Beach County when a farm worker was swept into a canal drainage pipe. High waves from the hurricane affected the northern coast of Puerto Rico, causing minor flooding. On October 18, a low pressure area developed near Norfolk, Virginia, which moved up the coastline and struck New England the next day. The system drew moisture from Lili, which dropped heavy rainfall over portions of the northeastern United States that reached in Newburyport, Massachusetts. In the state, the rains flooded hundreds of houses, leaving over $10 million in damage. High rainfall and a storm surge flooded coastal portions of Maine, and Portland lost freshwater access for 24 hours after a water main broke. There was one indirect death when a man tried driving across a flooded road in Cumberland County, and damage in the state totaled over $26 million. Heavy rainfall in New Hampshire also caused flooding, and river flooding occurred in both Pennsylvania and New Jersey due to the storm. Farther south in Delaware, the rains caused flash flooding in northern New Castle County, and roadway flooding occurred in eastern Maryland. =Bahamas= A hurricane watch was issued for the northwestern Bahamas on October 17, which was upgraded to a warning and expanded to cover the central Bahamas on the next day. A tropical storm warning was later issued for the southeastern Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands. The airport in Nassau was closed before the storm struck, and 40 people in Georgetown on Exuma island evacuated. While moving through the Bahamas, Lili produced in 10-minute sustained winds on San Salvador Island. On Great Exuma island, there was an estimated storm tide, mostly on the southwestern portion, which caused beach erosion and some coral damage. At French Bay, waves destroyed the public dock. Effects were worst on the western portion, including damaged houses and sunk boats. Hotels sustained heavy roof damage in Cockburn Town and Victoria Hill. The storm also knocked down trees, and sea spray damaged some crops. On Long Island, the storm damaged crops and a few houses. Overall damage in the Bahamas was described as \\"scattered\\", and not affecting any tourism areas. =United Kingdom= On October 28, the extratropical remnants of Lili moved over Ireland and the United Kingdom, considered the strongest storm to affect the area since 1961. Alderney in the Channel Islands reported winds, with gusts to 90 mph (144 km/h). Swansea in Wales reported gusts of , leaving thousands of houses without power in the region. The remnants of Lili produced waves in Bristol Channel, which heavily damaged about 500 cottages in Somerset. waves in the North Sea removed an oil platform from its moorings, which nearly washed ashore near Peterhead until a line was reconnected. A storm tide along the River Thames flooding coastal areas, and high waves washed a sailboat ashore along Chale Bay in the Isle of Wight. The remnants of Lili also dropped about of rainfall, which alleviated drought conditions. The storm killed six people in Great Britain - four were related to traffic accidents, and two fishermen were swept into the sea. Damage was estimated at $300 million (1996 USD, ¬£150 million in 1996 pound sterling), making it the costliest storm in the United Kingdom since the Great Storm of 1987. Aftermath On October 20, the government of Cuba issued an appeal to the international community for assistance. The Red Cross provided $1.6 million to the country, and various departments of the United Nations provided $80,000. The government of Japan sent about $104,000 worth of medical equipment, and Italy sent about $526,000 worth of medical supplies. The Canadian Red Cross donated a water purification unit, and the Spanish Red Cross sent blankets and cots. The German Red Cross also sent mattresses and blankets. The American Red Cross sent 9.5 tons of food. Several other countries sent assistance, including the European Commission which sent $750,000 worth of supplies. There were early difficulties in transporting the relief supplies due to fuel shortages. Due to storm damage, 66,881 people resided in shelters until their houses were rebuilt, or until they moved elsewhere. By March 1997, most people had returned to their homes, although some did so without a roof. There was a threat for water-borne diseases due to stagnant waters, although no such outbreaks occurred. The storm decreased the supply of the banana crop in 1997, coupled with a drought. Following the shooting down two small private U.S. planes in Cuban airspace in February 1996, United States President Bill Clinton banned charter flights between the two nations. After the storm, the ban was lifted to allow the Caritas charity to fly a plane with supplies to Cuba. Some Cuban Americans in South Florida donated to help the affected Cuban victims, but others did not for fear it would assist the regime of President Fidel Castro. The plane landed on October 26 with 36.5 tons of supplies, carrying about 30 tons of food and the remainder in the form of construction material. Only 23 tons of rice, beans, and milk were distributed. The Cuban government rejected the remaining seven tons due to the parcels containing inscriptions other than \\"Caritas\\" or \\"CRS\\", such as \\"exile\\" or other messages against the communist party.

Wilhelmina Barns-Graham CBE (8 June 1912 ‚Äì 26 January 2004) was one of the foremost British abstract artists, a member of the influential Penwith Society of Arts. Early life The grave of Wilhelmina Barns-Graham, Eastern Cemetery, St Andrews Wilhelmina Barns-Graham, known as Willie, was born in St Andrews, Fife, on 8 June 1912 into an old landed Scottish family. Barns-Graham's parents were second cousins and their respective families were well established representatives of minor Scottish gentry from both the east and west of the country. As a child she showed very early signs of creative ability. It was at school that Wilhelmina decided that she wanted to be an artist after one of her paintings was chosen to be displayed on the wall there, she stated later in life that \\"painting chose me, not I it\\".  Education  After school she set her sights on Edinburgh College of Art where, after some dispute with her father who was an emotional man prone to uncontrolled anger, she enrolled in 1931. During her time at College Barns-Graham was taught by tutors including portrait painter David Alison and painter William MacTaggart, her friends there included the influential Scottish painters Robert MacBryde, Robert Colquhoun and William Gear. Since birth Barns-Graham suffered from weakness of the lungs, exacerbated by stress or anxiety, and in 1933 she contracted pleurisy forcing her to take a break from College. Barns-Graham finally graduated with her diploma in 1936.  Early artistic career  After her education Barns-Graham made study trips to Paris, London and St Tropez before moving to St Ives, Cornwall in 1940 at the suggestion of the Edinburgh College of Art's Principal Hubert Wellington. Barns-Graham moved near to where a group of modernist artists had settled, at Carbis Bay. This was a pivotal moment in her life. On one of her first evenings there she met the sculptor Barbara Hepworth who made an immediate and lasting impression on her she then went on to meet Borlase Smart, Alfred Wallis and Bernard Leach, as well as the painter Ben Nicholson and the sculptors Naum Gabo and Margaret Mellis. After two weeks in St Ives, Barns-Graham acquired her first studio, directly below the Porthmeor Gallery which was the administrative headquarters of the St Ives Society of Artists. Her paintings at the time were heavily influenced by the Cornish landscapes and the St Ives harbour. During 1940 and 1941 Barns-Graham contributed to the war effort by volunteering in a factory making camouflage nets however using the rough materials gave her dermatitis so she had to give up the work, instead knitting string vests and socks. In 1942 Barns-Graham became a member of the Newlyn Society of Artists, in which she exhibited with every year, and the St Ives Society of Artists. Whilst establishing herself in St Ives, Barns- Graham also continued to send work back to Scotland for major exhibitions held there such as the Royal Scottish Academy's 117th Exhibition in 1943. The 1940s were an active time for the St Ives Society of Artists who received a number of invitations to send exhibitions and groups of works to galleries in the UK and abroad, Barns-Graham's work was always included in these as the Society's secretary, Borlase Smart, thought highly of her work. After the war the number of young modern artists joining the St Ives Society of Artists increased, of which Barns-Graham was one, their works were often shown in the darkly lit font area of the New Gallery of the Mariners' Church which gave them the nickname 'The Artists Around the Font'. There was deemed to be hostility from the more traditional artists of the Society so Barns-Graham and the other modern artists decided to exhibit their work separately in the crypt area of the New Gallery, calling themselves the Crypt Group. The use of the crypt as an exhibition space caught on and was used again a number of times to exhibit the work of the young modernist members of the St Ives Society of Artists, including in March 1947 where seventeen artists exhibited work, including Barns-Graham, Ben Nicholson, Barbara Hepworth and Peter Lanyon. Barns-Graham's first opportunity to exhibit in London came when her work was included in a group exhibition of six at the Redfern Gallery. This was due to the introduction and support of Patrick Heron who visited Barns-Graham's studio in St Ives and was excited by her work. Barns-Graham would later have her first one-person exhibition in London at Redfern in 1952. After a few years of tension, Barns-Graham eventually left the St Ives Society of Artists in 1949, becoming one of the founding members of a new breakaway group named Penwith Society of Arts. The first Penwith Society exhibition opened in June 1949 with huge success and 2755 paying visitors coming to see it. In the same year she married the young author and aspiring poet, and later noted architect, David Lewis; the marriage was annulled in 1960. In 1950 Barns-Graham's painting Upper Glacier was purchased by the British Council, this was her largest sale she had made so far and the following year the work was also included in Herbert Read's book Contemporary British Art. Barns-Graham's work was also increasingly being included in London exhibitions such as the Leicester Galleries Artists of Fame and Promise and the inaugural exhibition at the new Institute of Contemporary Arts premises. In 1951 Barns-Graham's work was also included in international exhibitions such as the Biennale de Peinture de France, where Barns-Graham was one of only eight British artists invited to contribute.  Later artistic career  Barns-Graham travelled regularly over the next twenty years to Switzerland, Italy, Paris and Spain. With the exception of a short teaching term at Leeds School of Art (1956‚Äì1957), where she befriended the artists Terry Frost and Stass Paraskos, and three years in London (1960‚Äì1963), she lived and worked in St Ives. From 1960, on inheriting a house outside St Andrews from her aunt Mary Niesh (who had been a support to her throughout her art college years), she split her time between summers in Cornwall and winters in Scotland. After the war, when St Ives had ceased to be a pivotal centre of modernism, Barns-Graham's work and importance as an artist was sidelined, in part by an art-historical consensus that she had been only as a minor member of the St Ives school. In old age, however, she received belated recognition. She received honorary doctorates from the University of St Andrews in 1992 and later from the universities of Plymouth in 2000, Exeter in 2001 and Heriot Watt Universities in 2003. In 1999 she was elected an honorary member of the Royal Scottish Academy and the Royal Scottish Watercolourists. She was awarded a CBE in 2001, the same year that saw the publication of the first major monograph on her life and work, written by Lynne Green ‚Äî W.Barns-Graham : A Studio Life (Lund Humphries). This publication was followed in 2007 by The Prints of Wilhelmina Barns-Graham: a complete catalogue by Ann Gunn (also a Lund Humphries publication). Her work is found in several major public collections in Britain. Wilhelmina Barns- Graham died in St Andrews on 26 January 2004. She is buried by the western wall of the Eastern Cemetery, not far from the cathedral. She bequeathed her entire estate to The Barns-Graham Charitable Trust, which she had established in 1987. The aims of the trust are to foster and protect her reputation, to advance the knowledge of her life and work, to create an archive of key works of art and papers, and, in a cause close to her heart, to support and inspire art and art history students through offering grants and bursaries to those in selected art college and universities. Artistic style Through the course of her life Wilhelmina Barns-Graham's work generally lay on the divide between abstract and representational, typically drawing on inspirations from landscape. From as early as the age of eight Barns-Graham had been creating abstract shapes with coloured chalks. From 1940, when she arrived in Cornwall, her pictures are exploratory and even tentative as she began to develop her own method and visual language. The influence of St Ives then starts to arise, to take hold as local shapes and colours appear in the images - the Cornish rocks, landscape and buildings. Perhaps the most significant innovation at this time derived from the ideas of Naum Gabo, who was interested in the principle of stereometry - defining forms in terms of space rather than mass. Barns-Graham's series of glacier pictures that started in 1949, inspired by her walks on the Grindelwald Glacier in Switzerland, reflect the idea of looking at things in a total view, not only from the outside but from all points, including inside. In 1952 her studies of local forms became more planar and two dimensional, but from the mid-1950s she had developed a more expressionist and free form attitude following journeys to Spain. In the early 1960s, reflecting the turmoil in her personal life, Barns-Graham adopted a severe geometrical form of abstraction as a way of taking a fresh approach to her painting. Combined with a very intuitive sense of colour and design, the work often has more vitality than is immediately apparent. Squares tumble and circles flow across voids. Colour and movement come together and it is at this point in her work that St Ives perhaps exerts the least influence; rather, this approach more likely reflects an interest in the work of Josef Albers who was exciting UK artists at this time, in embracing new possibilities offered by the optical effects of a more formulaic abstraction. Nonetheless there is evidence to suggest that many images did stem from observations of the world around her. This is seen in a series of ice paintings in the late 1970s and then in a body of work that explores the hidden energies of sea and wind, composed of multiple wave-like lines drawn in the manner of Paul Klee. The Expanding Form paintings of 1980 are the culmination of many ideas from the previous fifteen years - the poetic movement in these works revealing a more relaxed view. From the late 1980s until her death, Barns-Graham's paintings became more and more free; an expression of life and free flowing brushwork not seen since the late 1950s. Working mainly on paper (there are relatively few canvases from this period) the images evolved to become, initially, highly complex, rich in colour and energy, and then, simultaneously, bolder and simpler, reflecting her enjoyment of life and living. \\"In my paintings I want to express the joy and importance of colour, texture, energy and vibrancy, with an awareness of space and construction. A celebration of life ‚Äî taking risks so creating the unexpected.\\" (Barns-Graham, October 2001) This outlook is perfectly expressed in the extraordinary collection of screen prints that she made with the Graal Press of Edinburgh, between 1999 and 2003. Barns- Graham's work is now owned by a number of public collections including the Arts Council of Great Britain, Tate Britain, the British Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum.

It has a small church, a community village hall and small public house. In the early 20th Century it had one or two shops, plus beer and cider houses. Later came a small garage with petrol pump, and a post office. None of these now survive. Towards the end of the century the character of the village changed, moving from a predominantly farming community to more of a residential character, with several new homes and a mini-estate and starter- home development built during the 1980s and 1990s. Nevertheless, a few historic farms remain active into the early 21st century, along with the more recently arrived alpaca breeders. Ashill Inn St. Stephen's Church is part of the parish of St. Mary's, Uffculme. Ashill Inn was built in 1835. One of the more visible features is a 3-storey Victorian red-brick dwelling at the lower end of the village. Legend has it that it began life as a 2-storey building (which would have been rather more in keeping with the character of the rest of the village), but during its construction the woman to whom the new owner was betrothed left him, and in order to win her back the man tried to impress her by commissioning an extra storey to his new home, thus assuring her of a greater status as the wife of a 'property owner'. As the story goes, he was unsuccessful in this, and she never returned to him. Ashill lies approximately two miles from Uffculme and Kentisbeare. It was soul/R&B; singer Joss Stone's teenage home (specifically, the hamlet of Rull, approximately half a mile away).

Margarot followed his father in business and political interest. Living in France during the French Revolution in 1789, Margarot had acquaintances among the revolutionary leaders. He was inspired (as well as further radicalized) by the French people and the revolution, and returned to England in 1792, where he followed Thomas Hardy into the London Corresponding Society to further the cause of reform. In May 1792, the Society elected Margarot as its chairman. Margarot's signature, along with Hardy's, were present on all the early publications by the London Corresponding Society, and this continued for several years. The publications called for fiscal and electoral reform as well as shorter parliaments. In November 1793, Margarot and Joseph Gerrald were chosen to attend the Edinburgh Convention organized by the Friends of the People Society - ostensibly a meeting for reformers, but seen as a threat and an attempt to establish an illegal government by William Pitt the Younger's ministry at the time. Margarot and Gerrald stood out during the debate and authorities selected them to be charged with sedition. Trial and transportation In December 1793, Margarot was arrested and charged with involvement in seditious practices. The trial in January 1794 was notable due to mob demonstrations in Margarot's favor. At his trial, Margarot defended himself with a speech described by the judge, Lord Braxfield, as itself being \\"sedition\\". He was found guilty, and along with four other radicals (later known as the \\"Scottish Martyrs to Liberty\\") was transported to New South Wales in May 1794 in the convict ship Surprize. Margarot was joined by his wife, but almost immediately a controversial and still mysterious set of events overtook the prisoners. Late in the voyage, Captain Patrick Campbell of the Surprize claimed to have been informed of a plan for mutiny and locked up several of the prisoners he was carrying, including Thomas Fyshe Palmer and William Skirving. The source for this claim was information provided by this ships' superintendent of convicts William Baker, a British loyalist who had taken a strong dislike to the four Scotsmen. Margarot was not locked up, and in his Narrative of the Sufferings of T.F. Palmer and William Skirving (1794) Palmer claimed that Margarot was in league with Campbell. No hearings were held, however, when the Surprize reached New South Wales later in the year. In New South Wales Upon arriving in Sydney, Margarot at once demanded his freedom from Lieutenant-Governor Francis Grose (British Army officer). Maurice maintained that the process of transportation should discharge his sentence. His request was denied and although he had to remain in the colony, he was not liable for compulsory labour. As a political prisoner, Margarot enjoyed more freedom than other convicts and with his wife started a small farm. In letters to Colonial Office and friends he criticized the officers' power in New South Wales and urged the British government to re-evaluate it. He was mentioned in a report of rebellion in September and October 1800 due to multiple claims of sedition. Margarot fell into further trouble with authorities, for example, claiming at several points to have been appointed by the British government to report on the mis-governance of the young penal colony. His home became a center for seditious events that included radical convicts and the Society of United Irishmen. Months later, Governor Philip Gidley King seized Margarot's papers, which contained republican sentiments, evidence of conspiracy with the Irish, and a forewarning of Australia succeeding America as a chief power in the world. His most notable run-in was in 1804, when he was suspected of involvement in the Castle Hill Rebellion run by the United Irishmen. Shortly after this, he was briefly sent to hard labor at the Newcastle, New South Wales settlement. He arrived early in 1806. The following years until his return to England in 1810 are blank. Later life and death Following his and his wife's return to England, Margarot served as a witness in Parliamentary hearings concerning mis-governance and corruption in New South Wales (such as that which led to the Rum Rebellion), and his own sentence that he claimed was unjust in length. He stood witness before the 1812 parliamentary committee on transportation, where he continued his pursuit against the officers from New South Wales. He published two pamphlets upon his return to England that marked his return to an interest in British politics. The pamphlets are Thoughts on Revolution (Harlow, 1812) and Proposal for a Grand National Jubilee (Sheffield, nd). Both put forward old radical themes as well as how desirable it would be to base an economy on a local farmer and to restrict commerce to a minimum. He died in December 1815 in extreme poverty, and under continued government suspicion as a pro-French radical. By that time, many domestic British radicals also held Margarot in suspicion, primarily because of Palmer's accusations concerning the mutiny. Burdett Coutts Memorial Sundial. He was buried in Old St. Pancras Churchyard in London. His name is listed on Burdett Coutts memorial there amongst the interments with no marker. Reputation In the early years of the Chartist movement, Francis Place and others (including, earlier, Thomas Hardy) sought to rehabilitate Margarot's reputation, as plans went forwards for monuments to the martyrs in Edinburgh, and in London. The monuments stand today at the Old Calton Burial Ground, on Calton Hill, Edinburgh, and in Nunhead Cemetery, London. The commemoration of the sacrifices made by Scottish Martyrs became a key touchstone of Chartist publicity.

The squeeze operates in three suits, where the squeezed player protects the menaces in two suits, but cannot help his partner anymore in the third suit after the squeeze is executed. Example The following example shows a guard squeeze: South has a simple squeeze against West in hearts and diamonds except that there is no entry in either threat suit. The squeeze operates because West is also busy protecting East against a club finesse. South plays the 2 and West must keep all his red cards to protect menaces of 5 and Q in the dummy. Thus West must discard a club. Now, the declarer plays a club to the ace and can finesse against East's queen of clubs. Double guard squeeze A double guard squeeze is very rare. Again, in the diagram South leads the spade 2. If West discards J, the position comes down to the one from the previous diagram. So, he must discard the diamond king.

History Buffalo's first bishop, John Timon, established St. Joseph's in 1847 to be the seat of the new diocese. Because of the economic situation in the city he raised funds to build the church while he was in Europe. The cornerstone was laid on February 6, 1851. During construction, a storm approached the city from Lake Erie and destroyed several homes in the area. Bishop Timon allowed the residents to set up tents within the cathedral's walls for several weeks. The cathedral was usable, but not complete, when it was dedicated on July 1, 1855. The south tower was completed in the summer of 1862. Bishop Timon consecrated the completed cathedral on August 21, 1863. In 1902, Bishop James Quigley decided that the diocese required a new cathedral and purchased property at Delaware Avenue and Utica Street beginning in 1902. Italian architect Aristide Leonori designed a new Gothic Revival cathedral which was constructed between 1912 and 1915. The new edifice became known as St. Joseph's (New) Cathedral and this church became known as St. Joseph's Old Cathedral. This time both towers of the new cathedral were completed to a height of . Unfortunately, the cathedral was better suited for Rome's climate rather than Buffalo's. By 1924, the north and south transepts required major repairs and by 1927, the towers were so unstable they were removed. The exterior marble started to separate from the brick and Bishop Edward D. Head determined in 1976 that repairs would be too costly for the \\"new\\" St. Joseph's and the diocese. In 1977, after the demolition of the new cathedral, the \\"old cathedral\\" once again became known as St. Joseph's Cathedral. Architecture Bishop Timon selected New York architect Patrick C. Keely, who had worked with A. W. N. Pugin, to design the church. He created a Gothic Revival structure in length by across. The original plan called for towers on the north and south corners of the facade, however only the south tower was finished. The tower contained a 43-bell carillon by Bollee & Son of Le Mans, France. At the time of its completion in 1869, the carillon was the largest in the U.S. and the third largest in the world. Installed in St. Joseph's in 1870, the bells were too large for the cathedral's tower and never worked properly. At present, all but 2 of the bells have been removed from the church tower. Bishop Stephen V. Ryan added the Lady Chapel built at the rear of the cathedral in 1873. The three lancet windows above the altar were produced at the direction of King Ludwig II of Bavaria for the Paris Exposition of 1855. During his trips to Europe, Bishop Timon saw the windows and asked if the King would donate them to the new structure. After first being refused, the Bishop persisted and the Ludwig relented. The cathedral was renovated in 1882, 1903‚Äì05, 1937‚Äì47 and most recently in 1977. Organ The choir loft houses a 3,627 pipe Hook & Hastings organ, Opus 828. The organ was built in 1876 for the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition, where it was played frequently for concerts. It was moved to the Cathedral following the end of the Exposition February 13, 1877. The organ was updated in 1925 and 1976, but by 1996 had become unplayable. In 1998, the bishop and parish council engaged the Andover Organ Company to restore and expand the instrument. Andover installed the restored instrument in 2001 as its Opus R-328. It currently contains three manuals and 90 stops.

It is included in the province of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York, in the Latin Church. The Buffalo Diocese includes eight counties in Western New York State. The Catholic population is nearly 700,000. The Diocese is divided into more than 150 parishes, which also include churches, schools, convents, seminaries, hospitals, and colleges. The Buffalo Diocese was established in 1847. From the Buffalo Diocese, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rochester was created in 1868. Bishop of Albany Edward B. Scharfenberger was named as temporary replacement for Bishop Richard Joseph Malone and apostolic administrator for the diocese by the Holy See at the Vatican on December 4, 2019. Range and population The Diocese covers throughout the eight counties of Western New York; and has a Catholic population of 690,000. In the Diocese are 166 parishes, 15 high schools, 52 elementary schools, seven colleges and universities, one seminary, convents, and four hospitals. History =Establishment= The Roman Catholic Diocese of Buffalo was established April 23, 1847. It was set apart from the great Diocese of New York and the See located at Buffalo on Lake Erie, the territory comprising nearly one-third of the State of New York. =Redistricting= In 1868, the Diocese of Rochester was formed from the eastern counties of the territory of the Diocese of Buffalo. In 1896, after Bishop Stephen Vincent Ryan's death, four more counties, including Steuben, Schuyler, Chemung, and Tioga, were taken from the Diocese of Buffalo and added to the Rochester jurisdiction. =Reports of sex abuse and shakeup in leadership= On September 12, 2018, leaked church records showed that there were 106 clergy in the Diocese of Buffalo who had been credibly accused of sexually abusing children, far more than a list of 42 which had been released by the Diocese in March of the year.Specht, Charlie, \\"Church records show more than 100 accused priests, not 42 as stated by Bishop Malone\\", WKBW-TV ABC-affiliated Channel 7, September 12, 2018/December 13, 2018. Numerous former Bishops and former Bishop Richard J. Malone, have been accused of shielding some of these \\"predator priests,\\" as well as at least one nun, from potential prosecution and transferring some to other parishes to avoid scrutiny.Flores, Rosa, and Kevin Conlon, \\"Secret files suggest Catholic bishop shielded alleged 'predator priests' from the public\\", CNN, September 25, 2018.Specht, Charlie, \\"The 85 Catholic clergy in Buffalo accused of sexual misconduct - and the bishops who covered it up: 7 Eyewitness News has compiled comprehensive list\\", WKBW-TV ABC-affiliated Channel 7, July 10, 2018/September 20, 2018.

On September 28, Malone named Steven L. Halter, a former agent in the FBI's Buffalo Division who took part in the investigations of the 9/11 World Trade Center and USS Cole attacks committed by the Islamic terrorist organization Al Qaeda and who served as senior accounting officer at Empire of America Federal Savings Bank, Buffalo beforehand, director of the Diocese's newly created Office of Personal Responsibility, which handles sex abuse complaints in the Diocese.\\"Diocese hires ex-FBI agent, SBU grad to review sex abuse complaints\\", Olean (NY) Times Herald, September 29, 2018.\\"Buffalo Catholic Diocese hires ex-FBI agent / BISHOP: Former federal agent will oversee new Office of Professional Responsibility\\", Lockport (NY) Union-Sun & Journal, September 28, 2018. On 28 May 2019, it was announced that the Diocese of Buffalo's compensation program had by that point paid $17.5 million to 106 childhood victims of clergy sexual abuse, while rejecting 135 applicants it deemed ineligible for its voluntary compensation program.Tokasz, Jay, \\"Buffalo Diocese pays $17.5M to 106 clergy sex abuse victims\\", Buffalo News, May 28, 2019/December 4, 2019. In June 2019, however, it was announced that plaintiff James Bottlinger had declined a $650,000 offer to settle his sex-abuse lawsuit against the Diocese of Buffalo and will continue to pursue his lawsuit in court.\\"Abuse victim declines settlement, pursues legal case against Buffalo diocese\\", Catholic World News/catholicculture.org, June 20, 2019.Tokasz, Jay, \\"Top Buffalo diocese official allegedly scolded boy who accused priest of abuse\\", Buffalo News, June 20, 2019.Tokasz, Jay, \\"Man who refused $650K settlement says diocese knew priest was predator\\", Buffalo News, June 18, 2019/August 9, 2019. Bottlinger has also implicated former Erie, Pennsylvania Bishop Donald Trautman of protecting his abuser Rev. Michael Freeman from potential prosecution when Trautman served as the second-highest ranking official in the Diocese of Buffalo in the 1980s. Bottlinger is using the state of New York's new Child Victims Act to sue the Diocese of Buffalo. Aside from Bottlinger, who stated that Freeman started abusing him in 1984, two other men accused Freeman of molesting them when they were boys as well. Complaints against Freeman also surfaced by 1981. However, Freeman died in 2010. In September 2019, it was reported that under the Child Victims Act, the law firms of Steve Boyd and Jeff Anderson & Associates were able to file 100 different sex abuse lawsuits against the Diocese of Buffalo.Anstey, Evan, \\"2 firms file 100 Child Victims Act lawsuits against Buffalo Diocese\\", WIVB-TV CBS-affiliated Channel 4, September 24, 2019. 83 of these lawsuits were filed when the law went into effect on August 14, 2019. Leaked documents and audio recordings also revealed that the Diocese was hiding money via its charities amid plans to file for bankruptcy due to the financial burden created by 152 sex abuse lawsuits.Specht, Charlie, \\"Is the Diocese of Buffalo hiding money ahead of bankruptcy? Secret document criticized as 'shell game'\\", WKBW-TV ABC- affiliated Channel 7, September 20, 2019. About 40 percent of donations to the Diocese of Buffalo's charities were diverted to a secret foundation known as \\"The Bishop's Fund for the Faith.\\" The foundation was also included in the Diocese of Buffalo's budget as a corporate entity so it could be used to prevent the Diocese from being vulnerable to payments stemming from lawsuits and bankruptcy. On 24 September 2019, following the start of a criminal investigation brought against Diocese priest Rev. Jeffrey Novak,Buckley, Eileen, \\"Erie County DA now investigating allegations brought by former seminarian\\", WKBW-TV ABC-affiliated Channel 7, September 23, 2019.Licastro, Troy; Marlee Tuskes, \\"Buffalo Diocese releasing new policies for how it handles sex abuse claims\\", WIVB-TV CBS-affiliated Channel 4, September 24, 2019. the Diocese published an Adult Sexual Misconduct Policy and Procedures and a new Code of Pastoral Conduct for Clergy. Undisclosed financial problems also forced the Diocese to close and transfer its credit card account effective 27 September 2019.\\"Credit check: Buffalo diocese says cancelled cards not connected to Malone controversy\\", Catholic News Agency, September 27, 2019. Though the Diocese's communications director denied that the closure of the credit card account was related to the sex abuse scandals, it was revealed that the number of people suing the Diocese had grown to 168 by 25 September. On 2 October 2019, it was revealed that the number of accused clergy in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Buffalo had grown to 178 and that the Diocese had now paid a six figure settlement to a victim of one of the newly named clergy, the now deceased Fr. Maurus Schenck, for sex abuse committed at St. Mary's Parish in Dunkirk when the unnamed victim was a 13-year old boy in 1965.Keany, Brendan, \\"Another Former Priest Credibly Accused of Abuse; 178 priests or deacons have now been accused\\", WBEN (AM), October 2, 2019. On 20 October 2019, revelations surfaced that the Diocese of Buffalo removed Rev. Norbert F. Orsolits from his parish in South Buffalo in 1968 after he was accused of sexually abusing children. The Diocese was also accused of doing so in order to cover up sex abuse allegations against him.Tokasz, Jay, \\"Orsolits abused kids after Buffalo Diocese's cover-up of assault, lawsuits say\\", Buffalo News, October 20‚Äì21, 2019. \\"Orsolits told The Buffalo News in 2018 that he had sexual contact with probably dozens of teen boys while serving as a priest.\\" One of the alleged victims filed a lawsuit against the Diocese for abuse he alleged was committed by Orsolits.Tokasz, Jay, \\"Lawsuit: Boy abused by second priest after he was molested by Orsolits\\", Buffalo News, October 20‚Äì21, 2019. The alleged victim also accused Orsolits' replacement William F. J. White of sexually abusing him as well. On 31 October 2019, Brooklyn Bishop Nicholas DiMarzio, who the Congregation of Bishops assigned on 3 October 2019 to investigate the Diocese,Tokasz, Jay, \\"Vatican directs Brooklyn bishop to investigate Buffalo Diocese\\", Buffalo News, October 3‚Äì4, 2019 completed his investigation of the Diocese of Buffalo's sex abuse scandal.Tokasz, Jay, \\"Brooklyn bishop finishes probe of Buffalo Diocese, will report to Vatican\\", Buffalo News, October 31, 2019/November 1, 2019.\\"Buffalo diocese investigation ends, DiMarzio will send report to Vatican\\", Catholic News Agency, October 31, 2019.

Pope Francis accepted Malone's resignation on December 4, 2019. He named Albany's Bishop Edward B. Scharfenberger the apostolic administrator of the Diocese, with authority to manage its affairs pending the appointment of a successor to Malone. 60 Minutes Overtime reported that Malone's resignation was linked to leaked sex abuse documents which were reported by 60 Minutes journalist Bill Whitaker in 2018. On December 10, Malone gave his first interview since his resignation, where he stated to WIVB that while he did not want to submit his resignation until he reached the mandatory retirement age of 75, he also agreed to submit an early resignation to Pope Francis so the Diocese of Buffalo could \\"move forward.\\" On May 4, 2020, Diocese of Buffalo filed an adversary motion to freeze the lawsuits, stating that it was no longer financially stable enough to pay future sex abuse settlements if the lawsuits continued. The same day, the Diocese of Buffalo also appointed Sister Mary McCarrick, who had previously served as director of the Diocese's charities and received praise in 2018 for her handling of families dealing with sex abuse, as the Diocese's first Chief Operating Officer (COO).https://news.wbfo.org/post/buffalo- catholic-diocese-appoints-coo On May 8, 2020, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo extended the statute of limitations deadline to file sex abuse lawsuits in the state of New York, which was originally set for August 14, 2020, to January 14, 2021. =Bankruptcy and termination of payment and financial aid for accused clergy= On February 28, 2020, the Diocese officially filed for bankruptcy as a result of the numerous sexual abuse lawsuits. This comes weeks after the Diocese announced that they will be ceasing operations at Christ the King Seminary in East Aurora, NY. On April 28, 2020, Scharfenberger and Diocese spokesman Greg Tucker revealed that as part of the bankruptcy agreement, the Diocese of Buffalo would cease to provide regular payment and other financial support - which includes retirement payments, health care, dental care and car insurance - to 23 Diocese priests effective May 1, 2020. All 23 priests are currently suspended due to substantial sex abuse allegations which were brought against them as well. On May 6, 2020, months after his resignation, it was revealed that Malone secretly removed accused priest Fr. Paul Salemi from the Diocese of Buffalo in 2012, but then allowed the Diocese to keep Salemi \\"on the diocesan payroll\\" after Salemi moved to the South as well. No effort was also made to have Salemi laicized either. However, payment to Salemi ended on May 1, 2020, as he was among the 23 accused clergy who were suspended by the Diocese of Buffalo.

The closures, alphabetically by city, included Most Precious Blood, Angola; Genesee-Wyoming Catholic, Attica; St. Agnes, St. Bernard, and St. Rose of Lima, Buffalo; Infant of Prague, St. Josaphat, Kolbe Catholic, Resurrection, and St. Aloysius Gonzaga, Cheektowaga; St. Barnabas, Depew; St. Hyacinth, Dunkirk; Blessed Sacrament, Kenmore; and St. Edmund, Tonawanda. The school closures caused job losses to 158 full-time and 49 part- time employees. More than 1,410 students were negatively affected by the school closures in 2007, and were required to enroll in other educational programs outside of these schools. In the five years immediately preceding the school closures, many families had already begun removing their children from Catholic schools in the diocese due to the instability of the schools, and concerns about not desiring their children to be enrolled in schools in which there was little or no future. While the average cost of teaching one student in the 14 schools in 2007 was $4,738, the average tuition cost for the student was $1,525. Therefore, the debt of those schools' parishes averaged $224,160, and totaled more than $3.3 million altogether. Secretary of the Department of Catholic Education Denise McKenzie stated that the deficit can, therefore, lead to a significant deficit in the schools and associated parishes even prior to the beginning of each school year. The Diocese of Buffalo contributed millions of dollars to support schools whose parishes used up monies to subsidize their schools. In early 2007 alone, the Diocese was operating with a $2.1 million deficit, in part, due to the subsidies provided to schools and parishes. Cheektowaga, the area hardest-hit by the school closures with five schools lost in 2007, experienced great demographic changes in recent years. The area was once heavily Catholic, though the majority of the population of older adults has been replaced by those who are younger and non-Catholic. Younger couples have moved to the area, purchasing starter homes, and have moved out of the area when they begin having children, causing a decline in enrollments in the city's Catholic schools, particularly in kindergarten classes. The dramatic change has resulted in drastically reduced enrollments, for example in the Infant of Prague School that had 1,120 students in 1960, and had only 117 enrolled students in 2007. St. Barnabas School in Depew ‚Äì one of the schools that closed in 2007 ‚Äì had only 57 students enrolled that year, making it less than minimally viable per Msgr. John Madsen.

Lanyon was one of the most important artists to emerge in post-war Britain. Despite his early death at the age of forty-six he achieved a body of work that is amongst the most original and important reappraisals of modernism in painting to be found anywhere. Combining abstract values with radical ideas about landscape and the figure, Lanyon navigated a course from Constructivism through Abstract Expressionism to a style close to Pop. He also made constructions, pottery and collage. Lanyon took up gliding as a pastime and used the resulting experience extensively in his paintings. He died in Taunton, Somerset, as the result of injuries received in a gliding accident and is buried in St. Uny's Church, Lelant. In September 2010 Peter Lanyon‚Äôs work was honoured with a large-scale retrospective exhibition: Peter Lanyon 9 October 2010 ‚Äì 23 January 2011 at Tate St Ives. Curated by Chris Stephens, Head of Displays and Curator of Modern British Art at Tate Britain, it was the first thorough museum retrospective for almost forty years. In 2015 Lanyon's Gliding Paintings were shown as a set in the Soaring Flight exhibition at the Courtauld Gallery, London. In 2018 the catalogue raisonn√© of Peter‚Äôs oil paintings and three- dimensional works was published by Modern Art Press, after a decades work by Toby Treves. Life and career Peter Lanyon was born in St Ives, Cornwall, in 1918. He was the only son of W H Lanyon, an amateur photographer and musician. He was educated at Clifton College.\\"Clifton College Register\\" Muirhead, J.A.O. p469: Bristol; J.W Arrowsmith for Old Cliftonian Society; April, 1948 St Ives remained his base and he received after-school painting lessons from Borlase Smart. In 1937 he met Adrian Stokes who is thought to have introduced him to contemporary painting and sculpture and who advised him to go to the Euston Road School where he studied for four months under Victor Pasmore. In 1936‚Äì37 he also attended Penzance School of Art. In 1939 he met established artists Ben Nicholson, Barbara Hepworth and Naum Gabo who had moved to St Ives on the outbreak of the Second World War. Lanyon received private art tuition from Nicholson. The character of his work changed completely and he became very involved with making constructions. Throughout the 1940s the influence of Nicholson and Gabo remained very evident in his work. From 1940 to 1945 he served with the Royal Air Force in the Western Desert, Palestine and Italy. In 1946 he married Sheila St John Browne (1918/19 ‚Äì 18 November 2015). Their first child, Andrew Lanyon, was born in 1947. Six children were born to the couple between 1947 and 1957; Andrew, Jane, Matthew, Martin, Anna and Jo. In 1946 he also became an active member of the Crypt Group of Artists and a founder member of the Penwith Society of Arts in 1949. He travelled around Italy, with his wife Sheila Lanyon, in the summer of 1950 and became a leading figure in the St. Ives group of artists. He had his first solo exhibition at the Lefevre Gallery, London in 1949 and taught at the Bath Academy of Art, Corsham from 1951 to 1957 (where William Scott was senior painting master). In 1950 he was invited by the Arts Council to contribute to their exhibition at the Festival of Britain. He spent four months in 1953 living in Italy on an Italian government scholarship. In 1954 he was awarded the Critics' Prize by the British section of the International Association of Art Critics. He ran an art school, St Peter's Loft, at St Ives from 1957 to 1960 with Terry Frost and William Redgrave and in 1959 he was awarded second prize at the 2nd John Moores Exhibition, Liverpool. Lanyon's first New York show was held at the Passedoit Gallery in 1953 and his first solo New York show was at the Catherine Viviano Gallery in 1957. On the 1957 trip he met Mark Rothko, Motherwell and other artists, critics and collectors. Rothko's work particularly thrilled him. Lanyon was well received in New York and the increased demand for his work in the US combined with an expansion of work to the much larger scale of mural painting and in response to a new interest in gliding led to a looser and more open kind of painting. Lanyon began training as a glider pilot in 1959, as he explained: \\"to get a more complete knowledge of the landscape\\". He used his gliding experiences as the basis for paintings that gave an aerial perspective to his native Cornish landscape right through to his death in a gliding accident in 1964. In 1961 he was elected Chairman of the Newlyn Society of Artists and was elected a Bard of the Gorseth Kernow, with the bardic name Marghak an Gwyns (Rider of the Winds) for services to Cornish art.

Location It is separated from the islands of Espiritu Santo and Malo by the Bougainville Strait. Lakatoro, capital of Malampa Province, is situated on its northeastern shore and is the largest settlement in the island. On the northeastern side of the island there is a group of islands called Small Islands, amongst them (from N to S) Vao, Atchin, Wala, Rano, Norsup, Uripiv and Uri. Off the southwestern coast is Tomman Island, in the south Akhamb Island and at the southeastern point the Maskelynes Islands are found, among them Sakao Island and Uluveo.

Cone-shaped skulls were said to be a sign of higher social status. Economy and services Malakula funeral masks ‚Äì nineteenth century Malakula's economy is largely based on agriculture with extensive copra plantations on the eastern coastal plains around Norsup and Lakatoro. In 1939, a copra cooperative was set up at Matanvat in northern Malakula. In no time, it took on some of the cargo cult traits, up until 1950, after which it returned to its original purpose, copra production. Today, the largest copra-producing plantation in Vanuatu is located at Norsup. Lakatoro has more stores, a market house, a National Bank of Vanuatu branch, an Air Vanuatu office, the main wharf and it is the administrative centre for Malampa province (Malekula, Ambrym and Paama). Norsup has the provincial hospital. Both Norsup and Lakatoro have telephones and 24-hour electricity. Tourism The interior of Malekula is mountainous, rugged and forest-covered with good walking and bird watching. There are old cannibal sites hidden in the bush on north Malekula, but at many the bones and skulls have been removed or buried. The Maskelynes and the small offshore islands along the east coast of Malekula have sand beaches and coral reefs with good snorkeling and diving.

He has been described as the \\"father of child psychology\\".Pearce, J (2005). Eric Taylor: The cheerful pessimist. Child and Adolescent Mental Health, Feb;10(1):40‚Äì41. Currently he is professor of developmental psychopathology at the Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London and consultant psychiatrist at the Maudsley Hospital, a post he has held since 1966. A Review of General Psychology survey, published in 2002, ranked Rutter as the 68th most cited psychologist of the 20th century. Early life Rutter was the oldest child born to Winifred (n√©e Barber) and Llewellyn Rutter. He was born in Lebanon where his father was a doctor, but moved back to England at an early age. In 1940, at the age of 7, amid fears of a German invasion, Rutter was evacuated, with his younger sister, to North America.Michael Rutter Education He attended the Moorestown Friends School in New Jersey, USA. Later he attended Wolverhampton Grammar School and then Bootham School in York, Who's Who. Oxford University Press] from where he continued his studies at the University of Birmingham Medical School. Career Rutter set up the Medical Research Council (UK) Child Psychiatry Research Unit in 1984 and the Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre ten years later, being Honorary Director of both until October 1998. He was Deputy Chairman of the Wellcome Trust from 1999 to 2004, and was a Trustee of the Nuffield Foundation from 1992 to 2008. Rutter's work includes: early epidemiological studies (Isle of Wight and Inner London); studies of autism involving a wide range of scientific techniques and disciplines, including DNA study and neuroimaging; links between research and practice; deprivation; influences of families and schools; genetics; reading disorders; biological and social, protective and risk factors; interactions of biological and social factors; stress; longitudinal as well as epidemiologic studies, including childhood and adult experiences and conditions; and continuities and discontinuities in normal and pathological development. The British Journal of Psychiatry credits him with a number of \\"breakthroughs\\" in these areas. Rutter is also recognized as contributing centrally to the establishment of child psychiatry as a medical and biopsychosocial specialty with a solid scientific base.Hartman, L (2003). Review of Green & Yule, Research and Innovation on the Road to Modern Child Psychiatry. Am J Psychiatry, Jan;160:196-197. He has published over 400 scientific papers and chapters and some 40 books. He was the European Editor for the Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders between 1974 and 1994. In 1972, Rutter published 'Maternal Deprivation Reassessed',Rutter, M (1981) Maternal Deprivation Reassessed, Second edition, Harmondsworth, Penguin. which New Society describes as \\"a classic in the field of child care\\" in which he evaluated the maternal deprivation hypothesis propounded by Dr John Bowlby in 1951.Bowlby, J (1951) Maternal Care and Mental Health, World Health Organisation WHO Bowlby had proposed that ‚Äúthe infant and young child should experience a warm, intimate, and continuous relationship with his mother (or permanent mother substitute) in which both find satisfaction and enjoyment‚Äù and that not to do so may have significant and irreversible mental health consequences. This theory was both influential and controversial. Rutter made a significant contribution, his 1981 monograph and other papers (Rutter 1972; Rutter 1979) comprising the definitive empirical evaluation and update of Bowlby's early work on maternal deprivation. He amassed further evidence, addressed the many different underlying social and psychological mechanisms and showed that Bowlby was only partially right and often for the wrong reasons. Rutter highlighted the other forms of deprivation found in institutional care, the complexity of separation distress and suggested that anti-social behaviour was not linked to maternal deprivation as such but to family discord. The importance of these refinements of the maternal deprivation hypothesis was to reposition it as a \\"vulnerability factor\\" rather than a causative agent, with a number of varied influences determining which path a child will take.Holmes J. (1993) John Bowlby & Attachment Theory. Routledge. pp. 49-53. After the end of Nicolae Ceau≈üescu's regime in Romania in 1989, Rutter led the English and Romanian Adoptees Study Team, following many of the orphans adopted into Western families into their teens in a series of substantial studies on the effects of early privation and deprivation across multiple domains affecting child development including attachment and the development of new relationships. The results yielded some reason for optimism. In June 2014, Rutter was the guest on the BBC Radio 4 programme The Life Scientific, in which he described himself as a Nontheist Quaker, as well as revealing that, at the age of 80, he still worked each day \\"from about half past eight until about four\\".Professor Sir Michael Rutter on The Life Scientific, BBC Radio 4 Attachment theory Among Rutter's research topics was his extended interest in maternal attachment theory as studied in his book The Qualities of Mothering from 1974. In this book, Rutter studies the emergence of several disorders in growing children including antisocial personality disorder and affectionless psychopathology. Rutter concentration is often reflected in his comments dealing with deprived learning environments and deprived emotional environment as these affect the child's growth. One of the principal distinctions which Rutter makes throughout his book titled The Qualities of Mothering is the difference between intellectual retardation in the child and the impairment of the emotional growth of the child as the non- development of healthy emotional growth. Awards and honours Rutter has honorary degrees from the Universities of Leiden, Louvain, Birmingham, Edinburgh, Chicago, Minnesota, Ghent, Jyv√§skyl√§, Warwick, East Anglia, Cambridge and Yale. He has remained in practice until late into his career and the Michael Rutter Centre for Children and Adolescents, based at Maudsley Hospital, London, is named after him. Rutter is an honorary member of the British Academy and is an elected Fellow of the Royal Society. He is a Founding Fellow of the Academia Europaea and the Academy of Medical Sciences and was knighted in 1992. The citation for his knighthood reads: Professor of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Institute of Psychiatry, University of London. In 1983 he gave the annual Swarthmore Lecture to a large gathering of British Quakers, attending their Yearly Meeting, later published as A Measure of Our Values: goals and dilemmas in the upbringing of children.A Measure of Our Values: Goals and Dilemmas in the Upbringing of Children In 2004 he was awarded the Society of Clinical Child and Adolescent Psychology Distinguished Career Award.

History  Oaklawn Park opened on February 24, 1905. The city declared a holiday to mark the occasion, and more than 3,000 people attended the first day of racing. In its early years, the track ran just six races a day, similar to British cards. In 1907, political problems in the state forced the closure of Oaklawn. Both original business partners had died, so the closed track was sold, to Louis Cella. The track reopened in 1916 under the auspices of the Business Men's League of Hot Springs. In 1918, Cella died, and the track passed to his brother, Charles. For the next few years, the track was opened and closed periodically because of vagaries in the state's political climate. In the 1929 Arkansas legislative session, a bill to allow horse racing and parimutuel betting came to a tie vote in the state House of Representatives. The only Republican member of the state House at the time, Osro Cobb of Montgomery County, had been out of the chamber when his name was called. Upon his return, Cobb cast the tie-breaking vote to allow racing and betting at the track.Osro Cobb, Osro Cobb of Arkansas: Memoirs of Historical Significance, Carol Griffee, ed. (Little Rock, Arkansas: Rose Publishing Company, 1989), p. 24 In the 1930s, the track and \\"Spa\\" combined attracted many horse racing fans. In 1935, Oaklawn increased purses to become competitive with the best tracks across the country. The first Arkansas Derby was run in 1936 for a purse of $5,000. By this time, the track ran a 30-day race meeting. On October 29, 1940, Charles G. Cella died and the presidency of Oaklawn transferred to his son, John G. Cella (1909-1968). In 1941, purses again set Oaklawn records. By 1943, the Arkansas Derby had a purse of $10,000. Oaklawn stayed open in 1944, after World War II had closed most American tracks, but it did cancel the spring season in 1945. At the end of WWII, Oaklawn held a 30-day late-autumn-and-winter season, touching off an unprecedented period of prosperity. This financed a major clubhouse renovation and a resurfacing of the track. Throughout the 1950s, the track continued to climb in handle, attendance, and purses. In 1956, J. Sweeney Grant became manager of Oaklawn. In 1961, the track extended the season to 43 days. In 1962, the track notched the fifth-highest profit of North American tracks. By 1965, the Arkansas Derby was a $50,000 stakes that could attract top Kentucky Derby prospects. In 1968, Oaklawn president John G. Cella died suddenly and his son Charles J. Cella took over. Grant died in 1971, having led Oaklawn through 16 years of remarkable growth. Finish line at the 2013 Arkansas Derby W. T. Bishop replaced him and the track continued to thrive. In 1972, the Arkansas Derby became a $100,000 stakes; the following year saw the first run of the Fantasy Stakes, a prep race to the Kentucky Oaks. The Racing Festival of the South was created in 1974. The weeklong festival has one stakes race each day, leading up to the Arkansas Derby. In 1975, Oaklawn completed a renovation that added a five-level glass enclosure to the north end of the grandstand, near the top of the stretch. The addition included a general admission area, a 400 box and 2,500 reserved seats, a kitchen, a dining room and a private club. In 1983, the all-time record handle was established. The track reached a goal of averaging $3 million in wagering every day. For the 56-day season, the handle amounted to $168,740,923, for an average of $3,013,230 a day. Attendance for the season was 1,303,223, representing a 23,272 daily average. That same year, the purse for the Arkansas Derby was increased to $250,000. In 1984, the purse was again lifted to $500,000. By 1985, three decades of prosperity began to reverse. Betting declined 8.1% and attendance declined by 3.7% compared to 1984. Increased competition from neighboring states, a lack of Sunday racing, and a lack of race days were blamed. By 1990, the track was opened for races on Sundays, the grandstand had been enlarged, and attendance began to recover. Two years later, races began timing in hundredths of seconds, rather than fifths, as with other race tracks around the world. In 2004, to celebrate its 100th anniversary, Oaklawn Park offered a $5 million bonus to any horse that could sweep its three-year-old graded stakes, the Rebel Stakes and the Arkansas Derby, and then take the Kentucky Derby. Smarty Jones collected the bonus. In 2015, eventual Triple Crown winner American Pharoah began his Eclipse award- winning season with victories at Oaklawn in the Rebel Stakes and Arkansas Derby. In 2018, Oaklawn installed James Peniston's sculpture of American Pharoah and Victor Espinoza.Just before the 2018 season opened, Oaklawn unveiled a life-sized bronze sculpture of American Pharoah and jockey Victor Espinoza at the grandstand's redesigned entrance. The work, by Philadelphia sculptor James Peniston, had been commissioned two years earlier by then- Oaklawn president Charles Cella to memorialize the horse's victories at the Hot Springs track. Later 2018, Oaklawn announced that it would start its 2019 racing season a few weeks later than usual, running from late January until early May, lasting the customary 57 days and ending on the day of the Kentucky Derby. Among the reasons given for the change were spring weather conditions and January racing cancellations over the previous decade. Physical attributes Oaklawn's dirt track is one mile in circumference, with a chute in the backstretch permitting sprint races at 6 furlongs. Oaklawn, like a few other US racetracks, employs two finish lines. Since the distance from the main finish line to the start of the first turn is very short, races at one mile start and end at the 1/16th pole. This reduces the length of the stretch from the usual 1,155 feet to 825 feet. The original clubhouse was designed by Chicago architect Zachary Taylor Davis in 1904, who would later design Chicago's Old Comiskey Park and Wrigley Field. The track buildings have undergone many renovations and updated barns provide stabling for the horses. In 2008, Oaklawn began a $3 million addition to accommodate casino-style slot machines, poker tables, and an Instant Racing complex. The casino addition made Oaklawn the largest gambling facility in the state of Arkansas.  Casino  The state of Arkansas does not allow traditional slot machines, so the casino has \\"electronic games of skill\\", defined by section 10.17 of the Final Rules of the Arkansas Racing Commission Regulations for Franchise Holders Operating Electronic Games of skill as \\"game(s) played through any electronic device or machine that affords an opportunity for the exercise of skill or judgment where the outcome is not completely controlled by chance alone.\\" Final Rules of the Arkansas Racing Commission Regulations for Franchise Holders Operating Electronic Games of skill After Arkansas voters passed a bill to allow live gambling, Oaklawn added live tables.

It is site of the medieval Hospital of St Giles at Kepier. The name derives from 'Kipe weir', meaning a weir with a fish trap and the convenience of being close to a source of fish (a major part of the monastic diet) may have influenced the location of the hospital. Kepier was also the site of a medieval corn mill which continued in use until its destruction by fire on September 24, 1870 caused by a spark from the grinding of the stone millwheels. The mill was never rebuilt; only a stone arch over the remnant of the mill race remains. Kepier may also have been the site of a Roman crossing of the River Wear carrying a postulated Roman road, Cade's Road, which led north to Pons Aelius. The Kepier estate previously extended over much of Gilesgate, Gilesgate Moor and Carrville. In the 1940s, plans for Kepier power station were drafted, but the project was never undertaken.

It was formerly the main Medicine for the Older Adult assessment and rehabilitation hospital for the north of Edinburgh. It closed in 2012, then briefly reopened to ease pressure on acute beds in the region. The facility finally closed in early 2017 and was not in use when a fire caused damage to buildings in May 2017. It was managed by NHS Lothian. History The Royal Arms above an entrance to the admin block The hospital was established by Robert William Philip on the site at Craigleith as the Victoria Hospital for Consumption in 1894. The existing Craigleith house was converted and a series of butterfly plan pavilions were erected. There were covered sheltered in the grounds and continuous open-window treatment was also administered. In 1904 it became the Royal Victoria Hospital for Consumption with King Edward VII giving patronage. The pavilions were demolished in the late 20th century. In a 1968 a new purpose-built brick building was completed by Reiach, Hall and Partners. With a 247-bed capacity, it became the main geriatric assessment and rehabilitation hospital for the north of Edinburgh. In June 2012 the Medicine for the Elderly services were transferred from the Royal Victoria Hospital to a new purpose-built facility known as the Royal Victoria Building at the Western General Hospital. Although the facility closed briefly in 2012, bed shortages elsewhere meant that the health board opted to continue providing services at this site. One ward reopened at the end of November and another a week later. By early 2013 the health board expected the facility to be in use for at least two further years. In 2014, the health board considered proposals to demolish the hospital and three others, with a view to replacing these facilities with care villages which would consist of buildings more suited to social care. The facility finally closed in early 2017 and was not in use when a fire caused damage to buildings in May 2017. Services Within the Medical Unit there was an Acute Assessment Ward, a two-ward Trauma Unit that specialised in falls and orthopaedic rehabilitation, a Parkinson‚Äôs Disease Unit, a rehabilitation ward with an interest in delirium, and a Stroke Rehabilitation Unit.

It is Sensible Software's last ever Amiga game and was available only on an Amiga Power cover disk from issue 53, dated September 1995. Because of this, it is not nearly as famous as some of Sensible Software's earlier releases, such as Sensible Soccer and Cannon Fodder. Sensible Train Spotting is the world's first ever computerized train spotting simulator. The game takes place at a railway station, with a view looking over the train platforms. Various trains pass through, each bearing a unique ID number. At the bottom of the screen is a checklist of train ID numbers, each of which must be selected by the player as the corresponding train appears. This must be done against a time limit, and attempting to record an incorrect number will result in a penalty. When all trains in the checklist have been spotted, the game moves on to the next level.  Controversy  Eight years later in 2003, a PC games company called Demon Star released another train spotting simulator, called Train Tracking. The company claimed their game was the first ever train spotting simulator, although the gameplay is nearly identical to Sensible Train Spotting. British game journalist and former Sensible Software employee Stuart Campbell reacted to this by buying a fully registered copy of Train Tracker and making it freely downloadable from his web site, daring Demon Star to take legal action.STOP THE (RIP-OFF) EXPRESS at worldofstuart.com.

Lima was a popular, affordable brand of 00 gauge and N gauge model railway material in the UK, more detailed H0 and N gauge models in France, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, and the United States as well as South Africa, Scandinavia and Australia. Lima also produced a small range of 0 gauge models. Lima partnered with various distributors and manufacturers, selling under brands such as A.H.M., Model Power, and Minitrain. Market pressures from superior Far Eastern produce in the mid-1990s led to Lima merging with Rivarossi, Arnold, and Jouef. Ultimately, these consolidations failed and operations ceased in 2004. Hornby Railways offered ‚Ç¨8 million to acquire Lima's assets (including tooling, inventory, and the various brand names) in March of the same year, the Italian bankruptcy court of Brescia, last headquarters of Lima) approving the offer later that year. In December 2004, Hornby Railways formally announced the acquisition along with the Rivarossi (H0 North American and Italian prototypes), Arnold (N scale European prototypes), Jouef (H0 scale French prototypes), and Pocher (die-cast metal automobile kits) ranges. As of mid-2006, a range of these products has been made available under the Hornby International brand, refitted with NEM couplings and sprung buffers and sockets for Digital Command Control (DCC) decoders. Formation SBB CFF FFS electric locomotive made for the European markets. A simplified HO scale model of SNCF diesel locomotive made for the European markets. Lima (Lavorazione Italiana Metalli e Affini) was founded in 1946 as a parts supplier for the Italian state railway (F.S. Italia). When the railway started producing its own parts, Lima switched its aluminium casting capability in 1948 to producing toys (boats, trains and cars). In 1953 it started manufacturing a low budget and quite primitive model range. This gradually improved in detail by the late 1950s. By 1962 it was providing French, Belgian, Dutch and German models. Less than 10 years later, Lima was one of the largest model manufacturers in the world serving the modeling markets of the United States, Australia, Britain and South Africa. In 1977 the British model range switched from HO to 00 gauge. From 1982 Lima gradually moved into the higher quality market in mainland Europe with the introduction of better mechanisms such as Central Can Motors, flywheels and all bogie power as well as catering for niche markets. United Kingdom Lima focused heavily on the British range in the late 1980s which had expanded hugely due to the Sectorisation strategy of the then state operator British Rail. This was possible because of their capability to do small production runs (c.500), in contrast to its main UK rival, Hornby Railways, who required a minimum run of 4,000. Consequently, Riko International, Lima's UK distributor, were able to provide models within weeks of rollout of the actual prototype. By the mid-1990s, Lima had a swollen UK product range of over 300 models, some of questionable quality, while still producing new variations at a rate of five or more new schemes a month. A clearance campaign ran in 1993 with a mass sale of the entire range of existing stock. While this stimulated sales, demand subsequently shifted to the now considerable second-hand market. There was also an attempt to compete with Hornby and Bachmann by introducing new paint schemes on existing 1980s steam models. The distributor, Riko International went into receivership in 1999 and their replacement, The Hobby Company, commenced by commissioning further repaints and a new model, the Class 66. In early 2000, Lima finally delivered an updated Class 67 to match the improved standards in the market. However, the much-improved motor did not compensate the many other faults and failed to make an impact. This turned out to be the last completely new model from Lima and the company subsequently folded, being bought out by Hornby. The demise of Lima in 2004 left a significant supply gap for some of the key classes of the British diesel and electric locomotives range. However, since acquiring Lima, Hornby have re-released many of these models under their own brand name. Hornby now provide updated models of the Class 08, 31, 50, 60, Class 67 and Class 92 also, re-releasing many of the much sought after Lima originals such as the Class 73 and 156. North America Lima produced a variety of H0 models for the North American market. Initially, the quality was on par with other brands of the era, but competitors' improvements in detail and running characteristics soon relegated much of Lima's product to near toy status. At least one round of improvements was made, but Lima never quite caught up with its competition. The company also entered N scale fairly early in the game, producing at first Continental and British outline stock, some of which was fancifully decorated for North American railroads and sold in the States under the A.H.M. brand. Eventually, Lima developed a small assortment of distinctive American equipment, including four diesel locomotives, heavyweight passenger cars, several freight cars, and a caboose. Generally, the N scale line suffered from the same lack of improvements that plagued the North American H0 offerings. HO scale is 1:87. Europe Lima's continental outline catalogue concentrated first on French and German and then Italian and Swiss equipment. Their relatively inexpensive offerings doubtless brought many people into the hobby. A modest assortment of accessories, including operable pieces like grade crossings and an intermodal terminal, as well as static structures and lineside details, enhanced the 'playtime' pleasure of building and operating a Lima-based train layout. Lima also was one of the first to make scale models from the Scandinavian countries. Examples covered the DSB class MZ diesel with matching coaches in a smart red livery. They made the famous Swedish SJ Rc locomotive with a wide range of coaches, including the rare dining and sleeping car. Also Norwegian locomotives and coaches were made. Several goods cars, for example \\"Tuborg\\" and \\"Carlsberg\\" beer cars, were made - some of these to be repeated in \\"0\\" scale. Most were simple but robust. Only the engines suffered from lack of traction and too high speed, a problem first solved much later when Roco started to set pace in the Model railway world in the 1980s. In the 1990s many products could compete with other significant brands and catalogues covered almost any European country both in DC/AC. However a price had to be paid for running a 300-page catalogue at the same time as demand was generally dropping overall, and Lima went bankrupt. Australia Lima entered the Australian market in 1970 with models that matched the railways of New South Wales and Victoria reasonably well. Some models were not true representations of the prototype (the Lima XPT was just a repaint of the British HST) and all had NEM wheels and couplers. However the cheapness of Lima models made them popular with beginners and many models were super detailed by experienced modellers. The Australian Model Railway Magazine (AMRM), Issue 200, October 1996, carries a 14-page article on super-detailing the Lima New South Wales State Rail Authority 422. For NSW, Lima produced the steam 38, and diesel-electric 42, 44 and 422 class locos. For Victoria, they produced the d-e S and B class. For South Australia, they produced the d-e 930 class. In the early 1980s, Lima also renumbered their HO British 4F steamer as a NSW 19 class in black. The Commonwealth Railways stainless steel carriage stock was also produced by Lima. In 2006, Hornby Railways announced that some of the Lima Australian range would be re-released under the Hornby International brand from late 2007. Limited Editions A unique feature of Lima was its capability to do production runs of less than 1,000 units versus the norm of 4,000-5,000. This was because the importer only ordered a volume that matched the orders received in advance by its retailers. In the mid-1990s, Lima used this flexibility to introduce a range of \\"limited edition\\" models in small quantities (550 - 850), so as to maintain sales. This commenced with a model of the Class 50, \\"Thunderer\\" issued at ¬£33, which proved very successful, commanding over ¬£100 within a few weeks. Lima also took on commissions from shops that purchased the entire limited production run, these being retailed directly through their stores. This began with Cheltenham Model Centre's D1015 Western Champion. Over 100 different models were produced this way. This commercial practice provided Irish modellers, via Murphy Models of Dublin, with the first ever specific Irish scene RTR diesel locomotive, the General Motors 201 Class. Fewer than 3,000 were produced (in nine variants) and as of 2009 can still fetch over ‚Ç¨300 at on-line auctions. In 2008 Murphy Models brought out the second specific RTR Irish Diesel, a highly detailed Bachmann version of the CIE 141 Class.

Life Elisaveta Bagryana. Source: Bulgarian Archives State Agency Elisaveta Lyubomirova Belcheva was born on April 16, 1893 in Sofia, Bulgaria in clerk's family. She finished her primary and secondary education in the capital city. She lived a year (1907-08) with her family in the town of Tarnovo, where she wrote her first poems. Between 1910 and 1911 she taught in the village of Aftani, where she experienced rural life, after which she studied Slavic philology at Sofia University. Her first poems -- Why (\\"–ó–∞—â–æ\\") and Night Song (\\"–í–µ—á–µ—Ä–Ω–∞ –ø–µ—Å–µ–Ω\\") -- were published in 1915 in the magazine Contemporary Thought (–°—ä–≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–Ω–∞ –º–∏—Å—ä–ª).
