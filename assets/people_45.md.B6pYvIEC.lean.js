Origins  A town began to develop near pastoralist Octavius Philpott's Cobram Station around 1868. The Great Central Railway League, formed to advocate for construction of a line from the main north-eastern corridor to Shepparton, included Cobram in its estimates of potential patronage. When the Shepparton line was extended further north towards Numurkah and the Murray River, however, and a line to Yarrawonga was constructed from Benalla on the north-eastern line, landholders in Cobram became concerned they would be \\"beyond a reasonable radius of any station.\\" When extension of the line from Numurkah to Tocumwal to meet the New South Wales Government Railways system was recommended in 1879, Cobram residents began lobbying local politicians for a diversion of the route to serve the east of the town. Ultimately when the infamous Octopus Act of the Victorian Parliament passed in 1884, authorising a vast program of government railway construction across the colony, it included a railway from Numurkah to Cobram and none to Tocumwal. Building contractors for the Victorian Railways, Messrs. Shaw, Monie and Mixner, began work on the line in April 1887 with around 50 labourers. Construction was delayed by severe weather that winter, and although the Railway Commissioners' promise that the line would be complete by the summer harvest could not be fulfilled, local residents were told to expect the use of some of the line. The contractors were hauling small amounts of wheat to meet the main railway in May the following year when an inexperienced driver derailed his train returning to Numurkah. The line officially opened on 1 October 1888 simultaneously with eight other railway lines around the state. The decision to construct a line to Cobram in lieu of Tocumwal was heavily criticised, and an article in The Age accused Premier of Victoria and Minister for Railways Duncan Gillies of \\"meddling\\" in the design. The article observed that the landholdings of a \\"prominent member of the Legislative Council\\" had appreciated significantly in value as a result of the decision, and asked \\"what occult influence induced the Minister to drag the line out of its natural course to Cobram?\\" When Victorian Railways Commissioner Richard Speight sued The Age for libel in the following years, on the basis on a series of such articles alleging widespread corruption in the operation of the Octopus Act, lawyers for the newspaper pointed out that the three daily trains on the Cobram branch brought an average revenue of fewer than 15 shillings each. When, in 1904, a decison was taken to meet the New South Wales Government Railways system at Tocumwal with construction of a new line, Cobram residents vehemently protested the construction of a junction at Strathmerton, which would leave the Cobram line a branch instead of on the main route from the river to Melbourne. The project went ahead as proposed and the Victorian line to Tocumwal was completed in 1905.  Operation  Before the opening of the Tocumwal line, the single-track Cobram line was served by a single daily return mixed train from Melbourne, via Seymour and Shepparton, with a scheduled journey time of just under 8 hours. By 1918, the main train continued on to Tocumwal and a connecting service operated on the Cobram branch. In 1928, a railmotor service connecting with an additional train to Numurkah on a Wednesday night, returning on a Thursday morning, had been added. After the Second World War, the VR introduced its new Walker railmotor, and expanded passenger services on the Cobram line along with other branches across the state. By 1969 this meant two railmotor services ran in each direction between Cobram and Numurkah every day except Sunday to connect with trains to and from Melbourne. Three goods services were scheduled on the line each week.  Demise  Passenger numbers in the region had declined substantially by 1975, and the service between Strathmerton and Tocumwal was replaced by a bus in November, connecting with trains that now ran through to Cobram. At times, the number of passengers was so low that the Cobram station master drove ongoing travellers to Tocumwal in a station wagon. The rail service was cut back to Numurkah in 1981 but restored in the 1983 New Deal for Country Passengers. By then, apart from around of annual grain traffic on the line, by far the smallest amount carried on any branch between Shepparton and Tocumwal, freight had almost entirely disappeared from the Cobram line. Nevertheless, when the Tocumwal line was considered as a candidate for gauge standardisation as a secondary link to New South Wales, the VR intended to retain the connection to the Cobram branch. The project did not eventuate. In 1993, the government of Premier Jeff Kennett announced it intended to end passenger train services on most of the Victorian country network, including the line from Seymour to Cobram. After negotiating substantial reductions in operating costs with railway unions, the government agreed to retain the Cobram service, among others. Ultimately, however, when the operation of the line was put to private tender, the winning bid by Hoys Roadlines replaced the service north of Shepparton with a bus. The last passenger train to Cobram ran on 21 August 1993.

Hu explores neural mechanisms underlying social behaviors and psychiatric diseases. She specifically explores the neural substrates of social rank and the role of neuron-glia interactions in driving depressive behaviors. Hu discovered the anatomical and molecular targets of ketamine's fast-acting antidepressant effects to be localized to the lateral habenular circuits in rodents. Hu was also the first scientist outside of Europe and America to be awarded the IBRO-Kemali Prize in over 20 years.  Early life and education  Hu pursued her undergraduate degree at Peking University in Beijing, China. In 1996, she received her Bachelors of Science in biochemistry and molecular biology. Hu then moved to the United States to work as a research technician for one year at the University of California, San Francisco. She then pursued her graduate studies at the University of California, Berkeley. Under the mentorship of Corey S. Goodman, Hu explored the role of the plexin receptor and the Rho family GTPases in central nervous system development in Drosophila. Plexins are receptors involved in axon guidance, and Hu discovered a seven amino acid sequence in plexin, PlexB, which is necessary for Rac-GTP binding and subsequently axon guidance. Interestingly, PlexB inhibits Rac from binding downstream interactors while at the same time enhancing RhoA activity, altogether driving axon guidance. In further work, Hu found that CrossGAP, a GTPase-activating protein, is responsible for regulating Rac dependent-cytoskeletal changes during axon guidance in Drosophila. Hu completed her PhD in 2002. Following her PhD, Hu pursued her postdoctoral work under the mentorship of Julius Zhu and Roberto Malinow at the University of Virginia. In 2004, Hu moved to the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and then to the University of California, San Diego in 2006, to continue working under the mentorship of Malinow. During her postdoc, Hu explored the role of AMPA receptor trafficking in emotional enhancement of memory formation as well as the role of Ras GTPase signalling in fragile X syndrome.  Career and research  In 2008, Hu joined the Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute of Neuroscience in Shanghai, China and became the principal investigator of the Hu Lab. Her lab has been focusing on the neural mechanisms of social dominance in mice as well as the neural mechanisms of depression and the antidepressant effects of ketamine. Her lab has pioneered techniques with which to probe the neural correlates of social rank. In 2015, Hu was recruited to become a professor and senior investigator at the QuiShi Academy for Advanced Studies within the Medical School of Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, China. Hu also became the executive director at the Center for Neuroscience at Zhejiang University School of Medicine. = Neural circuit mechanisms of social dominance = Hu and her lab pioneered the study of neural circuit mechanisms governing social rank. In 2011, they showed that neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex of mice encode rank-specific information. Mice with higher social rank had increased strength of excitatory inputs in the layer IV pyramidal neurons of the mPFC compared to more subordinate mice. Further, manipulating the synaptic strength in the mPFC led to upward or downward movement in the social hierarchy, suggesting that these neurons are fundamental in the neural processes governing social rank. Hu and her team subsequently explored the effects of winning a social competition on social neural circuits across dominance rank. They found that activating the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) induces winning in social competitions. Specifically, the medial dorsal thalamic (MDT) inputs to the dmPFC, when stimulated, led to increased dominance behavior through increased initiations of competitions and more effortful behaviors. They propose that mPFC neural computations are fundamental in guiding dominance based behaviors, such as competition. An important contribution that Hu and her team made to the field was the establishment of reliable tests to assess dominance rank in a hierarchy. They use a behavioral assay called the \\"tube test\\" to obtain information about a mouse's rank. This test involves two mice from a cage meeting head to head in a small tube. Since both mice cannot fit to pass each other in the tube, one mouse is pushed by the other. The winner of this social encounter is the mouse that pushes the other mouse out. The tube test is performed in a round-robin type fashion such that the mouse that wins the mouse encounters across several days and continues to win in a stable way is deemed the dominant mouse. The correlation between tube test wins and dominance allows a researcher to then probe the neural correlates of dominance or other biological phenomena in relation to dominance. = Neural and glial mechanisms of depression = Hu and her team study the neural circuit mechanisms driving depression in rodent models. They found in 2013 that the lateral habenula (LHb) circuits play a role in depression through neuronal adaptations associated with the enzyme BCamKII upregulation. Increases in BCamKII lead to increased excitatory synaptic transmission and action potential firing through increased expression of a specific subtype of glutamate receptors. Overall habenular hyperactivity was associated with depressive phenotypes. In a following study, Hu and her team further explored the mechanisms of habenular hyperactivity. Using a proteomic analysis, they found evidence of upregulation of an astrocytic potassium channel, Kir4.1, in rat models of depression and the expression profiles of this channel seem to be localized to the synaptic junctions between astrocytes and neuronal somas. Hu found that these channels tightly regulate neuronal bursting and excitability of neurons in the LHb. By manipulating the expression levels of Kir4.1, Hu and her team showed that astrocytic Kir4.1 bidirectionally regulates the hyperexcitability of neurons as well as depressive behavioral symptoms highlighting the role of glia-neuron interactions in psychiatric illnesses such as depression. Hu and her colleagues then explored the potential of using ketamine to target the burst firing/hyperactivity in lateral habenula neurons that was leading to depressive phenotypes. Ketamine has been previously shown to be effective as a rapid antidepressant, yet the mechanisms of action have not yet been completely elucidated. They showed that blocking the NMDAR-dependent burst firing in the LHb, through ketamine administration, is able to alleviate symptoms of depression in rodent models. The blocking of LHb hyperactivity appears to disinhibit downstream monoaminergic reward centers thereby exerting antidepressant effects on habenular circuitry.

As a native of Marseille in Southern France, his paintings typically depicted scenes in and around Marseille.  Biography  Astruc studied at the School of Fine Arts in Marseille. When he was ten years old, he worked with his father in the family tannery and leather goods workshop. In addition to his creative work, Astruc also had hobbies such as sailing, skiing, and motorcycling. In 1913, he had a serious accident on a Hanriot airplane at the aerodrome of Reims. In June 1914, he traversed the Rhône by hydrofoil, on behalf of Henri Fabre, to Aix-les-Bains, a town known for its Roman-era thermal springs. He was a test pilot in Toulon and then in Saint-Raphaël, Var during World War I. After the war, he returned to painting. He commented: ″This time of my life, spent in aviation, the continuous contact with great spaces of the sky and the sea, rejuvenated and purified my vision. I returned to clarity, to light and to the atmosphere of my first years of painting\\". Astruc participated in numerous annual exhibitions in Marseille, Paris, Algiers, Lyon, Grenoble, Geneva, and Aix-en-Provence, from 1930 to 1939. In 1936, he was elected to the Academy of Marseille's Arts class. In 1956, Astruc presented his works at the Galerie Mourlot under the exhibit title \\"50 years of painting by the Marseilles painter Edmond Astruc\\". The exhibit was a visual journey through the evolution of his art. In World War II, he volunteered his services in aviation as a technical agent for SNCASE in Marignane. He was assigned to Evreux, where he worked in aircraft construction until the German invasion of Northern France. He then continued his trade in Angoulême. During the invasion of the free zone, he hid some of his equipment so it would not fall into the hands of the enemy, and rejoined his family in Marseille. The occupiers destroyed his house in the Saint-Lazare district in 1943 to install a defense battery for the Old Port, forcing his family to find refuge until the end of the war. After the war, he bought an old country house at Roucas-Blanc in Marseille, where he set up his workshop and continued to exhibit. In 1959, he built a catamaran on the model of two floatplane floats, and left Marseille along the coast. Astruc's last work, La Favière, remains unfinished as he died on January 11, 1977.

The background Anticipating the deluge that would destroy the world, Brahma sought the help of Shiva who created a pot containing nectar and the seeds of creation. Brahma decorated the pot with coconut, darbha, mango leaves, sacred thread, vastram and vilvam and performed puja placing the pot atop the Meru Hill. When the deluge struck, the pot came to rest in Kumbakonam. Shiva as a hunter, appeared and opened the pot. from where nectar dispersed in different directions and emerged as sacred tirtham in Potramarai tank (Sarangapani temple) and Mahamaham tank.

It was released on Atkins own label Metroplex. The song was the first track released after the split of Atkins' previous group Cybotron. The music followed similar themes of the previous group with science fiction and alienation but featured less of a song structure than Cybotron's music leading the track to be often identified as one of the earliest techno songs. On its release, the track was sold in Chicago where it grew to the popularity that was larger than that in Detroit. When music labels from England investigated the dance music in Chicago, they eventually mapped it back to Detroit leading to Atkins and his related musicians to agreeing to release a compilation baring the song \\"Techno Music\\" by Atkins on Techno! The New Dance Sound of Detroit. The song was re-released in 2017 with remixes from contemporary artists such as Moodymann. ProductionBackground= DEMF in 2007.alt=A man with electronic musical instruments performing at an annual electronic dance music event. Prior to recording \\"No UFO's\\", Juan Atkins grew up in a musical family with his father being a music promoter. Atkins first began playing music with friends on his street initially playing bass and guitar until he became 14 or 15 years old, and his family moved to Belleville, Michigan near Atkins' grandmother. When moving to Belleville, Atkins started playing the keyboard and convinced his grandmother to buy him a synthesizer. Atkins became entranced with the sound of the machine and making electronic music demos by the time he was starting his college education. Atkins was influenced by radio host The Electrifying Mojo, that aired between 1977 to 1985 and played a wide variety of music ranging from funk artists like Parliament, Prince and James Brown as well as Kraftwerk, Peter Frampton and New wave music. In College, Atkins met Rik Davis who was ten years older than Atkins. Atkins later described Davis as being \\"like a father figure to me. He taught me a lot. We didn’t have so much in common. I was in awe of him. My father was in jail at the time.\\" The two formed a group Cybotron in 1981. Their singles released were \\"Alley of Your Mind\\" in 1981 which was played by The Electrifying Mojo regularly, and followed it up with \\"Cosmic Cars\\" in 1982. The group then signed to the California based Fantasy Records and released the album Enter and the single \\"Clear\\" which became a hit on Billboard's Black Singles chart spending nine weeks there. The group broke up shortly after with Davis wanting to pursue a more rock-based approach to music, leading Atkins to develop his own solo project as Model 500. =Development= As Model 500, Atkins created his own music label called Metroplex to release what he described as \\"more funk and bass-heavy electro tracks.\\" The tracks for the first Model 500 release were done in the basement of Atkins mother's home on the East side of Detroit. As Atkins was taking an audio engineering course at The Recording Institute of Detroit, he would return home to apply the skills he learned on his own recordings. They were recorded with an eight-track tape recorder and a 16 channel mixing board and using a Roland TR-909 for the drum track sequence. Atkins recollected that it took about two days to finish the track \\"Future\\". Atkins felt strongly in his style of music and said that \\"setting up Metroplex was the only way to get it out there.\\" Atkins had previously attempted to send \\"No UFO's\\" to other music labels who turned it down. Style Mark Jonathan Butler, in his book on the history of electronic dance music, stated that \\"No UFO's\\" was \\"frequently described as the first techno record.\\" stating that unlike similar earlier tracks like Cybotron's \\"Alleys of Your Mind\\" and \\"Sharevari\\", the song had \\"no obvious relationship to rock or pop music. The instrumentation is entirely electronic with Butler describing it having stark drum machine rhythms as its prominent feature. The song has no verse/chorus structure, with lyrics that chanted rather than sung that are first heard nearly two minutes within the song. Atkins spoke about the lyrics in the song as \\"The government always tries to cover up the fact that there could be other life in the galaxy. To me, the system is bent on keeping people in despair, hopeless, not wanting to achieve anything, so if you keep your head up high maybe you'll start realizing things that you never thought possible and seeing a UFO is probably the ultimate possibly.\\" Like in Cybotron, Atkins and Davis were both interested in technology and the future and spent significant time discussing them philosophically and read works such as Alvin Toffler's 1980 book The Third Wave. These themes were also reflected in Cybotron's previous singles such as \\"Cosmic Cars\\" and \\"Industrial Lies\\". Release \\"No UFO's\\" was released in April 1985 on Metroplex. “‘No UFO’s’ was popular in Detroit, with Atkins noting that it was released to the radio when Jeff Mills was hosting, and “as soon as [Mills] got his hands on it, he put it in heavy rotation in his mixes, and it became an instant smash hit in his radio show. Also, this was the time of house music in Chicago, so DJs like Farley \\"Jackmaster\\" Funk, Bad Boy Bill, Ralphi Rosario, Julian Jumpin Perez, and Fast Eddie, among others, [played it]; therefore the record also became a smash hit in Chicago.” Carl Craig reflected on hearing \\"No UFO's\\" for the first time at 5pm on the radio on a weekday, noting that \\"It was drive time, so it really gave me the opportunity to hear this music as being more than just club music.\\" According to Atkins, the song was more popular in Chicago than Detroit. The song reached Chicago by when Atkins' associates Derrick May and Blake Baxter drove Baxter's pickup truck full of records to sell in Chicago, and then these records were exported to the United Kingdom. This led to record companies in England travelling to the United States to research the music, initially starting in Chicago where they were told the music was coming from Detroit. Arriving in Detroit, Neil Rushton suggested to do a compilation album for Virgin Records and call it The House Sound of Detroit which was later renamed to Techno! The New Dance Sound of Detroit based on the Model 500 song that was included on the compilation called \\"Techno Music\\" . The song was re-releaed by Metroplex in 2017 with remixes from Moodymann and Luciano. Atkins stated that idea behind these remixes was \\"why reinvent the wheel when we can get the source material that created the wheel in first place and reworked?” and that he \\"wanted to incorporate collaborations with some major players nowadays, like Moodymann and Luciano. That will make it possible to reach a newer, wider, and more diverse audience.” Track listing 12\\" single (M-001) # \\"No UFO's (Vocal)\\" – 4:17 # \\"No UFO's (Instrumental)\\" – 6:55 # \\"Future (Vocal)\\" – 4:45 # \\"Future (Instrumental)\\" – 5:01 Credits Credits are adapted from the vinyl release sticker of \\"No UFO's\\". * Marcellus 'Pete' Atkins – executive producer * Juan Atkins – engineer, composer, producer ReferencesSources=  * * Category:1985 debut singles Category:Model 500 songs Category:Songs written by Juan Atkins Category:Song recordings produced by Juan Atkins Category:Metroplex singles ","title":"No UFO's"},{"id":"64001360","text":"Makke Lambers-Groen also written as Martha Groen (1 March 1917 - 31 March 1977) was a Dutch female kortebaanschaatsen speed skater. Groen was born in Oldeboorn. She rode her first competition in the 1932-33 winter season. In December 1932 she won her first price, the third place in Oldeboorn. On 22 January 1933 she won her first race, in Bovenknijpe, and won a silver watch. The next day she won in Oosterlittens a gold watch. The day afterwards she won again a golden watch, now in Grouw where 40 skaters participated, and also a silver medal for the fastest race. She rode the lane in 14 seconds. The next winter season (1933–34) she also won several more prices and competitions, including the first price in Oldeboorn, Akkrum and Wolvega. In Wolvega she also won a silver medal for the fastest race (16.1 sec.). At a competition in Grouw with participants of among others Trijntje Hemminga and Janna van der Meulen, she was beaten by her with 2–1. At a competition in Ried one of the two lanes was very bad due to the many public watching the races. After winning one race, she started twice in the wrong race and fell twice due to cracks in the ice. She rode her last race on 17 December 1933 in Assen. She was not fit that day and was beaten with just a small difference by J. Helder. She still competed in 1940, at the Frisian championships and according to the newspaper, \\"she wasn't the last year one of the fastest skaters anymore\\". However, she skated still strong against Trijntje Hemminga, but lost, and also the race against Sietske Pasveer. She also competed in Leeuwarden.

It spans a chain of coralline islands in the Indian Ocean, including Lakshadweep (Laccadive Islands), a union territory of India; the Maldives, an independent country; and the British Indian Ocean Territory, an overseas territory of the United Kingdom. Wikramanayake, Eric; Eric Dinerstein; Colby J. Loucks; et al. (2002). Terrestrial Ecoregions of the Indo-Pacific: a Conservation Assessment. Washington, DC: Island Press. Geography The ecoregion is made up of low islands made mostly of coral sand, generally no more that 5 meters above sea level, and surrounded by extensive coral reefs. The islands rest on the Chagos–Laccadive Ridge, an oceanic ridge and plateau, and extend 2,550 km north and south across the equator, from latitude 14º N to 8º S. Lakshadweep lies to the north, 300 km west of India's southwest coast. Lakshadweep consists of 36 small islands between 8º - 14º N, with a total land area of 32 km². The Maldives are the largest island group, with approximately 1190 islands between 7º N and the equator. The Chagos Archipelago lies between 5° and 8° S, and constitute the British Indian Ocean Territory. Diego Garcia, a huge atoll, is the largest of the Chagos islands. The coral sand that makes up the islands comes from the skeletons of reef corals which have been broken up into fine particles by wave action. Wind, waves, and currents form islands from the sand. The coral reefs provide the raw material for the islands, and the reefs provide protection from erosive waves and currents that allows the islands to form and persist. Coral sand is highly porous, and water and organic nutrients quickly leach through it. The islands' small size, low relief, and porous soil mean that, despite high rainfall, they have no running streams; rainfall percolates 1-3 meters below the ground to shallow freshwater aquifers lying above salt water. Climate The climate of the island is tropical and equatorial, with warm temperatures that stay relatively constant throughout the year. Rainfall occurs mostly with the April-to-October southwest monsoon, and there is a dry season from December to March associated with the northeast monsoon off the Asian continent. Rainfall varies from 1600 mm annually in dry parts of Lakshadweep to 3,800 mm per year in the southern Maldives. Flora The vegetation on the islands is dependent on the underlying soils. Pioneer plants colonize areas of fresh sand, and stabilize them. Areas with infertile soil are generally covered with sedges and shrubs that can tolerate drought and salt spray. Sedges of genus Cyperus and the shrub Scaevola taccada are the most common. In the Laccadive Islands the low tree Argusia is sometimes found with the sedges and shrubs. Where plant cover persists over time, organic material can accumulate in the soil and sustain larger and more diverse plants. Tropical rain forests grow where soils and fresh water are favorable. Most of the original forests have been cleared for coconut plantations and other crops, but small areas of native vegetation remain, some disturbed and others relatively intact. The Chagos Islands were the last settled and are the least disturbed. Plant communities on the islands include: * littoral shrubland is found along the seaward shores of the islands. Scaevola taccada is the dominant shrub species, growing from 2 to 5 meters high. The shrubs Tournefortia argentea and Suriana maritima are found close to the shore, along with the vine Ipomoea macrantha. * Hernandia forest is dominated by the Chinese-lantern tree Hernandia nymphaeifolia, sometimes with coconut palm (Coco nucifera) and Terminalia catappa, and the smaller trees Morinda citrifolia, Guettarda speciosa, and Neisosperma oppositifolium. The fern Asplenium nidus grows on the forest floor and as an epiphyte in the trees. * Calophyllum forest is dominated by the tree Calophyllum inophyllum, typically in pure stands, forming a dense canopy with little understory growth. The trees can grow to very large size, with trunks up to two metres in diameter. * Barringtonia forest is dominated by Barringtonia asiatica, which can grow to a similar size as the Calophyllum trees. * Cordia forest is dominated by the tree Cordia subcordata, either in pure stands or mixed with Hernandia nymphaeifolia, Morinda citrifolia, and Neisosperma oppositifolium. * Pisonia forest occurs rarely, and is characterized by the tree Pisonia grandis, which can attain large size. The tree is associated with seabird colonies, since its sticky seeds are spread by birds and it can tolerate guano-derived soils. * Guettarda forest is dominated by the low tree Guettarda speciosa, with smaller numbers of Neisosperma oppositifolium. It may be a transitional zone or stage between littoral shrubland and other forest types. * Casuarina woodland are woodlands dominated by Casuarina equisetifolia. Its needle-like leaves typically form a thick layer of litter that limits the growth of understory plants, but sometimes it has an understory of shrubs including Premna serratifolia and Scaevola taccada. * Coconut woodland includes both abandoned plantations and natural woodlands, either in pure stands or mixed with Hernandia, Guettarda, and Neisosperma. Understory plants include Asplenium nidus, native herbs Boerhavia albiflora, Fimbristylis cymosa, and Stenotaphrum micranthum. Freshwater marshes are found where the water table is high, and saltwater wetlands and mangrove forests grow in sheltered shoreline areas. A 2,500 km2 mangrove forest remains on Minicoy island, and Bruguiera parviflora is the predominant mangrove species. The islands have few endemic plants, and the native plants are mostly typical of Indo-Pacific coral islands. The ancient origins of the islands' plant species include Sri Lanka (44%), Africa (28%), and Malesia (25%). The present flora of the islands includes both native species and species that were intentionally or unintentionally introduced by humans.Whistler, W. Arthur (1997).\\"Botanical Survey of Diego Garcia Chagos Archipelago, British Indian Ocean Territory\\". in Diego Garcia Natural Resource Management Plan, Prepared by Belt Collins Hawaii for the United States Navy, April 1997. Fauna The islands have few terrestrial animals. The islands are home to subspecies of Indian flying fox (Pteropus giganteus ariel) and small flying fox (Pteropus hypomelanus maris). Both subspecies are endemic to the ecoregion. The Maldivian pond heron (Ardeola grayii phillipsi), a subspecies of the Indian pond heron, is endemic to the islands. Thirteen or fourteen seabird species nest in the Maldives, often on small islets. The Chagos and Lakshadweep also have large rookeries. These include the white tern (Gygis alba monte), lesser frigatebird (Fregata ariel iredalei), black-naped tern (Sterna sumatrana), bridled tern (Onychoprion anaethetus), and greater crested tern (Thalasseus bergii). The red-footed booby (Sula sula) has a large population in the Chagos islands. The islands' native reptiles include two geckos, Hemidactylus frenatus and H. parvimaculatus,Agarwal, Ishan & Jablonski, Daniel & Bauer, A.. (2019).

Two native amphibians have been found on the islands, the Indian burrowing frog (Sphaerotheca breviceps) and Asian common toad (Duttaphrynus melanostictus). History Lakshadweep and the Maldives have been settled for thousands of years. The people of the Laccadives speak a dialect of Malayalam, the predominant language in the adjacent Indian state of Kerala. The people of the Maldives and Minicoy in Lakshadweep speak Maldivian, also known as Dhiveli, an Indo-Aryan language most closely related to Sinhala spoken in nearby Sri Lanka. There is no record of permanent settlement on the Chagos Archipelago until 1793, when the French established a settlement and coconut plantations on Diego Garcia. The French brought enslaved people to the islands to work in the plantations. Their descendants, the Chagossians, speak a version of Bourbonnais Creole, a French-based creole language also spoken on Réunion and Mauritius in the southwestern Indian Ocean. The British consolidated control over the islands at the end of the 18th century. Lakshadweep was administered as part of British India, the Chagos Islands were administered from Mauritius, and the Maldives had local rulers under a British protectorate. Settlers brought food crops to the islands, and domestic animals including cats, chickens, goats, rabbits, house mice, black rats (Rattus rattus), Asian house shrews (Suncus murinus) and donkeys. Coconut plantations were expanded during the 19th century and became the islands' major export crop. Important island crops currently include bananas, coconuts, sweet potatoes, mangoes (Mangifera indica), chico (Pouteria sapota), yams, taro, millet, watermelons, citrus, and pineapples. India, including Lakshadweep, became independent in 1947. The Maldives became independent in 1965. The UK split administration of the Chagos Archipelago from that of Mauritius in 1965, three years prior to Mauritian independence. In the late 1960s, the UK government leased Diego Garcia to the United States, which turned it into a naval base. The Chagossians were expelled from the islands and resettled in Mauritius, the Seychelles, and the UK. Mauritius still contests the UK's sovereignty over the islands, and the Chagossians continue to contest the legality of their expulsion and are seeking to return home.  Protected areas  A 2017 assessment found that 73 km², or 26%, of the ecoregion is in protected areas.

He trained as a gunner after his acceptance into the École Polytechnique in 1898. Georges Bellenger was very passionate about aviation since his childhood in France at the beginning of the 20th century.  Biography  Georges Bellenger was born in Évreux to Émile Bellenger, a lawyer, and his wife, Marie Eugénie Aglaé Gibert. In 1902, he graduated as a Second Lieutenant from the Fontainebleau . He went on assignment to the artillery regiment garrison at Saint-Mihiel. In 1904–1905, one of the articles by Captain Ferdinand Ferber, which appeared in the Revue d'Artillerie, caught his attention and he began to experiment with kites.Take note, on this subject, of the article on Jacques Théodore Saconney As an artillery man, Bellenger had an internship at the Versailles Balloonist Battalion between 1st April 1906 and June 30, 1906. His first ascent took place on April 21, 1906, in a 980 m3 cotton balloon inflated with lighting gas. He obtained the pilot's license for free balloons no. 95 of the Aero Club on October 3rd, 1907, after making his tenth ascent. As a free balloon pilot at the start of aerostation, he participated in numerous competitions brilliantly. In particular, he obtained second place in the Aero-Club International Aerial Photography Competition in 1907. He broke the distance record for small cubes on December 8, 1908, by taking a journey that took him from the Aéro-Club park in Saint- Cloud to the Baltic Sea aboard a 600 m3 balloon. He obtained the patent of military balloonist no. 43 on January 30, 1909. During his stay at the Vincennes military aviation establishment (January 15, 1910, to September 30, 1912), he was under the orders of Lieutenant-Colonel Estienne, who gave him the badge of the knight of the Legion of Honor. Member of the Aero Club of France born in contact with the aviation pioneers such as Ferber, Hubert Latham, and Louis Bleriot. He won the civil pilot's license no. 45 April 25, 1910, and was noted for the Great Maneuvers of 1910 by the quality of his observations: present, General Gallieni immediately promoted him, captain. In 1910, he took second place in the Grand Prix des Ballons of the Aéro-Club de France: departing from Saint-Cloud, he landed in Austrian Tyrol. In 1911, as the winner of the Paris-Pau raid, he was accepted in his hometown as a worthy successor to the exploits of BlériotSources booklet 20 personalities who made Évreux published on the occasion of the 2010 Heritage Days by the Municipal Archives of Évreux., the designer of his airplane. In 1912, Captain Bellenger received an appointment to install and direct an aviation school at the Avord camp, near Bourges. It formed the squadron no. 3, which, during the war, became the famous Storks Escadrille. In 1913, after reception at the war school, he left for three months to the Balkans \\"to compare facts and doctrines.\\" The report he drew first provoked hilarity, but the information came to confirm his observations and earned him a letter of satisfaction for his real qualities of view. However, there followed mixed evaluations from his teachers at the war school: \\"Bellenger: intelligent and sympathetic, - unfortunately had too many personal ideas to be specific to the collective work of a General Staff.\\" A promoter of aerial photography, his information contributed to the victory of the Marne in 1914. On September 1, 1914, he took command of the Aviation of the sixth Army whose intervention at the battle of Ourcq was most effective and where he had the opportunity to organize artillery observation by plane, then the aerial photo of the front, before being made available to the aeronautical directorate of the Ministry of War. Not wanting to stay away from the action, he went, at his request, into the artillery from May 1915 to August 1918, during which time he was seriously injured. He ended the war with six quotes. In 1939, mobilized at his request (he was 61 years old), he took charge of a regiment of anti-tank batteries for the RGA (General Artillery Reserve). He took the opportunity to inspect the front between Longwy and Valenciennes. His observations allowed him to propose a strategy to stop the German advance to the general staff on May 22. In conflict with a conservative team, he returned to forced leave. His strategy would not be implemented until ten days later, but too late and too timidly. A refugee with his family in Annecy, he corresponded with Lieutenant Théodore Morel (Tom), then chief of the maquis des Glières. He participated in the training of the maquis but expressed his fears to Tom about the concept of fortress plateau as practised in the Vercors, preferring a maquis war.\\"Rôle dans la résistance\\", récit tiré d'une lettre à Chamine, 1958 This preparation made it possible to limit the losses significantly during the German attack on the Glières.

Kircher was the first person to view infected blood through a microscope, and his observations are described in the book. The work was printed on the presses of Vitale Mascardi and dedicated to Pope Alexander VII. Background The plague outbreak in Rome in 1656 killed around 15,000 people in four months. During this period Kircher undertook experiments to try and understand the disease better although there is no evidence that he was directly involved in the medical treatment of the sick. Kircher's previous work, Itinerarium exstaticum had caused trouble with the Jesuit censors and stirred up controversy. Writing about the plague gave him an opportunity to compliment the new pope, Alexander VII, and move attention away from a work that had caused him difficulties. The Jesuit Order had a long-established practice of not writing about medical topics. For this reason, the Jesuit censors who reviewed the book - François Duneau, François le Roy and Celidonio Arvizio - originally refused to authorise it for publication. Eventually, after the opinions of a number of medical authorities had been sought, Superior General Goschwin Nickel permitted its printing. The published work included testimonials from the distinguished medical scholars Ioannes Benedictus Sinibaldus, Paulus Zachias and Hieronymous Bardi. Kircher's theories The bubonic plague by Athanasius Kircher Kircher summarised three possible explanations for the plague. The first was the hermetic approaches of Paracelsus and Cornelius Agrippa, the second was the moral explanation for disease, and the third was medical. Kircher agreed that God did send tribulations to afflict mankind, but was most interested in medical research. In Scrutinium Physico-Medicum Kircher discussed spontaneous generation as the source of the 'worms' which caused the plague, describing experiments he did with rotting meat and with a mixture of soil and water, which produced microscopic creatures. His conclusion was that \\"plague in general is a living thing\\" and that it was transmitted by contact from one person to another. Kircher theorised that when the ground was opened by caves and fissures, myriads of tiny creatures escaped that carried putrefaction and infected first plants, then the animals that ate them, and eventually, people. Once these creatures infected the human body, they drove out its natural heat. Once the body was chilled, the four humours were overwhelmed with putrefaction, and the victim began spreading disease in their breath. Kircher recommended the wearing of a dead toad around the neck as a prophylactic against the plague, because he maintained that toads were a scientifically proven magnet attracting the unpleasant vapours that spread the disease. Significance and Reception Frontispiece of Kircher’s Scrutinium physico- medicum Kircher was the first person to view infected blood through a microscope (which he called a 'smicroscopus'). Reporting that “the putrid blood of those affected by fevers... [is] so crowded with worms as to well nigh dumbfound me” he concluded that “Plague is in general a living thing”. It is not clear exactly what Kircher saw through his microscope, but it was certainly not the plague bacillus, which was not discovered until 1894. There were critics of Kircher's ideas, such as Flaminius Gaston, who wrote that Kircher's ideas were such that few people of sound mind embraced them. Francesco Redi, a member of the Accademia del Cimento, published Esperienze Intorno alla Generazione degl'Insetti (Experiments on the Generation of Insects) in 1668. In this work he attempted to reproduce the experiments Kircher claimed to have undertaken in Scrutinium physico-medicum and found some to be unrepeatable - indeed, Redi questioned whether Kircher had ever even done them himself. Sprinking basil water on powdered scorpion did not generate baby scorpions as Kircher claimed, and he doubted that Kircher had ever successfully generated frogs by mixing ditch dust with water. Nevertheless Kircher's ideas were taken up by Christian Lange (1619-62), a Leipzig professor, who republished his book with his own preface. A school of medical thinking grew up around Lange and is work in Germany and elsewhere, convinced that contagion was the method of disease transmission as Kircher had argued. Kircher's work was discussed by the Royal Society, and English thinkers persuaded by his views included Frederick Slare, Sir Charles Ent and Walter Charleton. Scrutinium Physico-Medicum also influenced the thinking of Leibniz, who believed in contagion theory. Later editions Later editions of the work were published in Leipzig by Johannes Baverus in 1659, 1671 and 1674. A Dutch translation was published in Amsterdam by Johannes van Waesbergen in 1669, and a German translation by J.C. Brandan in Augsburg in 1680. The Waesbergern translation carried a frontispiece depicting a woman covered in buboes. Above her hangs a portrait of Kircher. The wolf next to her may be a reference to the Romulus and Remus myth, symbolising Rome. She is stepping on a toad, mentioned in the book both as the product of spontaneous generation and as a protective against the plague.

Biography  Due to political turmoil, his family moved to Barcelona when he was still a baby. He showed some talent for art at an early age and was apprenticed to a silversmith. Later, in 1850, he attended the Escola de la Llotja, where his primary instructors were Claudi Lorenzale and .Lluís Moragas, Biografía del notable pintor Tomàs Moragas, Anales y Boletín de los Museos de Arte de Barcelona, 1944 One of his fellow students was Marià Fortuny, who went to Rome on a scholarship to continue his studies and suggested that Moragas come there too. In 1858 he did so, despite having no financial resources. Later, he was joined by some of his friends from the Escola, and they set up a studio just off the Via Flaminia. He also attended classes at the Accademia Chigi. During this time, he walked throughout Rome and its environs; making sketches that he would turn into oils and watercolors, then send to art dealers in Paris and London. In 1864, he returned to Barcelona, where he held his first exhibition, at the silversmith's shop he had worked in as a boy. At this time, most of his works were of the costumbrista school. Two years later, with a recommendation from Fortuny, he exhibited at the studios of Federico de Madrazo in Madrid. The following year, he participated in the National Exhibition of Fine Arts, where he obtained a first-class honorable mention. In 1869, he married Elvira Pomar; daughter of the silversmith. He then returned to Rome, where he developed an interest in Orientalism but, due to a cholera epidemic, he was forced to relocate to Naples. There, he came under the influence of the Naturalist painter, Domenico Morelli. In 1870, he and Fortuny visited Morocco, where his interest in the Orient was rekindled. After a short stay in Barcelona, he was back in Rome in 1873; beginning his most productive period. Fortuny died in 1874, and Elvira became ill, so he returned to Barcelona and settled there permanently. She died in 1877, and he never remarried. He opened a private drawing and painting school; attended by Santiago Rusiñol and Hermenegildo Anglada Camarasa, among others and, after 1877, served as a Professor at the Escola. From 1882, he held the same position at the \\"Escuela de Artes y Oficios\\" in Vilanova i la Geltrú. In 1883, he created the \\"Centro de Acuarelistas\\" (watercolorists) which later became the Cercle Artístic de Sant Lluc. In 1888, he was artistic advisor for the Barcelona Universal Exposition.

The term is commonly used by historians to refer to a transition from a premodern feudal society to a modern capitalist society, with consensus being that England emerged as the first modern capitalist society through the English Civil War (1642-51) and the Glorious Revolution (1688-89). Historians identify that the transition into modern capitalist society is often defined by a bourgeois revolution in which rising elites secure a system of representative democracy, rather than direct democracy, that serves their interests over the interests of the previously ruling royal aristocracy, such as in the American Revolution. Modern capitalist societies rely on calculated and systematic production, different from the merchant capitalism of the Italian city-states, and are defined by the existence of a wage-earning class that functions as the counterpart to a capitalist class. They are described as highly competitive and indvidualistic, focusing on private interests over public welfare, through prioritizing commodity production and profit maximization. Defending private property, preserving law and order, maintaining the economic exploitation and political impotence of the wage- earning class, training the wage-earning class in the tasks that modern capitalist society requires to function, educating the wage-earning class to internalize the principles of capitalist-democracy, often through forms of propaganda in the mass media, and conditioning the wage-earning class to believe that they are autonomous and live in a society ruled by the citizenry, have all been identified by scholars as forces which maintain modern capitalist societies. Modern capitalist societies are positioned in Western culture as a phase of human progression that is superior or \\"more advanced\\" than \\"premodern\\" forms of society. This perspective was most evidently portrayed through colonial logics which asserted that Indigenous peoples belonged to more \\"primitive\\" cultures and therefore should assimilate into more \\"civilized\\" societies or face genocide (e.g., \\"Kill the Indian, Save the Man\\"). For Marxists, anarchists, and others, modern capitalist society is a phase which will eventually lead to the emergence of a qualitatively different form of society. In opposition, liberals and others are opposed to the structural transformation of modern capitalist society.  Ideological origins  Modern capitalist societies center the concept of means-end rationality, also referred to as instrumental rationality and formal rationality, and its inherent association with domination over nature, so as to manipulate it to suit material needs, and human beings, so as to organize and discipline them in their control over nature. Means-end rationality has held importance in Western culture for longer than modern capitalist societies have existed and historians have identified that this concept may have origins as early as Homer. = Weber = According to sociologist Max Weber, modern capitalist society \\"arose out of the moral calling of Calvinists; more specifically, the doctrine of predestination which resulted in new tensions between the individual and society and encouraged the believer to rationalize the objectivity of his belief (his or her productive contribution to the accumulation of capital).\\" As Weber theorized: > The objectivization of one's beliefs was predicated on the distinction > between instrumental reality (the actual enactment and application of the > prevailing norms and rules of society) and value rationality (how moral > beliefs and values define the meaning and scope of these rules and laws). > The growth of modern society, in this sense, referred to the creation of > large bureaucracies, police forces, and legislative bodies: all autonomous > rational structures of the state and modern capitalist society embodying the > effects and ends of instrumental rationality. The legitimacy of these > institutions thus reflected the dominant function assumed by these > institutions in maintaining and administering societal order. [...] The > result of this evolving orientation was that citizens learned to obey > societal laws which, in turn, served as the basis of dominant and legitimate > types of authority in society. Weber perceived bureaucratization as an efficient institutional representation of rationality in modern capitalist society, yet also recognized how this could be \\"potentially dehumanizing, even malevolent, in its impersonality and possible elevation of economic efficiency and profit-maximization over human values and social justice. Weber was genuinely alarmed by the prospect that an institutionalized, morally vacuous or pernicious instrumental, and especially, formal, rationality might be used to justify morally questionable ends. Such rationality could potentially strip individuals of their freedom and dignity, placing them, metaphorically, in an 'iron cage' of despair.\\"  Historical lineage  The first modern capitalist society has its origins in England with the English Civil War (1642-51) and the Glorious Revolution (1688-89), which has been identified by historians as a bourgeois revolution that resulted in the transition from a traditional feudal society to a modern capitalist society. These historical events in England were described by scholars as being fueled by the historically inaccurate yet profoundly influential reference to Magna Carta (1215), which was heavily cited in the 17th century by rising elites such as Jurist Edward Coke and others to rally support against the British monarchy through the promotion of individualism. Early colonial charters, such as the Virginia Charter (1606) and the Massachusetts Body of Liberties (1641), as well as support for the American Revolution were influenced from this reference to Magna Carta. Many American colonists fought against Britain to preserve liberties and rights that they believed to be enshrined in Magna Carta. In the late 18th century, the United States Constitution became the supreme law of the land, recalling the manner in Magna Carta had come to be regarded as fundamental law. As described by political scientist Kenneth Good, \\"the rewriting of history 'forged a new pedigree for the concept of democracy' traceable from Magna Carta, through the Glorious Revolution of 1688, and the Founding Fathers of the American constitution–all largely aristocratic and elitist events with an absent or passive people–taking precedence over [the alternative canon of] Athens, the Levellers and Diggers, and the Chartists and many others of the 1830s and 1840s.\\" According to Good, \\"in this heritage, political rights in modern capitalist society no longer had the meaning and potency of citizenship in Athens. There was no clear division between state and civil society, no distinct and autonomous economy. With perhaps an especial contribution from American experience, modern capitalist democracy would be confined to a formally separate sphere while the market economy followed rules of its own, and socio- economic inequalities would coexist with civic freedom and formal political equality. Though new urban working classes struggled for self-determination through nineteenth-century Britain, democracy moved away from active citizenship to 'the passive enjoyment of constitutional rights and safeguards'; checks and balances, the division of powers, the rule of law.\\" For Good, this idea of democracy was most identifiable through British and American liberalism.

As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008.

Geology Saska Peak is composed primarily of granodiorite and hornblende quartz diorite, minerals of the Cardinal Peak pluton. Saska Peak, southwest aspectThe North Cascades feature some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, spires, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences.The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. Glacier Peak, a stratovolcano that is west of Saska Peak, began forming in the mid- Pleistocene.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago.During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

Many sources identify him as \\"the father of perinatal medicine\\": one even identifies him as the originator of the term \\"perinatal medicine\\". He was involved in a number of \\"firsts\\", among which the most frequently cited occurred in 1960 when he used blood gas analyses to assess the effectiveness of resuscitation procedures in respect of new-born infants. In 1961 Saling teamed up with K. Damaschke to develop a high-speed approach to testing for perinatal blood-oxygen levels and foetal blood analysis.  Life  Erich Saling was born in the city known, at that time, as Stanislau, at that time a multi-ethnic city in Poland. (In 1939 the city and surrounding region became the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic.Anna M. Cienciala (2004). The Coming of the War and Eastern Europe in World War II (lecture notes, University of Kansas). Retrieved 19 May 2020.) His father, Heinrich Saling, worked in forestry as a regional manager. It seems to have been from his father that Erich Saling inherited or learned a valuable set of hands-on craft skills. His mother, born Emma Hoffmann, had been born in Stanislau region, albeit during the nineteenth century when it was part of the Austrian province of Galicia (Eastern Europe). The family were registered as Protestants. Saling passed his \\"Abitur\\" (school leaving exam) in or before 1943, which in normal times would have opened the way to university admission, but the times were far from normal. Between 1943 and 1945 he was conscripted for military service. In 1945 he enrolled as a medical student at the University of Jena, which after 1945 found itself administered as part of the Soviet occupation zone (relaunched in October 1949 as the Soviet sponsored German Democratic Republic / East Germany). Between 1945 and 1952 he studied at Jena and at Berlin. In 1952 Erich Saling married fellow-physician Hella Weymann. This was also the year in which Saling obtained his professional \\"Approbation\\" in Berlin, receiving his doctorate from the Free University of (West) Berlin that same year. His doctoral dissertation concerned \\"Syphilis as a cause of premature births and miscarriages\\" (\\"Lues als Abort- und Frühgeburtsursache\\"). At the end of 1952 he embarked on his mandatory hands-on probationary posting (\\"Pflichtassistentenzeit\\") at the City Hospital (as the \\"Vivantes Clinic\\" was known at that time) in Berlin-Neukölln. He continued to be based in Neukölln between 1954 and 1958, working as an assistant hospital doctor while training in Gynaecology and Midwifery at the (then separate) Neukölln Women's Clinic. In 1958 Saling qualified in the specialisms of Gynaecology and Midwifery. During the post-war period these were not fashionable specialisms among junior doctors, and Saling had demonstrated a certain level of stubborn persistence in getting to this point. At the same time he embarked on what became a new life-long research programme in various complementary and over-lapping forms of perinatal medicine. While still in the final phase of his training period he had applied his hands-on craft skills to constructing a simple machine that could both blow oxygen into the lungs of new-born infants and suck out mucus from their breathing systems. He also \\"discovered the foetus as a patient\\", deserving of treatment, rather than simply as an after-effect of pregnancy. His expression of that attitude, subsequently mainstream, would have given many more traditionalist colleagues pause for thought. His radical attitudes in this respect were on public display in his first book \\"Das Kind im Bereich der Geburtshilfe\\" (loosely, \\"The Child in the context of obstetrics\\"): he was acutely conscious that \\"the period around an individual’s birth is the most dangerous stage of life\\". As he expanded his teaching roles Saling never tired of repeating this truism which, according to his numerous admirers in the profession, earlier generations of physicians had been inclined to overlook. In 1963, again from the Free University of Berlin, Saling received his habilitation degree, which confirmed his eligibility for a life-long academic career which, in Saling's case, would be combined with his role as a distinguished and exceptionally inventive hospital physician. This time his dissertation concerned \\"The balance of gases in the blood and the base-acid balance of the foetus in an undisturbed birth\\" . That was followed in 1968 with an extraordinary (\\"außerplanmäßig\\") professorship. It was not till 1976, however, that he was appointed head of the Free University's Institute for Perinatal Medicine and head of Obstetrics at the Neukölln City Hospital. In 1987 he was appointed C-4 professor (senior professor) in Perinatal Medicine at the Free University. Following reunification and the ensuring restructuring of university medicine in Berlin Erich Saling became University Professor for Perinatal Medicine for the greatly expanded Charité hospital network. In 1991, however, having passed the age of 65, he retired from his career in the university hierarchy, succeeded in his university professorship by Klaus Vetter. His contributions to medical research in the field of obstetrics were not quite an end, however. In 1993 he founded the \\"Erich Saling Institute for Perinatal Medicine\\", a Nonprofit organization based in Berlin and described in its own publicity as \\"a supra-regional consultation center with emphasis on the prevention of preterm births .... [and contributing in a number of other ways] significantly to the improvement of prenatal care\\".  The pioneer  Erich Saling repeatedly developed new methods of early problem identification and treatment procedures designed to reduced infant mortality and preterm birth levels. In 1958, for instance, he catheterized the aorta of a new-born infant directly following birth and developed a new method for faster placental blood transfusion with early cord cutting. It was in 1960 that he first used blood gas analyses to assess the effectiveness of resuscitation procedures for new-born infants. In 1961 he teamed up with K. Damaschke to develop a high-speed approach to testing for perinatal blood-oxygen levels and foetal blood analysis. This was the first time that direct diagnostic access to a foetus in the womb had become available. In 1962 Saling developed the \\"Fruchtwasserspiegelung\\" (amnioscope), enabling vulnerable late-stage foetuses to be identified and, where necessary, appropriate interventions to be performed. In 1965 he introduced clinical-biological condition diagnoses that were performed on new-born babies immediately following birth. In 1972 he succeeded in performing a directly postnatal Esophagogastroduodenoscopy. In 1978 he introduced continual vaginal disinfectant measures in order to avoid ascending infections in the event of amniorrhexis during later-stage pregnancy. That was also the year in which, together with his colleague U. Blücher, he came up with a device for monitoring premature labour in the home from a distance - in this case a hospital or clinic - using a telephone. In 1981 he developed the \\"Frühe Totale Muttermund-Verschluss\\" (FTMV),, a new method for the avoidance of recurring miscarriages and premature births. Saling E (1981): Der frühe totale operative Muttermundverschluss zur Vermeidung habitueller Aborte und Frühgeburten. Z Geburtshilfe Perinatol 185: pp. 259–261 In 1984, together with U. Blücher and J. Rothe, Erich Saling created microphone recordings of the acoustic background context of the Uterus during childbirth. In 1989 Saling developed a pre-term birth prevention programme suitable for routine application. Then in 1993, shortly after his retirement from the Free University, he launched a self-care action for pregnant women keen to avoid late-stage abortions and pre-term births. In 1999/2000 he developed a new method for patients to determine for themselves the pH-value of vaginal secretions, using an \\"Indicator Coated Panty Liner\\". Although it is to be hoped that the previous two paragraphs will provide a reasonable insight into the nature and extent of the innovations ascribed to Erich Saling, they are not intended to be comprehensive. The Berlin based \\"Erich Saling-Institut für Perinatale Medizin e. V.\\" has placed a longer schedule of Saling's perinatal \\"firsts\\" online, however.  Personal  Erich Saling's marriage to Hella Weymann (1925 - 2006) in 1952 was followed by the births of their sons Peter (1954) and Michael (1955). There are also six grandchildren and, at the last count, seven great grandchildren. Peter is a gynaecologist and Michael is a businessman.

Clash of rival gangs The riots started out as a political disturbance in the town of Curepipe on Curepipe Road which resulted in a clash between followers of Eugène Laurent (Action Libérale) against those of Armand Esnouf (Parti de l'Ordre or Oligarchy). This came at a time when Eugène Laurent had celebrated his victory over his rival William Newton (Mauritius) at the 1911 elections held on 18 January 1911. Curepipe also happened to be where a significant number of prominent business people resided. Some of these residents of Curepipe were attacked when they departed from a train when it reached its destination in Port Louis. The rioters also destroyed several businesses located in the capital city of Port Louis. The riots resulted in the death of two civilians.

Due to the planned immigration of Indian labourers to the island since 1834 following the Abolition of Slavery there had been a significant change in the ethnic composition of the working population, made up mainly of Creoles and Indians. During the years prior to the 1911 riots the need for representation and better working and living conditions were being advocated by the likes of Adolphe de Plevitz and Manilal Doctor. In fact soon after his arrival in Mauritius in 1907 lawyer Manilal Doctor assisted the political party Action Libérale of Eugène Laurent in its campaign against its rival the Oligarchy Party. On the other hand, there were continual debates over the suitability of the new Constitution. The 1909 Royal Commission of Enquiry witnessed a strong push to revert to the old Constitution of 1832. Royal Commission of Enquiry A Royal Commission of Enquiry was instigated after the 1911 riots.

The choir consists, including pre-choruses, of about 120 singers aged 6 to 21. As a non-confessional municipal choir, it has been directed since 2003 by music teacher Michael Krause.  History  The Göttingen Boys' Choir emerged in 1962 as a school choir for a boys grammar school. Under the direction of its founder Franz Herzog, who received his musical training at the Dresdner Kreuzchor (Dresden Holy Cross Choir), the choir soon became famous outside Göttingen. As early as 1964, the choir was recorded for German public radio and television. Moreover, the Choir started to cooperate with the Göttingen International Handel Festival. After Franz Herzog's retirement for health reasons in 1980, Torsten Derlin (1985-1985), Martin Heubach (1985-1989), and Stefan Kaden (1989-2003) ran the choir. Since 2003 Michael Krause, a music teacher at the Otto-Hahn Gymnasium in Göttingen, has been running the choir. In addition to cultivating the classical choral repertoire, Michael Krause has expanded the choir's repertoire by adding works by contemporary composers.  Structure  Main Choir = In the main choir, about 60 boys and young men sing. They are aged 9 to 21 years and are from different middle and high schools in Göttingen and its surroundings. The boys sing the soprano and alto voices, while the men sing the tenor and bass parts. The choir rehearses two or three times a week on the lectern or with all voices. Also, the choir rehearses one full day a month and once a year for a week during the holidays. Concerts, as well as recordings and individual and group voice work, complete the choral life.The Göttingen Boys' Choir 2016 in St. John, Göttingen = Pre- Choruses = For pre-school children, an offer has been set up to introduce boys to singing at an early age. The music education groups at the various primary schools in Göttingen are the mainstay for the promotion of young talents. Singers who have already taken part in these programs can continue to sing in the two pre-chorals, which are also open to newcomers. This is where individual singing lessons and first introductions to music theory take place. Every year more than 100 boys from Göttingen and the surrounding area participate in the various programs for young singers. Regular performances in partner schools and end of the school year performances with the pre-choruses prepare the singers for the entrance examination of the main choir. = Sponsorship = The choir is under the independent sponsorship of a non-profit association (Göttinger Knabenchor e. V.). The choir is also supported by the city of Göttingen and other institutions. Since 2020, Göttingen Boys' Choir has been part of an initiative of the Lower Saxony Ministry of Science and Culture to promote excellent youth choirs.  Repertoire  The Göttingen Boys' Choir sings sacred and secular works from all periods of music history. They place particular emphasis on a cappella choral music. However, sometimes great choral symphonic works are also performed, occasionally in cooperation with other choirs. The Göttingen Boys' Choir significantly cultivates the musical legacy of its founder Franz Herzog, who composed, among other, sacred works, arrangements of folk songs, and secular choral music.  Concert tours and choral exchange  Since its foundation, the choir has toured internationally in nations like the United Kingdom, France, Sweden, Poland, Switzerland, the Netherlands, the United States, South Africa, and, recently, Japan. Often the host choirs come back for return visits. For example, despite the Cold War in the 1970s, a choral friendship developed with the Poznan Nightingales, a famous boys choir in Poland. Other contacts are maintained with, among others, the Cantores Minores in Helsinki, the Hiroshima Boys' Choir, and the Dresdner Kreuzchor (Dresden Holy Cross Choir). The choir maintains a particularly close relationship with the Uetersen Boys' Choir and the Wiesbadener Knabenchor. Finally, the Göttingen Boys' Choir regularly participates in international choral festivals.

He has been a member of the Harare City Council since 2008 representing Ward 27, which covers parts of the Glen Norah suburb. Herbert Gomba was elected and sworn in as mayor on 3 September 2018. He is a member of the Movement for Democratic Change party.  Early life and education  Gomba was born in the town of Rusape in Manicaland Province. He attended Highfield 2 High School in Harare, where he completed his Ordinary and Advanced Levels. After leaving school, he worked in various positions at Meikles Hotel before his election as councillor. In 2013, he earned a Bachelor of Science with Honours in sociology from the University of Zimbabwe. He received a Master of Science in public policy and governance from Africa University near Mutare in 2016.  Political career  Gomba was elected to the Harare City Council in 2008 for Ward 27, which covers parts of the Glen Norah suburb. He has served as chairman of the business committee and health and environment committee, and was also a member of the housing committee and finance and development committee. He became deputy mayor of Harare in 2008, but lost the post to Thomas Muzuwa in 2013. On 2 September 2018, The Standard reported that Gomba had been chosen as the mayoral candidate of the Movement for Democratic Change Alliance. Gomba had been on the shortlist of three names presented by MDC Alliance President Nelson Chamisa before the party's national council earlier that week. The other two names on the shortlist were Deputy Mayor Enock Mupamawonde and Councillor Ian Makone, the former chief advisor to Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai. Factionalism reportedly played a role in the decision—Makone had the endorsement of MDC–T Secretary-General Douglas Mwonzora, whereas Gomba was seen as a Chamisa ally. An additional factor was that Gomba came from the high-density suburbs, while Makone represented a ward composed of Borrowdale and other affluent low-density suburbs. Gomba was elected mayor of Harare on 3 September 2018 at a meeting of the city council. The only ZANU–PF councillor, Martin Matinyanya nominated himself for the position, but did not receive a second, and Gomba was then elected unanimously. The incumbent deputy mayor, Enock Mupamawonde, retained his post. Gomba was sworn in on the same day by acting town clerk Hosea Chisango. In his acceptance speech, Gomba said he intended to be a servant and listening mayor, and listed some of the problems facing the city, including corruption, water shortages, road infrastructure, traffic and street vending congestion, debt, and illegal occupation of council land. Gomba is the first mayor from the city's western suburbs. He succeeded Bernard Manyenyeni, who did not run for reelection to the city council in 2018.

The band consists of brothers Mark (born in 1953) and Clive Ives (born in 1956). They grew up in the South of London. The band combine several musical styles, creating its own sound: Folk, Jazz, Pop, Ambient, Psychedelic as well as Healing Music. Woo is one of the first bands to incorporate acoustic instruments (clarinet, saxophone, Acoustic guitars, 12-string and bass guitars) into electronic music in the early 70's. The name of the band, Woo, refers to the sound of a musical saw,an instrument the brother's uncle Fred used to play. = Biography =  Childhood and first steps in music (1965-1974)  The Ives brothers grow up in the South of London in Raynes Park before moving to Banstead. Their interest in music starts with seeing The Beatles on TV in the 60's. The Ives brothers founded their first band, The Tescades, at ages 6 and 9, with two childhood friends. Mark was on the guitar and Clive played an old drum kit belonging to his grandfather. The Tescades put on gigs in the garage of their house, and invited their friends to be the audience. Their grandfather, a drummer in the Royal Marines, and their uncle Ivor, a Jazz musician, played an instrumental role in the musical development of the Ives brothers. Mark played at several Modern Jazz and Dixieland Jazz gigs with his uncle Ivor. The latter also gave Mark his first clarinet at the age of 15. Woo Logo Mark started to learn to play the guitar and to write songs at the age of 13. During these early years, the Ives brothers rehearsed Mark’s new compositions. Clive was impressed by the talent of his older brother and tried to back him up with variety of creative tools. He used any available kitchen utensils as percussion instruments. At 17, Mark joined a Royal Air Force band, and played clarinet. Meanwhile, Clive began to study art. The two brothers started recording when Mark left the RAF.  First recordings and first album (1974-1982)  In 1974, the Ives brothers bought their first synthesizer, the SH-3A by Roland, and a Teac 4-track tape recorder. The duo started to explore composing and home- studio recording. The Ives brothers met several nights a week in a small flat and recorded throughout the night. Clive was on synthesizer and percussions, Mark was on bass guitar, 12-string guitar, saxophone and clarinet. The material of the first recordings are based mainly on Mark's ideas and compositions. Mark dictated notes and chords to Clive and the band left the recorder on, hence comments from each other and background noises became part of the songs. As they recorded at night, they had to keep the volume down in order not to disturb the neighbours who banged on the walls as a means of complaint. This impacted the sound of the band: they were forced to record very quiet tracks with soft sounds. Triangles were used instead of drums, guitars were played in picking mode and keyboards were played in a delicate way. Mark And Clive Ives in their home studio in the early 80's. In 1976, the band acquired a new synthesizer, the Roland system 100. It featured a sequencer that propelled the sound of the band to another dimension. Clive realized that the audio signal of Mark's acoustic instruments could be delivered directly to the synthesizer and it’s sequencer. He manipulated Mark’s playing with the help of oscillators and processors integrated in the synthesizer. Experimenting with this new technology offered the Ives brothers a completely new and innovative way to record their music. \\"After our initial thrill of the wonders of recording we began to realise that with this technology at our fingertips, we could create beauty. Organic, unpredictable, mysterious things would happen when we allowed the technology to be set free, especially when Mark’s instruments were being treated through the sequencers and synths. Sometimes 1 and 1 made 3, and we were in creative heaven. From there the mind enters into the equation, and starts to envisage endless sounds upon sounds, combining musical influences and making them into something new …” \\\\- Clive Ives on the new approach of recording by the band. Woo tried to translate their different emotional states spontaneously and composes pieces that could evoke dream-like atmospheres, for example - Parisian cafés, Russian music and imaginary landscapes . This gave the music of the band a rich diversity of styles and sounds. With a brand new creative impulse, Woo kept creating endlessly, and recorded hundreds of tunes over a period of five years. In 1981, an old school friend of Clive, who had become an artist manager, submitted the music of the band to Mike Alway at Cherry Red Records. Mike decided to help them release an album. The band then chose several tracks for its first album from the previous five years recordings, and it was released under Woo’s Sunshine Series label. 1982, during the New Wave and Punk era, Woo's first album, entitled \\"Whichever Way You Are Going You Are Going Wrong\\" with 10 instrumental tracks and one song sung by Mark, came out. It was mixed by Clive, who also designed the LP cover. The album is well received by the English musical press, in particular Melody Maker and NME, which described the music of the Ives brothers as a collaboration between The Durutti Column and Penguin Cafe Orchestra, produced by Brian Eno. During that time, Woo met the bands Everything But The Girl and Five Or Six. They became friends and shared jam sessions.  It's Cosy Inside - Into the Heart Of Love - A La Luna (1982-1991)  Free and under no contract, the band kept building its musical career, recording more and more tracks, in a free creative spirit, for a total of 1500 tracks over a period of 10 years. The Ives brothers become strongly interested in Raja Yoga and spiritual healing. Mark studied theosophy and Krishna consciousness, while Clive started practicing Shiatsu in parallel with their musical creations. Their spiritual interests had a strong impact on Woo's forthcoming musical projects. In 1987, the US label Independant Projects Record re-released \\"Whichever Way You Are Going You Are Going Wrong\\". In 1989, “It’s Cosy Inside”, which Woo had already created in 1983, is released in the US as well as in Europe, and gave the band the opportunity to get some exposure on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean. Woo - It's Cosy Inside The band's musical style had evolved and was more mature throughout the 16 tracks of the album. This new album is influenced for the most part by George Orwell's novel \\"1984\\". \\"When we were recording, 1982-1983 we were living the suburban post-apocalyptic vision. The track “BB…..!” refers to the chant for Big Brother in 1984. CCT cameras had just been erected around the corner from where we were living and it felt like Big Brother was on his way! I photographed them and collaged them onto the top right corner of the album cover. The song “The Final Card”—also symbolised by the bar codes on the computer screen on the album cover—is a reference to identity tagging, where all our identity and finances are kept in an implanted under your skin. With Orwell’s vision looming towards us, the fear of nuclear war, conspiracy theories of the Illuminati, the apparent demise of the Love Generation—and with that loss, the reaction to the increasing awareness of all that is wrong in the world manifesting in suburban London with anarchy and Punk—and the increasing gulf between rich and poor with the Thatcher Government … Yeah, we were buying into an apocalyptic vision. \\" \\\\- Clive Ives on the inspiration for the album \\"It's Cosy Inside\\" Unfortunately, \\"It's Cosy Inside\\" did not have the same commercial success as the debut album, leading to a declining popularity of the band. Woo left its US label, and signed its next album with the label Cloud 9 Music. The third Woo album was issued in 1990 (on cassette only). Called \\"Into The Heart Of Love\\", it is often regarded as the band's masterpiece. This album had a new alchemy. Throughout the 20 slow-tempo tracks, which are sometimes accompanied by lyrics but for the most part instrumental, Mark's guitar and clarinet, as well as Clive's keyboard layers, shine in an oneiric mood. Influences for this album are very diverse: Native American mythologies, extra-terrestrial life, Tibetan culture, Steven Spielberg's movie 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' and above all, universal love. Some tracks featured on the album were composed in the 70's. In 1991, the band issues their third album in 3 years \\"A La Luna\\" on Grunki Records. This album, featuring 26 tracks, is very atmospheric and once again with a broad range of influences, and titles including Nazca Lines, Man on the Moon, Voices in the Night and Orbit Unknown. Through these years, Woo played very rarely on stage. The band reckons its true strength lies in the way they work in the studio, and that its intimate music comes from an alchemy between the two members that does not translate into live performances. Mark often plays on his own with his guitar during various gigs, mainly at festivals and in pubs. The band developed aesthetics of its own throughout the 80’s, and starts the 90's with more maturity and more evolved technical skills.  Rediscovery and new projects (1995-2020)  In 1995, the band published a new album with 7 tracks, \\"Live from Venus\\", produced by Dave Goodman, sound engineer of the Sex Pistols. Mark and his girlfriend Ruby created the title for this album, linking New Age symbolism with the planet Venus. Clive used a Notron sequencer, which Bjork famously used. From a musical standpoint, the band's style leaned more towards Sci-Fi- inspired trance, dance and ambient. On some tracks Woo also used old vocal recordings of people who reported to have met Venusians. Still in 1995, Woo issued \\"Forever Healing\\", the band's first foray into the world of \\"Healing Music”, Clive used this music during his Shiatsu sessions. This album contains 12 tracks for relaxation and meditation. The band kept recording regularly in the 90's, Mark recorded several albums of songs, while Clive kept recording albums of music for meditation sessions. But together the band didn't issue any album for the next 19 years. In the early 2010's, several labels approached the band to get their old albums re-issued. The second album was the first to be re-issued: \\"It's Cosy Inside\\" was published in 2012 by Drag City and Yoga Records. Following the critical success of this re-issue, the band was contacted by the English label Emotional Rescue for a more comprehensive re-issue of its back catalogue. In 2013, \\"Whichever Way You Are Going You Are Going Wrong\\", Woo’s first album, was issued again. Due to the growing popularity the band decided to publish a new album. For this purpose archives from 1974 to 1990 were unearthed. \\"When The Past Arrives\\" , the new album featuring 14 tracks, was released on Drag City Records in 2014. It was an instant success. The album received very positive feedback from the musical press, even scoring 7.7 out of 10 on Pitchfork. This album allowed a new audience to discover the musical essence of the band. The very same year, Woo was commissioned by the English Touring Opera to compose an opera for children, named \\"Waxwings\\". The work was created for the annual ETO tour that included the UK and Luxembourg in 2015. In 2014, \\"Into The Heart Of Love\\" was the next album to be reissued, highlighting the growing popularity of the duo even more. In 2016, Woo released a new album with tracks from its archives that was published by Palto Flats Records. \\"AWAAWAA\\", comprising 22 tracks, was both a critical and commercial success. Emotional Rescue re-issued \\"A La Luna\\" in 2017. Since 2016, Woo have continued to release new albums on their Bandcamp page, including \\"All Is Well” which came out as an LP in 2019, released by Slowboy Records, and contained 13 tracks, combining both instrumental titles and songs. The band continues to work on new projects, new original albums and re- workings of their archives. On June 2020, Woo released a new album \\" Arcturian Corridor \\" on Quindi Records. Influences The bands cites as main influences: Claude Debussy, Erik Satie, Yes, Todd Rundgren, The Beatles, Stevie Wonder, David Bowie, Brian Eno, Frank Zappa, Sergei Prokofiev, Stan Getz and Lionel Hampton.

During their competition career, the pair won medals at the Olympic Games and the World Cup Finals. Dynasty died in 1989 following a colic surgery. Early life The dark bay Hanoverian gelding was bred in 1977 by German Karl Jantzen. His sire was Darling and his dam was Minuett (by Marmor). Originally named Disco 16, he was acquired for Canadian Cindy Neale-Ishoy by her long time supporters and sponsors Charles and Janet Burns in 1981. Not happy with his original name, Cindy opted to change it to Dynasty. The new name was inspired by the Peter Newman's book on the rise of Bronfman dynasty in Canada. Although the prime time soap opera of the same name was on the air at the time, Cindy was not aware of its existence, having been living in Germany and having no interest in that kind of show. \\"The last thing I would ever do is name a horse after a soap.\\", she once admitted. Competitive career Dynasty and Cindy Neale-Ishoy began competing internationally in Europe in 1983. Their early career was marked by inconsistent performances, which were usually deemed as either very good or terrible. The pair made their championships debut at the 1986 World Championships in Cedar Valley, Ontario, where they placed 7th individually. The following year they competed in their first World Cup Finals and finished 4th. The pair's most fruitful season came in 1988. They improved their World Cup record by finishing second at the Finals in Den Bosch. It was the first and the only time that a Canadian pair has climbed the World Cup Finals podium. Following the early season success, Dynasty and Neale-Ishoy lead Canada to a historic team bronze medal at the 1988 Seoul Olympics. It was the first time that Canada has ever won an Olympic medal in dressage. In the individual competition later on, the pair placed 4th, merely 16 points away from another podium-finish. At a wrap-up coctail party in Seoul, one judge came up to Cindy and said that the best of Dynasty is yet to come. 1988 competition season, however, proved to be the final one for the pair. Following the Olympics, Dynasty suffered a tendon injury. He healed and was under saddle again when he suffered a colic attack. A section of his intestine had passed through a lesion in the gut wall. His colic condition was successfully operated on in Guelph, however at some point a blood vessel was ruptured. Dynasty was given over twenty quarts of blood and clotting drugs to try and stop the internal bleeding, but he could not be saved. Legacy Cindy Neale-Ishoy fondly remembers Dynasty to this day: “My whole life revolved around what to do with him. Along with Neil and my daughter Kahla, Dynasty was everything. The next morning I didn’t even want to get up.”. Cindy, however, did not take a break from riding, and since that day she has had many highlights in the ring with other horses. For a while it was difficult for her to develop a bond with other horses, as she was always looking for another Dynasty. “What I have learned is that with each new horse you try you have to discipline yourself to accept them for what they are.”, she admitted. As of 2020, Dynasty's two podium-finishes from 1988 remain to be the only global medals won in the Canadian dressage history.

The Round Houses in Moscow are nine-floors residential buildings built circularly, in Western Moscow in 1970, according to a project by architect Yevgeny Stamo and engineer Aleksandr Markelov. They are located at . They were built in a very different design from the regular “panel block” houses of that era. The diameter of the structure is 155 meters (around 500 feet). It has 26 entrances, 913 apartments and six big archways to enter the courtyard. The first floor of the building contained pharmacies, shops, hair salons, a laundry and tailor shop, also a childrens’ club, and even a library. The isolated courtyard has its own park, with playgrounds for kids and feels like it is a long way away from the busy town. The rooms here are not rectangular but more like trapezoids, which makes it harder to place furniture. Also the courtyard has bad acoustics – a small noise echoes a lot, it bounces from the walls making it noisy at night if something is happening in the courtyard.  History  The Two younger architects, Stamo and Markelov wanted to design their own housing project to diversify a bit from the dull typical Soviet planned architecture. Weirdly enough, the main communist architectural authority and the Moscow Mosproject-1 institute let them step out from the standard solutions and make a round building. In 1972, the construction of the huge accommodation building was completed. It made a big impression on the people of Moscow and of all the USSR, and for a long time there was an urban legend that the houses were built for the Moscow Olympics and that a whole block of such buildings was designed in the shape of the Olympic rings. According to Sergei Tekchenko, former head of the Moscow General Plan Institute, this version was distributed in the press for no reason: first, round houses seized too much land, and secondly, they turned out to be less cost-effective than standard buildings. The costs increased due to the need for constant monitoring of a single project, in addition, such houses required monolithic additions, which increased the cost of the construction and the duration of its construction. The real idea of the project was to try to restore the \\"old Soviet residential yard\\", to add attractiveness to the typical built-up areas and to provide the residents the necessary infrastructures within walking distance. Thus, the first floor of the building was reserved for facilities such as shops, pharmacies and a library. The building is in Nzhinskaya Street contains 913 apartments on 26 entrances. Another building on Dovzhenko Street is a similar copy and only the number of apartments is different - 936. Due to its location near the Mosfilm Studios, the Houses has often appeared in Soviet films. In 1979, a third house was built with 26 entrances again but with 936 apartments. It was built near the Mosfilm Studios and the best apartments were given away to the actors of the cinema and theater. After a few years, the disadvantages of this form of building became apparent: a strong wind was constantly blowing inside the yard, there were very loud voices and a significant portion of the apartments did not meet the required insulation standards. Repairs in the apartments are difficult to make due to the trapezoidal shape of the rooms and often residents and guests have difficulty finding the right entrances. As a result, after the construction of the house on Dovzhenko Street was completed, no such buildings were built. Despite all the weaknesses of the project, after about half a century, architectural scholars call it a project that preceded its time and paralleled it to the modern Headquarters of Apple Inc. in California (Apple Park). Former Moscow Chief Architect Mikhail Posokhin praised Yevgeny Stamo's contribution to the urban landscape and posed him alongside with architects such as Vasily Bazhanov and Alexei Shchosev who also contributed to Moscow's urban landscape.

He never shys away from the 'difficult', morally challenging themes of the human condition. Yet, all his artworks have a delicacy and beauty that shows redemption is possible through human creative self-analysis. His work is still as relevant today as it was 15 years ago.

Like its companion piece, Porter’s De Conditioning Chamber, with its challenging message, seems designed to make us question the basis of what we know and what we believe.” The exhibition included what Porter claimed was the only complete Neanderthal skull anywhere in the world.

Soviet critique of Chinese Communist Party However, at the conference the Soviet party distributed a circular, which argued that the Communist Party of China had violated the commitments of the 1957 International Meeting of Communist and Workers Parties. The document represented the first example of a detailed official Soviet critique of the Chinese party. Positions of the delegations The Conference of Representatives of Communist and Workers Parties was attended by parties from 51 countries. The conferences were attended by all the ruling parties of the socialist states in Europe (except the League of Communists of Yugoslavia) and Asia. \\\\- i.e. the Romanian Workers Party, the Albanian Party of Labour, the Bulgarian Communist Party, the Hungarian Socialist Workers Party, the Workers Party of Vietnam, the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, the Communist Party of China, Workers Party of Korea, the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, the Polish United Workers Party, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia. The Soviet delegation was led by Nikita Khrushchev, who argued in favour of the Soviet line of peaceful co-existence in his address to the Romanian party congress. The Chinese delegation was led by Peng Zhen, who countered Khruschev's argument by pointing to the U-2 incident, the subsequent break-up of the Paris Peace Summit and called on the parties present not to trust imperialist forces. The Chinese delegation protested that the conference had not been properly announced on forehand, that the Soviets had ambushed them by changing an informal meeting into a conference by surprise. The Albanian Party of Labour delegation was the sole Eastern European party not to rally being the Soviet position at the conference, albeit they didn't outright support the Chinese party line as such. The absence of Albanian leader Enver Hoxha and the Prime Minister Mehmet Shehu was noted, and interpreted as a decline in Soviet-Albanian relations. The Albanian delegation was led by Hysni Kapo, third-ranking politburo member. Other delegation members included Sulejman Baholli, Central Committee member, and Thanas Nano, deputy director of the Agitprop department of the party. The Workers Party of Vietnam, whose delegation was led by Lê Duẩn, did not take sides between the Soviet and Chinese parties at the conference. The Workers Party of Korea also took a neutral stand at the conference. All other attending parties unequivocally sided with the Soviet position. The Socialist Unity Party of Germany delegation was led by Walter Ulbricht. The Bulgarian Communist Party was represented by Todor Zhivkov. The Communist Party of India was represented by M. Basavapunnaiah and Bhupesh Gupta, who belonged to the leftist faction of the party. The Indian delegation took a neutral stand in the Sino-Soviet dispute (in contrast to the position taken by S.A. Dange, the leader of the CPI right-wing tendency, who fully defended the Soviet party at the Peking conference of the World Federation of Trade Unions held in the same month). The Communist Party USA was represented by Elizabeth Gurley Flynn. The Communist Party of Great Britain was represented by Peter Kerrigan.National Archives. Communist Party of Romania congress, Bucharest, June 1960. Issues debated at the conferences included the Great Leap Forward, the Sino-Indian border tensions and military cooperation. Resolution On June 24, 1960 a resolution of the conference was issued, with a language carefully worded to conceal the Sino-Soviet tensions. The resolution called for the holding of an International Meeting of Communist and Workers Parties in Moscow in November 1960, where outstanding differences would be settled.

Early life Rock Cottage, Bamburgh - long view Rock Cottage, Bamburgh - front of house Septimus Albert Pitt was born on 19 November 1877 in Low Fell, Durham, EnglandEngland & Wales, Civil Registration Birth Index, 1837-1915, the seventh-born son of Henry Pitt (24 March 1839-20 September 1906), a glass works manager, and Susan Harley (30 July 1839-7 May 1918). His maternal grandfather, Robert Henry Harley (1803-1875), was a bookseller and stationer. While his parents originated from Birmingham, they raised their large family (of eight sons and three daughters) in the counties of Durham (in the 1881 census, the family lived at 12 Victoria Terrace, Gateshead1881 England Census) and Northumberland (in the 1891 census, the family lived at Rock Cottage, Bamburgh1891 England Census). Personal life Pitt married Cecilia Philip (or Phillips) Keir (1876–1952) at Robinson’s Temperance Hotel and Restaurant, 31 Lothian Road, in the parish of St. George, Edinburgh, Midlothian, on 30 August 1899.Statutory Registers - Marriages 685/1 454, National Records of Scotland The Pitts’ only child, daughter Cecilia Jessie Pitt (1900–1971), was born on 17 October 1900 at 18 Devonshire RoadStatutory Registers - Births 168/2 1896, National Records of Scotland, Aberdeen, Aberdeenshire. Public life At the age of 14, Pitt began work as a junior assistant in the South Shields Public Library, County Durham. He began his professional career early, being appointed Sub-Librarian in 1894, just before the age of seventeen, and having charge of the complete reorganisation of the library. In 1898, he went to Aberdeen and, after a spell of several years as Sub-Librarian in the city, he came to Glasgow in 1901 to open Gorbals Library, the city’s first public lending library. In 1903, he was appointed Superintendent of Glasgow’s District Libraries, supervising the scheme for establishing sixteen district libraries and two reading-rooms in the city. For several years, Pitt and his family lived at 11 Bolton Drive, Mount Florida. Glasgow, Lanarkshire, Scotland, Electoral Registers, 1857-1962. However, by 1908, Pitt had left Scotland to become City Librarian in Coventry, Warwickshire, where he remained for several years. Following his appointment in December 1914, Pitt took up his duties as City Librarian for Glasgow on 15 March 1915, serving in this capacity for 22 years, based at The Mitchell Library, Glasgow. (His predecessor, Francis Thornton Barrett, had officially retired in 1914 but continued to work for the Library in an advisory capacity until shortly before his death in 1919 at the age of eighty.) On his return to Glasgow, Pitt greatly extended the library services, organising the first municipal commercial library in the country in 1915. In the years immediately following the Great War, his attention was occupied largely with the expansion of the lending service and, during the nineteen-twenties, the opening of a number of new branch libraries. Pitt published papers throughout his professional life, and contributed regularly to professional journals, and at Library Association meetings and conferences, his particular interests being the study of bibliography, library history, and languages. In 1919, Pitt spoke of his support for the idea of ‘open-access’ libraries (first introduced to Britain by James Duff Brown at Clerkenwell Public Library in London), speaking against the ‘indicator system’, which was an adjunct of ‘closed-access’ libraries, in which access to books is not readily accessible for reading or browsing but tightly controlled by library staff, saying, > “Familiarity with books is the most important element in the education of > the people and unrestricted access to a library power, because a book is > power.” In 1924, Pitt served on the Departmental Committee on Public Libraries, which reported in June 1927.Public Libraries. National Scheme Of Co-operation, Report Of Departmental Committee, 'The Times', 15 June 1927 Pitt served the Library Association as a member of the Council from 1915, Vice-President in 1920, and as President in 1934. He was also, twice (from 1927-1928 and from 1931-1932), a President of the Scottish Library Association. In 1928, Pitt was one of two commissioners (the other being Milton J. Ferguson, State Librarian of California, USA) who, under the auspices of the Carnegie Corporation of New York, was sent to survey and report on the library services in South Africa and Kenya. A direct culmination of their visit (convening at the end of their three months of investigations) was the 1928 Bloemfontein Conference (from 15-17 November 1928), at which they discussed their findings and suggested proposals towards improved public library services in the country. This conference (the first library conference in South Africa), is regarded as a watershed event in South African library development as it helped instigate the demise of the subscription system in favour of free libraries. In 1929, Pitt and Ferguson produced identically-titled but separate reports of their investigations. Meanwhile, back in Scotland, in Glasgow's Mitchell Library, Pitt devised its first open access department, the Music Room, which opened in 1930. By 1935, Pitt was obliged to obtain further accommodation for the book stock of The Mitchell Library and to suggest that the Library be further extended. The sub-committee appointed to consider his report found that the Library, originally designed to accommodate 330,000 volumes, now held approximately 400,000, and that the number was increasing at a rate of 6-10,000 per annum, large numbers of books being stored in corridors as there was no room for additional shelving in which to accommodate them. The area suggested for an extension by Pitt was deemed suitable, and the project was approved. However, having initiated the project, Pitt did not, however, see its commencement in March 1939; he died, suddenly, on 27th August 1937 and was succeeded as City Librarian by Robert Bain.

In 1840, 80 percent of all cotton textiles sold from Sweden was sold from the Kinna area. Life She was born in the rural area of Kinna as the daughter of the wealthy farmer Anders Jonsson and Elin Larsdotter, and married in 1800 to the wealthy farmer Erik Andersson (1772–1813). Her husband was the owner of the farm Stämmemand in Kinna, hence her own soubriquet. She had five children: two sons (one surviving to adulthood) and three daughters. =Business= Both her father and her spouse were active as textile entrepreneurs within the putting-out system and her mother managed her own money lending business, and she was to follow all of their examples. In 1813, when she became a widow and thereby of legal majority (which made her business activity visible in official documentation), she took over the textile putting-out system manufacture business of both her father and her late spouse.Ahlberger, Gunnar, Marks historia. 3, En vävbygd under omvandling 1770 till 1880, Rydals museum, Rydal, 2003 She also started banking by money lending. This was at a point in time when the putting-out system had its breakthrough from small scale business to large scale industrial enterprises, and she was one example of those who developed her manufacture to a major business industry. The Kinna area was furthermore the center of the Swedish cotton industry, and she became one of the major manufacturers with thousands of home weavers in her employ. She continued her business activity until her death, for almost forty years. She is known as the mother of the cotton industrialist (1801–1866), but he did in fact not inherit her business (he founded his own during her lifetime), her business enterprise was instead inherited by one of her daughters and her son-in-law. In 1842, she was awarded with a golden chain from King Charles XIV John of Sweden as a recognition for her industrial enterprise within the Swedish cotton industry as well as for encouraging the public diligence within the household with her diligence and personal example.Ahlberger, Gunnar, Marks historia. 3, En vävbygd under omvandling 1770 till 1880, Rydals museum, Rydal, 2003 Legacy After her death, her farm became a local memorial.

Available between October 2014 and December 2015, the title is a racing game with role-playing elements. Based on Square Enix's role-playing game Final Fantasy VII, the player controls the protagonist of that game, Cloud Strife. While riding on a motorcycle, Cloud battles enemies with melee weapons and magic with help from other Final Fantasy VII characters. Players can modify Cloud's weapons, clothing and motorcycle, and perform powerful attacks known as limit breaks. Square Enix and developer CyberConnect2 conceived of the game as a series of titles for mobile devices that would see the Final Fantasy VII mini-games remade. In the development process, they settled on only the most popular title, G-Bike. Developers expanded on the original idea for the mini-game in areas such as customization and gameplay but did not add an overarching story. Critics had mixed reactions due to it not being the remake of the original Final Fantasy VII for which fans had been hoping. However, they still found the game visually appealing and faithful to the original mini-games aesthetic. Square Enix shut down the game in 2015. Gameplay G-Bike gameplay shows Cloud using lightning-based magic to attack enemies. Final Fantasy VII G-Bike is a free-to-play racing game involving Cloud Strife, a young mercenary and protagonist of Final Fantasy VII. The game involves Cloud riding a motorcycle while fighting enemies as he travels the roads around the city of Midgar from Final Fantasy VII as well as other locations. Besides attacking with his weapon called the \\"Buster Sword\\", Cloud can perform magic with items called \\"Materia\\". He is capable of performing a series of powerful attacks known as \\"Limit Breaks\\". Players can summon supporting characters from the original Final Fantasy VII such as Tifa Lockhart. Bosses drawn from Final Fantasy VII are encountered at the end of stages, including Reno and Dyne. Players are awarded a ranking at the end of each stage based on how well they did. Players can customize Cloud's weaponry and clothing to resemble either his original Final Fantasy VII look or a new look by visiting shops in-between missions. Players can customize their bikes as well as purchase new ones. In a 2015 event, players were able to replace Cloud's Hardy Daytona bike with one called Phoenix, which was more powerful and gave a boost to the characters' magical powers. Development and release The idea to create a mobile game based on Final Fantasy VII came from Square Enix producer Ichiro Hazama. He suggested partnering with a company known for action games. For this reason, Square Enix chose developer CyberConnect2 to make the game. They chose them because the developer company's staff had a close relationship with character designer Tetsuya Nomura, who worked with them on earlier projects. Square Enix designated Hiroshi Matsuyama of CyberConnect2 as the game's director with oversight by Square Enix executive producer Yoshinori Kitase. Nomura became the creative director, and in this role, he created a new design for Cloud Strife. The initial plans were for G-Bike to be the first in a series of mobile games based on the minigames of Final Fantasy VII. Of the title's several minigames, G-Bike was decided upon because of its popularity. In order to expand upon it, new gameplay was developed, such as weapon modifications and new forms of combat. The team decided not to develop an elaborate story around the game because it would necessitate more playable characters. For this reason, Cloud is the only protagonist in G-Bike. Besides the original minigame, another inspiration for G-Bikes development was the 2005 film Final Fantasy VII Advent Children. In that film, Cloud fights enemies while driving a vehicle named Fenrir, which Hazama thought was \\"very cool, and radical\\", and influences from the title went into the game. During production, CyberConnect2 was given access to production assets from both Advent Children and Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII by Square Enix. That way, the developers' aesthetic matched the software publishers' previous works. Matsumaya described the early submission and evaluation processes with Square Enix's newly-established game screening department as \\"bumpy\\". Matsumaya claimed that he refused to make a mobile game that requires money to enjoy, so they decided to make the game free. During development, the staff felt pressured by the high expectations of Final Fantasy VIIs massive fan base. The staff did, however, express that Nomura and Kitase were supportive during that time. G-Bike was announced in June 2014 by Square Enix. After some initial confusion, Hazama cleared up misconceptions that the game was going to be Final Fantasy VII and stated that it would be its own game. Moreover, while it shared aesthetics with Final Fantasy VII and spin-off series Compilation of Final Fantasy VII, Square Enix stated that the titles are not connected. In an aside during an interview, Matsuyama revealed that he asked Square Enix producer Shinji Hashimoto if he was interested in a Final Fantasy VII remake, but Hashimoto was not. Matsuyama interjected, \\"Well, if G-Bike is released and becomes a hit, let's make a Final Fantasy VII [remake]\\". Square Enix released the game's first trailer in September 2014. Players who registered early for the game received a \\"Comet Materia\\" in-game item as a bonus. G-Bike was released in Japan on October 30, 2014. The game was released for free with in-app purchases. At release, G-Bike had problems downloading to players' devices. While technically available, a glitch disrupted the games service until November 1. In June 2014, Square Enix stated that the game would be released in Western regions. However, they later canceled it for unspecified reasons. Pocky maker Glico launched a special event to promote the game, and created collectible cards for the occasion. In September 2015, Square Enix announced they would shut down G-Bike, but gave instructions to help gamers keep playing if they had already downloaded it. Reception G-Bike received mixed reviews from critics. Japanese website AppGet praised the title as a quality remaking of the original minigame and its original aesthetic. Ishaan Sahdev of Siliconera praised the game for its graphics, which he called \\"gorgeous\\". Toshi Nakamura of Kotaku was optimistic about the game's announcement and thought the game's trailer looked appealing. He believed that it could lead to the release of other possible remakes from Square Enix. Kyle Hilliard of Game Informer concluded that fans would not be upset that Square Enix announced G-Bikes release instead of Final Fantasy VII Remake. Some critics were displeased and bewildered by the game's announcement. Jason Schreier of Kotaku claimed that the initial public reaction was general surprise upon hearing Square Enix was announcing a new minigame. Mike Wehner of Engadget pronounced that people would be disappointed that Square Enix was not ready with the Final Fantasy VII Remake. Nikola Suprak of Hardcore Gamer went so far as to call the developers \\"trolls\\" for even working on a minigame with the main Final Fantasy remake unfinished. Hidetsugu Naya of AppGet had more typical criticisms and noted the frequent load times and the many hours of gameplay required to unlock supporting characters. In retrospect, Kat Bailey of USGamer stated that because Square Enix has not localized the game into English, the title would stay obscure as most players will never hear about it.

After the recognition of sovereignty, the capital of Indonesia was moved to Jakarta. In accordance with this, the Yogyakarta Agrarian Committee was dissolved, and on 19 March 1952, the new committee, the Jakarta Agrarian Committee, was formed.

The PPKNST main task was to dissolve the parliament and the departments of the State of East Sumatra and transfer the power peacefully from the State of East Sumatra to the Republic of Indonesia, while the P4SU main task was to form the province of North Sumatra. His appointment as chairman was taking into the consideration that the region of North Sumatra was ethnically diverse. The government appointed a Javanese as a middle ground for the issue. On 20 July 1950, the PPKNST announced its program. In the program, the PPKNST stated that the State of East Sumatra would be transformed into a residency without any autonomy, while its regencies would be an autonomous region and directly controlled by the provincial government. On 23 July 1950, the Government of East Sumatra, represented by Raja Kaliamsyah Sinaga, officially responded to the program. The government of East Sumatra opposed the transformation of the state into a residency, and instead opted for the transformation into a province.

The radio station broadcasts worldwide, via RadioPlayer, TuneIn, Radio Garden and iTunes, as well as on DAB+ Digital Radio in the Portsmouth and Norwich areas of England. Skylab Radio is owned and operated by Skylab Radio Limited - a private company limited by guarantee. Background The name 'Skylab Radio' was first used in 2009, during internet radio tests on behalf of a community radio station in Lancashire. In December 2011; Skylab Radio recommenced as an internet radio station, initially utilising the Live365 network, but later moved onto the Shoutcast platform. They were also included within the iTunes, Wunder Radio, Pure Lounge and TuneIn internet radio directories. The station was inspired by the original 'Chill' digital radio station, Jazz FM's HedKandi:The Broadcast and Claire Anderson's Late Lounge, along with The Big Chill. Although the station is cloud-based, with no physical studio presence; Skylab Radio has been connected with the North West of England since its origins. Skylab Radio is named after the NASA Space Stations called Skylab, which signified an example of 'experimentation and innovation'. Playlist Skylab Radio is a music-driven radio station playing chillout, lounge, ambient, downtempo and soft house music, whose output consists primarily of non-stop music, interspersed with voiced announcements and identification. Alexander Copley, writing for digital radio manufacturer - Pure's blog described Skylab Radio as like the musical equivalent of a comforting cup of herbal tea, de-stress and embrace your creativity with an eclectic playlist that covers chillout, lounge, downtempo, ambient and Balearic beats. Chillout music has no exact definition, according to Jody Rosen writing for Slate Magazine, suggesting chillout may well be the most elastic category of them all, encompassing virtually any moderately laid-back music you can name. However Skylab Radio's playlist consists of artists who are primarily associated with chillout, downtempo, balearic beat, or triphop for instance, alongside contemporary artists who are known within other musical genres. The core artists played on Skylab Radio include; 4hero, Air, Aphex Twin, Blank & Jones, Boards of Canada, Brian Eno, Chicane, Chris Coco, Cocteau Twins, deadmau5, DJ Shadow, Goldfrapp, Groove Armada, I Am Kloot, José Padilla, Kaskade, Late Night Alumni, Massive Attack, Moby, Nick Drake, Nightmares on Wax, Nitin Sawhney, Nouvelle Vague, Ólafur Arnalds, Portishead, Rae & Christian, Röyksopp, Sia Furler, The Orb, Thievery Corporation, Tricky and Zero 7. According to Online Radiobox; Skylab Radio's music policy also incorporates a significant number of unsigned and self-publishing producers. However this has a direct correlation with Katy Jay's programming on Skylab Radio, which has encouraged considerable input from independent artists. Waterford-Based Musician and Producer - Micko Roche joined the station in July 2020, presenting a show called 'Balearica'. The radio station initially gained a following due to the unconventional use of 1970s and 1980s MOR or soft rock format radio jingles, despite playing no music from either format. JAM Creative Productions of Dallas, United States reproduced some of their back- catalogue jingles for Skylab Radio, which were re-sung to reflect the stations contemporary straplines and positioning statements. David Lloyd (Broadcaster and Radio Historian) said that a programmer should understand how they (jingles) are best used, so that they deliver the station name and enhance the flow, without clashing with the surrounding elements. Whilst the jingles can appear to be unconventional, their use on Skylab Radio as a form of identification and as junctions between various music segments are conventional in comparison. Another important aspect of Skylab Radio's on-air identity is the use of a single station voice providing a cohesion between the various elements, such as jingles, music or programming aspects, utilising voice actor - Victoria Shotton-Oza. DAB Digital Radio In April 2017; Skylab Radio started contributing regular programming to Folder Media's new DAB digital radio station - Upload Radio, whose purpose was to broadcast user generated programming. Following the closure of Upload Radio in June 2018; Skylab Radio obtained a Digital Sound Programme (DSP) Licence from Ofcom, after confirmation of carriage on Angel Radio's 'Solent Wireless' multiplex. This multiplex serves Portsmouth and the surrounding areas of Hampshire, and was initially established as part of Ofcom's 'Small-Scale DAB' trials. The radio station commenced broadcasting on the Portsmouth 'Small-Scale DAB' multiplex on 9 August 2018, utilising the DAB+ audio standard. Skylab Radio was also added onto the RadioPlayer technology platform, and the Future Radio Norfolk small-scale trial DAB multiplex in Norwich on 26 January 2019, again utilising the DAB+ audio standard. Skylab Radio's owner was cited by Ofcom, crediting small-scale DAB with an overall growth in listeners. Inclusion on the Portsmouth multiplex was a good decision as far as we were concerned, we noticed that listenership and overall interest in Skylab increased. During 2019; Skylab Radio was included in Nation Broadcasting's application to establish a local DAB multiplex in the Channel Islands. Nation Broadcasting was subsequently awarded the licence by Ofcom, on 31 October 2019. Programming Much of Skylab Radio's output is automated, with regular voiced announcements by Neal Bowden, Tom Green and Ann Marie Walsh.Skylab Radio Meet the Team - Retrieved 19 May 2020Media.Info Stations Directory - Skylab radio - Retrieved 19 May 2020 However the station introduced presenter- led late-night programming from Saturday to Monday, presented by Neal Bowden, Sarah Hall, Micko Roche, Katy Jay and Paul Teague.Skylab Radio Schedule - Retrieved 01 July 2020 See also * Chill-out music * Digital radio in the United Kingdom * List of Internet radio stations * List of radio stations in the United Kingdom * Radio in the United Kingdom  References External links * Station website *Media.Info Skylab Radio Profile Category:Radio stations in Hampshire Category:Radio stations in Manchester Category:Radio stations in Norfolk ","title":"Skylab Radio"},{"id":"64004256","text":"Sangwan Foengdee (born 9 July 1951) is a Thai diver.

Catalunya-VallbonaDeLesMonges It was declared a National Monument by Royal Order on 3 June 1931. Built between the 12th and 14th centuries, it is of Romanesque style with much of it already done in Gothic architecture. It is the most important female Cistercian monastery in Catalonia and together with the monastery of Poblet and the monastery of Santes Creus it forms part of the Cistercian Route. Catalunya en Miniatura-Monestir de Vallbona de les Monges  Foundation and origins  From a primitive group of mixed anchorites, founded in the year 1153 by Ramon de Vallbona under the rule of St. Benedict, in 1175 only a female community remained in the place that decided to take advantage of the Cistercian observance. They counted for their establishment with the land given for this purpose in 1163 by the Count of Barcelona Ramon Berenguer IV. To lead the community, the following year its first abbess was incorporated from the Monastery of Santa Maria de la Caridad in Tulebras (Navarra): Oria Ramirez (1176-1180). The monastery soon acquired a great reputation and attracted to its bosom ladies of the Catalan nobility. It also gained royal favour, demonstrated by visits from Alfonso II the Chaste and his wife Sancha de Castilla or Jaime I the Conqueror, who not only stayed in the monastery on repeated occasions but also sponsored its construction. From Pope Innocent III he received in 1198 and 1200 the immunity and protection of goods and a bull granted by the same pope in 1201 that regulated the enclosure and ensured its independence from the episcopate. Thanks to the numerous properties received through donations and wills, among them that of Count Ermengol VII himself, the great dominion of the monastery was formed between the 12th and 13th centuries, especially in the County of Urgel. Legal recognition was achieved under the mandate of Abbess Saurena of Anglesola (1379-1392), who bought from King Peter III of Aragon the civil and criminal jurisdiction of all the monastery's possessions for 22. 000 Barcelona salaries, these acquisitions allowed the establishment of the barony of Vallbona and made the monastery the centre of political and legal life for all the towns and districts that made it up. At this time, the community was made up of 150 nuns, most of whom belonged to the Catalan nobility, such as the Cardona, Cervera, Queralt, Boixadors, Anglesola, etc.  Decline and resurgence  The civil war of 1462-1472 and later the Council of Trent (1545-1563) had a notable repercussion on the abbey: one of its agreements prohibited the existence of female communities in unpopulated places, which forced the nuns in 1573 to cede part of their lands to people from other places, mainly inhabitants of Montesquiu, so that they could settle in their surroundings and thus create a population nucleus that derived in the current Vallbona de las Monjas. For the foundation of this town, the whole series of external buildings that the monastery had were fitted out, similar to those that still remain in Poblet or Santes Creus, so that only the strictly monastic premises remain in this monastery, apart from the church and the cloister. The following times were not superb, in the 17th century he had disputes with his order, mainly with Santa Maria de Poblet, the tributes they had to pay left their economy in a bad place that joined the ravages caused by the Reapers' War (1640-1652), followed by the Succession Wars (1705-1717) and the Roussillon War (1788-1795), They had numerous disputes with the towns belonging to their barony, because of Mendizábal's disentailment and the Exclaustration. They were absent from the monastery for six months so that they could continue monastic life and did not suffer as much damage as the monasteries of Poblet or Santes Creus. Today the monastery still houses a community of Cistercian nuns as it has done uninterruptedly since its foundation, with the sole exception of the period of the Spanish Civil War. With the new works carried out, some rooms have been fitted out for accommodation service which, together with ceramic works, word processing and computer music scores and tourist visits to the monastery, represent a good source of income for the community. = Desk = Its library together with the scriptorium achieved great fame. Fourteen codices from the 13th century are copied and illustrated by the old nuns and are kept in the archive with numerous old documents of great interest for regional and national historiography. Relevant was its pharmacy, which supplied all the villages of the barony with documentation from the 15th century.  Building  The Church, built between the 12th and 14th centuries, that is, in the transition from the Romanesque to the Gothic, has a Latin cross plan with only one nave and four sections up to the transept; this one is very long but narrower than the nave, so it gives rise to a rectangular transept that is covered with an octagonal dome that rests on trumpets whose construction is dated in the 13th century. In the two arms of the transept there are two square apse chapels. The main apse at the head of the nave is also quadrangular and smooth. The temple is covered with a gothic ribbed vault and the apses and transept with barrel vaults. VallbonaPuertasIglesia The octagonal-shaped bell tower, which rises like a second dome over the second section of the nave, is remarkable. It is markedly Gothic and has a surprising originality and architectural audacity, as it is directly supported by the side walls, and was built during the mandate of Abbess Elisenda de Copons between 1340 and 1348 (sister of the Abbot of Poblet Copons). In the presbytery, on the right side of the altar, there is the tomb of Violante de Hungría wife of Jaime I, who died in 1251 in the monastery of Salas de Huesca, but it was moved to the monastery in 1275 and it is the date of the inscription of her sarcophagus, which she arranged, Due to the prestige achieved by the monastery, his remains were laid to rest in it and on the other side that of the daughter of both, Sancha de Aragon, who died in the Holy Land and was transferred to the monastery, her sarcophagus is on three inverted columns \\"to the funeral\\" as a sign of mourning. Vallbona Nau In the southern abyssle there is a tomb belonging to Ferrer Alamany de Toralla, who died in 1360, and his wife Beatriz de Guimerà, the image of him on the lid dressed as a gentleman with heraldry at his level and the figure of her on one side in the Cistercian habit. At the bottom of the wall there is a representation of two angels carrying the souls of the dead to heaven. Tomb of Violant d'Hongria To the right of the choir is the chapel of Corpus Christi, where there is an image of Saint Mary in polychrome stone, the work of Guillem Seguer. From the altar of this chapel, two anti- fires from the 14th century are preserved in the National Art Museum of Catalonia. A gate separates the nave from the transept and the head of the temple.  Gates  The main door, located on the north arm of the transept and facing the Plaza Mayor, has a semicircular arch with five archivolts supported on columns with capitals with plant reliefs similar to the east gallery of the cloister and a carved tympanum with a figure of the Virgin and Child blessing with her right hand, surrounded by angels. Above it there is a cornice with a frieze of blind arcades with corbels sculpted with various motifs. Vallbona Monges-Claustre In the north wall there is a door that would lead to the third section of the nave, which is closed and obstructed by a sarcophagus inside its arch as an arcosolium and on which there is a Trinitarian chrismonium from the end of the 12th century. In total, there are five sarcophagi on this wall, four Romanesque ones from the 13th century and one Gothic one, in all of them heraldic symbols can be seen and in two of them the names of the recumbents can be read: Sibil-la de Guimerà, wife of Guerau Alamany, and the other, Miquela Sasala, from 1244.  The cloister  The cloister forms a quadrilateral with unequal sides and corresponds to different periods and constructive forms that took place between the 12th and 15th centuries. Access is through the door located in the middle of the nave of the church, which coincides with the gallery on the east side. The vaults throughout the cloister are ribbed. The south wing is the oldest part corresponding to the 12th century; it is executed according to the austere Cistercian canons in Romanesque style, and consists of three sections formed by three pillars and between these, three semicircular arches supported by pairs of columns with totally smooth capitals. The east wing is also Romanesque from the first half of the 13th century, consisting of five sections divided by four pillars, under pointed arches and eight-spoke rosettes that join in the centre with an Islamic design, triple semicircular arches are grouped together on pairs of columns and capitals, already with sculpted plant motifs. The northern wing, the shortest, is made up of two large ogival-shaped openings of typically Gothic tracery and was made during the 14th century. The west wing, the most recent, is already Renaissance, although it takes up the former Romanesque forms and was built by the abbesses of the Caldés family in the 15th century. The capitals of the columns show the heraldry of these abbesses. Around the cloister other rooms are developed, among which the chapter house could not miss its access is from the northeast corner of the cloister through a Gothic door commanded by the abbess Anglesola in the fourteenth century, is covered with a gothic ribbed vault, on its floor are several tombstones of the former abbesses of the community, presiding over this room is the image of the Virgin of Mercy, made of alabaster and attributed to the sculptor Père Johan. In the east side of the cloister, where there is an entrance, is the chapel from 1895 that holds the Virgin of the Cloister, a magnificent Romanesque stone carving from the 13th century. There is also another entrance to the transept of the church,  Reforms  In 1986, the Department of Culture of the Generalitat de Catalunya commissioned the architect Llorens i Perelló to restore the buildings and to construct a new building for the nuns' cells and work rooms. These works were resumed in 1997.

The episode was written by Charlie Day, Sonny Lee, and Patrick Walsh, and directed by Matt Shakman. In the episode, Mac, Charlie, and Dennis team up to solve the gas crisis through purchasing gasoline while Frank and Dee attempt to spy on Bruce Mathis. Plot Due to increasing electricity costs, Charlie reveals to Mac and Dennis that he has been using a gas generator to power Paddy's Pub. An argument over the cost of gasoline and the group's individual roles leads to Mac, the self-proclaimed \\"brains of the organization\\", proposing a plan to solve the gas crisis: purchase gasoline through a bank loan, store it in Paddy's basement, then sell it a year later at a higher price. The three are turned down by the bank, however, when they can't agree on who will seduce the female bank teller. They proceed to get their funding by stealing Dee's life savings from her sock drawer. They head to a gas station and began pumping gasoline into barrels, but are stopped by the gas station attendant. They then transport gas through Dennis's car and have Charlie siphon it out, but the strategy proves to be ineffective. An attempt to sell the gas back to the gas station fails, so they set up a stand next to the station. However, it comes to a halt when Mac suffers a burn due to Charlie accidentally spitting a fireball onto him in an attempt to attract customers. Mac is forced to have a towel duct-taped over his head to cover the injury, and Dennis takes the lead in the scheme. Meanwhile, Frank and Dee discover that Bruce Mathis, Dennis and Dee's biological father, is giving part of Barbara Reynolds's money away to a Muslim community center. Furious at Bruce's action, Frank purchases a \\"rape van\\" to spy on Bruce at his apartment, thinking that he would find evidence that Bruce's donation was a deal with terrorists. Frank and Dee then break into the apartment and plant baby monitors and fertilizers. While the two were scouting outside of Bruce's apartment, Mac steals the van and crashes into a car that Dee previously hit. Charlie, Dennis, and Mac then use the van to store the gasoline and sell them from door-to-door. However, Charlie's character of a Texan oilman scares a householder and leads to her calling the police, causing the three to flee in response. Back at the bar, Frank, thinking that Dee set him up, waterboards her with the men's room urinal. Mac, Charlie, and Dennis then enter, revealing that they stole the van. Mac then realizes that the paradigm of the group was off because Frank and Dee weren't included. The gang then decides to combine their schemes together: they will torture Bruce into confessing being a terrorist collaborator, turn him to the authorities, and use the reward money to purchase gas. However, en route to the apartment, Charlie, playing his role as the \\"wild card\\" of the group, reveals he cut the van's brakes and jumps out. The remaining gang members panic and jump out as well. The free-wheeling van full of gasoline then crashes into the car the gang previously hit and destroys it. The car's owner, the occupant of the apartment thought to be Bruce's, runs out to witness the destruction of his car. Upon seeing the man, the gang realizes that they were onto the wrong person and run away from the scene. Reception The episode received positive reviews from critics. Donna Bowman of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A- rating, saying the episode played its strengths by \\"using pop culture conventions to provide a jumping-off point for meta-riffs on their implausibility.\\" In 2015, the episode was ranked by Rolling Stone as the fifth best It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia episode.

After the war, he joined the real estate firm known then as Brown, Wheelock, Harris & Stevens in New York. He then founded Collins-Tuttle with Arthur Collins in 1954.

Tuttle seized the opportunity that arose out of Paris' growing need for urban development and decided to use American building expertise to help construct a modern landmark, stating at the time that \\"Paris needs a skyscraper and the competition here isn't as strong.\\" Tuttle and his associate, Herbert Papock, eventually enlisted a consortium of 17 French insurance companies and seven banks in the $140-million multiple-building project that became known as the Tour Montparnasse. The financing was led by French industrialist Jean-Claude Aaron. After the complex was finished, Tuttle turned over the management to his French partners.

Following Georgia's independence, Sakvarelidze became a prominent figure in Georgian theatre. It was then he founded the Caucasian Theatre/Lab to develop new writers in the creative industry. His work in Georgia attracted international attention with The Times referring to him as \\"At 28 […] already the godfather of an emerging generation of artists.\\" Such attention led to invitations to work at English National Opera in London; at the New York Theatre Workshop, where he directed James Pinkowski's Mint Juleps as part of his residency, and at Milan's Piccolo Teatro (Milan). While in Milan he wrote a thesis on the future of theatre and opera in Georgia and the need to implement new working methods that would banish the old Soviet style of management and training. He advocated for the adoption of contemporary practices for culture to be improved in Georgia. This was sent by the Italian Ambassador in Georgia to members of the Georgian government who endorsed his proposals and appointed him General Director of the Georgian National Opera Theater. In 2017, Sakvarelidze founded the Tsinandali Festival. In his role as General Director he helped found the Pan Caucasian Youth Orchestra, bringing young musicians from across the Caucasian region together. Sakvarelidze also serves as artistic director of the Sokhumi State Drama Theatre, which consists of refugees.

Education  Ball received his B.A. in psychology from Columbia University in 1977 and holds a Ph.D. in psychobiology from the Institute of Animal Behavior at Rutgers University (1983). He completed his postdoctoral research in comparative neuroendocrinology and ethology at Rockefeller University.  Research  Ball's research focuses on the interrelation of hormones, brain, and animal behavior, specifically how hormones and the external environment result in the production of social behaviors and changes to neural biology. The Ball lab works with a variety of avian species that exhibit a high degree of neuroplasticity in response to hormone treatment, which allows for the study both of how hormones modulate learned behaviors and of how behaviors affect endocrine activity, thus leading to changes in social behavior. The author of over 200 scholarly publications, Ball's research continues to be supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health.  Administrative career  Before becoming Dean of the College of Behavioral and Social Sciences at the University of Maryland in 2014, Ball was the Vice Dean for Science and Research Infrastructure in the Krieger School of Arts and Sciences at Johns Hopkins University, where he was also faculty in the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences and the director of the undergraduate program in neuroscience, with joint appointments in the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Division of Reproductive Biology at the Bloomberg School of Public Health, and in the Department of Neuroscience at the School of Medicine. From 2008 to 2010, Ball served as the Dean of Research and Graduate Education in the JHU School of Arts and Sciences. About the addition of higher education administration to his research portfolio, Ball notes, \\"Ever since middle school, I’ve wanted to make a living from the life of the mind. At this stage of my career, I’m most interested in shaping an institution of higher learning. I believe that strong universities are an important part of the health and the future of the United States.\\"  Honors and Awards  The JHU Student Council awarded Ball with the George E.

The Bavaria (female personification of the Bavarian homeland) was designed by Wagner. Wagners Tombstone on the Teutonic Cemetery in Rome Johann Martin von Wagner (born 24 June 1777 as Johann Martin Wagner; died 8 August 1858) was a German painter, sculptor and art collector. Through the donation of his extensive art collection the Martin von Wagner Museum of the University of Würzburg, named after him, became one of the largest university museums in Europe. Biography Johann Martin Wagner was born in Würzburg in 1777 as the son of the court sculptor Johann Peter Wagner. After attending grammar school, he became a student with his father at the age of 19. Between 1797 and 1802 he studied painting in Vienna and Paris. In 1802 he received a prize for Aeneas asks Venus for the way to Carthage. In 1803 he took part in a competition of the Weimar friends of art (to which Johann Wolfgang von Goethe also belonged). The theme was Ulysses appeases Polyphemus through wine. Wagner won the prize of 60 ducats and thanks to Goethe's intercession he was appointed professor of drawing arts at the University of Würzburg. He was also offered a two-year study visit in Italy.Meusel, Johann Georg. In Rome, Wagner was first employed as a drawing teacher in the house of Wilhelm von Humboldt, then Prussian envoy to Italy. Instead of two, Wagner stayed four years and returned to Italy several times during his life. On the return journey from his first stay in Italy, he met the Bavarian Crown Prince Ludwig in Innsbruck. Two years later became his art agent and art advisor. In this function he travelled to Italy again. Wagner worked for Ludwig for almost 40 years. Among other things he advised him on the establishment of the Munich Glyptothek and arranged the purchase of the Barberini Faun and the gable figures from the Temple of Aphaea at Aegina. In 1823 the king appointed him secretary general of the Munich art academy.Andresen, Andreas. Wagner himself increasingly moved from painting to sculpture, but had less and less time for his own artistic work. Meanwhile Wagner had become such an important advisor to King Ludwig that he ennobled him in 1825 – from then on he was called von Wagner. On behalf of the king he created an extensive relief frieze for the interior of the WalhallaBrockhaus, F. A.. : The Germanic procession from the Caucasus to Central Europe. The frieze is Wagner's largest sculptural work. From 1831 von Wagner lived in the Villa Malta in Rome. In 1841, the King appointed him Central Gallery Director of the Munich Pinakothek, but Wagner immediately asked for his resignation from this post as he did not want to leave Rome. In 1857 Martin von Wagner was made an honorary citizen of Würzburg for his services to art and science. In December of the same year, he donated his entire art collection to the University of Würzburg. Since 1963, the university collection exhibited in the Würzburg Residenz has therefore been named after Wagner – the Martin von Wagner Museum. Wagner died in Rome on August 8, 1858 and was buried in the Teutonic Cemetery.

These works borrow from exotic and classical traditions, often depicting landscape and water subjects, including whirling vessels, fountains, waterfalls, whirlpools and streams (e.g., Pots at the Falls, 1982 or Fire of the Falls, 1983). Art in America's David Rubin and others highlight the imagery's abstraction and ambiguity, which encourages multiple symbolic readings suggesting female, orgasmic, life-giving, or uncontrollable forces in the self and universe.Liss, Andrea. \\"Uses of The Past,\\" Artweek, 1986. After moving to New York in 1985, Simonian shifted toward more reflective, urban meditations that express feelings and observations—romance, decadence and shabbiness, modernist claustrophobia—about her environment rather than illustrate it.Muchnic, Suzanne. \\"Galleries: Wilshire Center”, Los Angeles Times, April 25, 1986.

They maintain Simonian's mixed-media approach, often using mosaic tiles to further dualities between interior and exterior (e.g., El Capitan), decorative and pictorial, and abstract and illusionistic; critics compare the effect to Mondrian’s transformation of natural imagery into patterns of squares and Bonnard's collapse of indoor and outdoor. Judith Simonian, Red Coliseum, watercolor, acrylic, collage on canvas, 42\\" x 60\\", 2005. For a 1994 conceptual show at Ovsey Gallery, Simonian turned to the human figure. She recreated Balthus's controversial paintings of young girls on the flip sides of white panels with peepholes that she suspended several feet in front of mirrored walls; visitors peering through found the girls' faces replaced with their own, implicating them as voyeur and viewed object, fantasist and victim.Kandel, Susan. \\"Gender Talk\\", Los Angeles Times, March 11, 1994. Retrieved April 14, 2020. Los Angeles Times critic Susan Kandel called it a deft reversal of gendered positions that upended critical commonplaces about the male gaze. In later series, Simonian drew on advertising, newspaper and snapshot images to piece together large-scale, fragmented portraits textured by washes and aggressive mark-making, that play individuality against a composite or fractured sense of selfhood.Cotter, Holland. \\"For Hikers Seeking Art, Brooklyn Is a Left Bank\\", The New York Times, December 15, 2000.

Critics note this work for its mix of incongruous subjects and disparate styles, sense of light and space, and palpable atmosphere, captured efficiently in loose, shorthand-like brushwork, saturated watercolor washes and built up surfaces.Maine, Stephen. \\"What Belongs Where,\\" Judith Simonian, New York: Edward Thorp Gallery, 2011. Reviewing Simonian's suite of watercolor collages, \\"Chronic Civilization\\" (Janet Kurnatowski, 2006), Shane McAdams highlighted Red Coliseum for its foregrounded, gauzy paper strips opening like windows into vague space and its vertical swaths of wet scarlet and lavender, which he compared to Morris Louis \\"Veil\\" paintings. Deborah Garwood singled out the claustrophobic ambiance of Deep Purple Space for its dense play of gesture, stenciling, texture and shadow. Judith Simonian, Snow Cone, acrylic on canvas, 46\\" x 64\\", 2014. Writers contend that Simonian's later work ventures into more ambitious territory, broadly mixing imagery, styles and approaches in spatial conundrums that push pictorial space and cognition to near-collapse. In these paintings, she delves further into montage (literal and painted), knitting together abstract passages, still lifes, domestic interiors, structures and travel scenes with dissolving, shifting boundaries.Butler, Sharon. \\"A Day in New York\\", Two Coats of Paint, May 20, 2013.

For example, Mountain with Flags (2012), Ski Lift (2013) and Ferry Boat (2018) feature curtains of color slathered over idyllic landscapes punctured by breaks, holes, ruptures or collaged shards; Huffington Post suggests that the disjunctures of natural and man-made, sublime and banal invite uneasy thoughts about hubris and romantic idealism, spiritual tourism and ecological degradation. In her 2015 show, '\\"Foreign Bodies,\\" the painting Lounge Chairs (2014) demonstrates Simonian's simultaneously embodiment of abstraction and illusion; it evokes a humid environment of plant life and water through an economy of marks and swaths of color. The larger Snow Cone (2014) blends coherent space and spatial disruption, juxtaposing a central frosted cake wedge, a bright, rough-textured yellow background casting an optical-illusion shadow, and punning allusions to collage strategies (\\"slice,\\" \\"layers\\").Humphrey, David and Jennifer Coates. \\"Search Party,\\" Judith Simonian, Foreign Bodies, New York: Edward Thorp Gallery, 2015.

Mikhaylov became a junior officer during World War I and was captured by Bulgarian troops in early 1917. Returning to Russia on the end of the war, he was drafted into the Red Army and served in the suppression of the Kronstadt rebellion and the East Karelian uprising. He held command and staff positions between the wars and on the outbreak of Operation Barbarossa commanded the 161st Rifle Division in Belarus. Mikhaylov led the division in the Battle of Smolensk, but was relieved of command in late August. Serving in an army headquarters position, he was killed in the Vyazma pocket later that year.  Early life, World War I, and Russian Civil War  Mikhaylov was born on 4 October 1895 in the village of Okhotino, Tumanovsky volost, Smolensk Governorate. Mobilized into the Imperial Russian Army in August 1915 during World War I, he was sent to the Northwestern Front, where he became a private in the 2nd Reserve Regiment. In November he was transferred to the 176th Infantry Regiment before studying at the Pskov School of Ensigns from March to June 1916. After graduating from the school with the rank of ensign, Mikhaylov returned to the 176th Regiment and served as a junior officer and company commander. In October he was sent to the Romanian Front, where he commanded a company of the 37th Siberian Rifle Regiment. In January 1917, during the retreat from Dobruja, Mikhaylov was wounded and concussed in battle at Măcin, being taken prisoner by Bulgarian soldiers. Held in prisoner of war camps in Sofia and Orhanie, Mikhaylov was released when the war ended and returned to Russia in December 1918, being invalided out of service. During the Russian Civil War, he was drafted into the Red Army in Petrograd in August 1919 and appointed a company commander in the 10th Reserve Regiment of the Northwestern Front. He commanded a march battalion of the front from September 1920, and in December became a company commander in the 96th Rifle Regiment of the 32nd Brigade of the 11th Rifle Division. With the division, he fought in the suppression of the Kronstadt rebellion, receiving a silver watch for capturing a battery. From May 1921 he served as an assistant battalion commander of the divisional training regiment. Mikhaylov and his unit subsequently participated in the suppression of the East Karelian uprising between December 1921 and March 1922. For capturing the Volazminsky factory, he was awarded the Order of the Red Banner, in addition to the To the Valiant Soldier of the Karelian Front badge for participating in the operation.  Interwar period  In the interwar period Mikhaylov served with the 33rd Rifle Regiment, formed from the training regiment of the 11th Rifle Division, stationed in the Leningrad Military District, from June 1922 as a company commander, assistant battalion commander, battalion commander and as assistant regimental commander for supply. After completing the Vystrel course between November 1929 and January 1930, he was appointed assistant commander for personnel of the 30th Rifle Regiment of the 10th Rifle Division. Mikhaylov was transferred to the North Caucasus Military District in October 1930, successively serving as chief of the 7th, 8th, and 10th departments of the district staff. He became a colonel in 1935 when the Red Army introduced personal military ranks. In May 1936 Mikhaylov was appointed commander of the 37th Rifle Regiment of the 13th Rifle Division, stationed in the Belorussian Special Military District. He retook the Vystrel course beginning in November 1937 and graduated with honors in August 1938, returning to the district to serve as chief of staff of the 2nd Belorussian Rifle Division. With the latter he participated in the Soviet invasion of Poland. From July 1940 Mikhaylov commanded the newly formed 161st Rifle Division of the Western Special Military District (the former Belorussian Special Military District) in Mogilev.  World War II  Just before the war began, Mikhaylov told district commander Army General Dmitry Pavlov that the division was not combat ready as it lacked motor vehicles and its anti-aircraft artillery had a shell shortage, but was dismissed with the response \\"if you have no shells, you will fight with your teeth and fists\\". When Operation Barbarossa began on 22 June 1941, he commanded the division as part of the 2nd Rifle Corps of the 13th, then the 20th Armies of the Western Front in heavy defensive battles on the Minsk- Moscow Highway and the Battle of Smolensk. In late July the 161st was withdrawn to the Gzhatsk area for rebuilding, and on 6 August with the 20th Army was sent into combat in the Yelnya area to fight in the battles to eliminate the German salient there. On 20 August, Mikhaylov was relieved of command for being \\"unable to control fighting in modern conditions.\\" The division commissar and chief of staff were also dismissed from their positions. He became chief of the army personnel department. With the 20th Army, he was trapped in the Vyazma pocket in October, and was killed in action there.

The EU manages the European Economic and Trade Office in Taipei, while the ROC operates the Taipei Representative Office in the EU and Belgium in Brussels.

Back in 2001, the EU Commission referred Taiwan as a \\"separate customs territory, but not as a sovereign state\\", highlighting the role of Taiwan as autonomous economic entity for the purposes of the establishment of relations with the European Union.

The works were completed in 1981 and permanently installed on the walls of the House of Representatives' chambers at the Washington State Capitol in Olympia; the building was designed in the 1920s to accommodate murals, but they were not funded until the 1970s. The \\"stark, black-and-white, modernistic\\" paintings depict \\"the mythic tasks performed by the Greek hero Hercules\\". The murals were covered by the state government a few weeks after their initial installation by plywood sheets behind a curtain pending their removal after a 1982 House vote, when some lawmakers objected to their content, perceived by some as sexually suggestive. The murals were separated from the House chamber walls in 1993 and put in storage. The dispute between the state legislature and the artist, becoming a lawsuit for breach of contract against the state, gained note in art and legal journals, and law reference books; the Columbia Law School's Journal of Law & the Arts called it \\"striking example of suppression of artistic freedom\\". The Seattle Art Museum said the question of Spafford's artistic freedom became \\"a state-wide debate\\". The murals were eventually acquired by Centralia College in 2002 following a decade of negotiations with the artist, and installed in the college's Corbet Theatre. They were put on display on October, 2003 following a symposium on \\"the legal, ethical and emotional issues\\" surrounding their history. The history of the Spafford murals and another set by Alden Mason removed from the capitol in 1987, is documented in From Capitol to Campus: The Alden Mason and Michael Spafford Murals.  Description of the Murals and their History  Spafford won the commission for four murals to be installed in the Washington State Legislature's House chambers in the Capitol Building in Olympia. Spafford selected the twelve labors of Hercules as the them, which he felt was an appropriate trope \\"for the conflicts and Challenges of lawmaking.\\" Spafford \\"couldn't see any reason why it would be considered inappropriate.\\" The twelve labors were to be depicted on two half circular murals facing each other across the legislative champbers. A third mural would be a large Chimera, breathing fire, on the rear wall facing the speaker of the house. A version of Icarus, providing a theme of hubris, would be above and behind the speaker's podium. The initial proposal was selected by a jury including architects, arts educators and art patrons from a very competitive proposal process. Spafford made a point during the jury process that some people considered his themes controversial and it was clear during the proposal process that the themes involved illustrated a critique of the legislative process. Spafford was awarded the commission in September 1980 along with a set of two murals by another University of Washington professor, Alden Mason (1919-2013) for the Senate chambers. Both artists displayed drawings and specific plans for their proposals during a reception in Olympia. No legislators attended. Spafford's set of two Hercules labors murals with six labors on each wall were installed in the House chambers in July 1981. They caused an immediate uproar which exposed many aspects of how the legislature paid attention to business. After months of debate, the Washington State House voted to drape the murals, completely covering them up and cancelling the remaining two panels. Later a judge awarded Spafford $35,000 for the cancelled murals. The murals were uncovered in 1989, then in 1993 four years later removed entirely and stored, at a cost of $162,200 to Washington State taxpayers--almost double what Spafford was awarded initially to create them. The mural battle eventually lasted for years, including numerous hearings, media coverage, a lawsuit, and taxpayer expense becoming a Pacific Northwest legend of bureaucratic folly. Interestingly, Alden Mason's murals for the Senate had also been removed because \\"they were too abstract for their setting.\\" Thus the Washington State legislature spent close to an estimated half million tax dollars for blank walls. Both the Spafford and Mason completed murals were eventually recovered from storage and installed at the Centralia College in Centralia, Washington, the college installing the Mason murals in its main library in 1991. In 1993 Spafford's Hercules murals were installed in Centralia College's Corbet Theatre, the college's new performing arts center. Spafford refused to attend the unveiling ceremony, stating that he'd rather see the site-specific work destroyed than displayed. Don Frey, Centralia College spokesman, defended the public's right to see the \\"irreplaceable pieces of art.\\" ReferencesFurther reading * Category:1981 establishments in Washington (state) Category:1981 paintings Category:Centralia College Category:Modern paintings Category:Murals in the United States Category:Paintings depicting Heracles Category:Public art in Washington (state) ","title":"The Twelve Labors of Hercules (Spafford)"},{"id":"64005886","text":"The Myanmar coastal rain forests is a tropical moist broadleaf forest ecoregion in Myanmar. The ecoregion occupies Myanmar's coastal lowlands along the Bay of Bengal and Andaman Sea. Geography The Myanmar coastal rain forests occupy the coastal lowlands of Myanmar. It extends from the Naf River, which forms the border between Myanmar and Bangladesh, along the Rakhine coast. It also occupies the lower basins of the Irrawaddy and Sittaung rivers, and the coastal lowlands of Mon State and Tanintharyi Region along the Andaman Sea. In Rakhine it is bounded on the east by the Mizoram-Manipur-Kachin rain forests, which occupy the lower slopes of the Arakan Mountains. In the Irrawaddy and Sittaung basins, the Irrawaddy moist deciduous forests lie inland to the north, while the Irrawaddy freshwater swamp forests occupy the wide Irrawaddy Delta to the south. Further east, the Kayah-Karen montane rain forests and Tenasserim-South Thailand semi-evergreen rain forests cover the eastern mountains, and another enclave of the Irrawaddy moist deciduous forests lies in the lower Salween basin. The Myanmar Coast mangroves fringe the coast and river estuaries.Wikramanayake, Eric; Eric Dinerstein; Colby J. Loucks; et al. (2002). Terrestrial Ecoregions of the Indo-Pacific: a Conservation Assessment. Washington, DC: Island Press. Climate The climate is humid and tropical. Rainfall is highest during the summer, when Southwest monsoon brings moisture-laden air from the Bay of Bengal. Flora The forests are mostly made up of evergreen trees, or semi-evergreen trees which drop some of their leaves during the dry season. Dipterocarps are the predominant trees, and common dipterocarps include Dipterocarpus alatus, D. turbinatus, D. obtusifolius, Anisoptera glabra, Hopea odorata, and Parashorea stellata. Other trees include Swintonia floribunda, Pentace burmanica, Lagerstroemia calyculata, L. floribunda, and L. speciosa. Understory plants include Calamus palms and the creeping bamboo Neohouzeaua helferi. Fauna Large mammals in the ecoregion include tiger (Panthera tigris), Asian elephant (Elephas maximus), Malayan tapir (Tapirus indicus), wild dog (Cuon alpinus), sun bear (Ursus malayanus), clouded leopard (Pardofelis nebulosa), leopard (Panthera pardus), Asian golden cat (Catopuma temmincki), and gaur (Bos gaurus). Habitat loss and poaching have made large mammals scarce. The Sumatran rhinoceros (Dicerorhinus sumatrensis) was once native to the ecoregion, but Myanmar's last rhinoceros was killed in 1984. The Burma pipistrelle (Hypsugo lophurus) is an endemic bat, and the disc-footed bat (Eudiscopus denticulus) is a near-endemic. Over 350 species of birds live in the ecoregion.  Protected areas  A 2017 assessment found that 3,534 km², or 6%, of the ecoregion is in protected areas. About half the unprotected area is still forested.

He was closely connected to Nuri Al- Said and Iraq's last King Faisal II. Jafar served as Minister of Transport, Economy, Finance and later as Minister of Development. He was a cabinet minister from 1947–1958.  Early life and education  Dhia Jafar was born to Jafar Hashem and Kheja al-Astarabadi. His father was a merchant, from a notable family in Al-Kadhimiya, that claim agnatic descent from Musa al-Kadhim through his son Ibrahim al-Mortada Al-Asghar, who was Ruler of Yemen and then of Mecca in the wake of the Third Hijri Century. His mother was the daughter of the renowned merchant Abd al-Hadi al-Astarabadi. His maternal uncle, Mahmoud al-Astarabadi was a member of the senate in the royal era for the city of Kadhimiya. His maternal cousin, Abd al-Saleh al-Killidar, was the custodian of the Imam Husayn shrine. = Education = Jafar grew up in Baghdad and completed his school education there. He then studied English at the American University of Beirut and subsequently obtained a degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Birmingham. He was the first Iraqi to hold a scientific PhD in engineering.  Career  Early career = Returning from his studies in England, Jafar started his career working in different engineering jobs and was eventually tasked with railway engineering and development of the Iraqi railway system. Together with fellow engineers, he founded the Industrial Engineering School in Baghdad, the first industrial school in Iraq. Jafar became friends with Prime Minister Nuri al-Said, after having worked with his son Sabah As-Said. Al-Said supported Jafar and a group of fellow young and well educated men. = Political career = Jafar served as a cabinet minister in Iraq from 1947 to 1958, heading the Ministry of Transport and Works, the Ministry of Economy, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Development.  Minister of Transport and Works  Jafar was appointed as Minister of Transport and Works in March 1947 by Salih Jabr. During his tenure as Minister of Transport and Works, Jafar pushed for the nationalization of technical education and expertise and began negotiations with the British Government and British oil companies.  Minister of Economy  Jafar was appointed as Minister of Economy in the early 1950s and continued to lead the intense oil negotiations on the side of the Iraqi delegation, which lasted for more than three years and resulted in a landmark 50/50 profit-sharing agreement in 1951. Al-Said and Jafar coined the term “Oil of Arabs”.  Minister of Finance  Jafar was appointed as Minister of Finance during the 10th ministry of Nuri al-Said. He held the same position again in the 12th ministry from August 1954 and resigned in December 1955. One of Jafar's main projects as Minister of Finance was the establishment of a gold standard for the Iraqi Dinar, disconnecting the currency from the British Sterling.  Minister of Development and Development Board  During his time as cabinet minister and especially as Minister of Development, Jafar was involved in the architectural and infrastructural advancement, reshaping and reconstruction of Iraq in general and Baghdad in particular. He was a central member of the Development Board, an organization and planning body of decision-makers, technical experts and politicians around Prime Minister Nuri as-Said. The board, which also seated members from the United States and the United Kingdom, was set up in 1950 to strategically invest the resources from the new oil agreement into important long-range development objectives for Iraq and was in tenure until 1958. Following the profit-sharing agreement with Britain, Iraq's income from oil rose from 6.7 million dinars in 1950 to 161.5 million in 1955, out of which 70% were redirected to the Development Board. An architectural “Master Plan for Baghdad” was commissioned by the Development Board in 1954 and presented in 1956. It was consisted of changes to Baghdad's road and bridge system, housing, industry, commerce and a wide range of new buildings, including schools, shops, clinics, car parks, factories and government buildings. Several important buildings and structures were planned and erected in cooperation with known architects like Le Corbusier, Gio Ponti and Frank Lloyd Wright. Prominent projects from the Development Board are the Tharthar Project, inaugurated in 1956, the Habbaniyah Project, the Ramadi Barrage and the Queen Alia Bridge (renamed to Jumhuriya Bridge later), inaugurated in March 1957. From 1957 – 1958, Jafar served as president of the Society of Iraqi Engineers. Jafar was reappointed as Minister of Development in May 1958. At the time of the 1958 Iraqi Military Coup, Jafar was receiving medical treatment in London and subsequently exiled himself in the UK. = Civilian life = Jafar returned to Iraq in 1962, establishing an architectural office in Baghdad.  Personal life  Jafar moved to the emirate of Sharjah in 1969 and later back to London again, where he died in December 1992 during surgery. = Family = Jafar married the daughter of Hamid Khan, a cousin of the Aga Khan who was a government agent in Najaf from 1917, appointed CIE in 1921 and became the first mutassarif (governor) of Karbala during the royal era. Among their children are: * Yahya, a businessman and currently Executive Director of Uruk Group. * Jafar, a scientist and former Vice Chairman of the Iraq Atomic Energy Commission and chief of Iraq's nuclear program and later Co-founder and CEO of Uruk Group. * Hamid, the founder and chairman of the Board of Directors of the Crescent Group, and the chairman of Dana Gas..

He is known for the discovery that sphingolipids have signaling functions.  Early life  Yusuf Awni Hannun was born in Saudi Arabia of Palestinian parents, Mrs. Aida Ashur-Hannun and Dr. Awni Hannun. He received his early education in Beirut at the International College and earned a Bachelor of Science at the American University of Beirut in 1977.. Following his undergraduate degree, Hannun continued at the American University of Beirut, obtaining an MD with distinction in 1981 and completing his internship and a residency in internal medicine  Discovery of Sphingolipid Signaling In 1983, Hannun left Lebanon to take up specialty training at Duke University with a fellowship in hematology and oncology as well as undergoing post- doctoral training in Biochemistry under Professor Robert Bell. It was during this time that Hannun made the initial discovery that protein kinase C was inhibited by sphingosine Yusuf A. Hannun, Carson R. Loomis, Alfred A. Merril Jr, and Robert M. Bell \\"Sphingosine inhibition of protein kinase C activity and of phorbol dibutyrate binding in vitro and in human platelets\\" J. Biol. Chem., vol. 261, issue 27, 1986, p. 12604-9. Accessed 19 May 2020.}}, showing a bioactive effect for a sphingolipid for the first time and suggesting that \\"a role for sphingolipids in transmembrane signaling may emerge\\" . Prior to this discovery, sphingolipids had primarily been thought to be inert, structural components of cell membranes. Subsequent work by Hannun and his laboratory demonstrated the turnover of sphingolipids in response to cell stimuli , analogous to phosphoinositide turnover, and the linking of sphingolipids, most notably ceramide, to biologies such as cell death, growth arrest, and differentiation. Lina M. Obeid, Corrine M. Linardic, Linda A. Karolak, and Yusuf A. Hannun \\"Programmed cell death induced by ceramide\\" Science, vol. 259, issue 5102, 1993, p. 1769-1771. Accessed 18 May 2020.S.

Accessed 19 May 2020. These early studies by Hannun and his colleagues ushered in a period of broader investigation on sphingolipid metabolism and function. Subsequent Career In 1998, Hannun moved to the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) to be Chair of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, holding the Ralph F. Hirschmann Chair of Biomedical Research, and serving as Deputy Director of the Hollings Cancer Center. While at MUSC the center was noted by the National Cancer Institute as NCI-designated. At that time there were only sixty such designated centers in the United States. In 2012, Hannun was recruited to be Director of the Cancer Center and Vice Dean for Cancer Medicine at Stony Brook University. He is also co-director of the Kavita and Lalit Bahl Center for Metabolomics and Imaging,, a major program focused on the study of lipids, metabolism, and imaging in Cancer Biology and Therapeutics.. Under Hannun's leadership, cancer research and care at Stony Brook has expanded, including the establishment of a new department of bioinformatics to use computer technology to collect and analyze biological data. This culminated in the opening of the Medical and Research Translation (MART) facility in 2019, which enables scientists and clinicians to work in close proximity, to help advance cancer research and rapidly translate basic research findings into new clinical tools and therapies.  Research Contributions, Honors, and Awards  In the field of bioactive sphingolipids, Hannun has contributed over 500 academic research articles and reviews, and published a number of books. In 2004, he was elected as a fellow in the American Association for the Advancement of Science. In 2006, he was given the South Carolina Governor's award for scientific research . In 2011, he was awarded the ASBMB Avanti award for excellence in research . The contributions of Hannun and his wife Lina M. Obeid to sphingolipid research were recognized by a Lifetime Achievement Award at the 16th International Conference on Bioactive Lipids in Cancer, Inflammation and Related Diseases - the first time that it was given as a joint award.  Personal life  While at the American University of Beirut, Hannun met his wife Lina M. Obeid, a fellow physician scientist and biomedical researcher who also made seminal contributions to the sphingolipid field. Their triplet children, Reem, Marya, and Awni, have all found careers in research. Obeid passed away in November 2019 from complications of lung cancer.

The organisation was set up as part of the first Edinburgh International Festival in 1947 and continues to operate under the patronage of the city's Lord Provost. The volunteer guides receive no remuneration, and no charge is made for most of their tours. Origins During the planning for the first Edinburgh International Festival in 1947, the then Lord Provost, Sir John Falconer, issued an appeal for \\"citizens who will be prepared to act, in a voluntary capacity, as guides,\\" their duties consisting of \\"taking parties of visitors … along the Royal Mile and explaining to them its historical associations.\\" Twelve volunteers came forward to lead walking tours twice a day during the Festival. The tours, which were coordinated by John Bowman, a former City Water Engineer, were listed in the Festival's official programme under the heading \\"Special Tours\\". The Festival Society provided secretarial and financial assistance and took responsibility for vetting the volunteers. A meeting place for the tours was provided in Cannonball House, a historic town house next to the entrance to Edinburgh Castle. The tours followed the length of the Royal Mile, ending at Holyrood Palace. More volunteer guides were recruited for the 1948 Festival. In that year the group was officially constituted as the Edinburgh Festival Voluntary Guides Association, with Bowman serving as its first president and with the Lord Provost as its patron. By the time of the 1949 Festival, there were 40 guides in service. Over the next few years, the tours grew in popularity, attracting about a thousand visitors per season by 1950. An EFVGA guide showing visitors the 16th-Century Riddle's Court Finances The Festival Society discontinued its support for the Association in 1985. The Department of Extra-Mural Studies at the Edinburgh University stepped in with an offer of both secretarial and financial help, an arrangement which was to last for seven years. This was mainly thanks to the support of the Department's former director, Basil Skinner. Today the Association is entirely self-supporting, with no funding from public sources. Its administrative costs are met from visitors' donations and also from charges made for custom tours outside the Festival season. Current activities The EFVGA currently has about 75 guides, of which 45 to 50 are active at any one time. All guides go through a rigorous training and assessment process. The Association's main activity still consists of running free tours during the Festival season, although these are now officially part of the Festival Fringe rather than the International Festival. The group typically runs about 80 tours during the three weeks of the season. In 2013, it moved its base to the City Chambers from Cannonball House when that building was converted to a restaurant. The Association also offers custom tours on demand outside the Festival, for which it makes a small charge. In 2019, it started running free tours as part of Edinburgh's Open Streets programme, in which most of the Royal Mile and some adjacent streets are closed to motor vehicles but open to visitors on foot or bicycle once a month. In the mid-1950s, a programme of free illustrated talks (originally known as \\"lantern lectures\\") was added to the Association's offering, and these continue to this day. The talks take place during the Festival season, and are typically on subjects relating to Edinburgh and Scottish history. In March 2020, the Association announced that it would not be offering tours in the 2020 season. This followed the cancellation of all the city's summer festivals as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

When John was about 17 years old, his father Bray leased 700 acres of land from the Royal Governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony around nine miles northwest of modern Salem, Massachusetts which later became the town of Salem Village, known today as Danvers, Massachusetts. Eventually he married a woman by the name of Lydia and had three children, Lydia died while giving birth to the third. Salem Witch Trials In 1689, the Wilkins family permanently settled in Salem Village in order to establish a church there. Around a year later, John's niece Margaret Wilkins married a constable named John Willard. John's father, Bray, had been taken to court and received a debilitating judgement to his opponent's favor 20 years earlier in 1666, and as a result the family harbored a deep hatred for Willard. When the trials began in Salem Village in 1692, Willard, being the constable, handled arresting the accused. However, he sometimes found himself ordered to arrest townsfolk that he respected for witchcraft, a task he eventually refused to carry out. Because of this, the paranoid townsfolk accused Willard himself of being a partitioner of the dark arts, and a warrant for his arrest was swiftly issued. Willard quickly fled to nearby Nashaway, but after a second warrant for his arrest was issued, he was discovered and sent back to Salem to stand trial. Ann Putnam, who would accuse 62 people by the trials' end, claimed to have seen two apparitions of John Willard, during the latter of which she claimed John Willard had told her he was responsible for the death of Lydia, the wife of John Wilkins. The accusation spurred John himself to testify against Willard. Willard was hanged on August 19. Later life John eventually remarried and had 8 more children. He later died at the age of 81.

In particular, Mexican music is especially popular among Chilean rural lower classes. Geographically, Mexican music is most popular in south-central Chile, but there are also significant audiences elsewhere, such as in the northern city of La Serena. Mexican corridos commonly perform in Chilean national day celebrations of Fiestas Patrias. Mexican music as understood in Chile is norteño music, a series of styles that originated in the rural world of the northern half of Mexico. The corrido and ranchera genres of norteño music in particular are referred as \\"Mexican music\\" in Chile. Among the annual Mexican music festivals in Chile are the Festival del Cantar Mexicano Guadalupe del Carmen in Chanco, Festival Internacional de la Voz de la Música Mexicana de Puyehue in Puyehue, and Festival del Cantar Popular Mexicano in La Serena. Origins It is thought that Mexican music gained popularity, even in remote areas of Chile, through radio stations and Mexican movies. The first Chilean interpreters of Mexican music appeared in the 1940s, and by the time of Jorge Negrete's visit to Chile in 1946, Los Queretaros and many other ensembles specializing in Mexican music were thriving. Musicologist Laura Jordán González comments that \\"music listening practices in Chile have extensively shown a preference for foreign music, which has been explained by some authors as a result of successive non-protectionist policies\\". Radio stations specializing in Mexican music are common in Chile. They may play music from as early as six o'clock in the morning, when farmers begin their workday. Typically, broadcasts of Mexican music on these radio stations continue well into midnight. In the 1950s and 1960s, non-specialized radio stations such as Radio Yungay and Radio Agricultura created programs dedicated to Mexican music. According to lifelong Mexican music collector Fernando Méndez, the popularity of Mexican music was helped by similarities in Chilean and Mexican culture, such as the equivalence of the charro with the huaso. 1970s to the present As Mexican music gained ground in Chile by the 1970s, the popularity of the corrido was considered to be on par with the local cueca, a local genre regarded as typically Chilean and promoted by the Pinochet dictatorship. As happened in many aspects of Chilean society, Mexican music became politicized in the 1970s. Jorge Inostroza, a prominent radio host and promoter of Mexican music, alienated much of his audience with his public support of the Pinochet dictatorship. The military dictatorship sought to isolate Chilean radio listeners from the outside world by changing radio frequency to middle wavelengths. This, together with the shutdown of radio stations sympathetic to the former Allende administration, had a negative impact to Mexican music in Chile. Another challenge to Mexican music was the closing of record shops selling Mexican music which coincided with the installment of the dictatorship in the early 1970s. In response to these adversities, Chilean exiles in Spain and Mexico supplied their relatives in Chile with records of Mexican music. The scarcity of Mexican music records is thought to have contributed to the creation of the local recording company Sol de América and the pirate cassette brand Cumbre y Cuatro, both of which catered to Mexican music enthusiasts. Elements of the Chilean military distrusted Mexican music, leading to cases where the music was denounced as \\"communist\\". The military's dislike of Mexican music may be rooted in the Allende administration's close links with Mexico, the \\"Mexican revolutionary discourse\\", and the overall low prestige of Mexican music in Chile. The dictatorship never suppressed Mexican music as a whole, as distinctions were made between different currents, some of which were actually promoted. Among the Chilean upper class, Mexican music has gained more acceptance since the 2000s. In part, this trend is explained by the popularity of the musical talent show Rojo Fama contra Fama on TVN, which aired for the first time in 2002. María José Quintanilla in particular gained acclaim on the program by singing ranchera songs.

The basis was the ballad of the same name by Mikhail Lermontov Tamara (\\"In the deep gully of Dariala...\\"), (in russian) written by the poet around 1837 under the impression of the old Georgian legend apparently heard in the Caucasus as a fantastic depiction of the Queen Tamar of Georgia. The original idea of the poem occurred to Balakirev under the influence of his trips to the Caucasus in 1862 and 1863. According to the memoirs of N. A. Rimsky-Korsakov in the autumn of 1866, M. A. Balakirev \\"more and more often played themes for orchestral fantasy 'Tamara'\\". The severe crisis that struck the composer in the early 1870s interrupted his work - it was only in 1876, at the insistence of M. Glinka’s sister, L. I. Shestakova, that Balakirev resumed the composition. The poem was completed in 1882 and first performed on March 7th (19th) 1882 in St. Petersburg, at a concert of the Free Music School under the direction of the composer. It was then performed twice in Paris, at the Concerts Lamoureux. In 1884 it was printed by P.I. Jurgenson.https://imslp.org/wiki/Tamara_(Balakirev,_Mily)  Overview  In the prologue of the symphonic poem the theme of the majestic Caucasian landscape sounds: gloomy sounds of low strings against the background of continuous murmur of kettledrums - in the gorge of Daryal Terek valley roaring menacingly. Then appears the love call of the Tsarina Tamara presented by the English horn later repeated by the oboe, which brings the traveler to the mysterious castle. The main part of the poem - Allegro moderato ma agitato - begins with passionate theme of the viola section; then the music is based on the rhythms of oriental Turkish-Iranian melodies, which leads the listener to the orgy scene, where the themes of Caucasian dances are heard. The painting full of passion ends with an epilogue - Andante - with music similar to the introduction.  In Diaghilev's enterprise  Diaghilev, who met Balakirev in 1893, in 1907 included \\"Tamara\\" in the repertoire of \\"Russian historical concerts\\" organized by him in Paris, held at the Theatre du Grand Opera and attracted the attention of the French music community. Most of the works of Russian symphony and opera music presented in these five concerts were subsequently transferred by Diaghilev to the ballet stage. The score of the poem was used for the eponymous production (also known as Thamar) of the Russian Seasons (Ballets russes) in 1912. The libretto and the design were created by Léo Bakst, choreography by Mikhail Fokin. The main roles were performed by Tamara Karsavina and Adolf Bolm, the premiere took place at the Châtelet Theatre in Paris on 20 May 1912.

Born in Paris, Tessier attended a Christian Brothers' school. In 1905, he joined the Trade and Industry Employees' Union (SECI), a union of Catholic workers, his membership sponsored by Jules Zimheld and Charles Viennet. He became prominent in the union's Study Group, which conducted research into labour-related matters from a Catholic perspective, and he wrote regularly for L'Employé, the union's journal. In 1908, he was appointed as assistant general secretary of the union, then in 1912, he became general secretary of a new union of Christian workers in the Paris region. As leader of the union, Tessier took a prominent role in founding the French Federation of Catholic Employees' Unions, in 1913, and he was soon also appointed as its general secretary. Due to poor health, he remained in his union posts during World War I, supplementing his income by opening a bookshop. In 1919, the French Confederation of Christian Workers (CFTC) was established, and Tessier was appointed as its general secretary. He also became active internationally, serving as the founding general secretary of the International Federation of Christian Employees' Trade Unions from 1921. He worked with Jules Zirnheld to gain the blessing of the Vatican for their union activities, and refute accusations that they were Marxists, later being made a knight of the Order of St Gregory the Great. In 1936, he was also made a knight of the Legion of Honour. The CFTC was banned in 1939, along with other trade unions, Tessier was one of three CFTC signatories to the Manifesto of the Twelve, opposing this. He was a founder of Liberation-Nord, wrote for underground newspapers, and from 1943 served on the National Resistance Council, then on the Consultative Assembly. Immediately after the liberation of France, he chaired the Ministerial Commission for Food Supply. The CFTC was re-established, and Tessier returned to his post as general secretary, then in 1948, he moved to become its president. In this role, he promoted Christian trade unionism internationally, and strongly opposed the growing support in the CFTC for secularisation. In 1953, he feared that this might lead to him losing re-election as the federation's president, so he stood down, becoming honorary president, and also president of the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions.

Most of it is a Local Nature Reserve and a National Nature Reserve. It is part of Solent and Southampton Water Ramsar site and Special Protection Area.  History  Until late in the 16th century, the River Meon was navigable as far as Titchfield, which at that time was a significant port. However silting started to restrict the passage of ships, and in order to maintain Titchfield's status as a port, the Earl of Southampton proposed that a canal should be constructed. The Titchfield Canal opened in 1611 and was only the second canal existing in Britain at the time. Unfortunately the canal also suffered from silting and the sea trade moved to nearby Southampton and Portsmouth. As part of the construction of the canal, the outfall of the River Meon to the sea was dammed, creating the wetlands that now form the nature reserve.Hampshire County Council (2006). Activities at Titchfield Haven - River Study . Retrieved 19 March 2006.

The site is managed to provide ideal conditions at different times of the year, with water levels lowered at the end of the waterfowl breeding season in order to expose food-rich mud to encourage migrating birds. Other areas of water are cleared in order to attract dragonflies and damselflies. Frogbit and flowering rush are also encouraged to grow because of this water management. Other flora include slender bird's-foot-trefoil and marsh mallow. The site is a winter refuge for ducks, geese and wading birds and avocet are known to use the location as a breeding ground in the summer months. The Walkway Pond is home to dragonflies, damselflies, moorhen, mallard and a variety of warblers. Water voles have been reintroduced to the reserve and the River Meon, as part of a project by South Downs National Park, Hampshire & Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust and The Environment Agency. The reserve has a number of hides, Cottage Hide, Meon Shore Hide, Knights Bank Hide, Meadow Hide, Pumfrett Hide, Spurgin Hide, Suffern Hide and West Hide, from which it is possible to observe the local wildlife, which includes fox and deer as well as waterfowl.  Amenities  The site is open seven days a week, including Bank Holidays (excluding 25 and 26 December) 9.30am - 5pm during the summer and 9.30am - 4pm in the winter. Admission is by ticket, available from the Titchfield Haven Visitor Centre. Free car parking is available close to the Reserve. The site has toilets (with wheelchair access), a tea room, a shop and an exhibition in the Visitor Centre.

A native of Somerset, Pulteney embarked on his short political career on account of his financial debts, aiming to avoid creditors and gain a lucrative sinecure appointment.Lewis Namier, Crossroads of Power: Essays on Eighteenth-Century England, p.7, Hamish Hamilton, 1970 Early life Pulteney was the eldest son the Rev. Charles Pulteney and his wife Betty Speke, whose relative George Speke the father-in-law of Lord North, acted as trustee of the marriage settlement.Namier, Crossroads, pp.7-8, Hamish Hamilton, 1970 Pulteney was the eldest of three sons and one daughter born to the couple who resided in the parish of Curry Mallet, Somerset. Pulteney was baptised on 19 September 1749. He entered Eton College as a King's Scholar, remaining in education there until 1769. While several other individuals with the same surname did serve in the House of Commons during the 18th-century including another Daniel, Pulteney was likely unrelated to the notable Pulteney that included the Patriot Whig leader William Pulteney.PULTENEY, History of Parliament Online Academic career Thereafter Pulteney was admitted as a scholar at King's College, Cambridge in 1769 from which he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1773.Namier, Crossroads, p.8, Hamish Hamilton, 1970 Prior to graduating Pulteney became a Fellow of King's, a position he would hold until his death. Pulteney did not appear to be a teaching fellow, yet would later serve twice a Vice-Provost at King's from 1798-1801 and 1803-10, while also serving a period as Dean between 1801-03. Pulteney's academic lifestyle while residing in Cambridge can be ascertained from the memoirs of Henry Gunning, as referenced by Lewis Namier who noted: > There were a few men amongst the Masters of Arts of pretty high standing, > who cultivated the acquaintance of the young nobility, and contrived to keep > a handsome establishment, and live in a very expensive style, without any > other apparent resources than their fellowships. Two of the most celebrated > (I was very near using the word notorious) were Akehurst and Pulteney, both > Fellows of King's. At a dinner given by the Bishop of Llandaff to the Duke > of Rutland and some other young men of rank, the Bishop was pressed by > Akehurst to take a seat at a table where there was a vacancy, and at which > they had been playing for very high stakes. This was the very significant > answer of the Bishop,- \\"I have no estate to lose, Sir; I am not desirous of > winning one.\\"Henry Gunning, Reminiscences of the University, Town, and > County of Cambridge, from the Year 1780, Volume 1, pp.20-1, George Bell, > (1855)Namier, Crossroads, pp.8-9, Hamish Hamilton, 1970 Pulteney resided in Cambridge during the 1770s, during which period he was admitted as a student of the Middle Temple in 1772, after which he was called to the bar over fifteen-years later in 1788. While at Cambridge he took the acquaintance and became a friend of the 4th Duke of Rutland, with Pulteney referring to Rutland as 'Dearest Granby'. Pulteney officially retired from academic work as a 'College officer' in 1794 at the age of forty-five. In his earlier years he seldom partook in college meetings and Congregations, with his being reported absent at all such meetings during the years 1772-5 and 1782-93.Namier, Crossroads, p.21, Hamish Hamilton, 1970 Political career Pulteney's politics first became apparent at the contest for the Cambridge University constituency during the 1780 general election. He cast his votes in that election for the two victorious candidates in the University constituency, Northite-aligned James Mansfield and Rockinghamite-aligned Lord John Townshend, and against Pitt the Younger.Namier, Crossroads, p.10, Hamish Hamilton, 1970 This created a near breach with his friend Rutland, leading Pulteney to intone in a December 1782 letter reproduced by Namier that: \\"I was then honored with by your Grace have done me injury in your opinion; but except in the Cambridge election where I was pre-engaged, I have never acted contrary to your wishes\\". Pulteney by this period had found his personal financial situation strained and within a year informed Rutland that creditors were due to execute writs against him on account of his dire financial situation. Pulteney's desire for a parliamentary seat was expressed in a letter to Rutland, dated 7 November 1783, written at Southampton where Pulteney appeared to be considering fleeing to France to avoid his creditors. The letter, quoted by Namier, sees Pulteney expressed that: > A bare existence in England out of a jail by means of Parliament is, I > assure your Grace, no object with me in my present circumstances. I should > endeavour to make myself as usefull [sic] as I could there to Pitt for half > a year or a year, and in the meantime settle as well as I could all my > affairs, and I then think the being thus patronized by your Grace, together > with Lord Chatham's and perhaps Pitt's own good wishes, might get me some > appointment to the East Indies. I should by this means leave your Grace's > borough open for any of your Grace's friends, and perhaps stand some chance > of repaying your Grace a sum which I am sensible is a considerable object > with the greatest estate...Namier, Crossroads, p.11, Hamish Hamilton, 1970 Receiving an assurance from Rutland, Pulteney was suggested as a potential candidate in either of the Looe constituencies or Newton in Lancashire, yet with the early dissolution for the 1784 general election Pulteney was returned pro-Pitt candidate for the notorious rotten borough of Bramber in Sussex.Namier, Crossroads, pp.11-2, Hamish Hamilton, 1970 Despite entering the Commons with the aim of receiving a sinecure in the Indies, he devoted himself to sending a series of sketches of parliamentarians and their activities to his benefactor in Dublin, who was serving by this point as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland.Namier, Crossroads, pp.12-3, Hamish Hamilton, 1970 Pulteney's parliamentary sketches make particular reference to MPs linked to the Foxite and Northite faction of the Coalition in opposition. Pulteney's personal politics seems to mirror those of conservative elements among the Coalition opposition which included several conservative and former-Tories in their ranks.James J. Sack, From Jacobite to Conservative: Reaction and orthodoxy in Britain, c.1760-1832, pp.81-4, Cambridge University Press, 1993 Pulteney would note to his benefactor at the steadily decreasing strength of the opposition under Charles James Fox which was termed by the Bramber MP as \\"the poor forlorn minority\\" which \\"seemed at last to join in the laugh at their ridiculous situation\\".Namier, Crossroads, p.13, Hamish Hamilton, 1970 Pulteney considered the government's support in the Commons to be firm and to have remained intact despite some disquiet over government measures from other backbenchers.Paul Kelly, \\"British Parliamentary Politics, 1784-1786\\", The Historical Journal, 1974, Vol. 17, No. 4, p.737 In the Commons Pulteney, like other Members pledged to the Duke of Rutland, defended the interests and positions of the Duke, which was alluded to in Pulteney's maiden speech to the Commons, given on 8 June 1784, where he listed various constituencies in the pocket of the Duke. Pulteney himself wrote to Rutland, as quoted by Namier, that: > I rose and spoke for ten minutes, ... not knowing what was to question > before the House. I took care, however, to get into no scrape ... but I > certainly felt no more embarrassment than in a private room, and will > venture to assure your Grace that you cannot employ any of your Members who > will more readily speak on the Turnpike Bills of Leicestershire, > Cambridgeshire, Grantham, Newark, Scarborough, or Bramber, whenever such > business is beofre the House. ... Fox who followed me ... has declared at > Brooks's, he wondered only at my want of embarrassment and want of > information. ... I am perfectly ready to execute all the minor business your > Grace will direct me to do.Namier, Crossroads, p.14, Hamish Hamilton, 1970 Along with other Members aligned to the Duke of Rutland, Pulteney voted appeared vaguely supportive of parliamentary reform measures introduced by Pitt, yet he also expressed his personal misgivings about certain aspects of Pitt's India Act, though he did not allow this criticism to become opposition to Pitt or his government.Namier, Crossroads, pp.14-5, Hamish Hamilton, 1970 Pulteney voted with the opposition in 1785 on the question of the Westminster election of 1784.Namier, Crossroads, pp.16-7, Hamish Hamilton, 1970 He continued to strive for a sinecure and a resolution to his financial woes, continuing to write to Rutland and ask for a sinecure of £400 per annum. By 1786 the Duke was paying Pulteney himself this sum and continued to look for means to finally gain Pulteney office. Rutland died suddenly on 24 October 1787 leaving Pulteney's financial well-being and political career up in the air. Pulteney remained a Member of Parliament until December 1788 when he finally gained office as Collector of customs in Dominica. Pulteney does not appear to have traveled to the island, likely leaving his duties to a deputy. Were he to have taken up the office, Pulteney would have had to resign his Fellowship at King's, which he continued to hold thereafter. Later life Pulteney resigned his seat in December 1788, by which time he seemed a possible defection to the Foxite grouping in Parliament. He was succeeded in a by-election on 15 December 1788 by Robert Hobart.Bramber, History of Parliament Online Pulteney returned to Cambridge after his period in the Commons and from 1794 onward he to attend college meetings and Congregation far more frequently than he had before. Pulteney retired in 1794, yet maintained residence in Cambridge all while refusing to serve as a tutor and having an income of £3 per annum from his position as second dean of arts.Namier, Crossroads, pp.21-2, Hamish Hamilton, 1970 Pulteney was a lifelong bachelor and did not have any recorded progeny. His final will, dated 8 October 1810 left a legacy to his younger brother, Dr. Charles Speke Pulteney, whom the elder Pulteney had lost contact with thirty years prior. Pulteney died at age sixty-one from apoplexy at the Rainbow Coffee House situated in London and was buried in King's College Chapel, Cambridge.E. Cave, The Gentleman's Magazine, and Historical Chronicle, Volume 81, Part 2, p.194, John Nichols and Son, (1811)Namier, Crossroads, p.22, Hamish Hamilton, 1970 Pulteney's short political career was motivated mainly by his desire to avoid creditors, with his time in Parliament coming to a close upon his appointment to a government sinecure that he had desired. Namier in writing on Pulteney's life and short political career considered him to be an intelligent and astute individual, terming him 'An Ordinary Man' in the House of Commons during the period. Namier, however summed Pulteney up, writing that he was: > A parasite throughout, he had sensed and recorded during his short > parliamentary career the change that was coming over British politics.

Fisher's papers are in the collections of the Smithsonian Archives of American Art in New York and the National Museum of Women in the Arts in Washington, DC. Work and reception Fisher began her professional career as an early-modernist- influenced abstract artist, before turning to portraiture in the 1960s, architectural paintings in the 1970, and landscapes and still-lifes in her late career. In the 1950s, she painted in a lyrical style that features impressionistic elements and organic shapes and planes that reference architecture (e.g., Garden Gift, Oriental #2, or The City) and pre-Columbian, Byzantine and Japanese art.Ethel Fisher. Early Work, Ethel Fisher website. Retrieved May 5, 2020.

Los Angeles County Museum of Art collection. In the early 1960s, after studying Classical Greek sculpture and Pompeian frescoes in Europe, Fisher decided that she had reached an impasse with the era's dominant abstract mode. Like others, such as Jane Freilicher, Alex Katz, Philip Pearlstein and the Bay Area Figurative Movement, she turned to the figure, eventually choosing a humanistic approach rather than Pop Art's flat, distanced style. She took evening lectures at the Art Students League with the well-known anatomy instructor, Robert Beverly Hale, and produced large works of simple, generalized figures with rounded Matisse-like bodies, depicted with loose brushwork, gestural line and strong color.Ethel Fisher. Figures, Ethel Fisher website. Retrieved May 5, 2020. Two paintings marking this transition from abstraction, Two Sisters (1964) and Woman on a Bed (1965), were recognized with a Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation Award for Painting in 1965. Fisher's late-1960s work sought greater representational specificity and psychological depth in portraits of herself, family and artist friends, such as Henry Pearson and Paul Thek. She composed her figures against large color fields, as in Portrait of Will Barnet (1967), which she considered a breakthrough figurative work. Related portraits in this vein include Alice Baber and Paul Jenkins (1967) and two depicting herself and Seymour Kott: Two Figures/Orange Space (1968) and Double Portrait/Yellow Space (New York) (1969); their background color fields, clothing, and stylized outlines containing anatomical details recall the work of Richard Lindner. In the late 1970s, after a break from portraits, Fisher resumed figurative work, conveying psychological overtones through details of clothing and interior spaces (e.g., Two Women, 1978; Portrait of Ilse Getz, 1979). By that time, Los Angeles Times critic William Wilson could write of a portraiture \\"revival\\"; his review of the \\"Portraits 79\\" exhibition describes Fisher's work as bringing \\"spare simplification to women of an aesthetic-intellectual type resting in small apartments … haunted by past pain.\\" In the 1980s and 1990s, Fisher continued to paint portraits of herself, her family and art-world friends, such as Martha Alf, Lem Dobbs, Michael Wingo, Leona Wood, and costume designer Ruth Morley. This work increasingly incorporated classical architectural forms (e.g., Model Holding Mirror, 1982; Reading in the Loggia, 1996) that functioned as both color fields and backgrounds. =Architectural paintings= In the early 1970s, Fisher felt that her portraits were moving toward a formula. She spent the next seven years producing a body of architectural paintings and graphite drawings that embraced discipline and a restrictive palette.Ahern, Charlene. \\"Buildings Live on Canvas,\\" Palisadian-Post, July 15, 1976. She was influenced by the work of Magritte and the late-19th-century cast-iron buildings of her youth in Galveston, with their Art Nouveau and Classical motifs. She eventually focused on monumental works that carefully record iconic, frontal views of ornate facades (usually four to six floors), sourced from black-and-white photographs of buildings in New York, Chicago, Galveston and St. Louis.Artweek. \\"Ethel Fisher: Corbusier Chair in Front of Terrace, 1977,\\" Artweek, December 3, 1977. Rather than create photorealist street-scene renderings, however, she modified her subjects with invented and remembered colors and expressive, loose brushwork, seeking to create personal interpretations and building \\"portraits.\\" Critics compare the tight, shallow spaces and grid-like organization to Mondrian canvasses and Louise Nevelson constructions, and the use of diagonal shafts of light (e.g., Fine Arts Building, Chicago, 1976) to the Cubist and Impressionist dissolution of hard- edged space. Ethel Fisher, California Landscape II/with fire in distance, oil on canvas, 48\\" x 72\\", 1985. Fisher appeared in the show, \\"Painting, Color, Form and Surface\\" (1974, curated by Martha Alf), along with Diebenkorn, Sam Francis and Ed Moses, all of whom were creating work that explored \\"painting as pure form\\" in contrast to the era's conceptual and fabricated art.Alf, Martha. Painting, Color, Form and Surface, Claremont, CA: Scripps College, 1974. Alf writes that Fisher's facade image, Building—Broadway—South of Houston Street (1974), is both completely recognizable and abstract, with shallow space, geometric form, subtle color and shadows that \\"reflect and conceal the mystery in the big city.\\" Her review of Fisher's 1975 solo exhibition describes the combined effect of differing light conditions, angles and disembodied patterns across works as a surrealistic, imaginary urban street of mysterious quiet. =Landscapes and still lifes= From the 1980s onward, Fisher turned increasingly to the California vistas surrounding her home (e.g., California Landscape II/with fire in distance, 1985), sometimes in combination with portraits (e.g., Santa Monica Beach (Sandra, Alix, Max), 1989), buildings, or still lifes. In these works, she often moved between horizontal and strongly vertical compositions that reflect her architectural interests (e.g., Garden Walls/Los Angeles, 1994 and Hill Above Patio, 1997–8).Ethel Fisher. Landscape, Ethel Fisher website. Retrieved May 5, 2020. Fisher turned to still lifes in her later career. Using the strong simple forms of David's painting The Death of Marat as a springboard, many of these works feature arrangements of objects stabilized by a central wooden box and seek a \\"mood between menace and melancholy.\\" She began to stack her objects vertically—which is unorthodox for still lifes—and included miniature artwork reproductions as postcards within the arrangements, recalling the ubiquitous postcard collections of many artists.Ethel Fisher.

Her research primarily addresses understanding ocean circulation processes over time through the use of chemical tracers and the connection to climate.  Early life and education  Fine was born April 17, 1944, in New York. Her parents are Joseph and Etta (née Kreisman) Arnold. Fine credits her attendance at the Bronx High School of Science for starting her on a career path with science and mathematics. Fine has a B.A. in mathematics from New York University and a M.A. in mathematics from the University of Miami. She completed her Ph.D. in physical oceanography from the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science in 1975. Her dissertation is titled High Pressure P-V-T Properties Of Seawater And Related Liquids with Frank Millero serving as her advisor and committee chair.  Research career  Upon completing her Ph.D., Fine continued on with the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School (RSMAS) in a one-year postdoctoral position in the Tritium Laboratory from 1976-1977. She remained as an Assistant Professor (1977-1980), Research Associate Professor (1980-1984), and Associate Professor (1984-1990). Fine was promoted to the rank of Full Professor in 1990 and served as the chair of the Department of Marine and Atmospheric Chemistry. Fine's research uses measurements of chemicals in the oceans to improve our understanding of the transfer of gases from the atmosphere to the oceans. Tracers, such as chlorofluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), have been used to determine a range of oceanic properties, including ocean transport and rates of biogeochemical processes. Fine has secured grant funding to support her research from the National Science Foundation, Office of Naval Research, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and NASA. Fine has served on scientific committees at the national level. She was a member of the National Science Foundation Division of Polar Programs Advisory Committee (1987-1990). For the National Academy of Sciences, she worked with the Geophysics Study Committee (1989-1992) and Ocean Studies Board, as well as chair of the OSB nominating committee. While Chair of the National Academy of Sciences' Committee On Major U.S. Oceanographic Research Programs, she was involved with the generation of the 1999 Global Ocean Science: Toward an Integrated Approach consensus study report from the National Academies Press. While serving on the NAS Committee on the Evolution of the National Oceanographic Research Fleet, she was part of the 2009 Science at Sea: Meeting Future Oceanographic Goals with a Robust Academic Research Fleet consensus study report, also from the National Academies Press. She has served on the scientific steering committee of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE). Fine has been active in encouraging and mentoring women to enter the field of physical oceanography. In her biography for The Oceanography Society's Women in Oceanography: A Decade Later, she mentions how during her time at the National Science Foundation in the early 1980s, \\"I was one of only four women considered to be physical oceanographers at academic institutions in the United States.\\" She credits programs such as Mentoring Physical Oceanography Women to Increase Retention (MPOWIR) for increasing the number of women in the geosciences and ocean sciences. In 2008, the American Geophysical Union selected Fine to present The Harald Sverdrup Lecture at their Fall meeting, which recognizes an individual for outstanding contributions and the promotion of cooperation in atmospheric and oceanographic research.

History  SC Equality was incorporated in 2002 in Columbia, South Carolina by Nekki Shutt as South Carolina Equality Coalition (SCEC). By 2003, the group was made up of 19 organizations, including the Alliance for Full Acceptance (AFFA). Its goal was to improve the conditions of gay and lesbian people in South Carolina through promoting tolerance, politically organizing gay people and allies and changing discriminatory laws. SCEC was the recipient of a 2003 Equality Fund grant from the Human Rights Campaign to support its political lobbying efforts. SCEC led a major campaign against South Carolina Amendment 1, which was a ballot measure part of the 2006 election. The amendment stated that a marriage between one man and one woman would be the only valid domestic union recognized in the state. In 2005, then- chair of SCEC Linda Ketner organized public testimony against the amendment at legislative subcommittee hearings. The amendment passed the South Carolina Senate with a vote of 36-1, with Senator Robert Ford of Charleston the sole dissenting vote. SCEC and its constituent members including AFFA and South Carolina Gay and Lesbian Pride Movement (SCGLPM) continued to campaign against the amendment through to the election, including canvassing at the South Carolina State Fair, hosting \\"Fairness for All Families\\" fundraising house parties, and a statewide bus tour. Groups lobbying in favor of the amendment included the Palmetto Family Council, led by Henry McMaster and Oran Smith. The amendment ultimately passed with 78% of the vote. SCEC later rebranded as SC Equality and continued its advocacy work at the state level. On June 26, 2013, SC Equality organized a march in Columbia, South Carolina, in anticipation of the Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Windsor.

Born and raised in Birmingham, Alabama, gained popularity among the underground scene as a result of releasing 14 original mixtapes and albums independently since 2007. He is a pioneer of hip-hop for Birmingham, Alabama in the digital era. Early life Daniel Payne spent his youth in and represents the Birmingham, Alabama neighborhoods of Ensley, Forestdale, and West End. He grew up middle-class, he stated in an interview with DJ Smallz, but Birmingham was plagued by violence in the 1990s and 2000s. He revealed that he had been shot at before but never hit, the first time being at 16 years-old. He moved to Atlanta at age 18 and played football at Clark-Atlanta University before moving back to Alabama after a year. He hustled in various ways and worked jobs at McDonald's, Pizza Hut, and Target before pursuing music. Musical career2007–2010= The first song that he recorded, \\"Polo & Nikes\\" was discovered by DJ Burn One on MySpace in 2007, right after he had just finished Chicken Talk with Gucci Mane. \\"Polo & Nikes\\" was featured on several mixtapes around the South and eventually led to KD releasing his 2007 mixtape Last Man Standing. He was offered record deals after the release of Last Man Standing, but declined every deal due to the fact he wanted to stay independent. He then, went on a run releasing the Playa Prezident in 2008, Untouchable and Soul Inn in 2009, and the best of KD in 2010. After the release of these mixtapes he was able to go on the Trunk Muzik tour with Yelawolf. \\"KD is yet another underrated Alabama artist in the music industry. This time he's hitting you with his second street album titled \\"The Playa Prezident\\" presented by DJ Burn One. The production on this album is what the south been missin!\\", wrote Whitefolksgetcrunk.com about 2008's The Playa Prezident. Untouchable featured the song \\"Luv It\\", of which The Fader wrote, \\"As the latest stars of Alabama's Got Talent, Birmingham's KD and H.A.M. try on flows like fancy clothes over a B-Phlat spaceship rattler, each verse outclassing the last. The chorus is as formidable as it is inspirational.\\" Soul Inn featured a guest appearance by Pill, and was released November 2009. Steady Bloggin described, \\"We sang the praises of Untouchable earlier this year, and Soul Inn continues in the tradition of excellent beat selection and smooth rhyming. Mick Vegas, B-Phlat and B Kirk crush the production here. This is big.\\" In 2010, he and DJ Burn One released, The Best of KD, a compilation of KD's best songs to date. London, United Kingdom based hip-hop website Southern Hospitality wrote, \\"Birmingham, Alabama’s consistently soul warming KD teams up with one of the world’s foremost country rap music connoisseur’s for his ‘Best Of’ collection.\\" =2011–16= In 2011, he released what many consider his magnum opus, G-Fluid. G-Fluid was critically acclaimed by hip-hop purists and featured the underground classic with Freddie Gibbs, \\"Let Me Ride\\". Justin Ivey, Kevin Nottingham Editor-In- Chief, described the album as \\"vintage country rap tunes\\". French blogger Abcdrduson wrote the following, \\"The combination fits perfectly in the revival of the genre \\"Country Rap Tunes\\", bathed by the classics of UGK, the Dungeon Family or 8ball & MJG. The pace is hopping, the bass ready to lift the chest, the hat accelerates to infinity and the soul invades us gently, a little more each snare. Burn One is a goldsmith in the field, drawing from this rich culture of the South American to bring out its essence between the bagpipe of Pimp C, the originality of Outkast and the charisma of Scarface.....by making this life-saving album, they are a worthy successor to these great legends of Alabama. Nate King Cole, Percy Sledge, Pickett Wilson, Eddie Kendricks, these names resonate like immutable figures, untouchable that KD and his team brush with the fingertip. Returning in the wake of their elders\\". This album also helped land him in SPIN magazine's November 2011 issue as a rising star of raps new underground. The following year, he partnered with Dirty Glove Bastard, DJ 5150, DJ Burn One and mixtape website LiveMixtapes to release Crown Me, a free album. In 2013, he released his first digital retail album Diary of a Trill Nigga on Hollow Entertainment. The Smoking Section wrote, \\"Alabama’s own KD brings his own version of street knowledge mixed with a little spirituality\\", to describe Diary of a Trill Nigga. He released Space Age Southern Playalistic Country Rap in 2015 and Green Acres in 2016. =2019-Present: Daniel Payne= He formally announced the stage name change from KD to Daniel Payne with the release of the Tuxedo Junction album. When asked about the name change he stated that \\"with time comes change and with change comes growth and I've been growing and kind of changing my outlook on things and I thought Daniel Payne would be a good transition into this next phase\\". His first release as Daniel Payne was an EP on April 19, 2019 entitled 3rd Coastin' On Purple Waves. \\"I've been living in Houston the last few years so I've been taking in those vibes and that sound and that culture, so I think that this kind of the first project where I've been in Houston for so long that I've recorded this and put it out and its kind of like an ode to what I've been on the last few years. And then, with Daniel Payne, people have always like how I've been singing so I've been trying to make it more 50/50\\", is how he described 3rd Coastin' On Purple Waves. On May 8, 2020 he released Purple Onion, his first LP under the Daniel Payne moniker. The Source magazine wrote, \\"Track 2, his self titled track “Daniel Payne” is a story of his upbringing and how the things he faced growing up in the south help mold him into the man he is today. When asked about what inspired this album, Payne had this to say,” I like to make music that reflects my thoughts and experiences at the time.

He also used the pseudonym Stary Detiuk, meaning \\"old Detiuk\\". Early life and education Andrzejowski was born the son of a bank clerk and property manager in the village of in the present-day Rivne Oblast in Ukraine. He grew up in various places in western Ukraine and studied in Vilnius after his father's death in 1801. Andrzejowski was a student of the botanists Franz Scheidt and Wilibald Swibert Joseph Gottlieb von Besser in Kremenets. Career in botany Andrzejowski was a teacher at the lyceum in Kremenets. After his Polish-language lyceum was dissolved in 1832, he was an assistant to Wilibald Swibert Joseph Gottlieb von Besser and lecturer at Kiev University beginning in 1832. He had to give up that position when the Russian authorities suspected him of harboring conspirators. Beginning in 1839, he taught natural history at the lyceum in Nizhyn. After retiring as a professor, Andrzejowski moved to Stavyshche in 1852, where he led the botanical garden. His botanical specialties were cruciferous plants (Brassicaceae) and the flora of Ukraine. He was also interested in zoology, geology, and paleontology. Andrzejowski described 51 fossil species from the Miocene in Volhynia. In 1825 he published a list of Ukrainian wild plants and posthumously in 1869 a flora of Ukraine and its neighboring areas. He collected in Lithuania, Volhynia, Ukraine, and Podolia. Occasionally he also worked on zoology, especially reptiles and amphibians. The daisy genus Andrzeiowskia is named in his honor. He was a member of the Moscow Society of Naturalists and the Warsaw Natural History Society and correspondent at the University of Kiev. Species first described by Andrzejowski include small-flowered winter-cress (Barbarea stricta) in the crucifer family (Brassicaceae).

Education  Wald graduated from Columbia College in 1952 and was classmates with future ABC News president Roone Arledge, PBS and NBC News president Larry Grossman, and The New York Times executive editor Max Frankel.  Career  He began his career in journalism with The New York Herald Tribune, where he served as a reporter and rose through the ranks to become the paper's last managing editor, working with Jim Bellows, before the paper's demise in 1966. He also served as the Sunday editor of the New York World Journal Tribune and assistant managing editor of The Washington Post before joining NBC in 1967. Wald became president of NBC News in January 1973 and left the network due to friction with the management over unsatisfactory ratings. His Columbia classmate Arledge, then president of ABC News, hired him to run the day-to-day operations of the news division in 1978. Wald was promoted to senior vice president for editorial quality, nicknamed the \\"ethics czar\\" of the network. As Roone Arledge's deputy, he was credited with bringing in talented reporters such as David Brinkley to the network and helped launch This Week with David Brinkley in 1981. He retired from ABC News in 1998. Outside his professional career, Wald is also the Fred W.

Originally described as a single species, genetic studies eventually classified it as at least four almost morphologically indistinguishable species, one of which was given the binomial denomination Callichirus macrotelsonis (Peiró, 2012). The complex is distinguished by sexual dimorphism, distinctly separated coxae and bases in the maxilla and gonochorism, despite vestigial signs of ancestral hermaphroditism in C. macrotelsonis. The widespread extraction of individuals for living fishing bait has endangered both its conservation and that of their respective ecosystems. Taxonomy Callichirus major was first described as Callianassa major by Thomas Say in 1818, specifically in the Gulf of Mexico and East Florida. Its genus was renamed Callichirus in 1866 by William Stimpson. It used to be classified in the infraorder Thalassinidea (ghost shrimp) of decapod crustaceans until this infraorder was proven to be paraphyletic in 2009, after which the family Callianassidae, in which C. major is included, was definitely placed in the infraorder Axiidae (de Saint Laurent, 1979). A supposed Brazilian species described as Anomalocaris macrotelsonis (Ortmann, 1893) was eventually discovered in 1974 to be the fourth larval stage of C. major. In 1995, the results of genetic testing published by Staton and Felder concluded that Caribbean Colombian populations described as C. major could not belong to the same species as those found in the United States Atlantic Ocean. Among those in the United States, although there were minor morphological differences between the populations of the East Coast (from North Carolina to Georgia) and those of the Gulf of Mexico (from Louisiana to Texas), the overall internal diversity of each population made them genetically indistinguishable. Samples of Pacific Mexican ghost shrimps also later suggested a species not identical, but close to C. major s.s. Further testing by Peiró confirmed that populations of the East Coast and the Gulf of Mexico belonged to the same species, which was in turn different from the Colombian ones, but C. major was definitely described not as only two, but four distinct species with a monophyletic origin. Apart from C. major stricto sensu in the United States, the Colombian populations were found to belong to a different species than those of Pacific Mexico and Costa Rica. Those were described simply as C. aff. major sp. 2 and C. aff. major sp. 1, still pending binomial naming. The Brazilian populations, on the other hand, was successfully described as a fourth one, designed as C. macrotelsonis. The relative genetical proximity between Caribbean and Pacific populations implies a separation posterior to the uplift of the Isthmus of Panama. Rio confirmed Peiró's tests at a morphological level, suggesting that the absolute lack of information on vestigial signs of hermaphroditism in C. major s.s. might indicate that this feature could be exclusive of the Brazilian species, which she denominated C. brasiliensis sp. nov. Based on descriptions by Sakai and Türkay in 2012, Felder and Dworschak suggested that the formers' denomination C. santarosaensis might be ascribed to populations formerly designated as C. major in the northern Gulf of Mexico, although pending further genetic analysis and casting doubt on the validity of Sakai's and Türkay's description of a damaged juvenile specimen, prejudicing the validity of the taxon. Description The great morphological similarities between all species of the C. major complex has proven to be a difficulty for the distinction of its closely related species. The C. major has a carapace with a rigid anterior margin, turning backwards to the linea thalassinica (an uncalcified membranous groove, in the complex's case distinctly parallel to the longitudinal axis of the body) and forwards to the rounded angles of the branchiostegal lung. The sternum is inconspicuous between the first and third pairs of pereopods. The complex has a flanked rostrum, with characteristically obtuse angles near the base of the eyestalks, which in turn almost reach the basal segment of the antennules' peduncles. The antennules have a third segments 1.5 to 2.5 times as longer as the first and second together. The maxilla has distinctly separated coxae and bases. The first pair of pereopods is very unequal in size, especially in adult males, presenting a uniquely bold instance sexual dimorphism in the genus. The second pair is well chelated, but the fourth and fifth have rather imperfect chelae. The first and second segments of the abdomen are membranous and soft, the latter being longer than the first, and almost twice as long as the third, fourth and sixth segments. The third, fourth and sixth segments have approximately the same length, although the fifth is slightly longer than its adjacent segments. Distinctly for its genus, C. major is gonochoristic. The vestigial signs of ancestral hermaphroditism (namely, the production of unused ovaries by males and additional gonopores in females) in C. macrotelsonis and the fully functional hermaphroditism in sister species such as C. seillacheri, however, implies that the genus Callichirus may have a unique case of crustacean basal, but not universal, hermaphroditism.  Habitat  C. major s.l. occurs in open, dissipative and flat sandy beaches, mostly in deep galleries in the intertidal zone, but also in shallow subtidal depths of 2–3 m. It has a very large geographic distribution across Pan-American coastlines. In the Atlantic coastline, the distribution occurs from North Carolina to Santa Catarina, although with a large hiatus from Southern Texas to Pará, being therein only sporadically found in Colombia and Venezuela. In the Pacific coastline, the complex has been identified in both Baja California and Costa Rica. C. major s.l. is widely employed as living fishing bait by many human coastal populations, including those in the United States and Brazil, due to its easy availability. Ghost shrimp mass extraction, both specifically regarding C. major and generically, has been described as ecologically harmful not only for their own ecological stability, but also to different animals that are killed in the procedure. The complex's IUCN status has been suggested as critically endangered, although it has not been officially reviewed by the IUCN.

Since its amalgamation with another church in the city in November 2019, it has been one of England's largest Spiritualist churches. The church was formed in 1902 and has occupied various premises since then. The present building, which has been registered as a place of worship since 1965, is architecturally significant for its curved, windowless Brutalist form. It has been recognised as a locally listed heritage asset by Brighton and Hove City Council. History Brighton's first Spiritualist church was formally founded on 17 May 1902, when a committee of worshippers agreed to hold weekly services in \\"the room [in] which the meeting had been formerly held\\". The first president was elected at the same time. The use of rented rooms and premises ceased in 1921 when a former Baptist chapel came on the market. This was on the corner of Mighell Street and Carlton Hill in the Carlton Hill district, east of central Brighton. It was built in 1878 for Strict Baptists and was founded by Thomas Boxall and George Virgo, two Strict Baptist ministers. The former led the church until 1893, when Virgo—who was in also charge of Bethel Chapel in Wivelsfield—took over. The chapel fell out of use in 1910 and was subsequently used as the church hall for the nearby St John the Evangelist's Church. The committee of Spiritualist worshippers purchased the building for £1,250. With the name Brighton National Spiritualist Church, it was formally registered as a place of worship and for the solemnisation of marriages in January 1949. The Carlton Hill area, bounded on the southern edge by the narrow Edward Street, was one of Brighton's worst slum areas by the 1950s. \\"The face of the street was completely altered\\" by the clearance of unsuitable buildings in the 1950s and a programme of road widening between 1961 and 1964 on what was the main entry point to the town from the east. Many properties were compulsorily purchased, including the church on Mighell Street (whose site was occupied from 1977 by forecourt of Amex House, a corporate headquarters). In March 1961, shortly after the compulsory purchase order, the church was able to acquire a new site further along Edward Street. Work began on the present church building in 1964 and was completed the following year, and on 17 May 1965 the new Brighton National Spiritualist Church was registered in place of its predecessor. It was licensed for marriages six weeks later. Following the passing of the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013, the church was also registered for the solemnisation of same-sex marriages in July 2014. The church was reconstituted with effect from 23 November 2019, becoming Brighton and Hove National Spiritualist Church. On that date it merged with another Spiritualist church in the city which had given up its premises. The Brighton and Hove Central Spiritualist Church was first documented in April 1925, when it met at the Athenaeum Hall in North Street. This had been built in 1890 as a 500-capacity multi-purpose recreational and leisure hall; as well as having various secular uses, it was also the first home of the First Church of Christ, Scientist, Brighton until it moved to the Montpelier district of Brighton in 1921. Spiritualists used the hall until it was compulsorily purchased in 1962 for road widening and the construction of an office block. The congregation, which had been affiliated with the Spiritualists' National Union since 1941, shared the premises of Brotherhood Gate Church (another Spiritualist place of worship in Brighton) until 1965. In July 1966 they registered part of a building on Norfolk Terrace in the Montpelier area as a new place of worship; this was succeeded in 1978 by their new premises, a house and former brothel on Boundary Passage (an alleyway running along the ancient boundary between Brighton and Hove parishes). The new church was dedicated in December 1978 and formally registered in July 1984. It held its last service prior to the amalgamation on 4 November 2019. Brighton and Hove National Spiritualist Church describes itself as \\"one of the largest Spiritualist churches in the country.\\" Two Sunday services are held, and there are other sessions and demonstrations on all days except Tuesdays. It is affiliated with the Spiritualists' National Union. Architecture The firm of Overton & Partners were commissioned in 1964 to design the new church. They were later involved in the initial design scheme for Brighton Marina. The scheme architect was Bev Pike. The northern side of Edward Street dates entirely from the 1960s and 1970s and is lined with \\"prominent buildings\\" such as the church, which has an \\"unusual figure- of-eight design\\". The building is in two parts linked by an offset flat-roofed entrance bay. The longer left-hand section is oblong inside but with a \\"sinuous\\" kidney-shaped exterior. To the right is a smaller circular- or oval- shaped worship space lit by a round roof lantern. The left-hand worship space is also top-lit with square shafts; the exterior is entirely windowless, consisting of vertically laid concrete blocks in a pattern emulating stretcher bond brickwork. The softening effect of the curved exterior walls provides a contrast to their \\"starkly unperforated\\" mass; the \\"smooth angular entrance building\\" is also a contrast. The interior worship space is lined with brickwork. Brighton and Hove City Council placed the church on their Local List of Heritage Assets in 2015, describing it as a \\"good example of a modern design of place of worship\\", \\"contribut[ing] positively to the streetscene\\" and having a \\"largely unaltered\\" exterior.

It initially operated under the name Rancho Mesquite. The hotel portion, originally part of the Holiday Inn chain, opened in August 1996. The casino opened on February 14, 1997. The Rancho Mesquite was owned by the Lee family, who were the only Nevada casino owners to be of Asian descent. Because of confusion with other businesses, the name was changed to Eureka in 2000. In 2016, the Eureka was sold to its 550 employees through an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP), becoming one of two casinos in the United States to be employee-owned. History Real estate developer Ted Lee had considered making a land investment in Laughlin, Nevada during the 1980s, but ultimately passed on the idea. He was later surprised to learn of Laughlin's rapid growth within a few years, and decided to figure out which city in Nevada could be next for such growth. Mesquite was considered one possibility, and a month later, an investment group from that city contacted Lee about a possible investment on property located at the intersection of Pioneer Boulevard and Mesa Boulevard. The group wanted to build a hotel and casino on the land, but eventually abandoned the project and sold the property around 1989 to Lee, who proceeded with the idea. However, he was skeptical that Mesquite, with its small population, could sustain another casino property. At the time, the only casino in Mesquite was the Oasis. Lee initially intended to name his hotel-casino \\"Conastoga\\". He put his project on hold when construction began across the street on a rival hotel-casino called the Virgin River, which opened in 1990. Planning for Lee's project, now called Rancho Mesquite, was underway again in early 1995. Groundbreaking took place on August 22, 1995. Lee still had some concerns about whether the city could sustain more gambling, as three new casinos – the others being Players Island and the Mesquite Star – would be opening in Mesquite within a year of each other. Construction was halted by the city at one point because the general contractor on the project had failed to comply with building codes. The hotel was affiliated with the Holiday Inn brand and opened in August 1996, with 215 rooms, located in a four-story building. The Rancho Mesquite casino opened on February 14, 1997, in a separate building located on the same property. It was Mesquite's fourth casino, and was operated by Longhorn Group, which also owned two casinos in Las Vegas. The casino building included 500 slot machines and 13 table games. It also featured a restaurant, bar, and lounge with live entertainment. When it opened, the Lee family were the only casino owners in Nevada to be of Asian descent. At the time of its opening, many gaming observers considered the Mesquite casino market to be overbuilt, although rival casinos believed that the opening of the Rancho Mesquite would be beneficial for all casinos in the city by increasing overall business. The Rancho Mesquite featured a southwestern theme, and its target clientele consisted of residents from southern Nevada and southern Utah. According to Lee, observers were critical of the Rancho Mesquite's layout, although he believed that having two different buildings, separated by a parking lot, would provide better access for local patrons of the casino. The Rancho Mesquite struggled initially. Greg Lee, the son of Ted Lee, lived at the hotel and served as president of the Rancho Mesquite. Greg Lee became familiar with regular customers and their opinions of the property, and he used this knowledge to improve the Rancho Mesquite by adding a steakhouse and newer slot machines. The property also signed a deal to become the host hotel for golf packages at the Wolf Creek Golf Club in Mesquite. In November 1997, an episode of Promised Land was filmed at the casino. =Eureka= In November 1999, the Lee family was planning to rename the Rancho Mesquite as the Eureka, to avoid confusion with other businesses such as the Mesquite Star. A contest was also launched for customers to submit their own name ideas with the chance of being selected instead of \\"Eureka\\". Nearly 1,500 names were submitted by more than 700 participants. On December 31, 1999, the Lee family announced that Eureka would be the new name. The Lees already operated a small Eureka casino in the Las Vegas Valley. Greg Lee said, \\"We've always liked the name, 'Eureka'. It is synonymous with discovery, excitement, and finding something valuable. The slogan, 'Eureka, I've Found It,' has been a part of western lore since the Gold Rush in 1849. Furthermore, the name is short, active and usable on billboards\\". Lee said that the old name seemed \\"very generic,\\" stating, \\"Over the years, there have been five other casinos (in Mesquite), and a lot of residential development. Our name seemed like it was no longer connoting a casino, and could be confused with other developments. We wanted to give it a name denoting fortune, gaming and what a casino is.\\" Lee also said that because of population growth, there \\"are a lot more businesses with the name 'Rancho' and 'Mesquite', and this was confusing our customers.\\" At the time of the name change, the Lees had ended the property's affiliation with Holiday Inn. The name change was expected to become effective in March 2000. As of 2003, the Eureka had 350 employees. That year, the Eureka surpassed the Virgin River to become the most successful casino in Mesquite, which was seeing a continual rise in its population. A $30 million renovation began in 2005, and concluded two years later. The project expanded the casino and added a buffet, while another $3 million was spent renovating the hotel. The casino expansion included 300 new slot machines and a new sportsbook and poker room. As of 2009, Greg Lee remained as the only Asian casino owner in Nevada. At the time, further expansion plans were on hold due to the economic effects of the Great Recession. In 2010, the Eureka began hosting a popular and annual Fourth of July celebration known as \\"Rockets over the Red Mesa\\". In February 2013, the Eureka hosted an off-road vehicle event on vacant land adjacent to the resort. The event was attended by 7,000 people, and included Nitro Circus rider Tanner Godfrey breaking a Guinness World Record for longest jump on an ATV. Later that year, the resort allowed the installation of a radio transmitter on its roof to expand coverage for KNPR. After two years of consideration, the Lee family announced in October 2015 that they would sell their interest in the Eureka to its 550 workers through an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP). Greg Lee said that the gaming industry had been stagnant since 2007, and that an ESOP would allow the Eureka to strategize future growth. The sale would also allow employees to earn certain retirement benefits via the resort's profits. The Lee family had always considered the employees to be part of their own family, with Greg Lee stating, \\"Many of them have been with us since my father and mother first opened the Eureka in 1997. The ESOP makes the Eureka even more of a 'family business' and honors the employees' contributions to our success.\\" The sale was approved by the Nevada Gaming Control Board and the Nevada Gaming Commission in November 2015. Two months later, the Mesquite City Council unanimously approved the transfer of gaming and liquor licenses to the ESOP. The Eureka is one of two casinos in the United States to be owned through an ESOP, the other being the Casino Queen in East St. Louis, Illinois. Lee remained as the chief executive officer of the Eureka, while Andre Carrier remained as chief operating officer and also serves as trustee of the ESOP. As of 2017, the casino is managed by Rancho Mesquite Casino Company. Doris Lee, one of the founders of the property, died of lymphoma in 2018, at the age of 98. In 2018 and 2019, the Eureka was included on Fortunes Top 100 Medium Workplaces, a list consisting of U.S. businesses with less than 1,000 workers. Eureka employees told Fortune, \\"We are one huge family and deeply care for one another.\\" Features The Eureka has 214 hotel rooms and a casino, which includes 1,000 slot machines, and the only 24-hour poker room in Mesquite. It also has three restaurants: Gregory's Mesquite Grill, Mason Street Courtyard, and Town Square Buffet. The Eureka also includes the Grand Canyon Ballroom, used for hosting various events. When the Mesquite Local News ran its Best of Mesquite reader poll in 2013, the Eureka won more accolades than any other business, for 13 categories that included best casino, hotel, and restaurants. Las Vegas location The Lees opened their original Eureka casino in 1988. It was built at 595 East Sahara Avenue in Paradise, Nevada, located in the Las Vegas Valley. The Eureka was built east of the Las Vegas Strip and is small in comparison to most gaming properties in the area.

Smith (born October 16, 1971), is an American translational research virologist, Chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases and Global Public Health at the University of California San Diego (UC San Diego), Co- Director of the San Diego Center for AIDS Research (SD CFAR), and Vice Chair of Faculty in the Department of Medicine at UC San Diego. His research interests include transmission, prevention, and treatment of both HIV and SARS-CoV2 (COVID-19). Since joining the UC San Diego faculty in 2003, Smith has been awarded more than $37 million in federal funding as a Principal Investigator. His research interests include transmission, prevention, and treatment of both HIV and SARS-CoV2 (COVID-19).  Career  Early career = Davey Smith working in the lab Smith earned his BS in Biology (summa cum laude) in 1992 from the University of Tennessee, Chattanooga, and his MD from East Tennessee State University College of Medicine in Johnson City in 1996. He then moved to the University of California San Diego (UC San Diego), where he completed his internship and residency (1999), Chief Residency (2000), a Fellowship in Infectious Diseases (2003), and earned his MAS in Clinical Research (2005). Smith is board certified in infectious diseases, and a Fellow of both the American College of Physicians and the Infectious Diseases Society of America. In 2015, he was elected to the American Society for Clinical Investigation. In 2003, Smith was appointed Assistant Adjunct Professor of Medicine at UC San Diego. He was promoted to Associate Professor of Medicine in Residence in 2009, and named Co-Director of the San Diego Center for AIDS Research (SD CFAR) in 2014. He was promoted to Professor in 2013 and then Vice Chair of Faculty in 2016. In 2017, Smith began his service as Chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases and Global Public Health, where he oversees more than 100 faculty. In addition to his academic and administrative appointments at UC San Diego, Smith helped found in 2001 and continues to serve as Medical Director of The Night Clinic of Family Health Centers of San Diego. The Night Clinic provides culturally competent medical care to gay men and transgender individuals. He has also served the VA San Diego Healthcare System since 2005 as a staff physician and Director of the HIV/HCV and HIV/HPV Co-infections Clinics. = HIV research = Smith is a translational research virologist. He applies laboratory research to inform clinical studies and vice versa in the U.S. and internationally. He studies HIV transmission, including HIV superinfection, molecular epidemiology, and the characteristics of HIV found in the genital tract. One of Smith's most innovative projects to date is the NIH-funded Last Gift Study, designed to identify hidden reservoirs of HIV through rapid autopsies of individuals who lived with HIV and were diagnosed with an unrelated terminal illness, such as cancer, neurological conditions, or end-stage organ failure. In summary, Smith's research represents an effort to understand the drivers of HIV transmission and find new ways to interrupt them. = SARS-CoV-2 Research = In late 2019, when reports of a novel coronavirus began circulating, Smith immediately began investigating causes, preventatives, and potential cures with colleagues in the Division of Infectious Diseases and Global Public Health at UC San Diego. He currently leads or contributes to a number of COVID-19 studies at UC San Diego and across the United States. Smith was also instrumental in coordinating a $1 million donation from the John and Mary Tu Foundation to support his COVID-19 clinical research activities. Additionally, in March 2020, in his role as Co- Director of the San Diego Center for AIDS Research (SD CFAR), Smith encouraged collaborative partnerships across the 17 NIH-funded Centers for AIDS Research (CFARs) to pool laboratory equipment, methods, and knowledge applicable to HIV and easily transferable to studies of the novel coronavirus.  Awards and Honors  Smith has earned numerous accolades for his academic success. In 2002, he received the Associate Investigator Award from the VA San Diego Healthcare System. In 2005, he was elected to the National Center for Leadership in Academic Medicine at UC San Diego. Also in 2005, Discover Magazine acknowledged one of Smith's papers on HIV superinfection as #41 of the top 100 stories of 2004. In 2008, Smith earned San Diego Metropolitan magazine's 40 Under 40 award, which annually recognizes local young leaders. In 2010, Smith received the HIV Medical Association Research Award, presented by the Infectious Diseases Society of America. In 2012, the National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA) named Smith a recipient of a $2.5 million Avant Garde Award in HIV Prevention for his proposal on “Molecular Epidemiology for HIV Prevention for Drug Users and Other Risk Groups”. And in both 2012 and 2014, Smith received Internal Medicine Residency Teaching Awards presented by UC San Diego's Chief Medical Residents. Smith also has received recognition for his community involvement, beginning in 2001, when he earned the Men's Volunteer Award from the San Diego Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Community Center (LGBT Center). In 2005, he received the Transgender Community Coalition Community Service Award, as well as the Outstanding Volunteer of the Year Award (Medical) from AIDS Walk San Diego. In 2009, he received the prestigious A. Brad Truax Award for outstanding HIV/AIDS service, presented by the County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency.  Professional Failures  Smith believes in highlighting professional challenges and failures. He thinks it is important to acknowledge that being a physician scientist requires resilience, and that it helps others who are trying to be physician scientists to openly share such \\"failures”.  Personal  In addition to academic and clinical research, Smith has developed equal passions for creative writing, travel, and adventurous dining. His friend and colleague, Sanjay R. Mehta, MD, Assistant Professor of Medicine at UC San Diego, said in 2013, “If this HIV stuff gets boring for [Smith], he'll do great as the next host of ‘Bizarre Foods,' as he's willing to test his palate all over the world.” Smith has published poems in JAMA and Annals of Internal Medicine, and still finds time to write. He is currently writing a book on becoming a virologist physician scientist in the time of viral pandemics. In 2015, Smith married his long-time partner, Asherlev Santos, Assistant Professor in the Public Health graduate program at California State University San Marcos.

Brief history of Basque anarchism. From its origins to the 21st century , Ed. Txertoa, San Sebastián, 2011; Biography Acracio Martínez Prieto was born in Santurtzi as the son of an anarchist father, his named was changed to Horacio by the Bilbao civil registry of the Ollerías neighborhood. Horacio studied at a municipal school, where he was beaten by his teacher – to which his father responded with a knife. Despite being a good student, Horacio did not receive any scholarship and had to immediately find work. As a teenager, he discarded all the predominant ideologies (nationalism, socialism or Carlism) and instead formed a libertarian group, \\"Los sin patria\\" (Those without country). Horacio was saved from being lynched by a group of Basque nationalists, due to the intervention of a rival gang from the Bilbao neighborhood of Bolueta. He took up the habit of carrying a pistol, which landed him in the Larrinaga prison in Bilbao at only 18 years of age, where he came into contact with a variety of different comrades. An attack in Altos Hornos de Vizcaya meant for Horacio the beginning of a long series of dangerous incidents, which forced him into exile in France, leaving his mother, already a widow, in Bilbao. Not long after Primo de Rivera's coup in 1923, Horacio participated in an attempted anarchist takeover of Vera de Bidasoa, but managed to escape again.Horacio Martínez Prieto in the Basque Illustrated Encyclopedia Auñamendi In 1931, when the Second Spanish Republic was proclaimed, he joined the CNT. In 1932 he was invited by the PCE to visit Russia along with the director of Tierra Vasca, but he returned with unfavorable impressions – he was initially cautious in sharing his views but later published a pamphlet that was critical of the Soviet system. Following the CNT's participation in the Revolution of 1934, he took the post of Deputy Secretary of the CNT, and in 1935 at the Congress of Zaragoza, Prieto replaced Miguel Yoldi as the CNT's general secretary. The outbreak of the Spanish Civil War surprised Prieto in Bilbao, where he represented the CNT in the Basque Defence Council until he moved to Barcelona. Due to his proposal to involve the CNT in the governments of Azaña and Largo Caballero, he was accused of being a traitor and a liquidationist, which led him to resign from his post in November 1936, although he continued representing the Northern Region in the CNT's National Committee and as a member of the Political Advisory Commission (CAP), from where he defended the participation of the CNT in the government of the Second Spanish Republic. Affiliated with the FAI, he was general director of commerce under the ministry of Juan López Sánchez (November 1936 – May 1937) and Undersecretary of Health under Segundo Blanco (April 1938 – February 1939).Entry into the Auñamendi Eusko Entziklopedia by Ainhoa Arozamena Ayala Consulted in June 2014 From the magazine Timón , directed by Diego Abad de Santillán, he defended his view that the FAI be transformed into a political party. At the same time he was part of an alliance committee with the UGT and called for the opening of negotiations with the Nationalist faction.htm MARTÍNEZ PRIETO, Horacio a The Anarchist Encyclopaedia At the end of the war he went into exile, where he was a leading member of the Spanish Libertarian Movement, defending anarchist participation in the Spanish Republican government in exile. He was Minister of Development in the two governments of José Giral (1945–1947) and was one of the signatories of the manifesto of January 23, 1948, calling for the transformation of the MLE into a political party. Horacio Martínez Prieto died in his Parisian exile, leaving six volumes of memoirs and several pamphlets on anarcho-syndicalism, the USSR and the future of the CNT unpublished.

She is noted for founding Battersea Dog's Home. It was founded in Holloway, London in 1860 and moved to Battersea in 1871.  Life  Tealby was born in Huntingdon in 1801. She gained a younger brother who like her father was named Edward. He would in time be the curate at Kelmarsh in Northamptonshire. She married, Robert Chapman Tealby, in 1829. They lived in Hull and they had no children. Whilst she was there, the first branch of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (it became the RSPCA in 1840) was formed by a group of men. Tealby is presumed to have been a supporter. She and Robert separated and this may initially have been so that she could care for her mother in London. She died in Holloway in 1854. She kept her married name and went to live with her father and her brother. Her brother had moved his career to Clipston, Northamptonshire where he was at the school when he was appointed to be master of the medical school of Clipston Hospital at £100 a year in 1856. For some reason he gave up this position and moved to London in 1860. The three of them had a modest lifestyle and they employed two servants. Tealby divorced her husband in the same year. Advert for the home she founded in 1901 (long after she died) She was still a member and supporter of the RSPCA. She cared for an abandoned dog that had been found by her friend Sarah Major, but it died and she decided to set up a place where abandoned dogs could be cared for. She called it \\"The Temporary Home for and Starving Dogs\\" and it was founded in North London in 1860. Initially the home was in her scullery but as the number of dogs delivered to her grew she hired some nearby stables funded by herself, her brother and Sarah Major. The costs were met by asking for donations and Tealby and Major found several generous backers. In 1860 the RSPCA agreed to assist and the committee meetings were held at the RSPCA offices at 12 Pall Mall. The Islington Gazette and the English Churchman were supportive and Punch predictably made jokes. The home for dog's moved to Battersea where it gained some resistance from sleepless neighbours. The Times ran a story ridiculing the idea of opening a \\"home\\" for dogs when there were homeless people in London. The paper did not name her but it accused her of \\"letting her zeal ...outrun her discretion\\". Despite this the home attracted supporters, and its most impressive supporter in the 1860s was Charles Dickens. He had a huge following and was an enthusiastic but realistic dog supporter. He wrote about a \\"remarkable institution\\" that had saved \\"over a thousand\\" dogs in 1860. He noted that the dogs were cared for but if necessary humanely disposed of. By 1864 the finances were sound and they were handling 2,000 dogs that year. Tealby died in Biggleswade in 1865 and she was buried at Church of St Andrew, Biggleswade. Sarah Major and her brother reinvigorated the home after the loss of the founder. Until the 1980s the annual report started with an acknowledgement of the home's founder.  Legacy  The Battersea home continued and in 1883 it took in cats as well. In 2015, Queen Elizabeth II unveiled a plaque to officially open the intake kennels named after their founder, Mary Tealby kennels. In the same year, a plaque was erected in Islington.

It was designed by Emmanuel Héré de Corny to honor the French king Louis XV and was built between 1752 and 1755. Its architecture is inspired by the Arch of Septimius Severus in Rome. The Arc replaced an older royal gate constructed under the rule of Louis XIV; three bas reliefs from the old gate are featured on the Arc. The Arc displays motifs of war and peace, with one side featuring arrowheads and armor and the other featuring wheat ears and cornucopias. The top of the Arc bears an inscription reading: \\"HOSTIUM TERROR / FOEDERUM CULTOR / GENTISQUE DECUS ET AMOR\\" (\\"terror of the enemies, maker of treaties, and the glory and love of his people\\"), referring to Louis XV. To the sides of the inscription are statues of the deities Ceres, Minerva, Hercules, and Mars. Above the inscription is an acroterion comprising gilded statues of Minerva, Pax (the Roman goddess personifying peace), and Fama (the Roman goddess personifying glory), all surrounding a medallion of Louis XV. Below the inscription are three marble bas reliefs taken from the old royal gateway that stood here before the construction of the Arc; they were retained for their depictions of Apollo, to whom Louis XV was often compared in imagery and art.  History  The original white marble medallion of Louis XV on top of the Arc was destroyed during the French Revolution. It was quickly replaced with a gilded lead medallion, which was taken down for preservation in 1830 during the July Revolution. It was eventually replaced on the Arc in 1852. The Arc was designated a monument historique in 1923. It forms part of the architectural ensemble comprising the Place Stanislas, the Place de la Carrière, and the Place d'Alliance, which in 1983 was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Another scientific name for it is Ricania shantungensis, more commonly known as the brown winged cicada This species is considered an agricultural and forestry pest (M.A. Rahman et al., 2012). It is mainly found along the roadsides in the Zhejiang Province. Also found in orchards in the Shantung province. It has recently been classified as an invasive species within western parts of Korean and turkey. Characteristics The body length of P. shantungensis can vary depending on gender. Males typically exhibit a body length from vertex to tip of genitalia of 7.5 - 7.8 mm. They also exhibit a 14.0 - 14.4 mm body length from vertex to the tip of the forewings. Females are bigger and exhibit a body length from vertex to tip of genitalia of 8.3 - 8.8 mm. From the vertex to the tip of the forewings is 15.0 - 15.3 mm. The coloration of these insects range from dark brown to black. Their vertex, frons, clypeus, rostrum, and eyes are often brown to dark brown. The pronotum and mesonotum are black along with the thorax. The forewings are dark brown but have an elliptical white spot around the costal margin. It is roughly two- thirds from the base. The posterior margin of the abdomen segments are yellow. These planthoppers lay their eggs in a zigzag pattern. They are then covered with white wax filaments. These eggs are often found within trees regardless of height or direction of the branch. Habitat Commonly found within the Zhejiang Province in China. It is also commonly found within the Shandong province of China, in the eastern coastal regions. However, they are only listed as a pest within Zhejiang Province. This species has been reported as an invasive species in the coastal areas of Southern Korea. These areas are similar in annual temperature and precipitation. Pochazia shantungensis can live in various types of landscapes such as cities, orchards, agricultural fields, and forests. Pochazia shantungensis is found to favor higher density in mountain regions and valleys. Invasive species The species has recently been labeled as an invasive species as it has moved from its usual habitat in China to locations such as Turkey and Korea. Some common hosts are apple, blueberry, Korean black raspberry, Schisandra chinensis, lacquer tree, Aralia elata, jujube, apple, Cedrela sinensis, chestnut, magnolia, quince, plum and acacia. Other common hosts in Korea: Malus pumila, Diospyros kaki, Zelkova serrata, Aralia elata, Styrax japonicus, Salix gracilistyla, Broussonetia kazinoki, Albizia julibrissin, Ailanthus altissima, Chaenomeles sinensis, Rubus crataegifolius, Castanea crenata, and Robinia pseudoacacia. In the Kurye, Jeonnam area the damage occurred on fruit trees, such as Cornus, persimmon, and chestnut. It seems to mainly affect fruit bearing trees/bushes. In an experiment studying the outbreak, the species preferred Cornus officinalis, Diospyros kaki, Castanea crenata, Eucommia ulmoides, and Styrax japonicus to lay their eggs. The eggs were laid on the inner twigs of the trees and each egg-mass had an average of 28 eggs. This is one of the ways that Pochazia can damage the trees. The eggs suck the nutrients out of the trees and cause a sooty mold. Damage Pochazia shantungensis has been classified as an invasive species because it has been affecting agricultural farms. The species causes damage to common agricultural plants such as apples and blueberries. As mentioned previously, it causes damage by sucking the nutrients out of the trees that it lays its egg. This indirectly causes the sooty mold disease found commonly on these plants. These eggs hatch around mid may to early June with the spawning season occurring in mid August. Control/mitigation Mitigation depends on how the farm/region wants to pursue the process of removing this species. One study found that there are environmentally friendly materials that can be used to control both the nymph and adult Ricana with a mortality rate of above 80%. The use of sophora and natural plant extracts can help alleviate this problem. Another mitigation solution involves using yellow-colored sticky traps. The sticky trap made it possible to safely remove the eggs during spawning season. The traps should be placed around common locations for oviposition depending on the farm and plant. It also deters the Ricania shantungensis from laying eggs there again, as the eggs don't survive.

Bishop Melentije is mentioned among the renovators and restorers of the Serbian state. Melentije was the son of Simeon Nikšić. He became a hieromonk in 1800. He distinguished himself in the First Serbian Uprising, and in 1813 he fled to Srem and lived as archimandrite for some time in the Fenek monastery, Vraćevšnica monastery and Studenica where he brought the golden cross with the scene of the Crucifixion, a gift of the Russian Emperor Alexander. Later, Prince Miloš Obrenović sent him and voivode Aksentije Miladinović as envoys on a mission to Constantinople, where he was consecrated bishop of Šabac. Melentije Nikšić was very proud and wrote about himself: \\"Bishop of Užice-Valjevo-Rudnik and Archbishop of Šabac\\". At the time, this was seen as a great success, a first Serb to be appointed to a See in Serbia proper since the time of the abolition of the Patriarchate of Peć in 1766. Prince Miloś was afraid of that respectable, rich and ambitious bishop, so Marko Štitarac had him killed under Miloš's instructions at a time when a coup d'état was being planned where Bishop Melentije, Petar Nikolajević Moler and others were implicated.

It is situated on the boundary of Glacier Peak Wilderness, on land managed by Wenatchee National Forest. Its nearest higher peak is Emerald Peak, to the south-southwest, and Cardinal Peak is positioned to the south. Precipitation runoff from the ridge drains into nearby Lake Chelan via Emerald Creek and Bearcat Creek. Bearcat Ridge forms the high divide between these two creek valleys. Climate Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Geology Bearcat Ridge is composed primarily of granodiorite and hornblende quartz diorite, minerals of the Cardinal Peak pluton. Bearcat Ridge from Emerald ParkThe North Cascades feature some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, spires, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. Glacier Peak, a stratovolcano that is west of Bearcat Ridge, began forming in the mid- Pleistocene.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

Biography Kermode was born Georgina Elizabeth Fawns in Barnet, United Kingdom in 1868, daughter of the Rev. J. Fawns, of Launceston. Her family were from Tasmania and when she was seventeen Kermode married another Tasmanian landowner Robert Crellin Kermode. She lived in Mona Vale, known as Calendar house probably as a result of its 12 chimneys. By the time she was twenty seven Kermode had become an active suffragette and ran the Campbell Town Woman's Christian Temperance Union. Kermode became the Colonial Suffrage Superintendent of the WCTU. She organised propaganda to put pressure on politicians and in 1896 she arranged a winter campaign of meetings and petitions all over Tasmania. She worked with Jessie Rooke. Her husband held mining interests and Kermode became a director of the Tasmanian Metals Extraction Co. Ltd. She became an expert in the metal ores of Tasmania. The business had technical difficulties in reaching the metals and Kermode travelled to England to gain expertise in the electrolytic extraction for the treatment of the zinc-lead ores in about 1904. Kermode did not return to Australia. Her husband did travel to the UK when he joined the army in 1914. From 1907 to 1923 Kermode took out patents for a variety of inventions. There were 27 across the United Kingdom, France, Switzerland, Denmark and the United States. Her main inventions related to the automatic vending of postage stamps. The UK post office bought her automatic machines and the very first of them was put in Houses of Parliament. They were in place until 1920. One of the advantages of her machines was the improved ability to detect counterfeit coins. Other patents were for improvements in furnaces, breathing apparatus for firefighters and divers, and a diving suit. When she was elected to the Institute of Metals on 21 December 1916 Kermode became the first woman to be a member. She was a regular attendee at institute events and was involved in other mining organisations. She died in Middlesex and was taken to Tasmania to be buried.

Houghton Mifflin Company, 1994. Production The design was built by Tillotson Pearson in the United States for Alden Yachts, but it is now out of production. Design The Alden 44 is a recreational keelboat, built predominantly of fiberglass, with wood trim. It has a raked stem, a raised counter reverse transom, a skeg-mounted rudder controlled by a wheel, aluminum spars and a fixed stub fin keel, with a retractable centerboard. It displaces and carries of lead ballast. The boat has a variety of possible interior layouts, but typical is sleeping accommodation for seven people, with a double \\"V\\"-berth in the bow cabin, an \\"L\\"-shaped settee, with a drop-leaf table and a straight settee, plus a pilot berth in the main cabin and an aft cabin with two berths. The aft cabin has its own companionway ladder from the cockpit. The galley is located on the starboard side beside the forward companionway ladder with the double sink located underneath the steps. The galley is equipped with a propane-fired three-burner stove and oven as well as a refrigerator and a freezer. The large head is located just forward of the aft cabin on the port side, with access from the aft cabin and the main cabin. It includes a shower. Main cabin trim is of ash wood. Ventilation is provided by five translucent hatches and seven opening ports. For sailing the design is equipped with two winches for the main halyard, two for the genoa halyard, two for the spinnaker halyard and two for the staysail halyard, two primary and two secondary winches for the genoa sheets, two for the staysail sheets, two for the mainsheet, two for the spinnaker sheets and one for the outhaul. The majority of the installed winches are self-tailing. The design also has a topping lift. Variants ;Alden 44 :This cutter rig model was designed by Neils Helleberg and introduced in 1976. It was designated as Alden design #1036xx. It remained in production until 1991, with 40 examples completed. It has a length overall of and has a waterline length of . The boat has a draft of with the centreboard extended and with it retracted. The boat is fitted with a Perkins Engines 4-108 diesel engine. The fuel tank holds and the fresh water tank has a capacity of . A tall rig was also available, with a mast about higher. The staysail is boom-mounted. Both the staysail and its stay are removed for racing and it is sailed as a masthead sloop. The design has a PHRF racing average handicap of 99 and a Portsmouth Yardstick of 79.4. ;Alden 44 MII :This later masthead sloop model was designed by Alden Yachts and introduced in 1981. It incorporates a different rudder and skeg configuration and moves the propeller forward, out of the skeg slot. A new interior layout was also introduced. The design has a length overall of and has a waterline length of . The boat has a draft of with the centreboard extended and with it retracted. The boat is fitted with a Japanese Yanmar diesel engine. Operational history In a 1994 review Richard Sherwood wrote, \\"The Alden [44] is designed for IOR competition but has many cruising amenities. The hull is moderate displacement. She is claimed to be fast, dry, stiff, and close-winded.\\" Reviewer Steve Knauth described the design in 2014, in Soundings, \\"the 44 was different from the old schooners, with its cutter rig, keel/centerboard and skeg-hung rudder. Yet it was perfectly in the Alden tradition of racing/cruising yachts. The boat could handle a crew of seven — enough for a Bermuda Race — and its competitive qualities were soon apparent. The Alden 44 quickly established a reputation for bluewater racing and passagemaking.\\" He concludes that it \\"remains one of the prettiest sailboats you'll see in any harbor.\\" See also *List of sailing boat types Similar sailboats *Nauticat 44 *Worldcruiser 44 References Category:Keelboats Category:1970s sailboat type designs Category:Sailing yachts ","title":"Alden 44"},{"id":"64007956","text":"Supper at Emmaus may refer to one of three autograph works by Rembrandt: * Supper at Emmaus (Rembrandt, Musee Jacquemart-Andre), painting, 1628 * Supper at Emmaus (Rembrandt, Louvre), painting, 1648 * Supper at Emmaus (Rembrandt etching), etching, 1654 A further studio work (1648) is in the National Gallery of Denmark.

reality Garry's Mod recreation of the video game Half-Life. The series was live streamed to Twitch, with highlights uploaded to YouTube, and follows Gordon Freeman, accompanied by additional characters controlled by other improv actors, going through the events of the original video game. The series was met with positive reception by critics. On May 12, 2020, a cast commentary series began being uploaded to the WayneRadioTV YouTube channel. On May 31st, 2020, a sequel, AI Crushes All Banks (often abbreviated as ACAB) was streamed as part of a charity drive https://mobile.twitter.com/wayneradiotv/status/1266799252774301699?lang=en , set in Payday 2, in which the main cast begins a bank robbing spree across the city of Washington DC.  Format  Half-Life VR but the AI is Self-Aware loosely follows the events of the original Half-Life, albeit with a much more humorous tone, with main character Gordon Freeman (played by series host WayneRadioTV) accidentally causing a Resonance Cascade and exploring Black Mesa to try to undo his actions. The series' main divergence from the original is the introduction of original \\"self-aware AI\\" characters, who despite the name of the series, are played by other improv actors. Similarly, the series is actually played within the game Garry's Mod, as Half-Life lacks support for virtual reality and additional features necessary for the staging of the series (such as limitations with object spawning and map sizes). The most notable actor-controlled characters are the series' supporting cast: three scientists named Bubby, Dr. Coomer, and Tommy, as well as an antagonistic security guard named Benrey, all four of whom follow Gordon in his journey through Black Mesa, generally to Gordon's detriment. CharactersMain characters= * Gordon Freeman (played by WayneRadioTV): The primary protagonist of the series. A scientist at Black Mesa, Gordon is the straight man of the series, reacting with confusion and horror to the rest of the cast’s actions. Gordon gradually becomes more manic and stressed over the course of the series due to the absurdities he is subjected to. Gordon and Tommy eventually form a strong alliance due to Tommy's lack of insanity relative to the rest of the science team. Midway through the series, Bubby and Benrey betray him to the US Military and get his arm cut off; later, it is replaced with a large gun, able to fire bullet-like fingernails. As a reference to previous WayneRadioTV streams, Gordon has an infant son named Joshua, who he keeps a picture of in his locker; upon seeing it, Benrey proclaims Joshua to “look a bit shit.” Gordon and Benrey are bitter enemies; while their rivalry initially consists of bickering, and the two occasionally get along, following Benrey’s betrayal, Gordon takes a much more violent approach, occasionally firing at Benrey, and the two’s relationship devolves into sheer hatred. Unlike his fellow teammates, Gordon refuses to kill civilians, though he still generally winds up doing so by accident. * Dr. Harold Pontiff Coomer (played by Hollowtones): A delusional, babbling scientist, who appears to be a severely glitched tutorial NPC. Dr. Coomer is often suicidally ignorant and stupid, running into barnacles and nearly getting himself killed after mistaking them for ropes repeatedly, and frequently interrupts himself or cuts off his own sentences. He eventually reveals he is aware of his role as a character in a video-game, and makes an attempt to possess Gordon and escape into the real world. Dr. Coomer has numerous clones throughout Black Mesa, which he kills on sight, as he claims the more clones he kills, the more powerful he becomes. One of his recurring jokes is a reference to the Nintendo 3DS \\"PlayCoin\\" virtual currency which is used on certain titles for the console, which Gordon can exchange for help with the game. In the final act, Gordon uses two \\"PlayCoins\\" to allow Dr. Coomer to use the \\"forbidden science\\" and defeat Benrey. In his past, Dr. Coomer set up an illegal boxing ring in Black Mesa, and his lifelong dream is to become a professional boxer. Coomer generally isn't a fan of video games, although he does have a soft spot for Super Punch-Out!!, a boxing game for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. At some point, Dr. Coomer had a wife, but \\"they took her in the divorce.\\" He frequently expresses loathing for his ex- wife, and claims she forced him into being a scientist rather than a boxer. His catchphrases are “Hello Gordon!”, “Don't fuck with the Science Team!”, “Hole!” and \\"Look, Gordon! Ropes!\\" * Tommy Coolatta (played by Baaulp): A childlike, friendly scientist. He and Gordon form a close bond over the course of the series, with Tommy being Gordon's only support after the betrayal of the rest of the team. Tommy is an orphan, and he admits to having chosen his last name off of the Dunkin Donuts drink of the same name; his only friend was an immortal dog he created and named Sunkist, who is bulletproof and capable of flight. Tommy is addicted to soda, and he claims that drinking it “helps you see faster”; Gordon realizes Tommy is actually undergoing a caffeine overdose. Tommy has a lack of knowledge about gun safety also known as bad trigger discipline, and frequently shoots innocent civilians and his teammates by accident due to constantly holding the trigger of his gun(s). Tommy is referred to as a child by multiple characters due to his childlike demeanor, but occasionally proclaims that he is 36, and celebrates his 37th birthday at the end of the series. Tommy is shown to be extraordinarily competent at his job and intelligent in spite of his childlike nature, and is one of the few competent employees of Black Mesa outside of Gordon, having a degree in nuclear engineering, frequently editing Wikipedia articles for leisure, generally enjoying reading and writing documentation, and enjoying drinking mint julep on a hot summer day. His father is revealed to be the G-Man, and Wayne states that they are biologically related, referring to their similarities in appearance. * Bubby (played by MasterGir): A crass and narcissistic scientist. He was created in a test tube in the depths of Black Mesa, and has lived in the facility for his whole life. During his time in the tube, he had knowledge injected directly into his brain, and thus has a doctorate. Dr. Coomer jokingly called Bubby \\"Professor\\", to which Bubby argues that he should be called \\"Doctor\\". There are failed versions of test tube scientists set free after the Resonance Cascade, called Prototypes. The Prototypes look similar to Bubby, but are unable to talk and are hostile towards anyone that approaches them. They appear throughout Black Mesa and are present in the final boss fight. Bubby is rather impulsive, often rushing into danger, injuring himself, repeatedly triggering traps, or detonating explosive devices mere feet away from other people. Bubby is very short-tempered, and often reacts violently to slights real or perceived, at one point shooting a scientist for owing him five dollars. * Benrey (played by Socpens): An antagonistic security guard with a perpetually calm demeanor who continuously harasses Gordon over not having his passport. He is capable of using the “Black Mesa Sweet Voice” to produce balls of light with different emotional effects. Benrey is frequently shown to be delusional, frequently citing events that never happened or reinterpreting events to show him in the best possible light, and often blames Gordon for crimes that he clearly has not committed. He is also biased and hypocritical as to what rules he enforces; he congratulates Bubby for spray painting graffiti art in the walls, only to berate Gordon for doing the same. He is obsessed with PlayStation, repeatedly demanding others help him get a free PlayStation Plus account. He is also incredibly violent, frequently executing other guards and scientists. Compared to Tommy, Benrey is portrayed as taking a more flippant approach to documentation, vandalizing the Wikipedia article for All Dogs Go to Heaven 2 to falsely claim that Gordon appears and is killed off in the film. Throughout the series, Benrey is implied to have a crush on Gordon, repeatedly asking him for a kiss and making flirty comments. Gordon doesn't react these comments and it is unclear if he is oblivious to Benrey's crush or does not reciprocate it. Benrey is implied to be in an alliance with the military and a Skeleton seen only by Gordon throughout the series. At one point, alongside Bubby, he launches a coup, allowing Gordon to be captured by the military and have his arm cut off. Benrey is eventually revealed to be the primary antagonist of the series, being some form of alien creature controlling the alien invasion who is fighting against the G-Man. Benrey is destroyed by Gordon, Dr. Coomer, Tommy, and Bubby, though one of the Skeletons associated with him is shown attending Tommy’s birthday party. He later returns in AI Crushes All Banks, joining the main cast on their bank robbing spree. Benrey is depicted here as a more comical, childish, and inept character who frequently hinders the team’s robberies through his incompetence. His catchphrase is “Can I see your passport?”. =Recurring characters= * The G-Man (played by Mike): A seemingly omnipotent and enigmatic alien being that frequently attempts to give Gordon cryptic advice. He is later revealed to be Tommy’s father, having aided Gordon so Benrey would be defeated and Tommy and his friends could have a birthday party at Chuck E. Cheese. * Forzen (played by Scorpy): An HECU Marine who frequently encounters the main cast. Forzen claims to have formerly been Benrey’s best friend, and the two have similar personalities and mannerisms. Like Benrey, Forzen is shown to be delusional, but to an even greater extent, as he is under the apparent belief he is saving the Black Mesa staff by killing them on sight. He is a fan of the Irate Gamer, and at one point holds Tommy’s dog Sunkist hostage to force the main cast to convince people the Irate Gamer did not rip off the Angry Video Game Nerd. After this fails and Gordon corners him, Forzen disappears into thin air. * Skeleton (played by Scorpy, Mike, Lauren, and Logmore): A mysterious skeleton Gordon frequently sees, and it is initially left ambiguous as to whether the Skeleton is a hallucination or not. The Skeleton is implied throughout the series to have some sort of connection to Benrey, at one point speaking in Benrey’s voice. Benrey later summons multiple Skeletons during the final battle, claiming they are online friends he met on PlayStation Plus. The Skeletons are seemingly all destroyed, though one appears attending Tommy’s birthday party. * Darnold (played by Logmore): The eccentric head of the Black Mesa Mixology Department. He specializes in making potions and new brands of Powerade, though Gordon points out that potions are not real and primarily associated with wizards. Darnold gives Gordon a potion that causes a large gun to grow on the stump of his arm, and he decides to join the main cast shortly afterwards; however, upon realizing their violent nature, he decides to leave them and flies up an elevator shaft on his rocket boots. He later returns in AI Crushes All Banks as “the guy in the chair.” * Sunkist (played by Lauren): The perfect dog. She was made by Tommy, possibly with some help from G-Man. Sunkist is a very large golden retriever, almost the same height as Gordon. She appears as a completely flat PNG of a dog, is immortal and follows Tommy's every command. Sunkist communicates solely through short busts of Black Mesa Sweet Voice that sound similar to dog barks. Tommy named Sunkist after the soft drink brand of the same name because of how much he loves soda. Sunkist, the brand, have since tweeted about Sunkist the dog after their replies were spammed with pictures of him. In the series, Sunkist was first mentioned after Gordon asked Tommy what he wanted to do when they got out of Black Mesa. Tommy responded by saying he was going to feed his dog, Sunkist. Later in the series, Sunkist gets kidnapped and held at gunpoint by Forzen. Once they free her, Tommy states that Black Mesa is too dangerous for a dog to be walking around in, and so sends her home. In the final episode, Sunkist reappears during the boss fight with Benrey and helps to defeat him for good. * Joshua/Josh: Referred to on multiple occasions, Joshua is a mysterious figure. Before the Resonance Cascade, Benrey was supposed to go to GameStop to pick up Heavenly Sword from Josh and then play it after his shift. When the science team reaches the locker room, Gordon shows Benrey a photo of his son Joshua to which Benrey claims “looks a bit shit.” Later, after Benrey finds a dead body, he refers to it as “my friend of Josh.” The character Josh is a placeholder name due to the rtvs stating so during one of their commentary streams, but some theories state that they are all the same person.  Reception  Half-Life VR but the AI is Self-Aware was received well by reviewers. Emily Rose of Ars Technica drew comparisons to the works of Shakespeare and improvisational theater in general, saying \\"...the convergence of performer and digital performance has come full circle.

She is a professor emerita of sociology at the University of Connecticut. Tuchman is best known for her 1978 book, Making News: A Study in the Construction of Reality, about the sociology of news production. She is a past president of the Eastern Sociological Society. Early life and education Tuchman grew up in Passaic, New Jersey. She attended Passaic High School, where she was editor-in-chief of the school newspaper. She earned an undergraduate degree in English and American Literature from Brandeis University in 1964. She went on to earn master's (1967) and doctorate (1969) degrees in sociology, also from Brandeis. Her doctoral dissertation was titled News, the Newsman's Reality.  Career  Tuchman was an assistant professor at State University of New York at Stony Brook from 1969 to 1972. After that she worked as a professor of sociology at Queens College until 1990. From 1990 onwards, she was a professor of sociology at the University of Connecticut. In 2012 she earned the title of emeritus professor. Tuchman has served as president of the Eastern Sociological Society, vice-president of Sociologists for Women in Society (she was one of 18 co-founders), a member of the council of the American Sociological Association, and the Board of Directors of Society for the Study for Social Problems. Research Tuchman is mostly known for her book Making News: A Study in the Construction of Reality that applies the concepts of social constructivism and framing in a qualitative study of media production in New York City. Tuchman describes how Together with Herbert Gans' Deciding What's News and Todd Gitlin's The Whole World is Watching, Tuchman's Making News has become one of the seminal texts for the sociology of news production in mass media. She was the first to describe, built on in-depth qualitative analysis, how news are the product of institutions, especially of journalists' strategies to manage their work, how news value is not an inherent property of events but a negotiated social process in which organisations select events from the daily abundance of potential news. In her perspective, the self- legitimation of media through the usage of visual codes, narrative and visual conventions through which they \\"radiate an aura of representation\\" , but at the same time add to legitimizing dominant institutions and individuals, and the media's self-perception as committed to claims of objectivity, are important parts of this process, as well as scandalization as active management of social controversies to attract attention. Tuchman has also studied the role of gender in cultural and media production Since the 1990s, Tuchman has been mainly active in the sociologies of culture (including media), gender, and higher education, using ethnographic methods and occasionally historical methods in sociology.

Her research considers infectious diseases and the development of cell lines that allow a better understanding of their epidemiology. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Eckerle studied the difference in response of adults and children to coronavirus disease.  Early life and education  Eckerle was born in Southern Germany. As a child she wanted to be a veterinarian or a field biologist, but ended up studying medicine at Heidelberg University. During her final year of medical school she visited Africa, which inspired her to work in infectious diseases. She decided to specialises in tropical pathogens, and spent her early medical career working in the Department of Tropical Medicine at the University Hospital Heidelberg. As a junior doctor Eckerle investigated the pathogenesis of travellers returning to Germany from abroad. She focussed on viruses of zoonotic origin.  Research and career  Eckerle moved to the University of Bonn Institute of Virology, where she worked with Christian Drosten on emerging zoonotic viruses. Here Eckerle studied renal epithelial cell lines of various reservoir hosts, including bats, rodents and insectivores. Until the works of Eckerle, the isolation of bat-borne viruses in cell culture had been challenging. Eckerle created an experimental approach to instantly freeze the organs of specimens, so-called cryo-conservation, allowing her access to cells from a variety of rare species. She visited Ghana and Gabon as part of field work missions to study and collect bat species. In 2018 Eckerle was made a Professor at the University of Geneva, where she studies exotic cell lines. Eckerle works with other physicians, veterinarians and microbiologists, to better understand the epidemiology of emerging viruses. Eckerle looks to develop cell culture models to better understand the epidemiology of emerging diseases. She has made use of artificial intelligence to generate the cell lines of small mammals from a diverse range of geographical locations, and then allows viruses to replicate in these algorithm-generated cell cultures in controlled laboratory setting. Using these cell lines, Eckerle demonstrated that ungulates, including goats and camels, were likely intermediate hosts of middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). At the Geneva University Hospitals, she is co-head of the Center for Emerging Viral Diseases. In the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, Eckerle was one of several Swiss physicians who requested access to the Early Warning and Response System; the European Union's network that looks to track the spread of infectious diseases. She argued that better epidemiology, pathogenesis and treatment options were essential in the global fight against coronavirus disease. In late April 2020, a serological antibody test in Geneva revealed that only 5.5% of the population had been exposed to the disease, which Eckerle described as \\"smaller than hoped for,\\". Eckerle investigated the different responses of adults and children to coronavirus disease. In particular, Eckerle studied the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the upper respiratory tracts of neonates, children and teenagers. In early May, Eckerle reported that children who fell ill with coronavirus disease were just as infectious as adults. She investigated the viral loads of children and adults, and showed that whilst children can have a more mild form of the disease, there was little difference between the number of SARS-CoV-2 particles carried by adults and children. She was awarded funding from the Swiss National Science Foundation to investigate the reaction of the pulmonary epithelium to SARS-CoV-2 infection, in an effort to create diagnostic guidelines that help healthcare workers evaluate whether someone will contract a mild or severe form of disease.

Career  After college, McDowell worked in advertising as a writer and creative director but grew frustrated with the industry and left to pursue her writing and art in other ways. While searching for her next venture, she noticed that the sentiments in classic greeting card did not reflect the real-world experiences of the people she knew particularly surrounding difficult subjects like grief, loss, and illness. Inspired to fill this gap, Emily began to create cards for what she calls “the relationships we really have” McDowell's first popular card went viral on Valentine's Day of 2012. The card which read: “I know we’re not like, together or anything but it felt weird not to say anything so I got you this card. It’s not a big deal, It doesn’t really mean anything. There isn’t even a heart on it. So basically, it’s a card saying hi. Forget it.” sold over 1,700 copies in one week and provided the springboard for her business. Emily's work was then picked up by Urban Outfitters and other large retailers. McDowell's first book, There Is No Good Card For This: What To Say and Do When Life Gets Scary, Awful, and Unfair To People You Love, co-authored with Dr. Kelsey Crowe, was released in January 2017.  Empathy Cards  McDowell was diagnosed with Stage 3 Hodgkin’s lymphoma at the age of 24. She has stated that one of the most difficult parts of her experience was “the loneliness and isolation I felt when many of my close friends and family members disappeared because they didn’t know what to say, or said the absolute wrong thing without realizing it.” Her experience as a cancer patient combined with the experience of losing a close friend to cancer inspired her to create a series of greeting cards known as “Empathy Cards” which is her most popular line to date. Empathy cards are designed for people dealing with grief and loss using frank, and often humorous language. McDowell stated that her goal is to create \\"better, more authentic ways to communicate about sickness and suffering.\\"  References  Category:Living people Category:American illustrators Category:21st-century American women writers Category:American businesspeople ","title":"Emily McDowell"},{"id":"64008075","text":"List of Ambassadors *Jonathan Peled (Non-Resident, Mexico City) 2015 - *Rodica Radian-Gordon (Non-Resident, Mexico City) 2010 - 2015 *Ephraim Evron (Non-Resident, Washington, D.C.) 1978 - 1982 *Simcha Dinitz (Non-Resident, Washington, D.C.) 1973 - 1978 References * Bahamas Israel ","title":"List of ambassadors of Israel to the Bahamas"},{"id":"64008118","text":"Olatokunbo Arinola Somolu (born 1950) is a Nigerian structural engineer.

Chekharin ended World War I as a junior officer but did not see much action in the Russian Civil War. He served at military educational institutions and in territorial units during the 1920s and 1930s, holding staff positions during the late 1930s. Chekharin commanded the 37th Rifle Division, destroyed in the Battle of Białystok–Minsk, and then the 269th Rifle Division during Operation Typhoon. He was killed while attempting to break out of encirclement during the latter.  Early life, World War I, and Russian Civil War  Chekharin was born in the village of Gubino, Kaluga Governorate on 26 October 1892. He served in the Imperial Russian Army from January 1915 as a ryadovoy (private) of the training command of the 641st Don Foot Druzhina in Belaya Tserkov. He was later promoted to yefreytor (corporal) and to junior and senior unter-ofitser (non-commissioned officer). In June 1916 he became a junker of the 1st School of Praporshchiks of the Southwestern Front in Zhitomir, and after graduating from it in December became a junior officer and company commander in the 47th Reserve Infantry Regiment of the front. Chekharin completed the three-month advanced courses for praporshchiks under the 35th Reserve Brigade of the front at Chertkov in 1917, then served as a junior officer and company commander with the 161st Alexandropol Infantry Regiment of the 41st Infantry Division. Between January and March 1918 he served as a junior officer with a company of the 256th Infantry Regiment of the Moscow Military District in Bryansk. After he was demobilized from the army, Chekharin returned to Gubino, where he became chairman of the volost executive committee in March during the Russian Civil War. He was conscripted into the Red Army in June and appointed commissar of the volost military commissariat. Serving as a platoon and company commander with the 18th Kaluga Command Courses and the 29th Reserve Rifle Regiment from December 1918, he became temporary chief of the courses and commander of the consolidated cadet brigade drawn from them in June 1921 to participate in the suppression of the Tambov Rebellion.  Interwar period  Demobilized in February 1923 to graduate from the Kaluga Pedagogical Institute, Chekharin was reconscripted into the army in December and sent to serve in the 241st Rifle Regiment of the 81st Rifle Division at Kaluga, becoming a company commander, chief of the regimental school, and assistant battalion commander. From November 1926 he served as chief of the regimental school of the 2nd Vyatka Territorial Rifle Regiment, and headed the military department of the Vyatka Pedagogical Institute. Chekharin studied at the Leningrad Higher Military Political School from March 1929 and following his graduation in October remained at the school as a tactics teacher. Appointed chief of staff of the 167th Rifle Regiment of the 56th Rifle Division of the Leningrad Military District at Pskov in December 1931, Chekharin temporarily commanded the regiment for three months. He transferred to the Leningrad Night Training Center in March 1933, serving successively as an instructor-leader and tactics teacher, acting chief of the center, and chief of training. Appointed chief of training of the Leningrad Improvement Courses for Reserve Command Personnel in April 1937, he became chief of the Combat Training Directorate of the OSOAVIAKHIM Central Council in February 1939. After completing the Vystrel course in 1939, Chekharin, promoted to colonel, served as assistant chief of infantry of the 15th Army of the Northwestern Front in March and April 1940, then was chief of the 2nd staff department of the Arkhangelsk Military District. In July 1940 he became deputy commander of the 37th Rifle Division of the 21st Rifle Corps of the Western Special Military District, stationed in Belarus. He succeeded to command the division in March 1941, being awarded the Order of the Red Star in the same month.  World War II  After Operation Barbarossa began, Chekharin led the division in the Battle of Białystok–Minsk as part of the Western Front. His unit was placed under the direct control of the front commander and entered battle on 24 June in the area of Lida. From late June, with the 21st Corps, the division fought in defense of the Minsk Fortified Region, and conducted a fighting retreat towards Borisov and eventually to the Dnieper, being virtually destroyed in the fighting. In early September Chekharin was appointed commander of the newly formed 269th Rifle Division, which joined the 3rd Army of the Bryansk Front. From 30 September the division fought against Operation Typhoon, the German drive on Moscow. In these operations it was defeated and encircled. In more than two weeks of fighting, lacking ammunition and fuel, the division fought to break out towards Tula. On 20 October the division and the 3rd Army headquarters had nearly reached Soviet lines, but Chekharin was reported missing, presumed killed, in a breakout attempt near Yasnaya Polyana. He was posthumously awarded the Order of the Patriotic War, 1st class, in 1965 in commemoration of the 20th anniversary of the end of the war.

It was a parasol wing aircraft with wings of rectangular plan apart from rounded tips and a central, trailing edge cut-out to enhance the pilot's field of view. They had wooden structures with spruce box-spars and ribs, were plywood-covered and braced to the fuselage by pairs of outward- leaning N-form struts between the mid- and lower longerons and the wing spars. These struts were quite short, reaching the wings at about 25% span. A cabane provided central wing support.

The fuselage of the M-1 had a welded chrome-molybdenum steel tube structure, like many designs of the time, and was fabric-covered. Zips provided easy access to the rear control connections. Two passengers sat side- by-side close to the wing underside at about mid-chord. They were protected by a large, V-shaped windscreen which projected forward of the leading edge to the engine mounting and rearwards to the hinge of a large access door. The pilot's well-instrumented cockpit was under the trailing edge cut-out, providing views both above and below the wing. The M-1's vertical rear control surfaces were rather straight and upright, though the balanced rudder was round-tipped. Its tailplane, mounted on top of the fuselage, was adjustable and wire-braced to the fin. The undercarriage was a split axle design, with the axles hinged from the fuselage central underside. Near-vertical Aerol shock absorber legs were fuselage-mounted at the base of the forward wing struts and drag struts reached rearwards to the lower fuselage. Operational history The M-1 first flew in 1929, though the exact date is not known, and received its type certificate in September. It featured at the Cleveland Air Show held in the autumn of 1929. Only four were built.

It took place on October 12, 1999 at the Tokyo Dome in Tokyo, Japan and was televised live on TV Asahi. Ten professional wrestling matches were contested at the event. The event featured a dual main event; the first main event was for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship in which Keiji Mutoh retained the title against Manabu Nakanishi and the second main event was for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship in which Naoya Ogawa retained the title against Shinya Hashimoto, with Tatsumi Fujinami serving as the special guest referee. In other prominent matches on the undercard, Genichiro Tenryu defeated Kensuke Sasaki, Team 2000 (Don Frye and Masahiro Chono) defeated nWo Japan (Satoshi Kojima and Scott Norton) and Jushin Liger defeated Kendo Kashin to win the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship while Shinjiro Otani and Tatsuhito Takaiwa retained the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship against Koji Kanemoto and Minoru Tanaka. ProductionStorylines= The main event of the event pitted the defending champion Naoya Ogawa against Shinya Hashimoto for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. The lengthy rivalry between Ogawa and Hashimoto began at Battle Formation on April 12, 1997, where Ogawa pulled out an upset victory in his debut match against Hashimoto by knocking him out with a choke in a different style fight. This earned Ogawa, a title shot against Hashimoto for the latter's IWGP Heavyweight Championship, the following month at Strong Style Evolution, where Hashimoto retained the title. The duo had a rubber match at the 1999 Wrestling World event, where they fought to a no contest after Ogawa hit Hashimoto viciously and knocked him out. The feud further escalated when Hashimoto attacked Ogawa at a press conference in the United States after Ogawa won the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, thus setting up a match between the two for the latter's title at Final Dome. A second main event of Final Dome was between Keiji Mutoh and Manabu Nakanishi for the former's IWGP Heavyweight Championship. On August 15, Nakanishi defeated Mutoh in the finals of the 1999 G1 Climax to win the tournament, thus earning a future title shot against Mutoh. This set up a title match between the two at Final Dome. EventPreliminary matches= The event kicked off with a match between Hiroyoshi Tenzan and Tatsutoshi Goto. Tenzan won the match by performing a diving headbutt on Goto. Next, Kazuyuki Fujita took on Sean McCully. Fujita won the match by making McCully submit to the Achilles tendon hold. Next, the team of Shinjiro Otani and Tatsuhito Takaiwa defended the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship against Koji Kanemoto and Minoru Tanaka. Onita delivered a Spiral Bomb to Kanemoto to win the match and retain the titles. Next, Kendo Kashin defended the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship against Jushin Liger. Liger nailed a fisherman buster to Kashin to win the title. Next, the team of Shiro Koshinaka and Tatsumi Fujinami took on Osamu Kido and Takashi Iizuka in a tag team match. Koshinaka executed a powerbomb on Iizuka for the win. Next, Yuji Nagata took on Kimo. Kimo won the match via submission by applying a sleeper hold on Nagata. Next, Team 2000 representatives Don Frye and Masahiro Chono took on the nWo Japan representatives Satoshi Kojima and Scott Norton in a tag team match. Chono made Kojima submit to the STF for the win. Later, Kensuke Sasaki took on Wrestle Association R representative Genichiro Tenryu in an interpromotional match. Tenryu nailed a scoop brainbuster on Sasaki for the win. The penultimate match was for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship, in which Keiji Mutoh defended the title against G1 Climax winner Manabu Nakanishi. Mutoh made Nakanishi submit to the cross armbreaker to retain the title. =Main event match= In the main event, Naoya Ogawa defended the NWA World Heavyweight Championship against Shinya Hashimoto, with Tatsumi Fujinami serving as the special guest referee. Hashimoto was knocked out after a series of stiff kicks and punches by Ogawa, which resulted in Fujinami stopping the match and Ogawa was awarded the victory and thus retained the title. Aftermath The feud between Naoya Ogawa and Shinya Hashimoto continued after Final Dome as the two squared off in a tag team match on opposite sides at Wrestling World 2000, where Ogawa teamed with Kazunari Murakami and Hashimoto teamed with Takashi Iizuka. Hashimoto and Iizuka won the match. Ogawa and Hashimoto had one final encounter at Dome Impact, which Ogawa won to end the feud. Minoru Tanaka would challenge Shinjiro Otani and Tatsuhito Takaiwa for the Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship, with Kendo Kashin as his partner at Wrestling World but failed to win the titles. Tanaka would then receive a Final Dome rematch with Koji Kanemoto against Otani and Takaiwa on June 25, where they won the titles.

The name \\"Laggan\\" is derived from the old Celtic root of \\"lag\\" or \\"lug\\" which means a \\"flat place.\\" Background Following the defeat of Gaelic Ireland after the Nine Years War and the Flight of the Earls in 1607, the colonization of Ulster began in 1609. English and Scottish settlers supported by the crown set up a colony in the north-east province of Ulster. The native Gaelic Irish Catholics living in Ulster were driven out of their homes and replaced with Protestant settlers loyal to the Crown. In 1641, the native Irish, fearful of a rumoured colonialist plan to attack and further displace the remaining Irish in Ulster, rose up in a coup led by Felim O'Neill. Although it was intended to be bloodless, the rebellion was characterized by rebel attacks on Protestant civilians. While O'Neill himself was opposed to these attacks he was unable to control the rebel soldiers. At the outset of the rebellion, thousands of Protestant settlers were evicted from their lands. Their homes were burned and their possessions taken. Most attacks involved robberies and assaults, however if the planters resisted they were often murdered by the Irish rebels. Thousands of the Protestant refugees sought safety and protection in Royalist strongholds or attempted to leave Ireland and return to England and Scotland. Protestant militias along with English soldiers also committed atrocities, especially after rebels surrendered, often where they were given no quarter. The most notable example, however, was the Rathlin Island massacre, where as many as 3,000 Catholic women and children were thrown from cliffs onto rocks below. Reports of the violence against the Protestants were widely exaggerated in press reports in Britain. Initially, Parliamentarian propaganda pamphlets claimed over 200,000 Protestants were killed, which was widely believed despite the fact that the estimates being stated were almost twice the number of Protestants living in Ireland at the time. On 3 April, 1642, a Scottish Covenanter expeditionary army landed in Ulster to protect the Planter population. Prior to that Protestants had to defend themselves by means of militias such as the Laggan Army. Afterwards the Laggan Army continued to operate in Ulster, and often participated in joint campaigns with the Scottish expeditionary force. Eventually, violence against civilians by both sides began to calm, mainly due to the arrival of Eoghan Ruadh O'Néill, an experienced Irish general who had served under the Spanish in Flanders in the Eighty Years' War. He landed in Ireland in 1642 along with several other Gaelic Irish and Old English officers, an example of the latter being Thomas Preston. Due to their experience they were given positions of command within the Confederate military. O'Neill began disciplining the troops of the Irish Ulster Army and hanged soldiers who attacked civilians. In turn, reprisals by Protestants also declined. Creation of the Laggan Army Wealthy Protestant landowners in northwest Ulster such as Sir William Stewart and his brother Sir Robert Stewart chose to defend their properties by organizing militias. The Stewarts were Scottish settlers who had served King Charles I of England in the military. During the colonization of Ulster, King Charles awarded English and Scottish loyalists such as the Stewarts with large tracts of escheated land under the condition that improvements be made and tenant settlers be brought over from England or Scotland. The Stewarts were held in such high regard by the English Crown that immediately after the outbreak of the rebellion, King Charles authorized both of the Stewarts to establish a regiment of 1,000 foot and a troop of horse for the king’s service. The military force that the Stewarts created came to be known as the Laggan Army. Originally the unit was formed to protect the Laggan Valley in eastern Donegal along with the northwest portions of counties Tyrone and Derry. As the war progressed, the Laggan Army became the most dominant Royalist militia in Ulster, defending and relieving Protestant strongholds; escorting refugees to safe havens; conducting reprisal attacks on the Irish rebels; and supporting other Royalist militias in numerous conflicts. William Stewart served as the nominal leader of the Laggan Army in the beginning as he had greater seniority and landed interests than his brother. Fairly quickly, however, Robert Stewart was selected for overall command based upon his extensive experience in the Thirty Years' War on the European continent. Robert Stewart was resourceful and proved to be adept at recruiting men and training military units. His troops were better equipped than the rebels they faced especially with respect to muskets. And perhaps most important of all, Stewart was both experienced and knowledgeable with regard to battlefield tactics. Warfare On 14 June 1642, the Laggan Army confronted and defeated a large Confederate Irish force commanded by Felim O'Neill. The Confederates were invading county Donegal intent upon bringing northwestern Ulster and the Royalist stronghold and port city of Derry under their control. The Laggan Army and the Irish forces clashed at the Battle of Glenmaquin near Raphoe. The Laggan Army routed the Confederates and then went on to capture a number of towns in Ulster ending the Confederate threat in the region for the time. The Laggan Army continued to serve in King Charles' service during the time of the First English Civil War and the Eleven Years' War. On 13 June 1643, Robert Stewart and the Laggan defeated Eoghan O'Néill and the Confederates at the Battle of Clones and on 8 July 1645 the Laggan Army assisted Sir Charles Coote and the Parliamentarians capture Sligo. In 1646, the Laggan Army was one of three forces including Scottish Covenanter regiments and English settler armies commanded by Robert Monro that was to be included in an attack on Eoghan O'Neill and the Confederates in Ulster. The Laggan Army was in Clogher on its way to meet up with Monro's force on 4 June when the Parliamentarian force was confronted and decisively defeated by Irish general Eoghan Ruadh O'Neill at the Battle of Benburb. After the battle, the Laggan Army retreated back to Derry and Enniskillen to prepare for a potential attack when the Confederates travelled west to Clones. After the failed siege of Derry in 1649, the Laggan Army started to break apart. Factions transferred their allegiance to the side of the Parliamentarians and eventually fought against their fellow compatriots at the battles of Lisnagarvey, Scarrifholis, and Charlemont. By the end of 1649, the Laggan Army had ceased to be effective as a fighting force due to internal ethnic divisions and as a result the force disbanded.

One of four National Natural Landmarks on Guam, it is closely associated with the folktale of two doomed lovers and is a major tourist attraction. The Point is part of the limestone plateau that forms the northern part of Guam. The cliff height at the point is approximately 370 feet.  Folktale  Aerial view of the Two Lovers Point facility A popular Guam folktale recounts how two lovers who were not allowed to be together by society tied their hair and leapt to their deaths from Puntas Dos Amantes rather than be apart. However, the details of the story have changed considerably since it was first recorded by French explorer Louis de Freycinet in 1819. In Freycinet's recounting, a man of the high-caste matao fell in forbidden love with a woman of the lower- caste manachang. They wandered in the wilderness eventually burying their infant in a stone cairn. In despair, they climbed to the top of a steep peak by the sea, tied their hair together, and, holding one another, jumped to their deaths. During the Spanish colonization of Guam's history, the location was called Cabo de los Amantes (Lovers’ Cape). However, the popular modern retelling includes the Spanish history of the island: once there was a beautiful young woman from Hagåtña who was the daughter of a Spanish businessman and a prominent woman who was herself the daughter of a maga’låhi, or great Chamorro chief. The woman ran away from home after learning that her father had arranged her marriage to a Spanish ship captain. On the north shore of Guam, she met and fell in love with a young and gentle Chamorro man. She eventually returned home with the promise that she would return to him. However, the woman's father was angry when he learned of his daughter's lover and demanded she immediately marry the Spanish captain. She ran away at sunset that day and met her Chamorro lover. But her father, the captain, and all of the Spanish soldiers pursued them to the high cliff above Tumon Bay. Cornered, the two lovers tied their long black hair into a single knot, kissed, and threw themselves from the cliff, to the horror of the soldiers.  Tourism  Viewing platforms and wedding chapel atop the plateau Two Lovers Point is Guam's most famous landmark. While the land is owned by the Government of Guam, the first term administration of Governor Carl Gutierrez (1995-1999) initiated a public-private partnership to develop the site with Calvo Enterprises, a company owned by former governor Paul McDonald Calvo. The partnership was held up by Senator James Moylan in 2019 as a good model for future island improvements. Two Lovers Point was reported in 2019 to attract 500,000 visitors to its park annually, and 360–400,000 to the lookout point itself. It includes a gift shop and facilities to host weddings. The site includes a sister bell with other \\"Lovers Points\\" in Kashiwazaki, Niigata and Izu, Shizuoka. An independently operated restaurant, Terraza Dos Amantes, operates on the site. In 2002, Super Typhoon Pongsona damaged and toppled the metal statue of the two lovers at the site. In 2013, Guam businessman David Barnhouse visited Two Lovers Point with his soon-to-be wife Nancy. Recounting rumors that the statue was still lying in a junkyard somewhere on Guam, David vowed that if the statue still existed that he would repair it and return it to the site as a symbol of his love for Nancy. Two years later, Nancy mentioned this to Moses S. Chong, the owner of Green Guam Corporation, who stated that the statue was lying in his scrapyard, explaining that he had bought it for scrap but \\"never had the heart to melt it down.\\" The Barnhouses bought the rusting statue and paid a local fabricator to spend five months carefully repairing it. On October 15, 2015, the second wedding anniversary of the Barnhouses, they returned the statue to Two Lovers Point, where it still stands.

It was evicted and partially demolished in 1989, then quickly reoccupied and rebuilt. It was evicted again in 1994 and briefly moved to a warehouse for six months before occupying its still extant location on via Antoine Watteau. Activities include concerts, theatre, debates, exhibitions and a radio station. The centre describes itself as Leoncavallo Self-Managed Public Space (Italian: Leoncavallo Spazio Pubblico Autogestito).  History  Inside Leoncavallo in 2007 The Leoncavallo social centre was first occupied in 1975. The former Scotti pharmaceutical factory (3,600m²) was on Leoncavallo Street in the northeast of the city. In 1989, the mayor of Milan decided to evict the building's residents in accordance with the wishes of the owner and it was then partially demolished. A few days after the eviction, Leoncavallo was reoccupied and rebuilt by hand. Rightwing politicians campaigned against the centre in 1994, and it was again evicted. A warehouse on via Salomone was occupied for some months and then a new zone (a former printers) was squatted on via Antoine Watteau, close to the first site. It was 10,000m², with courtyards set around buildings and a central square. Le Monde diplomatique stated that in the late 1990s, Matteo Salvini, who was at that time a city councillor, drank beer and attended events at the centre, defending it against attacks by the mayor, Marco Formentini. However, a detailed investigation by Jacobin concluded that Salvini had claimed affinity at one point for political gain but most likely was not a regular visitor. Eventually, the city decided against eviction and the owners did not request it, since they were hoping to be paid rent. By 2000, no agreement had been reached between the parties, and the following year a representative of the centre was elected to the city council as a member of the Communist Party (Rifondazione Comunista). In 2004, the Leoncavallo Foundation was set up to continue negotiations.  Activities  No TAV banner at Leoncavallo Activities at the vast centre include musical concerts, theatre shows, debates, language courses, workshops, art exhibitions and a radio station. Leoncavallo is also a hub for street art. Since 1995, free food and accommodation is provided for whoever needs it. As of 2003, 80 people were working at the centre, half as volunteers, half receiving \\"solidarity tokens\\" for their time. The centre is self-financing, generating the money it needs for upkeep from benefit concerts and bar takings. For ideological reasons, the centre refuses to pay taxes. When Naomi Klein visited Leoncavallo in 2001, she described it as \\"practically a self-contained city, with several restaurants, gardens, a bookstore, a cinema, an indoor skateboard ramp, and a club so large it was able to host Public Enemy when they came to town.\\" The still-extant centre defined itself in 2019 as Leoncavallo Self- Managed Public Space (Italian: Leoncavallo Spazio Pubblico Autogestito).

Costello had copied these lyrics from notebook to notebook for over five years until he \\"found their rightful home\\". The lyric \\"Listen to the hammers falling in the breaker's yard\\" reference a memory Costello had of watching the scrapping of steam locomotives on the news when he was a child. Other lyrics derived from his experiences on tour; references to \\"carnival desires\\" were, according to Costello, \\"just a picturesque way of saying that you might have to choose between chasing the wrong girl and avoiding gangs of lads shouting abuse and spewing into the gutters\\". The lyric \\"Backslapping drinkers cheer the heavyweight brawl\\" comes from, as Costello explained, \\"the kind of dubious lodgings [on tour] where the police drank after hours with local ne'er-do- wells and the bar didn't close until dawn\\". Costello finished writing \\"Watch Your Step\\" in the summer of 1980, before the recording of the Trust album. A demo of the song was created during this same time; at the time, the song was, according to Costello biographer Graeme Thomson, a \\"raucous rocker\\", contrasting with the final version that Costello described as \\"a slow dance number\\". The song's use of melodica was, according to Costello, inspired by dub music; a planned guitar solo for the song was scrapped in its place. Release and reception \\"Watch Your Step\\" was released as the only single from Trust in America; in the UK, \\"Clubland\\" and \\"From a Whisper to a Scream\\" were released instead. The B-side was \\"Luxembourg\\", though a 12-inch single instead featured Costello's interview with Tom Snyder on the B-side. The single failed to chart in the US. The song has since appeared on compilation albums The Best of Elvis Costello and the Attractions, Girls Girls Girls, and The Very Best of Elvis Costello and The Attractions 1977–86. \\"Watch Your Step\\" has seen critical acclaim and has been named by many writers as a highlight of Trust. Rick Anderson of AllMusic described the track as \\"a song that is unsettling and slightly scary, but still great for singing along to\\" and wrote that the song \\"proved a couple of things: first, that [Costello] really did know how to write for his own voice, and second, that his voice really wasn't all that bad\\". Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone noted the song as well as \\"New Lace Sleeves\\" as \\"the album's undisputed twin highlights\\". Noel Murray and Keith Phipps of The A.V. Club named the song as a highlight from Trust and called it \\"beguilingly paranoid\\". Jim Miller of Newsweek wrote, \\"On 'Watch Your Step' he builds a complex mood out of the title's admonition, turning the song into a bittersweet tribute to suspicion\\". Dave Lifton of Ultimate Classic Rock named the song as the fourth best Elvis Costello song, stating, \\"The ominous 'Watch Your Step,' with a subdued performance by the Attractions and Costello's voice barely rising above a whisper, is the best [on Trust]\\". The Daily Telegraphs Martin Chilton ranked the song number 31 on his top 40 list of best Costello songs. Live history \\"Watch Your Step\\" has been performed live by Costello regularly since its release. Costello debuted the song in his live setlist during the Get Happy tour. Costello also performed the song on The Tomorrow Show with Tom Snyder in 1981 to promote Trust. He cited the appearance as \\"return[ing] us from our exile from US television\\" after his 1979 controversy. David Hyland of WPR noted that the song was one of the tracks Costello performed at a 2015 show in Madison that \\"offered many opportunities for Nieve to impress\\", noting that Nieve's performance on \\"Watch Your Step\\" \\"featured several exquisite runs\\".

Its mission is to \\"defend and encourage the development of the profession.\\" FEBAB is the oldest library association in the country, founded in 1959; it is also the largest. Its headquarters is in São Paulo. The organization is a federation of 16 library associations, some active and some inactive, one for each state of Brazil. Each state library association has its own organization and governing body, but generally meet in conjunction with other FEBAB meetings. FEBAB members participate in international activities as part of the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA). History FEBAB emerged from a proposal by Laura Russo (1915-2001) and Rodolfo Rocha Júnior during the 2nd Congress of Libraries and Documentation (CBBD) in Salvador, Bahia in 1959. The organization as incorporated on July 26, 1959, with the main objective of defending and encouraging the development of librarianship as a profession. Laura Russo served as the first president of the organization, serving from 1961 to 1975. Russo, along with Maria Alice Toledo Leite and Maria Helena Brandão procured a headquarters for the organization in São Paulo in 1969. The librarian Neusa Dias de Macedo noted in 1989 that the first thirty years of the organization was marked by \\"financial and administrative infrastructure difficulties\\". The Brazilian Federal Council of Librarianship (, CFB) was created in 1965. In contrast to FEBAB, which is responsible for training and promoting librarianship as a profession, the CFB acts as a representative body for librarians in the Brazilian state and federal government. Governing structure FEBAB consists of a general assembly, a board of directors, an executive board, a fiscal council, associated commissions, and working groups. Members of the executive board serve for three terms, and include a president, vice-president, directors of administration, communication and publications, events, political and professional training. It additionally includes the regional directors from the sixteens states of Brazil and a member of the fiscal council. =Commissions and Working Groups= FEBAB has 11 commissions and working groups, each with their own area of responsibility and governance. They roughly correspond to the commissions and working groups of other national library associations, and include the: *Brazilian Commission of University Libraries () *Brazilian Commission of School Libraries () *Brazilian Commission of Prison Libraries () *Brazilian Commission on Copyright and Open Access () *Working Group on Public Libraries () *Working Group on Library Accessibility () *Working Group on Cataloging () *Working Group on Diversity and Gender () *Working Group on Parliamentary Libraries () *Working Group on Ethnic-Racial Relations and Decolonization () *Working Group on Library Services for Vulnerable People () Events FEBAB holds annual or biannual conferences, which include the Brazilian Congress on Library and Documentation (CBBD); the International Congress on Archives, Libraries, Documentation Centers and Museums; SENABRAILLE, the National Seminar on Braille Libraries; and the National Seminar of University Libraries. Publications The primary publication of FEBAB is an academic journal, the Revista Brasileira de Biblioteconomia e Documentação (). It dates to 1973 and replaced an newsletter, Boletim Informativo, published since 1960. The organization also hosts numerous publications, notably of translations of international library standards and other documents issued by the International Federation of Library Associations.

Karađorđe's secretary Janićije Đurić was born in 1779 in Stragari in the Kragujevac nahiye. He was a friend of Tanasko Rajić when his sister Perunika married. He was educated in the monastery of the Annunciation in Rudnik. He joined the insurgents at the very beginning of the First Serbian Uprising in 1804.When Tanasko Rajić heard about the upcoming Orašac Assembly, he took his men and Janićije Đurić and went to the Stragari han (inn) where they killed the innkeeper (hanadžija) and razed the inn to the ground.Фељтон, Вечерње новости,2. јун 2006. Janićije Đurić participated in the Orašac Assembly on 14 February 1804.Karađorđe was elected supreme leader (Vožd), and Janićije Đurić was elected his secretary, which he remained until the collapse of the First Serbian Uprising. He immediately wrote nine letters in Orašac, in which Karađorđe called on important people to join the insurrection against the occupying forces. He had a family relationship with Karađorđe [5] and had a great influence on him.Karađorđe used to call him \\"Janja\\" (instead of Janićije). At the end of 1808, together with Pavle Popović and Ivan Jugović, Đurić was in the delegation that Karađorđe sent to Russia, although Konstantin Rodofinikin opposed sending that delegation.The delegation went to the Russian General Staff in Iasi, where it negotiated with Prince Alexander Prozorovsky. At that time, due to the agreement with the French, the Russians intended to secure only the autonomy of Serbia within Turkey, but the Serbs demanded full independence, which the Russians had promised them earlier. When it became known that the Russians would go to war with the Turks again, negotiations in Iasi became pointless, so the Serbian delegation returned to Belgrade in early April 1809. Karađorđe sent Janićije to Wallachia in May 1809 to agree with Prozorovsky on a joint war against the Turks. In 1812, he was awarded the Imperial Russian Order of St. Anna, II degree. Replaced Karađorđe twice In 1813, Karađorđe sent him to Imperial Russia for help, but on the way, he was hindered by Austria. After the fall of Deligrad, the Serbian insurgent army was in a great crisis, and on September 14, 1809, Karađorđe transferred all his powers to Janićije Đurić. In difficult moments, on July 22, 1813, Karađorđe again temporarily transferred the supreme power to Janićije Đurić. Karađorđe sent him to be the commander- in-chief instead of him on the Drina.However, Đurić proved to be a very bad military commander. After the defeat of the insurgent army at Zasavica, Đurić fled to Belgrade, and then, together with Karađorđe, he moved to Zemun on October 3, 1813.He took his mother, wife, his three children and five servants with him. In exile In Zemun, the Austrian authorities separated him from Karadjordje. The Austrian authorities sent Karađorđe to the Fenek monastery and kept Đurić under guard in Zemun. He managed to find a way to deliver Russian messages to Karađorđe so that they would remain consistent in their wishes to move to Russia. When Austrian General Crvenka learned of Đurić's skilful delivery of letters, he called him the Russian spirit. Đurić was sent to Petava, and then went to Russia together with Karađorđe. Karađorđe blamed Metropolitan of Belgrade Leontije Lambrović, and Janicije Đurić of being responsible for the fall of Serbia.That is why they took revenge on Karadjordje when he arrived in Hotin in Bessarabia, then part of Imperial Russia, in November 1814. From mid-November 1814, At the time Karađorđe was a permanent resident of Hotin, and in early 1817 moved to Chisinau. Until 1830, he received aid in the amount of 2,500 rubles from the Russian government. Somewhat later, in April 1815, Đurić travelled with Karađorđe and several dukes to Petrograd. Together with Jakov Nenadović, Luka Lazarević, Petar Dobrnjac and Milenko Stojković, he was in opposition to Karađorđe and supported Prince Miloš Obrenović's strategies and tactics with the Turks. Together with Luka Lazarević, he gave information about Karađorđe's escape from Hotin at the end of June 1817, when Karađorđe secretly crossed into Serbia and was then killed in an ambush. Return to Serbia He returned to Serbia in 1830. As he was quite rich, he built a large house on the site where the royal court was later built. He later sold the house to the state. He also had another house in Terazije, which he also sold during his lifetime. [5] In March 1834, he became a member of the Legislative Commission.He was appointed a member of the State Council on 15 February 1835 and was confirmed at the Peter's Assembly in the same year. He was appointed a member in March 1839 and president of the Court of Appeals on 21 June 1840. He became a member of the State Council again on 3 September 1840, until Vučić's revolt. He was removed in September 1842 from the position of advisor. He then complained to Toma Vučić-Perišić that they unfairly suspected him of being in favour of the Obrenovićs. After the shrift, he retired and lived for a time in Belgrade and for a time in Stragari. He had four children, two sons, Vladislav and Aleksandar, and two daughters, Paula and Milica. He died 14 April 1850 in Stragari. He was buried in the monastery of Voljavča, where he built a bell tower in 1838. His house in Stragari housed a valuable archive from the First Serbian Uprising, but it burned down at the end of the 19th century. During his stay in Russia, he began to record the events from the First Serbian Uprising and Karađorđe's biography -- Povešnica od početka vremena vožda srpskog Karađorđa Petrovića (The History from the Beginning of the Time of Serbian Grand Vožd Karađorđe Petrović).

After, the Goth takes Euphemia to his home only to have her enslaved to his Gothic wife.

The studio is known for its specialization in architectural photographs and works of art, and for having documented the transformation of Rome in the twentieth century.. Collections of Vasari photographs are held by the International Museum of Photography and Film at George Eastman House in Rochester (New York), at the National Institute for Graphics in Rome, and at the Center for Studies and Communication Archive (CSAC) of the University of Parma. Cesare Vasari  History  Tommaso and Giorgio Vasari The company founder Cesare Vasari (Arezzo, 30 May 1846 - Rome, 31 May 1901) moved to Rome in 1860, working initially for professional photographers. He become a collaborator of Tommaso Cuccioni's widow, Isabella Bonafede. In 1875 he opened one of the first ateliers for the production of art and architecture photographs. After Cesare moved to Florence, the Roman atelier passed to his nephew Alessandro (Rome, 1 July 1866 - 18 March 1929); Alessandro's son Tommaso (Rome, March 21, 1894 - August 25, 1971) documents the artistic and architectural story of Rome of the Twenties, becoming a supplier of the Royal House, and photographing the post-war reconstruction. Initially, the laboratory for the development and printing of the photographs was located in via della Mercede, subsequently transferred to via Ludovisi and finally to via Condotti, where all the processing of the negatives was carried out, the subsequent printing and final retouching. Tommaso, who had two children (Laura and Giorgio), was succeeded by Giorgio, a doctor in chemistry (Rome, 11 September 1931 - Filettino, 3 July 2004). Under Giorgio, the business developed in the fields of art, architecture and industry, including the photographic documentation of public works for the 1960 Olympics, the headquarters of the major companies of the Italian \\"economic boom\\", as well as editions that dealt with the most important basilicas, churches and Roman galleries of art and antiques. Subsequently, Giorgio's sons (Alessandro, Andrea and Francesco) continued the studio's activity, establishing the Vasari Photographic Archive and enriching it through photographic campaigns commissioned by state bodies, museums, private collections and national and international publishers. Today the company is directed by Alessandro Vasari (Rome, 25 February 1957).

It opened in 1967 to replace a 140-year predecessor on West Street in central Brighton, but was closed in 2012 and demolished over the 2017–2018 Christmas and New Year period. Houses and flats now occupy the site; the development was completed in December 2019. The Tabernacle in West Street served Independent Calvinistic worshippers at first, but its doctrines later changed to Strict Baptist. Its successor maintained this character, and in its later years—along with another church in Brighton–was a member of an organisation for Reformed Evangelical Christian churches. Decline in the 21st century led to its closure and a period of dereliction during which it was squatted. The building was starkly Modernist in style, with echoes of Basil Spence's Coventry Cathedral–a contrast to the Classical appearance of the West Street Tabernacle. HistoryWest Street= Protestant Nonconformism was a significant feature of the religious life of East Sussex from the 17th century–in particular a local form of Calvinist doctrine \\"explicitly rooted in 16th-century puritanism\\". In Brighton, the largest town, several Strict Baptist and independent Calvinistic causes were founded in the 18th and 19th centuries, all of which could trace their origins back to one of two older churches: Salem Chapel (1766) and Providence Chapel (1805). Salem Chapel on Bond Street in the North Laine district was formed when some members of Bethel Strict Baptist Chapel, Wivelsfield were sent to offer assistance to a group of Calvinistic Baptists who wanted to found a church in Brighton. A permanent chapel was built in 1787, rebuilt in 1861 and survived until 1974, having closed two years earlier. Providence Chapel, an independent Calvinistic cause on nearby Church Street, was founded by a former curate of St Nicholas Church who had seceded from the Church of England and met the Calvinistic preacher William Huntington, who helped him to found the new chapel. One of the later chapels was the Tabernacle on West Street, opened in 1834. One source states that it was one of three founded by seceders from Providence Chapel, along with the short-lived Cave Adullam (1836) and Jireh (1842) chapels; while another historian states that on 13 August 1833, a visiting preacher from London had to step in at short notice to lead a special service at Salem Chapel after the minister was taken ill, and that \\"his testimony that day was [so] well received\\" that worshippers asked for him to return to Brighton and minister there permanently. In January 1834 he began to preach in hired rooms, including the Assembly Room of the Old Ship Hotel; and on 16 April of that year a church was formally constituted along Independent Calvinistic lines under his leadership. A site was found just off West Street, the western boundary of the ancient town, and the foundation stone of the Tabernacle was laid on 1 May 1834. Building work was complete four months later, and the new chapel was registered for the solemnisation of marriages in November 1837. The building was Neoclassical in style, topped with a pediment and with a rendered façade; a photograph from the 1950s, taken after the council cleared buildings which had obscured it from view in order to build Regency Road, shows a tall two-storey three-bay symmetrical façade with arched windows flanked by pilasters of the Ionic order. The chapel had a capacity of 900; the interior had galleries around three sides and a double-decker pulpit entered from a vestry at first-floor level. Until 1865, the theology of the chapel was consistent with other independent Calvinistic chapels and distinct from that of Strict Baptist chapels, which held a narrower view of the doctrine of baptism: to the latter, \\"baptism is the door to the church and communion [should be] confined to those who are members\\". The Tabernacle, in contrast, practised \\"open communion\\"–although some worshippers identified more closely with Strict Baptist beliefs. Disagreement over the election of a new pastor in 1865 led to a secession by Strict Baptist members, who founded Galeed Chapel on nearby Gloucester Road in 1868. In 1906, though, the Tabernacle itself was reconstituted as a Strict Baptist chapel after the election of the next minister. Such doctrinal shifts were common: \\"many–even a majority of–Strict Baptist causes in Sussex have Independent origins\\". By the 1960s the chapel was too large for its remaining congregation, and the land west of West Street was proposed for redevelopment by Brighton Corporation. Plans were drawn up in 1960, a public inquiry took place in 1962, and the compulsory purchase of buildings covering was agreed in January 1963. Among them was the Tabernacle, which was demolished two years later; its registration was formally cancelled in November of that year. A new church hall for St Paul's Church, named Wagner Hall after its long-serving vicar Arthur Wagner, was built on the site of the Tabernacle. =Montpelier Place= The derelict church in December 2017, days before demolition started At the same time, work started on a replacement church for the congregation. In the Montpelier district of Brighton, on the border with Hove, a site had become available at the corner of Montpelier Place and Norfolk Terrace. It had been the site of the Emmanuel Reformed Episcopal Church, a rendered Early English Gothic Revival building with a corner tower, which had been built in 1867. This building was cleared away in 1965, and later that year E. Joseph Wood was commissioned to design the new building. The foundation stone from the old chapel was incorporated into one of the external walls. The new chapel was built across the ancient parish boundary of Brighton and Hove. Work continued until the church opened on 1 April 1967. It was fomally registered for worship for Strict Baptists on 15 May of that year, and licensed for the solemnisation of marriages (under the name Baptist Tabernacle) on the same date. Later, the church aligned itself with GraceNet UK, an association of Reformed Evangelical Christian churches and organisations, along with the Ebenezer Reformed Baptist Church–another long-established chapel in Brighton. Decline set in at Montpelier Place Baptist Church in the 21st century. Its GraceNet UK counterpart Ebenzer Chapel was demolished and rebuilt in 2006–07 as a new church with flats above; and there was no longer the requirement for two churches in the city. Montpelier Place Baptist Church closed in 2012 and stood empty until it was squatted in early 2014. Its registration for marriages was formally cancelled in December of the same year. The Brighton and Hove Islamic Cultural Centre, owners of a nearby mosque, had considered the site as a location for a new mosque and Muslim community centre, but in 2017 the Grace Baptist Trust sold the derelict building to developers for £3 million. In the same year a local firm, Crowther Architects Associates LLP, drew up plans for residential redevelopment of the site, consisting of three blocks featuring five townhouses, 19 flats and one building for commercial or community use. Planning permission for this was granted in October 2017, demolition of the church started soon afterwards and was complete by early 2018, and the new development (named Montpelier Place in marketing material) was completed in December 2019. Architecture Detail of part of the saw-tooth roof and brick arcade The Montpelier district of Brighton is largely homogeneous: developed mostly in the 1840s and 1850s, with some gaps filled in later in the 19th century, it is \\"largely Regency or post- Regency in style\\", with some elements of Italianate and early Victorian architecture. There are few \\"significant interruptions to the stuccoed orthodoxy\\", and 20th-century buildings are even rarer: Montpelier Place Baptist Church was therefore a distinctive feature. Architecturally, the church has been described as \\"in isolation not without merit, but too low and spreading\\" in the context of a closely built urban environment of tall 19th- century buildings. The main façade of the building faced south, with a wide western bay and narrower eastern bay, both topped with shallow gables and separated by an arcade formed by narrow vertical brick slabs topped by a \\"saw- tooth overhanging roof reminiscent of Coventry Cathedral\\", which had opened in 1961. Behind this arcade was a partly open courtyard. The larger, western part of the building was the church; the eastern section was used as a hall. Both of the southern walls of these bays had an \\"incised\\" pattern of vertical bands of recessed bricks.

Early life Ambassador Leishman and his family, . Nancy Louise Leishman was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on October 2, 1894. She was the youngest of three children born to John George Alexander Leishman (1857–1924) by Julia (née Crawford) Leishman (1864–1918). Her father, the son of Scots-Irish immigrants who eventually became the president of Carnegie Steel, served as the U.S. Ambassador to Switzerland, Turkey, Italy, and Germany during the administrations of U.S. Presidents William McKinley, William Howard Taft, and Woodrow Wilson. Her sister, Marthe Leishman, a favorite of King George V and a close friend of Cole PorterCole Porter, by Charles Schwartz, page 56. and Francis Poulenc,Entrancing Muse, by Carl B. Schmidt, 2001, page 191 married twice, first to Count Louis de Gontaut-Biron and, after his death, to American heir James Hazen Hyde. Her brother, John Leishman Jr., married, and divorced, New York socialite Elizabeth Helene Demarest. Her paternal grandparents were John Leishman and Amelia (née Henderson) Leishman and her maternal grandparents were Edward Crawford and Nancy Harriet (née Ferguson) Crawford. Personal life While her father was serving as the American Ambassador to Germany, Nancy met and fell in love with Karl, 13th Prince von Croÿ. As Nancy was a commoner (and an American) and Karl a prince who ranked among the highest nobility of titled Europeans, the opposition to their marriage was enormous. Karl's aunt, Princess Isabella of Croÿ (wife of Archduke Friedrich, Duke of Teschen), was chief among the European nobility who vehemently protested the match, which led to Kaiser Wilhelm II to refuse to give his official permission for their marriage. In July 1912, Prince Karl's sister, Princess Isabella Antonie of Croÿ had married Prince Franz of Bavaria (third son of Archduchess Maria Theresia and Ludwig III, the last King of Bavaria). Nevertheless, Nancy and Karl married on 27 October 1913 at Versoix, Canton of Geneva, Switzerland. As a result of the impasse between the Kaiser and her father over her marriage to Croÿ, Leishman left his post in Berlin in 1913 and retired to private life. Before their divorce in 1922, they were the parents of: * Carl Emmanuel Herzog, 14th Prince von Croÿ (1914–2011), who married Princess Gabriele, daughter of Crown Prince Rupprecht of Bavaria (eldest son of Ludwig III), in 1953. * Princess Antoinette Emma Laurenzia Charlotte Ludmille Juliette Marthe Helene Sabina von Croÿ (b. 1915), who married Jurgen von Gorne in 1944. They divorced in 1947 and married, Frederick Nelson Tucker in 1948. They divorced in 1956 and she married Douglas Auff'm-Ordt in 1981. * Princess Marie-Luise Natalie Engelberta Ludmilla Nancy Julie von Croÿ (b. 1919), who married Richard Metz, a son of Herman A. Metz, in 1941. They divorced in 1949, and she married H. Nelson Slater III in 1952. After his death in 1968, she married Frederick Baldwin Adams Jr., son of Frederick Baldwin Adams and Ellen (née Delano) Adams (a first cousin of President Franklin D. Roosevelt), in 1969. She married, secondly, Markus Andreas d'Oldenberg (1877–1939), the Danish Ambassador to France and son of Valdemar von Oldenburg. Regardless of the opposition to the marriage, her son Carl was eventually deemed eligible to inherit the properties of the family upon Karl's death in 1974 when he became the 14th Prince von Croÿ. She died on 22 February 1983 at age 88 at Copenhagen, Denmark. =Descendants= Through her eldest son, Carl, 14th Prince von Croÿ, she was a grandmother of Rudolf, 15th Prince von Croÿ (b. 1955), who married Alexandra, a member of Miloradović noble family.

Biography Guglielmo Piani was born on 16 September 1975 in Martinengo, Italy. He was ordained a priest of the Salesians of Don Bosco on 15 May 1898. On 16 December 1921, Pope Benedict XV appointed him titular bishop of Palaeopolis in Pamphylia and auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Puebla de los Ángeles. This was quickly revised because of intense conflict between the Church and the Mexican government, and on 17 March 1922 he was named titular archbishop of Dramas and Apostolic Delegate to the Philippines. He received his episcopal consecration in Rome on 14 May 1922. His service in the Philippines was interrupted in 1936 when he visited Mexico as an Apostolic Visitor to develop an independent assessment of the ongoing conflict between the government and the Church. He arrived in June shortly after the death of Pascual Díaz y Barreto, Archbishop of Mexico, on 19 May 1936 and it fell to him to recommend a successor. He continued from Mexico to Rome on other business, and there he provided intelligence that led Pope Pius XI to address an encyclical to the bishops of Mexico that directed them to adopt a less confrontational posture. On 5 October 1948, Pope Pius XII named him Apostolic Visitor to Mexico with the authority of Apostolic Delegate. He received the title of Apostolic Delegate to Mexico on 13 April 1951.

Todd Muller and Nikki Kaye stood against the existing leader Simon Bridges and his deputy leader Paula Bennett following poor polling results. Muller and Kaye won the votes and became the new leader and deputy leader respectively.  Background  After the National Party lost the 2017 election, its leader Bill English resigned and Simon Bridges won the leadership election in February 2018. Bridges had promised a \\"generational refresh\\" of a National Party in Opposition for the first time in almost a decade. Under Bridges' leadership, National continued to poll between 40% and 45% and on some polls was projected to be able to form a government with the support of ACT New Zealand. However, Bridges' personal popularity remained well below that of Prime Minister and Labour Party leader Jacinda Ardern. Despite this, he saw off an apparent challenge for the leadership made by Judith Collins in April 2019, although a leadership election was never called. In September 2020, the National- supporting political commentator Matthew Hooton alleged that at this time Collins had formed a leadership ticket with Todd Muller, but they had been unable to gather sufficient support to remove Bridges. Bridges' judgement was questioned throughout his leadership. Among other incidents, he received criticism for describing National MP Jami-Lee Ross as having \\"embarrassing\\" personal health problems ahead of Ross quitting to become an independent MP and for describing a National Party staffer as \\"junior\\" and \\"emotional\\" when he deleted, in the aftermath of the Christchurch mosque shootings, an anti- migration petition that was hosted on the Party's website. In April 2020, during New Zealand's COVID-19 pandemic, Bridges published a long Facebook post criticising the Government's response to COVID-19. The post attracted more than 25,000 comments, most of them negative. Opinion polling would show that most New Zealanders supported the Government's decision to implement a nationwide stay-at-home order and the Government's economic response. Bridges also received some criticism for choosing to drive weekly between his home in Tauranga and Parliament to chair the Epidemic Response Committee, which was meeting virtually over Zoom. On 18 May 2020, four months before the next general election, a poll was released in which 56.5% of those surveyed would vote for Labour, compared with 30.6% for National. The same poll reported that 59.5% of those surveyed preferred Labour's leader Jacinda Ardern for prime minister, whereas Simon Bridges was preferred by only 4.5%. This was the first public poll since the COVID-19 pandemic reached New Zealand, and Labour had seen widespread support for its actions in the pandemic including from National supporters. By 19 May, media were reporting on a challenge to Bridges' leadership, citing comments from anonymous National MPs. Also on 19 May, Muller said he had no leadership ambitions and wasn't interested in the job. But on 20 May Muller confirmed in an email to National MPs that he would challenge for the National Party leadership. Later that day the party announced that the vote would be held on 22 May. Former National Party president Michelle Boag said that the poll was not the only reason for the leadership challenge, describing it as the \\"catalyst\\" but saying that there had been \\"months and months, and sometimes years, of [National] MPs having negative feedback about their leader, not only from party members but from constituents.\\" Some National MPs told reporters that a leadership challenge by Muller had been \\"brewing for a while.\\" Muller arrived in Wellington on 21 May in order to talk with National MPs one-on-one. When asked whether Nikki Kaye was his running mate for the deputy position, he refused to comment, saying \\"all conversations about leadership should stay within caucus\\". Kaye also refused to confirm she was Muller's running mate. That night, another poll was released which had Labour at 59% and National at 29%. In this poll, which was conducted from 16 to 20 May, Bridges received 5% support as preferred prime minister, while Muller received 0.2%. National MPs arrived at Parliament on the morning of 22 May for an emergency caucus meeting to be held at midday, many having flown into Wellington that morning. Very few would indicate which way they intended to vote, and the vote was a secret ballot.

Collins declined to say who she would support ahead of the vote, but a month later confirmed that she had voted for Muller. *Mark Mitchell, MP for Rodney since 2011. Mitchell pledged support to Bridges on 20 May. Despite media speculation, Mitchell confirmed on the day of the vote that he would not run in the election.  Results  Todd Muller won the vote for the party leadership, and Nikki Kaye won the vote for the deputy position in a secret ballot. On 24 May, the Herald on Sunday reported that Muller may have won the leadership by a single vote. By contrast, Stuff reported that while Bridges' supporters were claiming such a margin, the margin was likely to have been wider.  Aftermath  On 25 May, three days after the election, Muller announced a National caucus reshuffle, though there were only a few changes. Amy Adams, who had planned to retire at the 2020 election, instead changed her mind and was awarded the newly created \\"Covid-19 Recovery\\" portfolio. It was reported that Simon Bridges was offered the Justice portfolio; reportedly he turned it down and asked for the Foreign Affairs portfolio, but was refused it. Bridges was not given any caucus ranking but Muller said that there would be a place for Bridges in his senior leadership team should he decide to stay in politics. Bridges announced he was staying in the party and would run again for the Tauranga electorate he currently represents. Paula Bennett announced on 29 June her intention to retire from politics at the 2020 general election. Her announcement prompted a second caucus reshuffle; in this reshuffle Bridges was given the Foreign Affairs portfolio he wanted and a caucus ranking of 17. Muller held the position of National Party leader for less than two months. Muller would later reveal that he suffered severe panic attacks, starting five days after his election, which became worse as the days went on, until he found himself unable to get out of bed. On 14 July 2020, he resigned as leader, saying: \\"the role has taken a heavy toll on me personally, and on my family, and this has become untenable from a health perspective.\\" This triggered the second leadership election in 2020.

In 2019 she published Dress in the Age of Jane Austen. Professional career Early in her career Davidson traveled widely, and became an artisanal expert in recreating vintage clothing. In 2012 Austrian archeologists published a report on their discovery of medieval bras. Davidson's opinion on this discovery was widely quoted. She called the bras an amazing find, said one was very similar to a modern bra, and compared them to a missing link. In 2018 a team of archeologists found a skeleton that was still wearing thigh high leather boots, in mud in the Thames River. Science Alert quoted Davidson, to provide context of the discovery, for its readers. She clarified that while thigh-high boots are a fashion item today, these boots seem to be designed for a working man, whose job required him to be wading in the shallows of the Thames. The Bill & Ted test Slate magazine credits Davidson for a Bill & Ted test for period costume accuracy. In an interview with Slate Davidson described spending six years working on Dress in the Age of Jane Austen, which required a great deal of meticulous checking of modern works. She described having the movie Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure playing in the background, when the heroes capture Beethoven. Slate reported that Davidson created new twitter ID @BillAndTedTest specifically to publish analysis of the costume design of period movies. Slate quoted the tweet where Davidson gave the test its name. Davidson described being stunned at the authenticity of the costuming of the scenes in Bill & Ted set in Beethoven's time. Even the background characters in those scenes were wearing very authentic costumes. Surprisingly, the costume designers had achieved much more authentic costumes than more serious films with larger budgets.

Early Life  Born in Thessaloniki, , his father Rabbi Shabbethai may have been a minor community leader. In his early years he studied under Rabbi Aaron Sason, Rabbi Joseph Escapa, Rabbi Shlomo HaCohen and Rabbi Samuel de Medina. At the age of thirty seven, he subsequently became the Rosh Yeshivah of the \\"Shalom\\" community. Thousands of students came to his Yeshiva from surrounding Balkan communities and he had several illustrious pupils such as; Yehoshua Khandali, and David Conforte. In 1607 he succeeded Samuel Florentine as the Chief Rabbi of Thessaloniki.  Rabbinic position  During his time as the Chief Rabbi of Thessaloniki, Shabbethai exemplified himself as a leading halakhic authority of his time. His tenure was defined not only by excellent local leadership but also by an extensive relationship to other diasporic communities, (notably the Sephardic Jews of Dutch Brazil, headed by Moses Raphael de Aguilar and Isaac Aboab da Fonseca). In fact one of the three volumes of his responsa Sefer Torat Hayyim relates to a question asked by the Jews of Brazil, regarding whether they should pray for rain, due of the reversal of seasons south of the equator. This ultimately ended up being the first recorded responsa of the New World. In addition, he had close relationships with the communities of Safed , Venice , Sofia and Rhodes, who would often approach Shabbethai for halakhic direction. He devoted himself assiduously to congregational matters, introducing many important halakhic regulations, which are relevant to this day.  Works  Some of his most famous works are as follows: * Sefer Torat Ḥayyim (ספר תורת חיים) - widely considered his Magnum Opus, published in 1713, 1715, 1722 in Thessaloniki. A three volume responsa (שאלות ותשובות), mostly on Shulchan Aruch, Even Ha'ezer, Choshen Mishpat and laws relating to agunot as well as several other different topics. * Torat ha-Zevaaḥ (תורת הזבח) - on the laws of kosher ritual animal slaughter and inspection. * Moda'ah ve-Ones (מודעה ואונס) - published in 1628 in Thessaloniki, and once again in 1798 in Lviv, with commentaries of Jeremiah Mattersdorf and his son Joab. On laws regarding contracts entered into under duress. He also wrote several commentaries on the talmudic tractate Ta'anit as well as others, which were printed in \\"Sefer Torat Moshe\\" written by his son Mosses Shabbethai.

At the time of the establishment of the community's post office, one of the lines of the Savannah, Florida and Western Railway passed through Aimar, which was part of Liberty County at the time. On July 14, 1908, Aimar filed a petition for a depot on the succeeding Atlantic Coast Line Railroad (ACL), which continued passing through the community as of 1955. After investigating the 1908 petition, the Railroad Commission of Georgia determined that the demands \\"were not sufficient in justifying an order requiring the erection of a depot at said point.\\" The community had a railway station for the ACL. The population of Aimar was estimated to be 100 in 1912. When the post office closed, mail to Aimar was supplied from Ludowici as of 1915. As of 1916, the community's closest access to attorneys was in Jesup, and as of 1917, the closest access to banks was in Ludowici. Aimar became part of the newly created Long County in 1920.

Description  Twining herbaceous Lianas with ovate-lanceolate leaves. The solitary flowers, with a violet corolla, are strongly zygomorphic (bilaterally symmetrical) with the very large bottom petal differentiated into a claw and blade and are saccate (pouch like) at the base. On the five stamens, the filaments are weakly connate (fused) with the two lowest anthers weakly calcarate (spurred) and possessing a large dorsal connective appendage that is entire and oblongovate. In the gynoecium, the style is filiform- rostellate (threadlike and beaked). The fruit is a thin walled elastic follicle dehiscing by a single longitudinal suture. There are several seeds per carpel, that are obovoid with a pair of basal-lateral expansions.  Taxonomy  The genus Hybanthopsis was first described by Paula-Souza in 2003, with a single species, Hybanthopsis bahiensis which thus is considered the type species. Therefore the genus bears the name, Paula-Souza, as the botanical authority. The genus resembled the previously described Hybanthus in floral structure, but with important distinctions in terms of seed and fruit morphology, which are unique among neotropical Violaceae. Only one species of Hybanthus is a twining plant, and the floral structure is quite different to two of the other lianescent genera, Anchietea and Calyptrion but closer to that of Agatea, while the seeds more closely resemble Anchietea. Hybanthopsis is one of four lianescent genera in Violaceae, together with Calyptrion Ging., Agatea A.Gray and Anchietea Paula-Souza. Historically, these genera were distributed among separate subtribes, with Anchietea within subtribe Violinae with Calyptrion and Hybanthopsis and Agatea in subtribe Hybanthinae. Molecular phylogenetic studies have now grouped these four genera together into a single lianescent clade, one of four within the family Violaceae. = Etymology = The genus Hybanthopsis is named after the genus Hybanthus from which it is differentiated, the suffix -opsis indicating similarity in Greek (). The specific epithet bahiensis indicates its discovery in Bahia. = Species = Hybanthopsis is a monotypic genus, with a single species: * Hybanthopsis bahiensis Paula-Souza  Distribution and habitat  Arid deciduous forests (caatingas) of central and east Bahia, North-east Brazil, particularly disturbed areas such as forest borders and the roadsde.

Carpenter (March 30, 1867 – October 22, 1937) was an attorney and government official from Vermont. A Democrat, among the offices in which he served was United States Marshal for the District of Vermont (1914-1922) and judge of the Brattleboro, Vermont municipal court (1923-1929). Early life Arthur Perry Carpenter was born in Readsboro, Vermont on March 30, 1867, the son of Solomon R. and Laura M. (Bishop) Carpenter. He was raised on his father's farm in Readsboro and attended the public schools. In 1887, Carpenter graduated from Castleton Normal School, after which he taught school at several locations in the Readsboro area. He attended a commercial course at Rochester Business University of Rochester, New York, from which he graduated in 1890. While working as a bookkeeper, Carpenter studied law with attorney Stephen T. Davenport of Brattleboro, Vermont. He was admitted to the bar in 1896, and began a practice in North Adams, Massachusetts in partnership with Cornelius A. Parker. He received his LL.B. degree from Boston University School of Law in 1897. One of Carpenter's law school classmates was David I. Walsh, with whom he remained friendly after their graduation. Start of career Carpenter and Parker practiced together until 1900, when they dissolved their partnership. Carpenter continued to practice in North Adams, and later opened a branch office in Readsboro. As a resident of Whitingham, Vermont, Carpenter served in local offices including school board member. He served on the board of directors of the Berkshire County Cooperative Bank and was secretary of the Hoosac Valley Agricultural Society. Carpenter was a member of the Masonic lodge in Jacksonville, Vermont and the Royal Arcanum’s Berkshire Council. In 1904, Carpenter sold his law practice and planned to move to Michigan. He worked briefly as counsel for a corporation in Detroit before moving to Brattleboro, where he continued to practice law. A Democrat during an era when Republicans controlled Vermont's government, Carpenter was an unsuccessful candidate for several offices in Windham County, including state's attorney. In addition, he served for several years as chairman of the party in Brattleboro. Despite his party affiliation, for several years Carpenter served as Brattleboro's town agent and town attorney and a justice of the peace. After becoming a resident of Brattleboro, Carpenter was active in the town's Order of Royal and Select Masters commandery and Knights Templar preceptory. United States Marshal In February 1914, Carpenter was appointed U.S. Marshal for Vermont, succeeding Horace W. Bailey, who had died in January. He served until June 1922 and was succeeded by Albert W. Harvey. As marshal, one of Carpenter's first acts was to reappoint Frank H. Chapman as chief deputy marshal. Chapman had served as chief deputy since 1901 and had held the post under Carpenter's two immediate predecessors. He continued to serve until retiring in 1923. During World War I, Carpenter was involved in arrests of suspected German agents and sympathizers. In addition, he enforced anti-immigration laws against individuals attempting to illegally cross the Canadian border. Carpenter also arrested US service members who committed crimes in Vermont or were reported as absent without leave or having deserted. After passage of the Eighteenth Amendment, which prohibited the manufacture and sale of alcohol, Carpenter arrested several individuals for selling hard cider and other alcoholic beverages. Later life After his tenure as marshal ended, Carpenter resumed practicing law. In 1923 he was appointed judge of Brattleboro's municipal court, succeeding Frank D. E. Stowe. He was reappointed to successive two year terms and served until 1929, when he was succeeded by Orrin B. Hughes. In 1936 he was a delegate to the Vermont Democratic Party's state convention. Death and burial Carpenter died in Boston on October 22, 1937. He received Masonic funeral rites at a memorial service in Brattleboro. Carpenter was buried at Arms Cemetery in Shelburne Falls, Massachusetts. Family In 1897, Carpenter married Addie Laura Boynton (1875-1959). They were married until his death, and had no children.

As of August 2019, Cum Town was the sixth highest earning podcast on Patreon. It has featured guests including David Cross, Bam Margera, Bonnie McFarlane, Jim Norton, Kurt Metzger, Brandon Wardell, and Dasha Nekrasova (who is a former fiancée of one of the co-hosts, Adam Friedland). Cum Town received coverage after Saturday Night Live pulled Shane Gillis from its cast for making controversial jokes and remarks on his own podcast. Gillis had been a guest on Cum Town and is a friend of the hosts. Format Cum Town episodes usually range between 60 and 90 minutes in length. The format is almost entirely unplanned, with the hosts' aimless conversation giving way to improvised comedic characters and sketches. Many riffs come from crude puns and rhymes—for example, \\"Louis SeemsGay\\" instead of Louis C.K.—and usually involve sexually explicit scenarios as well as ethnic and racial stereotypes. Mullen is the primary host and producer of the show, with Halkias as co-host. Friedland, who appears least frequently of the three, first appeared in the show's second episode and often serves as the butt of Mullen and Halkias' jokes and insults. The first 24 episodes began with the theme song from 1990s sitcom Home Improvement. During the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, the show was conducted via Zoom; episodes were broadcast live via YouTube. Nick does many celebrity impressions, including Donald Trump, Barack Obama, Michael Douglas, Dennis Hopper, E. Jean Carroll, Patrick Warburton, Rip Torn, John Hamm, and Homer Simpson. Dirtbag left association Cum Town is often associated with the dirtbag left, though it is not focused on politics. In a February 2020 article, New York Times described Cum Town (by allusion, citing its \\"unprintable name\\") as \\"bards of the new American left\\" alongside podcasts Chapo Trap House and Red Scare. Several Chapo hosts, including Amber A'Lee Frost, Will Menaker, and Felix Biederman, have appeared on Cum Town; Mullen, Halkias, and Friedland have individually made multiple appearances on Chapo. Though the hosts occasionally discuss their responses to current events and politics—with all three expressing support for 2020 presidential candidate Bernie Sanders—they deny any specific political agenda.

It has since become one of Crenshaw's most famous songs. It has since seen positive critical reception and has become a live favorite, often in a slower style. Background According to Crenshaw, \\"There She Goes Again\\" was inspired by memories of his youth, which he characterized as a time when \\"everything took place in cars.\\" Described by Crenshaw as \\"a pretty typical subject for a rock and roll song,\\" the song lyrically focuses on seeing a girl pass by through a window.

The west wall was likely rebuilt in the late 5th century, as a doorway on the west side of the atrium stands unusually inside the arch, and has an inscription dating to October 480 CE. Church of St. Sergius (West Church), Babisqa (بابسقا), Syria - West facade - PHBZ024 2016 4906 - Dumbarton Oaks The west church is the latest dated Byzantine church in northern Syria and is dedicated to Saint Sergius. It has a 4-bay nave, and rectangular presbyterium with square side chambers. The preserved west wall bears an inscription in the doorway, indicating the church's 609-610 CE date. The east wall has a sanctuary window. A pier on the south side of the chancel arch still stands, while side walls, interior arches, and upper parts of the east end's side chambers have fallen. The west entrance features curvilinear moldings, a popular decorative type employed in the late 6th century. Syrian Civil War Babisqa is located near Bab al-Hawa, a contested area along the Syrian-Turkish border crossing. Babisqa has thus become a military site throughout the Syrian Civil War, functioning as a storage depot for the supreme military council of the Free Syrian Army and acting as a battleground for military violence.

Other factors that contribute to iatrogenic anemia include bleeding from medical procedures and dilution of the blood by intravenous fluids. People may receive blood transfusions to treat iatrogenic anemia, which carries risks for complications like transfusion reactions and circulatory overload. Incidence and cause A 2013 study of over 400,000 people admitted to US hospitals found that 74% developed anemia at some point during their hospital stay. Iatrogenic anemia is of particular concern in intensive care medicine, because people who are critically ill require frequent blood tests and have a higher risk of developing anemia due to lower hemoglobin levels and impaired production of red blood cells (erythropoesis) at baseline. The average intensive care unit (ICU) patient loses up to 660 mL of blood per week to laboratory testing. For each day in the ICU, it is estimated that a person's hemoglobin level falls by 5 g/L (0.5 g/dL), 80% of which is due to phlebotomy. On the second day of admission to the ICU, more than 70% of adults exhibit anemia, over half of whom will go on to require a blood transfusion. In the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), the issue is exacerbated by the patients' low body weight: it is estimated that during their first six weeks of life, infants in NICUs may lose 15−30% of their blood volume to blood draws. Premature babies often suffer from anemia of prematurity, which is caused by low production of erythropoietin (a hormone that stimulates red blood cell production) and the short lifespan of neonates' red blood cells, and is worsened by blood loss through phlebotomy. People who are receiving dialysis lose blood not only through sampling for laboratory tests, but from the dialysis process itself and from bleeding caused by accessing veins to attach the dialysis equipment. This iatrogenic anemia often occurs alongside the anemia caused by kidney disease. Another factor that contributes to anemia in hospitalized people is the use of intravenous fluids. Infusion with large volumes of intravenous fluids dilutes the blood, causing a decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit level. This is not a true anemia, as no red blood cells are lost and the body eventually compensates for the effects of the infusion. However, the decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit may lead to unnecessary transfusion. Blood loss through surgery and through medical procedures such as central line placement also play a role, as does the use of certain drugs which can suppress the bone marrow's ability to produce red blood cells. Complications People who develop iatrogenic anemia spend a longer amount of time in the hospital and have an increased risk of mortality. They are also more likely to receive blood transfusions, which carries risks for various conditions, including transfusion reactions, lung injury, circulatory overload and alloimmunization. After the initial development of anemia, further testing may be ordered to monitor and investigate the condition, which worsens the anemia and the attendant risks for complications. Prevention The volume of blood needed for most laboratory tests is lower than the amount that is commonly drawn; a 2008 study found that only 9% of the blood in standard sized blood tubes was used for testing. Using smaller tubes for blood tests can decrease the risk of anemia, but it may increase the risk of laboratory errors. Point-of-care testing, meaning testing performed at a patient's bedside rather than in a medical laboratory, typically uses much smaller blood volumes than conventional testing; however, as of 2019, there is insufficent evidence regarding the effects of point-of-care testing on iatrogenic anemia. The use of closed blood sampling devices, which return excess blood from blood draws or line flushes to the person's circulation, can decrease the amount of blood loss in hospitalized patients. Strategies to decrease the amount of blood tests ordered, such as clinician education and auditing, or restricting test orders through the electronic health record, have also been investigated.

It stars Bella Thorne, Jake Manley, Amber Riley, Michael Sirow and Marisa Coughlan. It follows the story of two young lovers robbing their way across the southland, posting their exploits to social media, and gaining fame and followers as a result. The film was released on June 12, 2020, by Vertical Entertainment, and received negative reviews from critics. However, Thorne's performance received critical acclaim and was cited as the highlight of the film. Plot In Florida, Arielle lives with her mother Janet. Janet has a boyfriend named Bobby who is pretty much a bum. Arielle enjoys being on social media and has few followers. One night, she goes to a party where she gets into a fight and beats up a girl while everyone at the party films the fight and post it on social media. Arielle immediately gets 147 new followers. Dean Taylor is new to town and stays with his dad. Arielle meets him while he is working on his car. They spend time together at a party, where Dean reveals he was in prison for armed robbery and assault, and that his parole requires him to be with his father since his mother is dead. His father is an abusive drunk. She tells him how badly she wants to get out of Florida and go to Hollywood to be famous. One day, Arielle finds all her saved money missing. Right away, she bursts into Janet's room where she and Bobby are in bed. Arielle blames Bobby of stealing her money and attacks Bobby, but Bobby pushes her and she hits her head against the wall. Arielle leaves after threatening to kill him. She goes to Dean’s home and finds his father beating him. Arielle tries to intervene but again gets hit on her head after getting thrown to the ground. Dean fights his father who ends up falling down the stairs and dies after hitting his head. Arielle and Dean begin to leave town right away but realizing that they have no money, they decide to rob a gas station with Dean's gun. Arielle livestreams as Dean commits the robbery. Dean is unaware of being live streamed. Arielle sees that her social media account has three thousand followers. Dean gets angry when he comes to know that Arielle has been live streaming their crimes, but Arielle says she used IP blocker and didn't show their faces. She says it will lead to fame and money. Still short on money, Dean suggests they rob a dispensary next. This time, Dean films as Arielle does the robbing. With more crimes filmed, Arielle’s account gets over three million followers. Eventually, the police identify them and Dean and Arielle see their faces on the news. Dean is angry about the social media, but Arielle is elated to be famous. On the road, they get pulled over, and Dean tells Arielle not to start anything. When the officer goes to check their IDs, Arielle gets out of the car and shoots the officer. Arielle and Dean go into hiding for a while and this leads to Arielle losing her subscribers and followers. Dean and Arielle get into an argument where Dean tries to make her realize about how serious of a crime she committed whereas Arielle says that she did it for him but Dean disagrees as he thinks she did it for fame. Even though they have enough money and do not need anymore, Arielle still goes off on her own to commit a robbery at a gas station and accidentally kills a customer who startled her. The clerk gets a chance to grab a gun and shoots Arielle in the shoulder as she flees. Dean is extremely upset that everyone now knows where they are. The police have found them and thus begins a car chase and a shootout. They realize that they left their money behind. Once they get away from the police, Dean removes the bullet from her shoulder. Arielle takes pictures of her wounds for her followers, making Dean angry again. Dean blames Arielle for the whole situation since her coming over led to his dad’s death. Arielle slaps him repeatedly and then kisses him. A woman driving by sees Arielle and the broken down truck. She pulls over to help and Arielle pulls out her gun and says they need a place to stay for a night. Elle reveals she follows Arielle online and that she knew who they were before she pulled up. At Elle’s place, Dean asks her why she follows Arielle. Elle explains that her life hasn’t worked out and that people find them empowering. Dean tells her no one should want to be like them. The next day, Elle drives them through a police checkpoint. Once they’re through, they give Elle a bottle of water and take her car, directing her to walk back to the gas station they passed and to report her car stolen to get the insurance reimbursement. Elle wants to go with them, but Dean refuses. Arielle takes a picture with her and posts it, telling her lots of people are going to want to talk to her after that. Arielle and Dean drive off. Later, they stop at the home of Kyle, Dean's contact. Kyle’s crew plans to rob a bank but needs an extra gunmen. Arielle wants in, but Dean thinks it’s a bad idea. He wants to leave and go to Mexico, but Arielle holds firm, wanting the money and the followers. Dean makes Arielle promise that if they do this job she will leave with him after. During the robbery, even though Kyle insisted on no social media, Arielle streams it to her five million followers. On the other hand, Kyle becomes upset after not being able to find the money they expected and in anger shoots a bank worker. As they are about to leave, they find cops already outside surrounding the bank. Kyle realizes it’s because Arielle streamed the bank robbery and (accidentally) the name of the bank. Kyle and his crew get into a shootout with Arielle and Dean where Kyle and Dean end up shooting each other and both die. The police arrest Arielle and as they bring her out of the bank, she sees hundreds of fans and followers with signs cheering her, giving her fame that she always wanted. Cast * Bella Thorne as Arielle Summers * Jake Manley as Dean Taylor * Amber Riley as Elle * Michael Sirow as Kyle * Marisa Coughlan as Janet Production In February 2019, it was announced Bella Thorne had joined the cast of the film, then titled Southland with Joshua Caldwell directing from a screenplay he wrote before the title was changed to Infamous. In May 2019, Jake Manley joined the cast of the film. In July 2019, Amber Riley and Michael Sirow joined the cast of the film. Principal photography began in July 2019, taking part in Guthrie, Oklahoma and other smaller towns around the state. Release In May 2020, Vertical Entertainment acquired distribution rights to the film. It was released on video-on-demand and in a select number of theaters (mostly drive-ins) on June 12, 2020. ReceptionBox office= Infamous made $160,371 from 58 theaters in its opening weekend, finishing second among reported films. In its second weekend the film made $94,984 from 37 theaters (dropping 41%) and then $36,592 from nine. =Critical response= On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 21% based on 28 reviews, with an average rating of 4.48/10. The site's critics consensus reads: \\"Infamous attempts to level an indictment against modern youth, but only manages to offer a forgettable story with little of interest to say.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 40 out of 100, based on six critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Molly Freeman from Screen Rant wrote that the film \\"serves as an exciting crime thriller and a compelling look at what - in a most extreme case - will drive someone to do anything for fame. Caldwell's movie, thanks to his directing eye and the work of cinematographer Eve Cohen, is also beautiful to watch, depicting a stylized and hyperreal version of reality that mixes with the grit and grime of real life.\\" Joe Leyden of Variety called the film \\"a warmed-over 'Bonnie and Clyde' for the social media era\\" and wrote: \\"One can always make the argument that it's not absolutely necessary to have sympathetic protagonists for a drama to enthrall or enlighten. But Infamous pushes way, way too far in the opposite direction: Dean and especially Arielle seem so irredeemably psychotic even before they begin to mount a body count, you actively wish for them to be caught or killed.\\" Writing for RogerEbert.com, Nick Allen gave the film 2/4 stars and praised Thorne for having \\"the classically great presence of someone like Sandra Bullock, but with her own scraggly edge ... Thorne dominates numerous scenes that catapult her character from clout-hungry wannabe to gun-selfie superstar.\\" However, he criticized Manley's performance, saying, \\"Clyde to Thorne's Bonnie is a total dud.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Category:2020 films Category:2020 independent films Category:2020 thriller films Category:2020s crime thriller films Category:2020s heist films Category:American crime thriller films Category:American films Category:American heist films Category:American independent films Category:Films about social media Category:Films set in Florida Category:Films set in Oklahoma Category:Films set in Texas Category:Teen crime films Category:Teen thriller films Category:Vertical Entertainment films ","title":"Infamous (2020 film)"},{"id":"64010075","text":"The 2010 Dartmouth Big Green football team represented Dartmouth College in the 2010 NCAA Division I FCS football season.

They are known for targeting other conservative groups and individuals whose agendas they view as too moderate and insufficiently nationalist. The Groyper movement has been described as white nationalist, homophobic, antisemitic, and an attempt to rebrand the alt-right movement. Groypers are a loosely defined group with no formal leadership structure. However, they are generally considered to be followers of Nick Fuentes, a far- right political commentator and podcaster. Patrick Casey, the leader of the United States neo-Nazi group Identity Evropa (rebranded in 2019 as the American Identity Movement), is also considered to be a leader of the Groypers. Michelle Malkin, a conservative blogger and political commentator, has referred to herself as the \\"mommy\\" of the Groyper movement.  Ideology  Groypers are extremely conservative and critical of more mainstream conservative organizations, which they believe to be insufficiently nationalist and pro-white. Groypers and their leaders have tried to position the group's ideology as being based around \\"Christian conservatism\\", \\"traditional values\\", and \\"American nationalism\\". Some Groypers downplay the extremism of their positions, and instruct others on how to engage in entryism and radicalization tactics such as slowly introducing their targets to increasingly extreme ideas. Despite attempts to brand themselves more moderately, the group is widely recognized as white nationalist, anti-Semitic, and homophobic. According to the Anti-Defamation League, Groypers blame the mainstream conservative movement, as well as the political left, for what they view as \\"destroying white America\\". They oppose immigration and globalism. Groypers support \\"traditional\\" values such as Christianity, and oppose feminism and LGBTQ rights.  Background  Groypers are named after a cartoon amphibian named \\"Groyper\\", which is a variant of the alt-right symbol Pepe the Frog. Groyper is depicted as a rotund, green, frog-like creature, often in a sitting position with its chin resting on interlocked fingers. There is some disagreement around the specifics of Groyper: it is alternatively said to be a depiction of the Pepe character, a different character from Pepe but of the same species, or a toad. The Groyper meme was used as early as 2015, and became popular in 2017. In 2018, a group of computer scientists studying hateful speech on Twitter observed the Groyper image being used frequently in account avatars among the accounts identified as \\"hateful\\" in their dataset. The researchers observed that the profiles tended to be anonymous and collectively tweeted primarily about politics, race, and religion. Similarly, they detected that the users were not \\"lone wolves\\" and the individuals could be identified as a community with a high network centrality. The same year, Right Wing Watch reported that Massachusetts congressional hopeful Shiva Ayyadurai had created a campaign pin featuring a variation of the Groyper image, which RWW described as an attempt to appeal to the far-right activists on 4chan, Gab, and Twitter who had adopted the meme. Followers of Nick Fuentes began to be known as Groypers beginning in 2019. In September 2019, Ashley St. Clair, a \\"brand ambassador\\" for the conservative student group Turning Point USA, was photographed at an event featuring several allegedly white nationalist and alt-right figures, including Fuentes, Jacob Wohl, and Anthime Gionet, better known as \\"Baked Alaska\\". After Right Wing Watch brought the photographs to Turning Point USA's attention, the organization issued a statement declaring that it had severed ties with St. Clair, and condemning white nationalism as \\"abhorrent and un-American\\". At the 2019 Politicon convention, Fuentes tried to access several of the Turning Point USA events featuring its founder Charlie Kirk, including a line to take photos with Kirk and Kirk's debate with Kyle Kulinski of The Young Turks. Security repeatedly barred him from being allowed anywhere near Kirk, with Fuentes accusing Kirk of deliberately suppressing him in order to avoid a confrontation, as Fuentes had grown critical of Kirk's positions, which he believes are too weak.  Groyper Wars  In the fall of 2019, Kirk launched a college speaking tour with Turning Point USA titled \\"Culture War,\\" featuring himself alongside such guests as Senator Rand Paul, Donald Trump, Jr., Kimberly Guilfoyle, Lara Trump, and Congressman Dan Crenshaw. In retaliation for the firing of St. Clair and the Politicon incident, Fuentes subsequently began organizing a social media campaign asking his followers to go to Kirk's events and ask provocative and controversial leading questions regarding his stances on immigration, Israel, and LGBT rights during the question-and-answer sessions, for the purpose of exposing Kirk as a \\"fake conservative\\". At a Culture War event hosted by Ohio State University on October 29, eleven out of fourteen questions during the Q&A; section were asked by Groypers. Groypers asked questions including, \\"Can you prove that our white European ideals will be maintained if the country is no longer made up of white European descendants?\\" and \\"How does anal sex help us win the culture war?\\" Fuentes' social media campaign against Kirk became known as the \\"Groyper Wars\\". Kirk and others at Turning Point USA, including Benny Johnson and spokesman Rob Smith—a gay black veteran of the Iraq War, and Kirk's co-host at the Ohio State speaking event—began labeling the questioners as white supremacists and anti-Semites. Another Turning Point USA event targeted by the Groypers was a promotional event for Donald Trump Jr.'s book Triggered, featuring Trump, Kirk, and Guilfoyle at the University of California, Los Angeles. Anticipating further questions from Fuentes' followers, it was announced that the originally planned Q&A; portion of the event would be canceled, which led to heckling and boos from the mostly pro-Trump audience. The disruptions eventually forced them to cut the event short after 30 minutes, when it was originally scheduled to last for two hours. Groypers' targets for heckling quickly expanded beyond Charlie Kirk and Turning Point USA. Groypers began targeting other mainstream conservative groups and individuals—which they sometimes collectively call \\"Conservative Inc.\\"—including events hosted by Young America's Foundation and their student outreach branch Young Americans for Freedom, which included such speakers as Ben Shapiro and Matt Walsh of The Daily Wire, and Jonah Goldberg of The Dispatch. Questions posed to their opponents often focus on topics including United States–Israel relations, immigration policy, affirmative action, and LGTBQ conservatives. They regularly use anti-Semitic dogwhistles in their confrontations with other conservatives, including numerous questions about the USS Liberty incident, and references to the \\"dancing Israelis\\" conspiracy theory alleging Israeli involvement in the September 11 attacks.  Other activities  In December 2019, Fuentes announced and held the Groyper Leadership Summit in Florida. A small group attended the event in person, and attendees also joined via livestream. The event was held at the same time and in the same city as Turning Point USA's Student Action Summit (SAS); Groypers argued with SAS attendees outside of their venue, and Fuentes, Patrick Casey, and some Groypers were removed from the SAS venue after attempting to enter. At the Groyper Leadership Summit, Fuentes, Casey, and former InfoWars contributor Jake Lloyd spoke about the Groypers' strategy and ideology. While outside the venue where Turning Point's event was being held, Fuentes eventually crossed paths with Ben Shapiro, who was on his way to the event with his pregnant wife and two children. Fuentes confronted Shapiro over his Stanford speech, while Shapiro refused to acknowledge him. Fuentes faced widespread condemnation from politicians and various pundits—including Nikki Haley, Meghan McCain, Sebastian Gorka, Megyn Kelly, and Michael Avenatti—for confronting Shapiro while he was with his family. In January 2020, Groyper and former leader of Kansas State University's Turning Point USA chapter Jaden McNeil formed the Kansas State University organization America First Students. The group, which shares a name with Fuentes' America First podcast, was conceived at the Groyper Leadership Summit, and Groyper leaders have helped promote the group. The America First Students organization, which states it was formed \\"in defense of Christian values, strong families, closed borders, and the American worker,\\" is considered to push the Groyper movement. In February 2020, Fuentes spoke at several events that were held as rival events to the Conservative Political Action Conference. One such event, hosted by the online publication National File, featured Fuentes, Alex Jones of InfoWars, and Proud Boys founder Gavin McInnes. Fuentes hosted his own event called the \\"America First Political Action Conference,\\" which included such speakers as Patrick Casey, former Daily Caller author Scott Greer, and Malkin. Groypers are very active online, particularly on Twitter, and have engaged in targeted harassment against opponents. In April 2020, The Daily Dot reported that Fuentes and other Groypers had begun to move to the video sharing platform TikTok, where they streamed live and used the \\"duet\\" feature to respond to Trump supporters. Fuentes and some other Groyper accounts were banned from TikTok shortly after the article was published.  Reaction  The Groyper Wars earned widespread media attention after the UCLA incident with Donald Trump Jr. Chadwick Moore of Spectator USA commented that the ordeal revealed deep divisions within the American right among young voters, particularly with regards to the political beliefs of Generation Z, or \\"Zoomers\\". This divide, Moore claims, is due to the Groypers viewing Charlie Kirk and others in the mainstream conservative movement as \\"snatching the baton and appointing themselves the guardians of 2016's spoils\\", despite holding beliefs that Fuentes and his followers believe to be in conflict with President Trump's \\"Make America Great Again\\" agenda. Another Spectator author, Ben Sixsmith, claimed that Turning Point's unwillingness to respond to controversial questions, and subsequent use of insults to dismiss their critics, revealed the organization's hypocrisy after having \\"promoted themselves as the debate guys\\". Several mainstream conservative commentators also weighed in on the matter. Addressing the increase in attention towards the far-right due to the aggressive questioning of Kirk, Ben Shapiro gave a speech at Stanford University in which he attacked Fuentes (without naming him) and his followers as essentially being a rebranded version of the alt-right. Representative Dan Crenshaw similarly referred to the questioners as \\"alt-right 2.0\\" while American Conservative Union chairman Matt Schlapp said that \\"there is no place in our conservative movement for those interested in fomenting hate, mob violence, or racist propaganda.\\" Conversely, conservative commentator Michelle Malkin wrote an article for American Greatness attacking Kirk for his immigration policies, and particularly his stance that green cards should be awarded to immigrants who graduate from American universities. After defending Fuentes and his followers, Malkin was fired as a speaker for Young America's Foundation, a rival organization to Turning Point whose events had also been targeted by Groypers. Malkin later would refer to herself as a mother figure among and a leader of the Groypers.

The earliest surviving church in Syria, it dates to 372 CE, as mentioned in an inscription found by Butler on the eastern doorway lintel of the south aisle. A complete record of the church plan was observed and recorded by H.C. Butler during the Princeton Archaeological Expedition in 1905, but much of the structure has deteriorated since. Today, the triumphal arch, which has four bands, and a circle with a chi rho symbol at its center decorates the arch’s keystone is still preserved at the church’s east end. The apse was originally flanked by square side chambers, both accessed from the aisles. The doorway to the north chamber from the aisle is still preserved. The south chamber also had a southern doorway, leading to the outside. The church’s north wall was essentially cut out of the natural rock on the hillside. This church comprised a nave of seven bays, with one entrance at the west end and two onto the south aisle. The column capitals of the nave arcade had Doric and Tuscan designs, while the interior and exterior doorways, along with their rectangular clearstory windows, had no ornament. Nothing remains of the bema once located in the center of the nave.

Early life  He was the only child of George Capell, 7th Earl of Essex and, his first wife, Eleanor Harriet Maria Harford (1860–1885). After his mother's death in 1885, his father remarried to American heiress and socialite Adele Grant, daughter of the New York railway magnate David Beach Grant of the Grant Locomotive Works. From his father's second marriage, he had two younger half-sisters, Lady Iris Mary Athenais de Vere Capell, and Lady Joan Rachel de Vere Capell (wife of Osbert Peake, 1st Viscount Ingleby). His paternal grandparents were Lt.-Col. Arthur de Vere Capell, Viscount Malden (son of Arthur Capell, 6th Earl of Essex), and Emma Martha Meux. His mother was the eldest daughter of William Henry Harford of Oldtown House in Almondsbury and the former Ellen Tower (third daughter of Rev. William Tower of How Hatch, Vicar of Braughing). He was educated at Eton College.Mosley, Charles, editor. Burke's Peerage, Baronetage & Knightage, 107th edition, 3 volumes. Wilmington, Delaware, U.S.A.: Burke's Peerage (Genealogical Books) Ltd, 2003. Career He served in the 7th Hussars, gaining the rank of Lieutenant. He also served in the Hertfordshire Yeomanry and the Remount Service, temporarily gaining the rank of Temporary Captain. Upon his father's death in 1916, he inherited the earldom of Essex. The death of his father brought the eventual demise of the Capell family seat, Cassiobury House. Death duties, a form of taxation introduced in 1894 by the Liberal Government, had placed an increasing financial burden on aristocracy and landed gentry, and was responsible for the breaking up of many large estates across Britain.Robinson, p.28 His father's widow, Adele, was presented with a substantial tax bill and after six years, she decided to sell Cassiobury House and its contents. The house did not, however, find a buyer before Adele's death in July 1922. It remained unoccupied for a further five years before it was sold for materials and demolished in 1927. The site was acquired by property developers and today is the residential area of Cassiobury with the remainder of the estate being used for Cassiobury Park. =Acting career= Lord Essex was an accomplished amateur actor and appeared in his own home, Bodenham Manor, Herefordshire with a troupe of Pierrots. He later organized a small troupe, which was called \\"The Canaries\\" to give charity performances. As star of the show, the Earl sang comic and sentimental songs. Reportedly, the other members were a gardener's daughter, the village seamstress, a farm laborer, and two farmers. Personal life Lord Essex was married four times. His first marriage, which was referred to as a \\"runaway marriage\\" was on 28 September 1905 to Mary Eveline Stewart Freeman (d. 30 Oct 1955), the eldest daughter of William Russell Stewart Freeman, of The Old Manor House in Wingrave (built by Hannah de Rothschild in 1876). Before their divorce in 1925, they were the parents of one son: * Reginald George de Vere Capell, 9th Earl of Essex (1906–1981), who married twice, without issue. His second marriage was on 10 February 1926 to Alys Montgomery (née Falkiner) Scott-Brown (d. 1977) at the Saint Albans registry office. Alys was the former wife of Ernest Scott-Brown and daughter of Robert Hayes Falkiner. They divorced in 1950. Lord Essex married, thirdly, on 10 December 1950 to Zara Mildred Carlson of Los Angeles, California who was with the U.S. Consular Staff at Melbourne. They divorced in 1957. His fourth, and final, marriage was to Christine Mary Davis (d. 1985) in 1957. She was a daughter of George Frederick Davis of Handsworth Wood. Lord Essex died on 8 December 1966.

It was built in 1720 and has been operated by the Tolland Historical Society as a museum since 1970. Along with the Old Tolland County Jail and Museum, the Tolland County Courthouse, and the Hicks-Stearns Family Museum, the Benton Homestead is one of Tolland's four major historic landmarks.  House  The house is a colonial Cape Cod with an ell, featuring ten rooms, five fireplaces, and a spacious cellar. The building has been restored and repainted in its original colors. The original paneling in the parlor was painted with simulated walnut wood grain in a style typical of early Georgian architecture.  History  Daniel Benton, son of Samuel Benton, one of the first settlers in Tolland, built the family homestead on 40 acres of farmland in 1720. The house stayed in the Benton family for six generations. It was the ancestral home of U.S. Senator William Benton. = American Revolution = During the American Revolutionary War, twenty Hessian soldiers were imprisoned in the Benton Homestead's cellar, whose rafters featured intricate scrolls, now undecipherable, carved by Hessians to pass the time during captivity. The prisoners were well-treated and several chose to remain in Tolland after their release. Historic marker for Elisha Benton and Jemima Barrows at the Benton Homestead The homestead was also the scene of a tragic romance. Daniel Benton's grandson, Elisha Benton (b. 1748), fell in love with Jemima Barrows (b. 1759), 11 years his junior and the daughter of a local cabinetmaker. The families reportedly frowned on their romance because of age and social class differences. Elisha and two of his brothers enlisted in the Continental Army and were captured in the Battle of Long Island and held for months on squalorous British prison ships. Elisha's brothers died in captivity. Released in a prisoner exchange, Elisha Benton returned home suffering from smallpox in January 1777. Jemima attempted to nurse Elisha back to health, but he passed away on January 21. Jemima, too, died of smallpox on February 28. Because eighteenth-century custom prohibited the burying of an unmarried couple side by side, the lovers were buried a discreet distance apart on Benton land. = Twentieth century = In 1934, the Chapin family, descended from the Bentons, sold the house to WTIC radio host and University of Connecticut dietetics instructor Florrie Bishop Bowering. Bowering restored the house and lived there until she sold it in 1968 to William Shocket and Charles Goodstein. The new owners donated the property, house, and furnishings to the Tolland Historical Society on December 13, 1969. The house opened as a museum the following year. It is open for tours on Sundays from June through September. The house is reputedly haunted by the ghosts of Hessian soldiers and of the lovers Elisha and Jemima. Bowering's maid reportedly saw the specter of a young woman in a bridal dress wandering through the house and weeping. Other visitors reported unexplained lights, sounds, and apparitions.

The two-part episode was written by Charlie Day, Glenn Howerton, and series creator Rob McElhenney, and directed by Fred Savage and Matt Shakman. In the episode, Mac and Charlie fake their deaths and go into hiding after Mac's vengeful father, Luther, is released from prison. PlotPart 1= After Mac and Charlie fail to frame Mac's father Luther (Gregory Scott Cummins) for threatening them at his parole hearing, Luther is released on parole. Fearing that he will seek out vengeance on them, Mac and Charlie agree that the only way to avoid Luther's wrath is to fake their deaths. The two proceeds to steal Dee's car and her purse and crash the car into a brick wall to stage their apparent suicide, although Mac is injured when he fails to jump out of the car before it hits the wall. After failing to blow up the car using a hand grenade and a pistol, the two decide that they went far enough and go into hiding on the rooftop of Paddy's Pub. Meanwhile, a glory hole is discovered in the men's bathroom stalls at Paddy's. Dennis is intrigued by the hole and the experience of anonymous sex. Frank proceeds to take Dennis to an orgy, but he is left unimpressed and disgusted at the age and shape of the participants. Back at Paddy's, an eyehole is then installed atop of the glory hole between the stalls. While Frank and Dennis are discussing potential scenarios while using the hole, Dee shows up and informs the two that Mac and Charlie are apparently dead. They play a suicide tape discovered at the scene but then proceed to argue over the perceived ridiculous demand made in Mac's will. As the three argues, Mac and Charlie listen atop of the roof. =Part 2= A memorial is held for Mac and Charlie at Paddy's, with only Mac and Charlie's mothers and the rest of the gang attending, while Mac and Charlie watch through the air ducts. While Frank mourns, Dee believes that Mac and Charlie are still alive. Commuting on a bus after her car was destroyed, Dee sees Mac and Charlie on the streets and confronts them on Paddy's rooftop later that night. Mac reveals to her that his father has been released from prison and that she would have to fake her death to avoid Luther as well. Meanwhile, Dennis is eager to move on from on Mac and finds a new roommate Jan (Keir O'Donnell), a mysterious European. He promises Dennis extravagant European-style sex parties and brings two German women in underwear to party at the apartment. Mac and Charlie watch from the outside, with Mac becoming jealous of how fast Dennis has moved on from him. The two later witness Frank coping with losing Charlie by using a mannequin lookalike. Meanwhile, Dee attempts to fake her death by telling Dennis she's going on a jog alone by herself at night, but is ignored by Dennis. Mac, Charlie, and Dee meet up at Paddy's and retreat to the back office when Dennis and Jan enter with a group of women to hold an anonymous sex party at Paddy's; Frank enters with the Charlie mannequin as well. Furious at Dennis having fun without them, Mac, Charlie, and Dee decide that they will scare them by pretending to be ghosts. Jan tells Dennis that he has arranged for Dennis to use the glory hole. Dennis is excited, only for him to find out that Jan had arranged for him and Frank to use the hole. The two men proceed to kick Jan and the girls out of the bar, disgusted at Jan's arrangement. Mac, Charlie, and Dee then enter the bar with firecrackers to scare Frank and Dennis, but Dennis reveals that he knew they weren't dead because he was able to hear them speaking and see them through the windows, and was only getting a new roommate to annoy Mac. Charlie then expresses concern that Luther may be still coming after them, but Frank reads a letter left by Luther on Paddy's door: he had fled to Tijuana and asks Mac to stay away from him as far as possible. Reception The episode received acclaim from critics and is widely considered to be one of the best episodes in the series. Donna Bowman of The A.V. Club gives both Part 1 & 2 \\"A\\" ratings, calling the episodes \\"solid gold\\" and praised its \\"brilliant invention and utter crudity\\" Seth Amitin, in a review for IGN, called the episode the best of the season and says that the jokes in the episode were \\"all hilarious\\".

Named after James M. Baxter, it was opened in 1941. It was closed and demolished in 2009 due to social and financial neglect. The housing was replaced in 2012 by 90 apartments known by the name of Baxter Park.  Origins  Under the Federal Housing Act, the Newark Housing Authority was created in 1937. The Housing Authority was tasked with creating affordable housing for low income residents. When the first contracts were signed between the Federal Housing Authority and the city of Newark, Baxter Terrace was among the first projects to be built. The facility was named after James M. Baxter, the principle of the first high school for Black students in Newark.  Years in operation  One of the first public housing facilities in the United States, Baxter Terrace was open for 68 years. Through the 1950s, Baxter Terrace remained the only majority Black housing project in Newark. The 14 acres of housing was informally segregated, with Black people living on one end, and whites on the other. Many early residents took pride in the community, with one father being cited as writing a theme song for it. A group of teenagers who sang in the Baxter Terrace recreation hall went on to become the Monotones, a doo-wop group.  Closure and legacy  Baxter Terrace was closed and demolished in 2009 and replaced by Baxter Park in 2012. Baxter Park became more focused on having mixed incomes rather than focusing specifically on housing low income people. Former residents of Baxter Terrace have held reunions. The façade of Baxter Terrace was preserved in demolition, with parts being brought to and displayed at the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture.

It sits at the center of a legal debate over whether trial penalties abridge defendants' Sixth Amendment right to trial. Background The \\"trial penalty\\" is in reference to the use of plea bargaining in the United States. In a plea bargain, a criminal defendant waives their right to trial and agrees to plead guilty to a lesser charge than would be brought against them at trial or agrees to plead guilty to the original charge in exchange for a less-than- the-maximum sentence.Devers, L. (2011). Plea and Charge Bargaining. U.S. Department of Justice Bureau of Justice Assistance. Retrieved from https://bja.ojp.gov/sites/g/files/xyckuh186/files/media/document/PleaBargainingResearchSummary.pdf Plea bargaining is a pervasive practice in the United States: most criminal defendants accept a plea deal rather than go to trial, and at the federal level only 2% of defendants elect to go to trial. The constitutionality of plea bargaining has been repeatedly affirmed by the United States Supreme Court, such as in the case Brady v. United States, provided that the defendant enter into the plea deal voluntarily. Definition The \\"trial penalty\\" refers to the \\"discrepancy between the sentence the prosecutor is willing to offer in exchange for a guilty plea and the sentence that would be imposed after a trial\\". The requirements in many plea bargains that the defendant waive certain constitutional rights, such as the right to challenge unlawfully procured evidence and the right to appeal, are also sometimes considered as part of the \\"trial penalty\\". Criticism Critics argue that the trial penalty has the effect of depriving defendants' of their Sixth Amendment right to \\"a speedy and public trial\\". Prominent lawyer Alan Dershowitz argued in The Wall Street Journal, for instance, that trial penalties have rendered most plea bargains unconstitutional for the simple reason that they amount to a punishment for exercising the right to trial, and any right is abridged \\"when you're punished for exercising it\\". Legal scholar Andrew Chongseh Kim emphasizes this point that trial penalties amount to punishment, concluding in his empirical analysis of the federal court system that federal defendants who exercise their right to trial are penalized with sentences 64% longer than they would have received had they accepted a plea deal. He similarly argues that this makes trial by jury \\"less of a right and more of a trap for fools\\". Human Rights Watch also stresses the discrepancy between plea sentences and trial sentences in their report on trial penalties in drug cases. They state that \\"the trial penalty’s effectiveness at securing plea agreements is purchased at the cost of disproportionate and unjust sentences for those who exercise their right to trial\\". One of the most expansive reports on the trial penalty is a report published by the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers (NACDL), which argues that trial penalties are \\"now so severe and pervasive that it has virtually eliminated the constitutional right to a trial\\". The NACDL contends that trial penalties impose such harsh penalties on electing to go to trial that they amount to coercing defendants to plead guilty—which renders such plea deals unconstitutional.National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. (2018). The Trial Penalty: The Sixth Amendment Right to Trial on the Verge of Extinction and How to Save It. Retrieved from https://www.nacdl.org/getattachment/95b7f0f5-90df-4f9f-9115-520b3f58036a/the- trial-penalty-the-sixth-amendment-right-to-trial-on-the-verge-of-extinction- and-how-to-save-it.pdf For instance, they argue that the power of a prosecutor to reduce a multi-decade prison sentence that could be faced at trial to several years in a plea bargain renders \\"any choice the defendant had in the matter...all but eliminated\\". They further point out that \\"the pressures defendants face in the plea bargaining process are so strong even innocent people can be convinced to plead guilty to crimes they did not commit\\", which they argue casts doubt \\"on the assumption that defendants who plead guilty do so voluntarily\\". The NACDL also argues that trial penalties have resulted in the system of trial by jury laid out in the United States Constitution to be effectively replaced by a system of plea bargains.

By 2009, Yiong had become the leader of the DPP Department of Social Movement. In December of that year, he again sought the Miaoli County magistracy, which Liu Cheng-hung retained. By 2011, Yiong was reappointed to the DPP's Ethnic Affairs Department. The party backed his 2012 legislative bid in Miaoli. During his own campaign, Yiong analyzed the Tsai Ing-wen presidential bid with regard to Hakka voters. Yiong and other Hakka drew attention to the lack of promotion and resources devoted to the culture under the Ma Ying-jeou administration.

In 1894, Esmeralda was sold to the Empire of Japan via Ecuador, an action which brought down the latter's government. Renamed Izumi, the cruiser arrived too late to participate in the major naval battles of the First Sino-Japanese War, but saw active service during the Boxer Rebellion and Russo-Japanese War. In the latter, Izumi was one of the first ships to make visual contact with the Russian fleet just before the decisive Battle of Tsushima. After the conflict, the aging cruiser was decommissioned and stricken from the Imperial Japanese Navy in 1912.  Design  Designed by George Wightwick Rendel, Esmeralda was a development of the s, which were originally built by Armstrong for Japan and China. Like those ships, Esmeralda mounted a heavy armament and was constructed out of lightweight steel, something enabled by the Siemens process.Brook, Warships for Export, 53; Brook, \\"Armstrongs and the Italian Navy,\\" 94. Unlike the Tsukushis, Esmeralda was far larger and had much more seaworthy design, including a freeboard that was higher.Brook, Warships for Export, 53. It was also the fastest cruiser in the world upon its completion; had a better secondary armament; was able to steam longer distances before needing additional coal; and had deck armor that extended the length of the ship, with particular attention paid to the areas above the propulsion machinery and other important areas of the ship.Brook, Warships for Export, 53.Perrett, \\"Some Notes,\\" 211.Crucero \\"Esmeralda\\" 3°, Armada de Chile. Accessed 9 June 2020. Despite these improvements, Esmeraldas freeboard was still only from the waterline, and its design came under heavy criticism from the British Admiralty, who believed that it was outclassed by their own protected cruisers of the . Among other critiques, they highlighted Esmeraldas lack of a double bottom, a proper conning tower, and any provision for emergency steering should the primary position be destroyed in battle. They also criticized the design of its coal bunkers, which could allow water into a good portion of the ship if hit by an enemy shell in certain areas.Brook, Warships for Export, 54. Moreover, the Admiralty's comparison of Esmeralda to the Mersey design found that the former carried nearly less armor, which measured out to about of the ship's total displacement. For Mersy, the same figure came out to when a full load of coal was embarked.Brook, Warships for Export, 54–55. Esmeraldas design was followed closely by improved designs for the Japanese (the ) and the Italians (). However, as small cruisers were usually tasked with fighting other cruisers or armed merchant ships rather than full-fledged capital ships, Armstrong-built cruisers would subsequently never mount guns larger than .Brook, Warships for Export, 58 and 62. = Public reaction = As the first modern protected cruiser, Esmeraldas construction attracted much publicity. Within Chile, it was financed in part by a public subscription and the country's newspapers published lengthy treatises on its potential power.Grant, Rulers, 122. While in the United Kingdom, Esmeralda was visited by the Prince of Wales, who would later inherit the British throne as Edward VII, and was the subject of a weighty article in the Times of London—albeit one written anonymously by Armstrong's chief naval architect. The attention lavished on the ship was given a boost by William Armstrong, the founder of the original Armstrong company, who boasted that Esmeralda was \\"the swiftest and most powerfully armed cruiser in the world\\" and that it was \\"almost absolutely secure from the worst effects of projectiles.\\"\\"The 'Esmeralda,'\\" Record (Valparaiso) 13, no. 183 (4 December 1884): 5.Bastable, Arms and the State, 176. He believed that the protected cruiser warship type, exemplified by Esmeralda, would usher in the end of the ironclad era. For the price of one ironclad, several cruisers could be built and sent out as commerce raiders, much like the Confederate Alabama during the United States' civil war.\\"Home,\\" Graphic 30, no. 775 (4 October 1884): 347. In an additional comment directed at the British Royal Navy, Armstrong noted that it was fortunate that the ship had gone to Chile instead of a hostile nation. His remarks were later summarized in press outlets: Armstrong's intention in delivering this message was to obtain Royal Navy orders for his new warship type lest he should choose to sell to British enemies. His anticipation of additional orders was well-founded: by the time Esmeralda was completed in 1884, Armstrong had was or would soon be constructing protected cruisers for over a dozen countries. Nathaniel Barnaby, a Director of Naval Construction at the British Admiralty, the department in charge of Britain's Royal Navy, would later write that the ship type \\"made the fortune\\" of Armstrong's company. Across the Atlantic, the US Army and Navy Journal published an interview with an American naval officer which expressed his belief that Esmeralda could stand off San Francisco and drop shells into the city while being in no danger from the shorter-ranged shore-based batteries covering the Golden Gate strait. \\"Chili [sic] has today the finest, fastest, and most perfectly equipped fighting war ship of her size afloat,\\" he said. \\"She could destroy our entire Navy, ship by ship, and never be touched.\\"\\"We Cannot Fight the Chilean Navy,\\" Army and Navy Journal 23, no. 1 (1 August 1885): 16. This perspective was only one of several published during this time which intended to sound alarms about the underfunded and underequipped state of the United States Navy.Sater, Chile and the United States, 51–52. = Specifications = Esmeralda measured in at a length of between perpendiculars. It had a beam of , a mean draft of , and displaced . It was designed for a crew of nearly 300.Lyon, \\"Chile,\\" in Conway's, 411. For armament, Esmeraldas main battery was originally equipped with two /30 caliber guns in two single turrets, one each fore and aft. The ten-inch weapons were able to be trained to either side of the ship, raised to an angle of 12°, and depressed to 5°. They weighed each, while the shells they fired weighed and required a powder charge of . Its secondary armament consisted of six /26 caliber guns in single Vavasseur central pivot mountings; two 6-pounder guns located on the bridge wings; and five Hotchkiss revolving cannons located in elevated positions.Brook, Warships for Export, 52–53. The ship was additionally fitted for but not with three torpedo tubes. The propulsion machinery consisted of two horizontal compound steam engines built by R and W Hawthorn, which were fed by four double-ended boilers. The engines were placed in separate compartments. On Esmeraldas sea trials, its machinery proved good for , making a speed of . To protect itself, Esmeralda had an arched protective deck below the waterline that ran from bow to stern; it was over the important machinery, and near the ends of the ship. It also had cork mounted along its belt with the intention of limiting flooding and increasing buoyancy in the case of shell penetration, but the cork's practicality was limited. The ship's coal bunkers were also designed to be part of the protective scheme, but as they were not subdivided, their utility if damaged in battle were also severely questionable. The ship's main guns were provided with shields up to thick, and the conning tower was provided with its own 1-inch armor. While in Japanese service, Esmeralda was renamed Izumi and fitted with two /40 caliber quick-firing guns (in 1901–02), six /40 caliber quick-firing guns (in 1899), several smaller guns, and three torpedo tubes. These changes lightened the ship, making for a displacement of even while its machinery could still manage .Jentschura, Jung, and Mickel, Warships of the Imperial Japanese Navy, 98–99.  Chilean service  Esmeraldas keel was laid by Armstong Mitchell in Elswick, Newcastle upon Tyne, on 5 April 1881. It was launched on 6 June 1883 and completed on 15 July 1884, making for a construction time of just over three years.Brook, Warships for Export, 52. The cruiser arrived in Chile on 16 October 1884, too late for service in Chile's War of the Pacific against Peru and Bolivia. Nevertheless, with Esmeralda Chile was able to lay claim to possessing the most powerful navy in the Americas: their fleet was centered around the protected cruiser, two well- maintained 1870s central-battery ironclads, and two 1860s armored frigates. Moreover, they could staff them with foreign-trained officers and highly trained and disciplined sailors.Grant, Rulers, 121–23.Scheina, Latin America, 43–46. In April 1885, the Chilean government sent Esmeralda on an unusual and statement-making voyage to Panama, where it showed the Chilean flag alongside the great powers of France, the United Kingdom, and the United States.Tromben, \\"Naval Presence,\\" n.p. The ship was able to complete the run north in 108 hours, or about four and a half days, maintaining a high average speed of for the first hundred of those hours.Bainbridge-Hoff, Examples, 121. At least one historian has stated that Esmeralda was ordered to block an annexation of Panama by the United States, which had sent marines and several warships to the area,Sater, Chile and the United States, 52. but another has argued that the various sources of information about the incident are contradictory and do not agree with that interpretation. During the Chilean Civil War, Esmeralda was one of the most powerful units possessed by the Congressionalist faction which rebelled against the president. In February 1891, Esmeralda bombarded the city of Iquique. Seven months and an amphibious landing at Quintero Bay later, Esmeralda and its fellow cruiser engaged presidential ground forces during the Battle of Concon. Their fire did not kill many soldiers, but did severely demoralize the presidential forces.Brook, Warships for Export, 55.Scheina, Latin America's Wars, 1:402. After the conflict, which ended with a victory for the navy-supported Congressionalists, in March 1894 the Chilean Navy briefly considered modernizing Esmeralda amidst the quickly worsening Argentine–Chilean naval arms race. They approached Armstrong about upgrading the cruiser's weapons and replacing its boilers, but in November of that year they instead sold the ship to the Imperial Japanese Navy. As that nation was in the midst of the First Sino-Japanese War and the Chileans did not want to appear to be violating its official neutrality, the latter induced the Ecuadorian government and its president Luis Cordero Crespo to serve as an intermediary: the ship would first be sold and sailed to Ecuador, who would briefly take formal possession of the ship before selling it to Japan. This arrangement was facilitated with a considerable payment given to the Ecuadorian president.Scheina, Latin America's Wars, 1:146. Although there was some initial speculation in press outlets that Esmeralda would join the Ecuadorian Navy for potential use against the Peruvian Navy, the ship was only under the Ecuadorian flag from Chile to the Galapagos Islands, where it was handed to the Japanese. Back in Ecuador, however, Cordero's political opponents revolted against the government and after a brief conflict, Cordero was forced into exile.Lauderbaugh, History of Ecuador, 79–80.\\"Ecuador Buys a Cruiser,\\" The New York Times, 2 December 1894, 9.\\"Speculations About the Sale; The Esmeralda Could Easily Be Transferred from Ecuador to Japan,\\" The New York Times, 3 December 1894, 5.  Japanese service  Although the Japanese purchased Esmeralda for their war against China, the cruiser saw no active service during the conflict. Renamed Izumi, the Japanese Navy rearmed the ship's secondary armament with quick-firing guns in 1899. At the same time, they removed the ship's fighting tops to improve its stability. Two years later, Izumis ten-inch guns were removed in favor of quick-firing weapons. Izumi did play an active role in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05. Placed in the Sixth Division of the navy's Third Squadron, the cruiser was deployed as part of the Japanese Navy's preparations for what would turn into the decisive Japanese victory at the Battle of Tsushima. Around 6:30 am on 27 May 1905, Izumi was the first ship to make visual contact with the opposing Russian fleet. Over the next few hours, Izumi shadowed the opposing warships, correctly identifying the lead Russian flagship as a cruiser of the Izumrud class, while reporting their movements back to the main Japanese fleet. Brook, Warships for Export, 56.Pleshakov, The Tsar's Last Armada: The Epic Journey to the Battle of Tsushima, 262–63. After the conclusion of the conflict, the quickly aging Izumi was used for auxiliary tasks prior to being stricken from Japan's navy list on 1 April 1912. It was later sold for scrapping in Yokosuka for .Jentschura, Jung, and Mickel, Warships of the Imperial Japanese Navy, 99.The Japan Chronicle, 1913, 180.

The channel's programming consisted of uncut and re-edited versions of recent older theatrically released motion pictures, along original music, comedy and nature specials sourced from the parent HBO channel aimed at a family audience. History Cover of the January 1988 issue of Festival's monthly program guide. On April 1, 1986, HBO began test-marketing a tertiary premium service, Festival, to an estimated 850 subscribers over six cable systems owned by then-sister company American Television and Communications Corporation (eventually expanding to 25 systems by the Summer of 1986). The channel—which transmitted for 19 hours each day from 7:00 a.m. to 2:00 a.m. Eastern Time daily—was targeted at older audiences who found programming containing violence and sexual situations on other premium services objectionable, television viewers without cable service, and basic cable subscribers that opted against retaining a subscription to a premium service. Primarily to cater to the former demographic, Festival focused around family- friendly fare that included classic and recent hit movies (including collections of feature films starring a featured actor, known as \\"Star Salutes\\"), and documentaries, along with HBO original stand-up comedy, concert, nature and ice skating specials (which Festival branded under the \\"Centerstage\\" banner). Atypical for a premium service, Festival aired \\"airline-style\\" versions of R-rated movies re-edited to fit a PG rating on the channel's schedule. As Festival was designed as a mini-pay premium service (similar to Take 2 before it), subscription pricing for the channel was set lower than that of HBO and Cinemax (between $2.99 and $6.99 per month—equivalent to between $ and $ in , adjusted for inflationAs calculated by the US Bureau of Statistics' CPI Inflation Calculator—depending on the cable system). Festival also provided subscribers with a 20-page, color monthly program guide. Like HBO, Festival also ran occasional free preview periods, such as the October 30 to November 2, 1987 preview hosted by Tony Randall. On July 14, 1988, Home Box Office, Inc. announced it would shut down Festival at the end of the year, citing headend channel capacity limitations that prevented Festival from expanding beyond the 102 systems that already carried the service. The channel had reoriented its marketing initiatives to aggressively target cable subscribers who subscribed to another pay service. At its peak, Festival had an estimated 30,000 subscribers by the Summer of 1988, putting it at a distant last place in total subscriber reach among the eight American premium cable services operating at the time. (By comparison, during the same timeframe, HBO had reached 15.9 million subscribers and fellow sister channel Cinemax reached 5.1 million, while Festival's most direct competitor, The Disney Channel—then also a family-oriented premium service until it shifted to basic cable in April 1997—had 3.18 million subscribers.)

University of Munich), where he became a senior psychologist in 1989. Rief accepted a professorship in clinical psychology and psychotherapy at the University of Marburg in 2000. In the following years, he was a visiting professor at the Harvard Medical School in Boston (2004-2005), the University of California in San Diego (2009/2010), and the University of Auckland in New Zealand (2002). Rief is spokesperson of the Commission \\"Psychology and Psychotherapy Training\\" of the German Society for Psychology (DGPs) and advocates, among other things, a revision of the Psychotherapists Act, which was finally approved by the German Bundestag in 2019. He was also President of the German Society of Behavioural Medicine for several years (2001-2005). He was also nominated as a member of the expert commission of the American Psychiatric Association (APA) and World Health Organization (WHO) \\"Somatic Presentations of Mental Disorders\\" for the preparation of DSM-5 (Beijing, 2006). In addition, he is spokesperson of the DFG Research Group on Placebo and Nocebo Mechanisms (2010-2019), member of the DFG Review Board (2012-2020), and of the DFG Commission \\"Clinical Trials\\". He co-chairs the ICD-11 Working Group on \\"Classification of Chronic Pain\\" of the WHO (since 2013). He is editor in chief of the journal Clinical Psychology in Europe. Rief was awarded the Distinguished International Affiliate, APA Division Health Psychology in 2014 and received a Distinguished Scientist Award from the International Society of Behavioral Medicine in 2014. Rief was awarded the Alison Creed Award by the European Association of Psychosomatic Medicine in 2020.  Research work  For many years, Rief's scientific work focused on the investigation of psychological factors in the development, maintenance and management of physical complaints. He is one of the leading scientists on somatoform disorders and, per Web of Science, leads the international publication list on this topic. Together with Prof. Hiller (Mainz) he developed the frequently used questionnaire procedure SOMS (Screening for Somatoform Symptoms). As a nominated member of the Initial Group for the reformulation of the concept of somatoform symptom and associated in DSM-5, he was initially involved in this process, but later clearly criticized the concept of \\"somatic stress disorders\\" in DSM-5 presented in 2014. In 2009, the German version of ICD-10 introduced the new diagnosis F45.41 \\"Chronic pain with mental and somatic factors\\" [Rief et al. in Current Opinion of Psychiatry]. This introduction was the result of a working group chaired by Prof. Rief. As co-chair together with R.-D. Treede he also chaired the working group on the classification of chronic pain in ICD-11. The classification proposal of this working group for chronic pain was officially included in the draft for ICD-11 by the World Health Assembly 2019, which will become the worldwide basis for the classification of physical and mental diseases. Since 2004, he has increasingly expanded his research focus to the topic of placebo and nocebo mechanisms in medical interventions and since 2010 has headed a corresponding transregional DFG research group (DFG 1328). He was able to prove that patient expectations contributed significantly to the success of treatment, even in highly invasive medical interventions (such as cardiac surgery), and that modifying these patient expectations increases the success of such interventions. However, patient expectations are also essential for the development of side effects. Book publications on the subject of \\"biofeedback\\" (Rief & Birbaumer, 2000; 2006; 2010), somatisation disorder (Rief & Hiller, 2011) or on the subject of \\"psychosomatics and behavioural medicine\\" (Rief & Henningsen, 2015). Rief was also a member of the initiative group for the foundation of a European Society of Clinical Psychology and is a board member of the European Association of Clinical Psychology and Psychological Treatment. As Editor in Chief he launched the journal Clinical Psychology in Europe.

One deputy was able to escape the shooting and call for help. Guzman and Lopez were suspects in a burglary in Ellis County, Texas, and the officers were obtaining consent-to-search forms when they were abducted. Guzman and Lopez were able to escape after the shootings, beginning a manhunt that led to their arrest in East Dallas. Guzman and Lopez were tried, found guilty, and sentenced to death. However, following issues in the court case and the death penalty being declared unconstitutional, they were given a retrial. Both were given four life sentences. Lopez was paroled in 1991, but was incarcerated again for a separate case.  Parties involved  William Don Reese = Deputy Sheriff William Reese was born on October 15, 1939, in Dallas, Texas, to H. G.

Background  The town of Bristol, Texas, was an alleged target for burglars from Dallas. The town did not have a police force, and investigations were conducted by either Ellis or Dallas County officers. On the afternoon of Monday, February 15, 1971, a home near Bristol was burglarized, and several items including a television set and stereo were taken. A resident of Bristol had copied down the license plate number of a car that was unfamiliar and reported it to the Ellis County police. Ellis County deputies A. J. Robertson and Wendell Dover went to Dallas with a felony warrant to investigate the home of the car owner. They were later joined by Dallas County officers Samuel Infante (who was a Spanish speaker), William Reese, and R. D. McCurley. The car owner was registered as living at 2810 Ingersoll Street, Dallas, Texas. Infante, Robertson, and Dover were the first to arrive at the address. Guzman and Lopez were seated in a white Ford Fairlane in the front yard of the house. The car that had been reported in Ellis County, a red and white 1962 Ford, was backed up to the house. The two men invited the officers into the house, with Infante acting as a translator. While inside the house, Infante contacted the Dallas Sheriff's office and requested for Reese to bring a blank consent-to- search form to the house. Reese was joined by McCurley and the two made their way to the house. Guzman and Lopez told the officers that the car in question had been left at their house and that they had not participated in any burglaries. Dover stepped out of the house to check if the engine in the 1962 Ford was still warm. While he was checking the car, one of the men followed him out of the house and pressed a gun to Dover's back. The man took Dover's pistol and forced him into the house, where Dover saw Infante and Robertson being held at gunpoint and seated. After Infante had ended his call to the sheriff's office, Guzman and Lopez pulled their guns on the officers and disarmed them. Robertson told Dover to do as the gunmen said. Dover, Infante, and Robertson's hands were tied and the gunmen awaited the arrival of the officers Infante had called. Reese and McCurley arrived at the house around 15 minutes after the officers were disarmed and were told to enter by an unknown voice.  Abduction and shootings  McCurley and Reese entered the house and saw Infante, Robertson, and Dover with their hands bound and seated on chairs. Guzman and Lopez had waited on either side of the entry door, and they had a gun in each hand. They threatened McCurley and Reese before taking their weapons and binding their hands with rope. A third man entered the house for a short time and spoke with Guzman and Lopez before leaving. Infante attempted to reason with Guzman and Lopez. He told the men that they had the officer's guns, money, and cars, and could flee to Mexico. The men refused. Dover stated that neither of the men appeared to be under the influence of drugs, and that the taller gunman seemed nervous whereas the shorter man appeared \\"steady as a rock\\". One of the men went out and backed a squad car to the back door of the house. The men then took the officers and sat them inside the county squad car. Infante was placed in the front seat, and the rest of the officers were placed in the back seat. One of the men returned to the home, and one remained at the squad car. Officer Reese spoke to the remaining man and attempted to convince him to release them, but the other man returned and the two men entered the car with the officers. Infante's hands were untied, and he was forced at gunpoint to drive. The men were driven onto Singleton Drive going east, turned onto Hampton Road going north towards the Trinity River, west onto Canada Drive, and then north towards a dirt road parallel to the Trinity River levee. While approaching the Trinity riverbank, Reese whispered to McCurley that he had freed his hands, and that the incident had \\"...gone far enough. They mean to kill us.\\" As Infante was ordered to stop the car in a small gully between the levee and the dirt road, he stated aloud: \\"This is it. They're going to kill us now.\\" Guzman and Lopez had been communication between one another in Spanish. All seven men quickly got out of the car. Reese told Guzman and Lopez that all of the officers had freed their hands, and both he and an Ellis county officer attempted to dissuade Guzman and Lopez from killing them. Reese swung at Guzman, and was shot by Guzman. Infante tackled Lopez, and was shot and killed. Dover and Robertson fled the scene towards Westmoreland Street. Robertson saw that Guzman and Lopez had returned to the squad car and were driving towards Dover and Robertson, and he shouted to Dover that the men were going to run them down. Dover and Robertson went over the levee to the riverbank. Dover reached the edge of the river after Robertson and saw Robertson cornered by the shorter of the two men. The man's gun was jammed, and Robertson called for Dover to help him capture the man. As Dover made his way to Robertson, the other shooter came down the riverbank towards them. He was armed with two guns. Robertson yelled at Dover to run and the two fled down the river bank. Robertson was shot in the back near the river's edge. Dover ran up to the bank in an attempt to retrieve a loaded shotgun from the squad car when he was shot by a gunman from the top of the river bank. He fell unconscious. When he regained consciousness, he saw Robertson laying near him. He checked for a pulse and found that Robertson was dead. Reese was also laying nearby, and Dover found that he was also deceased. Dover made his way over the levee embankment and could not see the gunmen. He went over the embankment and went towards Westmoreland Street. As the shooting broke out, McCurley dove backwards over the riverbank. He landed down the slope near the edge of the Trinity River. A tree at the edge of the river stopped McCurley from falling into the water, and caused him to free his bound hands. He had feared falling into the water with his hands tied. He ran east alongside the river and crawled under bushes until he reached Westmoreland Road. McCurley was able to flag down a car, and the driver took him to a gas station. McCurley used the phone at the gas station to call city police, and obtained a small pistol from the gas station attendant. A city officer picked McCurley up from the gas station, and the two returned to the scene of the shooting. Guzman and Lopez had left. Dover was found stumbling through a grassy area northeast of the shooting site. He had been shot in the chest and arm. McCurley and the officer picked him up and took him to Parkland Hospital. Other police officers and deputies made their way to the shooting site and found the bodies of the other officers. Infante's body was found face down in a pile of rubble. Reese's body was found west of Infante and down the riverbank. He was on his back. Robertson's body was found near Reese.  Search and arrests  The suspects had left the site in the stolen squad car, which was later found abandoned. The officer's billfolds had been taken. Over 400 sheriffs and officers searched the area for suspects. Two men were arrested as suspects the evening of the shooting, and it was theorized that the third man, the leader of the group, was believed to have been recently released from prison for a murder conviction. On Tuesday, February 16, Rene Guzman and his brother Moises Guzman were charged with murder with malice. The brothers were both residents of 2810 Ingersoll Street. One of the arrested suspects was Moises, who had been arrested in the 2900 block of Weisenbarger Street. His and Rene's fingerprints were allegedly found in the stolen squad car. Rene was still at large at the time the murder charges were set, and lawmen searched motorists passing through the Texas-Mexico border. On Thursday, February 18, McCurley identified Moises as the man who entered and left the home before the shootings. McCurley stated in an earlier interview that the shooters had attempted to convince Moises to join them, but Moises refused. Moises, who had been held without bond since his arrest on Monday, made a written statement that told his account of the day of the shootings. Moises stated that he arrived at his home on Ingersoll Street around 5:30 pm and was warned by his stepfather that there was trouble inside the house. Moises entered the home and saw his brother, Rene, and an unnamed friend holding guns. He saw the officers tied down in chairs. He left the house immediately and walked half a block down the street, and did not return until he saw a car full of people leaving the house. Moises returned to the home and took four rifles and a television set and, using Rene's car, drove to a relative's house on Weisenbarger Street where he was later arrested. Following his statement and McCurley's interview, Rene remained a suspect and a warrant was set out for an unnamed John Doe, the second shooter. An informant connected to the US Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs told the police that Guzman and Lopez were hiding in a boarding house on Ross Avenue. Following the arrests, the informant received a $1,000 reward. The man, later identified as heroin dealer Agapito Gonzales, was murdered in June 1971. On Friday, February 19, about 40 federal, state, county, and city officers participated in a raid on an apartment complex at 4627 San Jacinto Street. The raid was led by Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Lew Acker, partner of Infante. An entire block was sealed off in preparation of the raid, with the perimeter of the block being defined by San Jacinto Street, Annex Street, Fitzhugh Street, and Ross Avenue. Around 12:30 am, police entered the apartment of Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Rodriguez. Gunfire was exchanged, and both Thomas and his pregnant wife were shot. The police searched the large building in the apartment complex and found and arrested Guzman and Lopez at around 1:00 am. Two women, one of whom was reported to be a companion of Guzman, had hindered the police by initially claiming that there was no one else within the apartment. A police officer saw curtains move in the bathroom window, and officers pushed past the two women and entered the apartment. Officers ordered Guzman and Lopez to surrender. Guzman tossed out a pistol from the bathroom and surrendered, and Lopez was arrested and removed from the bathroom. Within the apartment police found two pistols, including Infante's .38 caliber service revolver, which had been tossed out of an adjoining room. Two women, Alice Rosales and Angie Hernandez, would be charged as accessories to the murder for resisting the officers as the apartment was raided. Guzman confessed to the killings on the night of his arrest. He stated that he and Lopez began shooting at an officer when Reese freed his hands and took a .32 caliber revolver. It was speculated that Guzman remained in Dallas to stay close to his heroin supplier. Five days after his arrest, Lopez confessed to the triple slayings in a signed written statement. According to his statement, it was Guzman who first drew his gun on Infante, Robertson, and Dover at the Ingersoll house, and it was Guzman's idea to drive the men to the Trinity River. Lopez stated that the shootings began when Reese freed his hands and managed to grab a pistol. Lopez claimed that Reese began shooting at him. He claimed to have seen Guzman kill Infante, and that Reese had run out of bullets and was running away when Lopez shot and killed him. Lopez and Guzman then chased Robertson and Dover, and Lopez shot one of the men once. Lopez looked for the other officer, McCurley, but could not find him. Lopez stated that he had taken a hit of heroin within two hours before the murders, and could not explain why the killings happened. He claimed he and Guzman did not attempt to leave Dallas because of their drug addictions. When a deputy asked if Lopez had any questions before he signed his confession, Lopez only asked if he would get the chair.  Rodriguez family controversy and Mexican-American community relations  The Rodriguez family lived in a garage apartment at the San Jacinto address. An informant had claimed Guzman lived in the garage apartment, leading to the raid. Detective Captain Robert O. Dixon reported that his team announced themselves as police officers and commanded anyone in the apartment to open the door three times, but heard no response. He saw a light turn on and off within the apartment before someone inside shot at the officers twice. Officers returned fire. Thomas Rodriguez (also spelled Tomas) lived with his five-months-pregnant wife, Berta, and their eight children. On February 24, he gave his account of the night of the shooting to Pancho Medrano, a labor and civil rights activist. The interview was conducted in Spanish and published in El Sol de Texas and Papel Chicano. According to Thomas, he and his family were asleep when he heard the sound of someone attempting to break the door down. The children woke up and began crying and screaming. He went to the front door of the apartment and found it open, and it was then that he was shot through the chest and arms. He went for the gun that he kept behind the sofa, and went to the kitchen door from the front entrance. He was again shot, this time through the leg, once he arrived at the kitchen door. He fired after he was last shot and said he did not know where the bullet went. His wife was seated in the living room and had been shot through the leg. Rodriguez returned to the living room where his son told him to drop the gun, and that the shooters were police. Rodriguez then went outside and was taken into custody. He claimed that he was not questioned at the scene or Parkland Hospital, where he was taken, and that he only knew Guzman through what he saw on the news. Throughout his interview with Medrano, he stated that he only wished to protect his family, and that he was afraid. Some neighbors corroborated Rodriguez's claim that there were no warnings before the shooting began. Following the shooting, Sheriff Clarence Jones claimed that the Rodriguez apartment raid was not a mistake, and that he had evidence proving that Rodriguez was a heroin supplier for Guzman and Lopez. On Wednesday, February 24, District Attorney Henry Wade stated that it would be impossible to charge Rodriguez as a narcotics pusher unless drugs were found at the apartment or he had sold drugs to an undercover agent. No drugs were found in the Rodriguez apartment, and Rodriguez had not sold drugs to an undercover agent. Jones, however, claimed that an informant notified the police that Guzman and Lopez were at the Rodriguez apartment and that the police announced themselves at the apartment in Spanish and English. Dallas Legal Services Project director Ed Polk acted as attorney for Thomas Rodriguez. Polk had demanded that the Sheriff file charges against Rodriguez or retract his claims of Rodriguez being the drug seller to Guzman. Sheriff Jones did not file formal charges against Rodriguez, and instead gave his evidence over to the grand jury. Rodriguez was given a $1,000 bond by Judge P. T. Scales. A grand jury was gathered in March to determine the Guzman and Lopez indictment, and to determine whether or not to indict Thomas Rodriguez on charges of assault to murder a police officer and the sale of heroin. A federal narcotics agent testified regarding the accusations. On February 26, Dallas deputy Tom Barker was heard by journalists as claiming that the entire neighborhood where Guzman and Lopez lived were aware of the murders beforehand. This comment, which was interpreted as indicting the largely Mexican-American community in West Dallas, was sharply criticized by community leaders such as Dallas City Councilwoman Anita Martinez. Al Lipscomb also worked to defend the family and community. Warren Burnett served Rodriguez as his defense attorney after he was indicted by the grand jury. In July, Burnett filed a motion for Rodriguez to receive a speedy trial. Rodriguez also filed a $10,000 damage suit against Sheriff Clarence Jones, Dallas Police Chief Frank Dyson, and the deputies who had shot him. In February 1972, Robert McKnight, one of the officers who had shot Rodriguez, gave a deposition for Rodriguez's suit. McKnight claimed that the police had announced themselves in English and Spanish, and that the first shots he heard came from within the apartment. He acknowledged that Rodriguez had been fleeing into the apartment when he was shot, and that the officers were tasked with ensuring that no one left the apartment. McKnight claimed that they had believed Guzman and Lopez alone were inside the apartment. Final hearings for the damage suit were held on March 9, 1972. Attorneys Burnett and William Baab focused much of their arguments on the police's failure to announce why they were raiding the apartment. The defense claimed that the injuries sustained by Rodriguez and his wife were his own fault for shooting at the officers. District Attorney Wade also argued that there was no provision in state laws for such a claim against a government body, only regarding motor accidents involving county employees. The charges were dropped in September due to technicalities. On November 2, 1972, Celso Cantu was awarded $6,500 in personal damages for being held illegally without charges and incommunicado in a by room in the Dallas County Jail. Cantu had been arrested while playing baseball in West Dallas as a suspect in the murders of the officers, and was held in solitary confinement for eight days. Dallas County Sheriff Jones admitted that Cantu was imprisoned due to an administrative oversight.  Trial and retrials  A grand jury was gathered in March to determine if there was sufficient evidence to charge Guzman and Lopez with murder and determine if the officers acting in the raid on the Rodriguez apartment were acting within the line of duty. The witnesses who testified to indict Guzman and Lopez were Dallas County deputy sheriffs John R. Webb, Jim Valentine, and McCurley. Dallas police detectives Gus Rose and Captain R. O. Dixon and attorney Brian Hunsaker also testified before the grand jury. On March 30, Guzman's attorney filed a motion indicating that he would seek an acquittal in response to the district attorney's office stating in a legal document that they would be seeking the death penalty. He also filed a writ of habeas corpus. Guzman's attorney filed a motion for Guzman to be tried separately from Lopez on April 16, and the motion was denied by District Judge P. T. Scales. In April, Guzman, his brother Moises, and four others filed a suit against the estates of the murdered officers, Sheriff Clarence Jones, Dallas Police Chief Frank Dyson, Dover, and McCurley, claiming that they were arrested without provocation or legal cause and had been subjected to acts of terrorism. None of the attorneys on the case felt the need for a change of venue, but in May 1971, District Judge P. T. Scales determined that the case had received too much publicity in Dallas for a fair hearing. He moved the murder trial to Belton, Texas, and presided over the trial. Guzman was represented by attorneys Frank Holbrook and John J. Solon, and Lopez was represented by court-appointed attorneys Don Metcalfe and Florentino Ramirez. Before the trial began, Solon hired a psychiatrist who determined that Guzman showed traits of psychomotor epilepsy, an illness that had been used by Jack Ruby's defense team to argue that Ruby was not sane. During the jury selection procedures, Guzman and Lopez were held at the Bell County Jail. District Attorney Doug Mulder, assistant District Attorney, led the prosecution against Guzman and Lopez. He was joined by state prosecutor Jon Sparling and District Attorney Henry Wade. The team was later joined by Bell County District Attorney Stanley Kacir. The prosecutors decided to try Guzman and Lopez for the murder of Robertson first because Dover was present at Robertson's death and could serve as a witness. Both Dover and McCurley had picked Guzman and Lopez out of a lineup as the men who took the officers captive. The prosecution had difficulties finding Bell County residents who believed in capital punishment, and nearly half of the first round of interviewed potential jurors stated that they could not sentence anyone to death. The first 24 prospective jurors were turned down by both the defense and prosecution. The trial was sat by a jury of 11 men and 1 woman. The trial for the murder of Arthur Robertson began on Monday, June 28, 1971. Dover was the first to give a statement during the opening day of testimony. He described the events of the shooting emotionally, and stated that he had no doubt in his mind that Guzman and Lopez were the shooters, and would never forget them as long as he lived. McCurley also took the stand and described what he saw during the shooting. After the two-day trial, Henry Wade made the closing arguments for the trial. He stated that the crime Guzman and Lopez committed was \\"against the very fiber of our nation\\" and reflected what Wade described as an \\"open season\\" on police officers. These remarks drew strong objections from the defense. The jury deliberated for 30 minutes before convicting Guzman and Lopez of the murder of Arthur Robinson. They were sentenced to death by electric chair. The sentence was seen positively by several surviving friends and relatives. Guzman and Lopez were not tried for the murders of Infante or Reese. In 1973, the conviction was overturned by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals due to the 1972 Furman v. Georgia U.S. Supreme Court decision that temporarily ruled the death penalty to be unconstitutional and due to the remarks made by District Attorney Henry Wade during his closing arguments were judged improper. The sufficiency of evidence in the original trial was not in question. Guzman was represented by Attorneys Joe Montemayor, Pat McDowell, and Frank Holbrook. Lopez was represented by Attorneys Donald R. Scoggins and Paul Enriquez. District Attorney Jon Sparling led the prosecution. The first new trial for the murder of A. J. Robertson was held in Belton, Texas, and began on Monday, February 18, 1974. Pat McDowell had unsuccessfully moved for all three murder cases to be tried at once, but Lopez refused to accept the idea, and he and Guzman were tried together for three separate murder cases. Both sets of attorneys also attempted to have separate trials for their clients, but were unsuccessful. A jury of 7 women and 5 men, all African-American or Mexican-American, sat for the first trial. Both survivors of the shootings served as witnesses in the new case. No case was presented by the defense, and the attorneys of the two defendants had pleaded for mercy for the men during the punishment phase of the trial. The trial concluded on February 20. The jury took 40 minutes to determine a guilty verdict for the murder of Robertson, and 60 minutes to give the defendants a sentence of life in prison. The trial for the murder of Don Reese began on Tuesday, April 2, 1974. 5 women and 7 men sat on the jury. Deputy Dover was the first witness in the trial, and was followed by other sheriffs and officers from Dallas. District Judge R. T. Scales sat for this trial and for the trial of the murder of Infante. The trial was completed on April 3, and the jury deliberated for 25 minutes before determining a guilty verdict and another 25 minutes before determining a sentence of life in prison for both Guzman and Lopez. The second trial was held for the murder of Samuel Infante on April 3, 1974, immediately after the sentences for the murder of Reese were handed down. A jury of 8 women and 4 men sat for the trial. The jury took 10 minutes to deliberate on a guilty verdict and 15 minutes to give a second life term for each defendant.  Aftermath  In February 1971, Dallas County Commissioners voted for the Dallas County Historical Plaza to be dedicated to the late Sheriff Bill Decker and all county officers killed in the line of duty. The commissioners also voted to pay the families of Infante and Reese three months of their salaries. In 1967, the State of Texas passed an amendment providing $10,000.00 to officers killed on duty with an additional monthly stipend for families with children. Dallas County also provided life insurance for deputies. Rene Guzman attempted to escape from prison in January 1973. He and other escapees had sawed a hole in the prison wall using a hacksaw. As of 2020, he is still in prison. Leonardo Lopez was granted parole on December 18, 1990, after requesting parole nine times. At the age of 44, he moved to Houston, where he lived with his wife who he had married by proxy two years before. He expressed remorse and regret for the killings, and claimed that he was so high that he could not accurately recall the events. He did not contact Guzman while imprisoned. He attended church services regularly and claimed to be a Christian. Lopez stated in an interview: \\"I don't want to be a hypocrite or nothing, like I tell God when I talk to him . . . He knows I can't change nothing. What happened has happened. Now I put my life in his hands.\\" He expressed a fear of traveling to meet with relatives, claiming that he feared harassment from police and that he believed that police could kill him without reprisals. He considered writing to the relatives of survivors, but decided against it after concluding that nothing he stated could make them understand what happened that day. His parole placed him under intensive supervision, requiring him to have ten in-person visits with his parole officer per month and be subjected to drug testing on demand. His placement on parole was met with criticism. His release helped lead to the formation of special hearings on parole decisions. Lopez was eventually returned to prison in Texas for parole violations, where he died on August 6, 2017.

Starting from 2018, exchange processes between atmosphere and ocean are studied. The vessel has been funded by the Werner Siemens Foundation and is operated by the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry in Mainz. The Seibold is named after Professor Eugen Seibold, a German marine geologist Construction of the boat started in 2017. On May 11, 2018, the vessel was christened on the 100th anniversary of Seibold's birth.  Research  The Seibold is designed for flexible and dynamic topical operations. Based on a long-term sampling schedule and sampling grid, targeted projects are being developed on short notice to capture events such as El Niño, dust storms, or large wildfires. The design of the Seibold with a glass fiber reinforced composite hull and up to nine hours of battery mode autonomy facilitates contamination-free sampling of seawater and air.  Scientific equipment  The Seibold has three laboratories to facilitate wet sampling and seawater analyses (starboard-side), on-line mass spectrometry, infrared spectrometry, flow cytometry, and analyses of air samples. Seawater is constantly pumped from three meters water depth to the wet lab through a one-inch Teflon tube. A sampling chamber with a debubbler delivers the sampling water to various probes including temperature, salinity, chlorophyll, and other photosynthetic pigments, particle sizes, pH, CO2, ocean color properties as well as analyses of microalgae and bacteria. This allows for the assessment of primary production in the surface ocean as well as biogeochemical cycling of nutrients and potential contaminants. Various filtration racks are used for the processing of discrete samples. Fume hood, clean bench, and freezers complement the wet lab. In the next-door half-dry lab, online CO2 isotope analyses and quantification of Ar/O2 as another measure of primary production are carried out. The air lab of the Seibold is equipped with instrumentation for the analysis of atmospheric aerosols, including particle number concentrations and size distributions, as well as soot abundance and its microphysical properties. Moreover, aerosol samples are collected on filters for subsequent laboratory analysis with a spectrum of different techniques. Air is sampled from about ten meters above the main deck. The water column is sampled with a rosette water sampler equipped with an 8-channel CTD (recording conductivity, temperature, and pressure/depth), a large volume pump for in- situ filtration, bongo nets and a multinet, and a sediment trap. Photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) is also measured on the mast top and on top of the CTD together with temperature, salinity, pH, O2, and fluorescence.  Research objectives  The Seibold is coordinated by the Climate Geochemistry department of the MPI for Chemistry and its director Prof. (ETHZ) Dr. Gerald Haug. It investigates the role of the ocean on climate change. Physical, chemical, and biological parameters are sampled, measured, and calibrated for detailed analyses of the modern atmosphere and surface ocean to facilitate better reconstruction of the past ocean and climate. The lower atmosphere and surface ocean are analyzed from the euphotic, light penetrated zone and the export layer down to 1000 meters water depth. Major chemical and biological exchange processes including degradation of organic matter take place in this so-called twilight zone. These processes have a significant effect on the turnover and distribution of greenhouse gasses such as carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere and ocean. Abundance and properties of atmospheric aerosols in the continental outflow and remote ocean affect climate through the ocean-atmosphere exchange, marine clouds, and radiative forcing.Schiebel, R., Barker, S., Lendt, R., Thomas, H., Bollmann, J., 2007.

The Seibold will sample all main climate zones and marine provinces over the following years. Transects from the tropical to polar North Atlantic, extending into the Caribbean and the eastern Pacific are projected.  Boat design  About half of the interior space of the 22-meter long and six meters wide (draught 3.5 meters) Explorer-72 type Seibold is used as laboratory. In total, eight berths can host four to six scientists and two to four crew members. A desalination plant, 1000 liters of fresh water, and 4000 liters of diesel allow up to three weeks of autonomy at sea. Lithium iron phosphate batteries, with a capacity of about 65 kWh, facilitate emission-free operation including navigation and scientific work of at least nine hours. Batteries are charged while sailing and in port. Propulsion at sea and in port is supported by a 210 hp diesel engine.

Nuclear fission was discovered in December 1938 by physicists Lise Meitner and Otto Robert Frisch and chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann. Fission is a nuclear reaction or radioactive decay process in which the nucleus of an atom splits into two or more smaller, lighter nuclei. The fission process often produces gamma rays and releases a very large amount of energy, even by the energetic standards of radioactive decay. Scientists already knew about alpha decay and beta decay, but fission assumed great importance because the discovery that a nuclear chain reaction was possible led to the development of nuclear power and nuclear weapons. Hahn and Strassmann at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry in Berlin bombarded uranium with slow neutrons, and discovered that barium had been produced. They reported their findings by mail to Meitner in Sweden, who a few months earlier had fled Nazi Germany. Meitner and her nephew Frisch theorised, and then proved, that the uranium nucleus had been split, and published their findings in Nature. Meitner calculated that the energy released by each disintegration was approximately 200 megaelectronvolts, and Frisch observed this. By analogy with the division of biological cells, he named the process \\"fission\\". Hahn was awarded the 1944 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the discovery. The discovery came after forty years of investigation into the nature and properties of radioactivity and radioactive substances. The discovery of the neutron by James Chadwick in 1932 created a new means of nuclear transmutation. Enrico Fermi and his colleagues in Rome studied the results of bombarding uranium with neutrons, and Fermi concluded that his experiments had created new elements with 93 and 94 protons, which his group dubbed ausonium and hesperium. Fermi won the 1938 Nobel Prize in Physics for his \\"demonstrations of the existence of new radioactive elements produced by neutron irradiation, and for his related discovery of nuclear reactions brought about by slow neutrons\\". However, not everyone was convinced by Fermi's analysis of his results. Ida Noddack suggested that instead of creating a new, heavier element 93, it was conceivable that the nucleus had broken up into large fragments, and Aristid von Grosse suggested that what Fermi's group had found was an isotope of protactinium. This spurred Hahn and Meitner, the discoverers of the most stable isotope of protactinium, to conduct a four-year-long investigation into the process with their colleague Strassmann. After much hard work and many discoveries, they determined that what they were observing was fission, and that the new elements that Fermi had found were fission products. Their work overturned long-held beliefs in physics and paved the way for the discovery of the real elements 93 (neptunium) and 94 (plutonium), for the discovery of fission in other elements, and for the determination of the role of the uranium-235 isotope in that of uranium. Niels Bohr and John Wheeler reworked the liquid drop model to explain the mechanism of fission. BackgroundRadioactivity= In the last years of the 19th century, scientists frequently experimented with the cathode-ray tube, which by then had become a standard piece of laboratory equipment. A common practice was to aim the cathode rays at various substances and to see what happened. Wilhelm Röntgen had a screen coated with barium platinocyanide that would fluoresce when exposed to cathode rays. On 8 November 1895, he noticed that even though his cathode-ray tube was not pointed at his screen, which was covered in black cardboard, the screen still fluoresced. He soon became convinced that he had discovered a new type of rays, which are today called X-rays. The following year Henri Becquerel was experimenting with fluorescent uranium salts, and wondered if they too might produce X-rays. On 1 March 1896 he discovered that they did indeed produce rays, but of a different kind, and even when the uranium salt was kept in a dark drawer, it still made an intense image on an X-ray plate, indicating that the rays came from within, and did not require an external energy source. The periodic table circa 1930 Unlike Röntgen's discovery, which was the object of widespread curiosity from scientists and lay people alike for the ability of X-rays to make visible the bones within the human body, Becquerel's discovery made little impact at the time, and Becquerel himself soon moved on to other research, Marie Curie tested samples of as many elements and minerals as she could find for signs of Becquerel rays, and in April 1898 also found them in thorium. She gave the phenomenon the name \\"radioactivity\\". Along with Pierre Curie and Gustave Bémont, she began investigating pitchblende, a uranium- bearing ore, which was found to be more radioactive than the uranium it contained. This indicated the existence of additional radioactive elements. One was chemically akin to bismuth, but strongly radioactive, and in July 1898 they published a paper in which they concluded that it was a new element, which they named \\"polonium\\". The other was chemically like barium, and in a December 1898 paper they announced the discovery of a second hitherto unknown element, which they called \\"radium\\". Convincing the scientific community was another matter. Separating radium from the barium in the ore proved very difficult. It took three years for them to produce a tenth of a gram of radium chloride, and they never did manage to isolate polonium. In 1898, Ernest Rutherford noted that thorium gave off a radioactive gas. In examining the radiation, he classified Becquerel radiation into two types, which he called α (alpha) and β (beta) radiation. Subsequently, Paul Villard discovered a third type of Becquerel radiation which, following Rutherford's scheme, were called \\"gamma rays\\", and Curie noted that radium also produced a radioactive gas. Identifying the gas chemically proved frustrating; Rutherford and Frederick Soddy found it to be inert, much like argon. It later came to be known as radon. Rutherford identified beta rays as cathode rays (electrons), and hypothesised—and in 1909 with Thomas Royds proved—that alpha particles were helium nuclei. Observing the radioactive disintegration of elements, Rutherford and Soddy classified the radioactive products according to their characteristic rates of decay, introducing the concept of a half-life. In 1903, Soddy and Margaret Todd applied the term \\"isotope\\" to atoms that were chemically and spectroscopically indistinct but had different radioactive half-lives. Rutherford proposed a model of the atom in which a very small, dense and positively charged nucleus of protons was surrounded by orbiting, negatively charged electrons (the Rutherford model). Niels Bohr improved upon this in 1913 by reconciling it with the quantum behaviour of electrons (the Bohr model). =Protactinium= The decay chain of actinium. Alpha decay shifts two elements down; beta decay shifts one element up. Soddy and Kasimir Fajans independently observed in 1913 that alpha decay caused atoms to shift down two places in the periodic table, while the loss of two beta particles restored it to its original position. In the resulting reorganisation of the periodic table, radium was placed in group II, actinium in group III, thorium in group IV and uranium in group VI. This left a gap between thorium and uranium. Soddy predicted that this unknown element, which he referred to (after Dmitri Mendeleev) as \\"ekatantalium\\", would be an alpha emitter with chemical properties similar to tantalium (now known as tantalum). It was not long before Fajans and Oswald Helmuth Göhring discovered it as a decay product of a beta-emitting product of thorium. Based on the radioactive displacement law of Fajans and Soddy, this was an isotope of the missing element, which they named \\"brevium\\" after its short half-life. However, it was a beta emitter, and therefore could not be the mother isotope of actinium. This had to be another isotope. Two scientists at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute (KWI) in Berlin-Dahlem took up the challenge of finding the missing isotope. Otto Hahn had graduated from the University of Marburg as an organic chemist, but had been a post-doctoral researcher at University College London under Sir William Ramsay, and under Rutherford at McGill University, where he had studied radioactive isotopes. In 1906, he returned to Germany, where he became an assistant to Emil Fischer at the University of Berlin. At McGill he had become accustomed to working closely with a physicist, so he teamed up with Lise Meitner, who had received her doctorate from the University of Vienna in 1906, and had then moved to Berlin to study physics under Max Planck at the Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität. Meitner found Hahn, who was her own age, less intimidating than older, more distinguished colleagues. Hahn and Meitner moved to the recently established Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry in 1913, and by 1920 had become the heads of their own laboratories there, with their own students, research programs and equipment. The new laboratories offered new opportunities, as the old ones had become too contaminated with radioactive substances to investigate feebly radioactive substances. They developed a new technique for separating the tantalum group from pitchblende, which they hoped would speed the isolation of the new isotope. Otto Hahn and Lise Meitner in 1912 The work was interrupted by the outbreak of the First World War in 1914. Hahn was called up into the German Army, and Meitner became a volunteer radiographer in Austrian Army hospitals. She returned to the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in October 1916, when not only Hahn, but most of the students, laboratory assistants and technicians had been called up. Meitner therefore had to do everything herself, aided only briefly by Hahn when he came home on leave. By December 1917 she was able to isolate the substance, and after further work was able to prove that it was indeed the missing isotope. She submitted her findings for publication in March 1918. Although Fajans and Göhring had been the first to discover the element, custom required that an element was represented by its longest-lived and most abundant isotope, and brevium did not seem appropriate. Fajans agreed to Meitner naming the element protactinium, and assigning it the chemical symbol Pa. In June 1918, Soddy and John Cranston announced that they had extracted a sample of the isotope, but unlike Meitner were unable to describe its characteristics. They acknowledged Meitner's priority, and agreed to the name. The connection to uranium remained a mystery, as neither of the known isotopes of uranium decayed into protactinium. It remained unsolved until uranium-235 was discovered in 1929. Transmutation Irène Curie and Frédéric Joliot in their Paris laboratory in 1935. Patrick Blackett was able to accomplish nuclear transmutation of nitrogen into oxygen in 1925, using alpha particles directed at nitrogen. In modern notation for the atomic nuclei, the reaction was: : + → + p This was the first observation of a nuclear reaction, that is, a reaction in which particles from one decay are used to transform another atomic nucleus. A fully artificial nuclear reaction and nuclear transmutation was achieved in April 1932 by Ernest Walton and John Cockcroft, who used artificially accelerated protons against lithium, to break this nucleus into two alpha particles. The feat was popularly known as \\"splitting the atom\\", but was not nuclear fission; as it was not the result of initiating an internal radioactive decay process. Just a few weeks before Cockcroft and Walton's feat, another scientist at the Cavendish Laboratory, James Chadwick, discovered the neutron, using an ingenious device made with sealing wax, through the reaction of beryllium with alpha particles:Chadwick announced his initial findings in: Subsequently he communicated his findings in more detail in: ; and : + → + n Irène Curie and Frédéric Joliot irradiated aluminium foil with alpha particles, they found that this results in a short-lived radioactive isotope of phosphorus with a half-life of around three minutes: : + → + n which then decays to a stable isotope of silicon : → + e+ They noted that radioactivity continued after the neutron emissions ceased. Not only had they discovered a new form of radioactive decay in the form of positron emission, they had transmuted an element into a hitherto unknown radioactive isotope of another, thereby inducing radioactivity where there had been none before. Radiochemistry was now no longer confined to certain heavy elements, but extended to the entire periodic table. Chadwick noted that being electrically neutral, neutrons would be able to penetrate the nucleus more easily than protons or alpha particles. Enrico Fermi and his colleagues in Rome—Edoardo Amaldi, Oscar D'Agostino, Franco Rasetti and Emilio Segrè—picked up on this idea. Rasetti visited Meitner's laboratory in 1931, and again in 1932 after Chadwick's discovery of the neutron. Meitner showed him how to prepare a polonium-beryllium neutron source. On returning to Rome, Rasetti built Geiger counters and a cloud chamber modelled after Meitner's. Fermi initially intended to use polonium as a source of alpha particles, as Chadwick and Curie had done. Radon was a stronger source of alpha particles than polonium, but it also emitted beta and gamma rays, which played havoc with the detection equipment in the laboratory. But Rasetti went on his Easter vacation without preparing the polonium-beryllium source, and Fermi realised that since he was interested in the products of the reaction, he could irradiate his sample in one laboratory and test it in another down the hall. The neutron source was easy to prepare by mixing with powdered beryllium in a sealed capsule. Moreover, radon was easily obtained; Giulio Cesare Trabacchi had more than a gram of radium and was happy to supply Fermi with radon. With a half- life of only 3.82 days it would only go to waste otherwise, and the radium continually produced more. Enrico Fermi and his research group (the Via Panisperna boys), circa 1934. Left to right: Oscar D'Agostino, Emilio Segrè, Edoardo Amaldi, Franco Rasetti and Fermi. Working in assembly-line fashion, they started by irradiating water, and then progressed up the periodic table through lithium, beryllium, boron and carbon, without inducing any radioactivity. When they got to aluminium and then fluorine, they had their first successes. Induced radioactivity was ultimately found through the neutron bombardment of 22 different elements. Meitner was one of the select group of physicists to whom Fermi mailed advance copies of his papers, and she was able to report that she had verified his findings with respect to aluminium, silicon, phosphorus, copper and zinc. When a new copy of La Ricerca Scientifica arrived at the Niels Bohr's Institute for Theoretical Physics at the University of Copenhagen, her nephew, Otto Frisch, as the only physicist there who could read Italian, found himself in demand from colleagues wanting a translation. The Rome group had no samples of the rare earth metals, but at Bohr's institute George de Hevesy had a complete set of their oxides that had been given to him by Auergesellschaft, so de Hevesy and Hilde Levi carried out the process with them. When the Rome group reached uranium, they had a problem: the radioactivity of natural uranium was almost as great as that of their neutron source. What they observed was a complex mixture of half-lives. Following the displacement law, they checked for the presence of lead, bismuth, radium, actinium, thorium and protactinium (skipping the elements whose chemical properties were unknown), and (correctly) found no indication of any of them. Fermi noted three types of reactions were caused by neutron irradiation: emission of an alpha particle (n, α); proton emission (n, p); and gamma emission (n, γ). Invariably, the new isotopes decayed by beta emission, which caused elements to move up the periodic table. Based on the periodic table of the time, Fermi believed that element 93 was ekarhenium—the element below rhenium—with characteristics similar to manganese and rhenium. Such an element was found, and Fermi tentatively concluded that his experiments had created new elements with 93 and 94 protons, which he dubbed ausonium and hesperium. The results were published in Nature in June 1934. However, in this paper Fermi cautioned that \\"a careful search for such heavy particles has not yet been carried out, as they require for their observation that the active product should be in the form of a very thin layer. It seems therefore at present premature to form any definite hypothesis on the chain of disintegrations involved.\\" In retrospect, what they had detected was indeed an unknown rhenium-like element, technetium, which lies between manganese and rhenium on the periodic table. Leo Szilard and Thomas A. Chalmers reported that neutrons generated by gamma rays acting on beryllium were captured by iodine, a reaction that Fermi had also noted. When Meitner repeated their experiment, she found that neutrons from the gamma-beryllium sources were captured by heavy elements like iodine, silver and gold, but not by lighter ones like sodium, aluminium and silicon. She concluded that slow neutrons were more likely to be captured than fast ones, a finding she reported to Naturwissenschaften in October 1934. Everyone had been thinking that energetic neutrons were required, as was the case with alpha particles and protons, but that was required to overcome the Coulomb barrier; the neutrally charged neutrons were more likely to be captured by the nucleus if they spent more time in its vicinity. A few days later, Fermi considered a curiosity that his group had noted: uranium seemed to react differently in different parts of the laboratory; neutron irradiation conducted on a wooden table induced more radioactivity than on a marble table in the same room. Fermi thought about this and tried placing a piece of paraffin wax between the neutron source and the uranium. This resulted in a dramatic increase in activity. He reasoned that the neutrons had been slowed by collisions with hydrogen atoms in the paraffin and wood. The departure of D'Agostino meant that the Rome group no longer had a chemist, and the subsequent loss of Rasetti and Segrè reduced the group to just Fermi and Amaldi, who abandoned the research into transmutation to concentrate on exploring the physics of slow neutrons. The current model of the nucleus in 1934 was the liquid drop model first proposed by George Gamow in 1930. His simple and elegant model was refined and developed by Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker and, after the discovery of the neutron, by Werner Heisenberg in 1935 and Niels Bohr in 1936, it agreed closely with observations. In the model, the nucleons were held together in the smallest possible volume (a sphere) by the strong nuclear force, which was capable of overcoming the longer ranged Coulomb electrical repulsion between the protons. The model remained in use for certain applications in the 21st century, when it attracted the attention of mathematicians interested in its properties, but in its 1934 form it confirmed what physicists thought they already knew: that nuclei were static, and that the odds of a collision chipping off more than an alpha particle were practically zero. DiscoveryObjections= Fermi won the 1938 Nobel Prize in Physics for his \\"demonstrations of the existence of new radioactive elements produced by neutron irradiation, and for his related discovery of nuclear reactions brought about by slow neutrons\\". However, not everyone was convinced by Fermi's analysis of his results. Ida Noddack suggested in September 1934 that instead of creating a new, heavier element 93, that: Noddack's article was read by Fermi's team in Rome, Curie and Joliot in Paris, and Meitner and Hahn in Berlin. However, the quoted objection comes some distance down, and is but one of several gaps she noted in Fermi's claim. Bohr's liquid drop model had not yet been formulated, so there was no theoretical way to calculate whether it was physically possible for the uranium atoms to break into large pieces. Noddack and her husband, Walter Noddack, were renowned chemists who had been nominated for the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the discovery of rhenium, although at the time they were also embroiled in a controversy over the discovery of element 43, which they called \\"masurium\\". The discovery of technetium by Emilio Segrè and Carlo Perrier put an end to their claim, but did not occur until 1937. It is unlikely that Meitner or Curie had any prejudice against Noddack because of her sex, but Meitner was not afraid to tell Hahn Hahnchen, von Physik verstehst Du Nichts (\\"Hahn dear, of physics you understand nothing\\"). The same attitude carried over to Noddack, who did not propose an alternative nuclear model, nor conduct experiments to support her claim. Although Noddack was a renowned analytical chemist, she lacked the background in physics to appreciate the enormity of what she was proposing. Former Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry building in Berlin. After the Second World War it became part of the Free University of Berlin. It was renamed the Otto Hahn Building in 1956, and the Hahn-Meitner Building in 2010. Noddack was not the only critic of Fermi's claim. Aristid von Grosse suggested that what Fermi had found was an isotope of protactinium. Meitner was eager to investigate Fermi's results, but she recognised that a highly skilled chemist was required, and she wanted the best one she knew: Hahn, although they had not collaborated for many years. Initially, Hahn was not interested, but von Grosse's mention of protactinium changed his mind. \\"The only question\\", Hahn later wrote, \\"seemed to be whether Fermi had found isotopes of transuranian elements, or isotopes of the next-lower element, protactinium. At that time Lise Meitner and I decided to repeat Fermi's experiments in order to find out whether the 13-minute isotope was a protactinium isotope or not. It was a logical decision, having been the discoverers of protactinium.\\" Hahn and Meitner were joined by Fritz Strassmann. Strassmann had received his doctorate in analytical chemistry from the Technical University of Hannover in 1929, and had come to the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry to study under Hahn, believing that this would improve his employment prospects. He enjoyed the work and the people so much that he stayed on after his stipend expired in 1932. After the Nazi Party came to power in Germany in 1933, he declined a lucrative offer of employment because it required political training and Nazi Party membership, and he resigned from the Society of German Chemists when it became part of the Nazi German Labour Front. As a result, he could neither work in the chemical industry nor receive his habilitation, which was required to become an independent researcher in Germany. Meitner persuaded Hahn to hire Strassmann using money from the director's special circumstances fund. In 1935, Strassmann became an assistant on half pay. Soon he would be credited as a collaborator on the papers they produced. The 1933 Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service removed Jewish people from the civil service, which included academia. Meitner never tried to conceal her Jewish descent, but initially was exempt from its impact on multiple grounds: she had been employed before 1914, had served in the military during the World War, was an Austrian rather than a German citizen, and the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute was a government-industry partnership. However, she was dismissed from her adjunct professorship at the University of Berlin on the grounds that her World War I service was not at the front, and she had not completed her habilitation until 1922. Carl Bosch, the director of IG Farben, a major sponsor of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry, assured Meitner that her position there was safe, and she agreed to stay. Meitner, Hahn and Strassmann drew closer together personally as their anti-Nazi politics increasingly alienated them from the rest of the organisation, but it gave them more time for research, as administration was devolved to Hahn's and Meitner's assistants. =Research= The nuclear fission display at the Deutsches Museum in Munich. This was touted for many years as the table and experimental apparatus with which Otto Hahn discovered nuclear fission in 1938. The table and instruments are representative of the ones used, but not necessarily the originals, and would not have been together on the one table in the same room. Pressure from historians, scientists and feminists caused the museum to alter the display in 1988 to acknowledge Lise Meitner, Otto Frisch and Fritz Strassmann. The Berlin group started by irradiating uranium salt with neutrons from a radon-beryllium source similar to the one that Fermi had used. They dissolved it and added potassium perrhenate, platinum chloride and sodium hydroxide. What remained was then acidified with hydrogen sulphide, resulting in platinum sulphide and rhenium sulphide precipitation. Fermi had noted four radioactive isotopes with the longest-lived having 13- and 90-minute half-lives, and these were detected in the precipitate. The Berlin group then tested for protactinium by adding protactinium-234 to the solution. When this was precipitated, it was found to be separated from the 13- and 90-minute half-life isotopes, demonstrating that von Grosse was incorrect, and they were not isotopes of protactinium. Moreover, the chemical reactions involved ruled out all elements from mercury and above on the periodic table. They were able to precipitate the 90-minute activity with osmium sulphide and the 13-minute one with rhenium sulphide, which ruled out them being isotopes of the same element. All this provided strong evidence that they were indeed transuranium elements, with chemical properties similar to osmium and rhenium. Fermi had also reported that fast and slow neutrons had produced different activities. This indicated that more than one reaction was taking place. When the Berlin group could not replicate the Rome group's findings, they commenced their own research into the effects of fast and slow neutrons. To minimise radioactive contamination if there were an accident, different phases were carried out in different rooms, all in Meitner's section on the ground floor of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute. Neutron irradiation was carried out in one laboratory, chemical separation in another, and measurements were conducted in a third. The equipment they used was simple and mostly hand made. By March 1936, they had identified ten different half- lives, with varying degrees of certainty. To account for them, Meitner had to hypothesise a new (n, 2n) class of reaction and the alpha decay of uranium, neither of which had ever been reported before, and for which physical evidence was lacking. So while Hahn and Strassmann refined their chemical procedures, Meitner devised new experiments to shine more light on the reaction processes. In May 1937, they issued parallel reports, one in Zeitschrift für Physik with Meitner as the principal author, and one in Chemische Berichte with Hahn as the principal author. Hahn concluded his by stating emphatically: Vor allem steht ihre chemische Verschiedenheit von allen bisher bekannten Elementen außerhalb jeder Diskussion (\\"Above all, their chemical distinction from all previously known elements needs no further discussion.\\") Meitner was increasingly uncertain. They had now constructed three (n, γ) reactions: # + n → (10 seconds) → (2.2 minutes) → (59 minutes) → (66 hours) → (2.5 hours) → (?) # + n → (40 seconds) → (16 minutes) → (5.7 hours) → (?) # + n → (23 minutes) → Meitner was certain that these had to be (n, γ) reactions, as slow neutrons lacked the energy to chip off protons or alpha particles. She considered the possibility that the reactions were from different isotopes of uranium; three were known: uranium-238, uranium-235 and uranium-234. However, when she calculated the neutron cross section it was too large to be anything other than the most abundant isotope, uranium-238. She concluded that it must be a case of nuclear isomerism, which had been discovered in protactinium by Hahn in 1922. Nuclear isomerism had been given a physical explanation by von Weizsäcker, who had been Meitner's assistant in 1936, but had since taken a position at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics. Different nuclear isomers of protactinium had different half-lives, and this could be the case for uranium too, but if so it was somehow being inherited by the daughter and granddaughter products, which seemed to be stretching the argument to breaking point. Then there was the third reaction, an (n, γ) one, which occurred only with slow neutrons. Meitner therefore ended her report on a very different note to Hahn, reporting that: \\"The process must be neutron capture by uranium-238, which leads to three isomeric nuclei of uranium-239. This result is very difficult to reconcile with current concepts of the nucleus.\\" Exhibition to mark the 75th anniversary of the discovery of nuclear fission, at the Vienna International Centre in 2013. The table (on loan from the Deutsches Museum Munich) is now described as a replica and images of Meitner and Strassmann are prominently displayed. After this, the Berlin group moved on to working with thorium, as Strassmann put it, \\"to recover from, the horror of the work with uranium\\". However, thorium was not easier to work with than uranium. For a start, it had a decay product, radiothorium () that overwhelmed weaker neutron-induced activity. But Hahn and Meitner had a sample from which they had regularly removed its mother isotope, mesothorium (), over a period of several years, allowing the radiothorium to decay away. Even then, it was still more difficult to work with because its induced decay products from neutron irradiation were isotopes of the same elements produced by thorium's own radioactive decay. What they found was three different decay series, all alpha emitters—a form of decay not found in any other heavy element, and for which Meitner once again had to postulate multiple isomers. They did find an interesting result: these (n, α) decay series occurred simultaneously when the energy of the incident neutrons was less than 2.5 MeV; when they had more, an (n, γ) reaction that formed was favoured. In Paris, Irene Curie and Pavel Savitch had also set out to replicate Fermi's findings. In collaboration with Hans von Halban and Peter Preiswerk, they irradiated thorium and produced the isotope with a 22-minute half-life that Fermi had noted. In all, Curie's group detected eight different half-lives in their irradiated thorium. Curie and Savitch detected a radioactive substance with a 3.5-hour half-life. The Paris group proposed that it might be an isotope of thorium. Meitner asked Strassmann, who was now doing most of the chemistry work, to check. He detected no sign of thorium. Meitner wrote to Curie with their results, and suggested a quiet retraction. Nonetheless, Curie persisted. They investigated the chemistry, and found that the 3.5-hour activity was coming from something that seemed to be chemically similar to lanthanum (which in fact it was), which they attempted unsuccessfully to isolate with a fractional crystallization process. (It is possible that their precipitate was contaminated with yttrium, which is chemically similar.) By using Geiger counters and skipping the chemical precipitation, Curie and Savitch detected the 3.5-hour half-life in irradiated uranium. With the Anschluss, Germany's unification with Austria on 12 March 1938, Meitner lost her Austrian citizenship. James Franck offered to sponsor her immigration to the United States, and Bohr offered a temporary place at his institute, but when she went to the Danish embassy for a visa, she was told that Denmark no longer recognised her Austrian passport as valid. On 13 July 1938, Meitner departed for the Netherlands with Dutch physicist Dirk Coster. Before she left, Otto Hahn gave her a diamond ring he had inherited from his mother to sell if necessary. She reached safety, but with only her summer clothes. Meitner later said that she left Germany forever with 10 marks in her purse. With the help of Coster and Adriaan Fokker, she flew to Copenhagen, where she was greeted by Frisch, and stayed with Niels and Margrethe Bohr at their holiday house in Tisvilde. On 1 August she took the train to Stockholm, where she was met by Eva von Bahr. =Eureka!= The Paris group published their results in September 1938. Hahn dismissed the isotope with the 3.5-hour half-life as contamination, but after looking at the details of the Paris group's experiments and the decay curves, Strassmann was worried. He decided to repeat the experiment, using his more efficient method of separating radium. This time, they found what they thought was radium, which Hahn suggested resulted from two alpha decays: : + n → α + → α + Meitner found this very hard to believe. The mechanism of fission. A neutron caused the nucleus to wobble, elongate, and split. In November, Hahn travelled to Copenhagen, where he met with Bohr and Meitner. They told him that they were very unhappy about the proposed radium isomers. On Meitner's instructions, Hahn and Strassmann began to redo the experiments, even as Fermi was collecting his Nobel Prize in Stockholm. Assisted by Clara Lieber and Irmgard Bohne, they isolated the three radium isotopes (verified by their half-lives) and used fractional crystallisation to separate them from the barium carrier by adding barium bromide crystals in four steps. Since radium precipitates preferentially in a solution of barium bromide, at each step the fraction drawn off would contain less radium than the one before. However, they found no difference between each of the fractions. In case their process was faulty in some way, they verified it with known isotopes of radium; the process was fine. On 19 December, Hahn wrote to Meitner, informing her that the radium isotopes behaved chemically like barium. Anxious to finish up before the Christmas break, Hahn and Strassmann submitted their findings to Naturwissenschaften on 22 December without waiting for Meitner to reply. Hahn concluded with: \\"As chemists... we should substitute the symbols Ba, La, Ce for Ra, Ac, Th. As 'nuclear chemists' fairly close to physics we cannot yet bring ourselves to take this step which contradicts all previous experience in physics.\\" Frisch normally celebrated Christmas with Meitner in Berlin, but in 1938 she accepted an invitation from Eva von Bahr to spend it with her family at Kungälv, and Meitner asked Frisch to join her there. Meitner received the letter from Hahn describing his chemical proof that some of the product of the bombardment of uranium with neutrons was barium. Barium had an atomic mass 40% less than uranium, and no previously known methods of radioactive decay could account for such a large difference in the mass of the nucleus. Nonetheless, she had immediately written back to Hahn to say: \\"At the moment the assumption of such a thoroughgoing breakup seems very difficult to me, but in nuclear physics we have experienced so many surprises, that one cannot unconditionally say: 'It is impossible.'\\" Meitner felt that Hahn was too careful a chemist to make an elementary blunder, but found the results difficult to explain. All the nuclear reactions that had been documented involved chipping protons or alpha particles from the nucleus. Breaking it up seemed far more difficult. However the liquid drop model that Gamow had postulated suggested the possibility that an atomic nucleus could become elongated and overcome the surface tension that held it together. According to Frisch: Meitner and Frisch had correctly interpreted Hahn's results to mean that the nucleus of uranium had split roughly in half. The first two reactions that the Berlin group had observed were light elements created by the breakup of uranium nuclei; the third, the 23-minute one, was a decay into the real element 93. On returning to Copenhagen, Frisch informed Bohr, who slapped his forehead and exclaimed \\"What idiots we have been!\\" Bohr promised not to say anything until they had a paper ready for publication. To speed the process, they decided to submit a one-page note to Nature. At this point, the only evidence that they had was the barium. Logically, if barium was formed, the other element must be krypton, although Hahn mistakenly believed that the atomic masses had to add up to 239 rather than the atomic numbers adding up to 92, and thought it was masurium (technetium), and so did not check for it: : + n → + + some n Over a series of long-distance phone calls, Meitner and Frisch came up with a simple experiment to bolster their claim: to measure the recoil of the fission fragments, using a Geiger counter with the threshold set above that of the alpha particles. Frisch conducted the experiment on 13 February 1939, and found the pulses caused by the reaction just as they had predicted. He decided he needed a name for the newly discovered nuclear process. He spoke to William A. Arnold, an American biologist working with de Hevesy and asked him what biologists called the process by which living cells divided into two cells. Arnold told him that biologists called it fission. Frisch then applied that name to the nuclear process in his paper. Frisch mailed both the jointly- authored note on fission and his paper on the recoil experiment to Nature on 16 January 1939; the former appeared in print on 11 February and the latter on 18 February. ReceptionBohr brings the news to the United States= Before departing for the United States on 7 January 1939 with his son Erik to attend the Fifth Washington Conference on Theoretical Physics, Bohr promised Frisch that he would not mention fission until the papers appeared in print, but during the Atlantic crossing on the , Bohr discussed the mechanism of fission with Leon Rosenfeld, and failed to inform him that the information was confidential. On arrival in New York City on 16 January, they were met by Fermi and his wife Laura Capon, and by John Wheeler, who had been a fellow at Bohr's institute in 1934–1935. As it happened, there was a meeting of Princeton University's Physics Journal Club that evening, and when Wheeler asked Rosenfeld if he had any news to report, Rosenfeld told them. An embarrassed Bohr fired off a note to Nature defending Meitner and Frisch's claim to the priority of the discovery. Hahn was annoyed that while Bohr mentioned his and Strassmann's work in the note, he cited only Meitner and Frisch. News spread quickly of the new discovery, which was correctly seen as an entirely novel physical effect with great scientific—and potentially practical—possibilities. Isidor Isaac Rabi and Willis Lamb, two Columbia University physicists working at Princeton, heard the news and carried it back to Columbia. Rabi said he told Fermi; Fermi gave credit to Lamb. For Fermi, the news came as a profound embarrassment, as the transuranic elements that he had partly been awarded the Nobel Prize for discovering had not been transuranic elements at all, but fission products. He added a footnote to this effect to his Nobel Prize acceptance speech. Bohr soon thereafter went from Princeton to Columbia to see Fermi. Not finding Fermi in his office, Bohr went down to the cyclotron area and found Herbert L. Anderson. Bohr grabbed him by the shoulder and said: \\"Young man, let me explain to you about something new and exciting in physics.\\" =Further research= It was clear to many scientists at Columbia that they should try to detect the energy released in the nuclear fission of uranium from neutron bombardment. On 25 January 1939, a Columbia University group conducted the first nuclear fission experiment in the United States, which was done in the basement of Pupin Hall. The experiment involved placing uranium oxide inside of an ionization chamber and irradiating it with neutrons, and measuring the energy thus released. The next day, the Fifth Washington Conference on Theoretical Physics began in Washington, D.C., under the joint auspices of The George Washington University and the Carnegie Institution of Washington. From there, the news on nuclear fission spread even further, which fostered many more experimental demonstrations. Bohr and Wheeler overhauled the liquid drop model to explain the mechanism of nuclear fission, with conspicuous success. Their paper appeared in Physical Review on 1 September 1939, the day Germany invaded Poland, starting World War II in Europe. As the experimental physicists studied fission, they uncovered more puzzling results. George Placzek (who had measured the slow neutron absorption of gold in 1934 using Bohr's Nobel Prize medal) asked Bohr why uranium fissioned with both very fast and very slow neutrons. Walking to a meeting with Wheeler, Bohr had an insight that the fission at low energies was due to the uranium-235 isotope, while at high energies it was mainly due to the far more abundant uranium-238 isotope. This was based on Meitner's 1937 measurements of the neutron capture cross- sections. This would be experimentally verified in February 1940, after Alfred Nier was able to produce sufficient pure uranium-235 for John R. Dunning, Aristid von Grosse and Eugene T. Booth to test. Other scientists resumed the search for the elusive element 93, which seemed to be straightforward, as they now knew it resulted from the 23-minute half-life. At the Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley, California, Emilio Segrè and Edwin McMillan used the cyclotron to create the isotope. They then detected a beta activity with a 2-day half-life, but it had rare-earth element chemical characteristics, and element 93 was supposed to have chemistry akin to rhenium. It was therefore overlooked as just another fission product. Another year passed before McMillan and Philip Abelson determined that the 2-day half-life element was that of the elusive element 93, which they named \\"neptunium\\". They paved the way for the discovery by Glenn Seaborg, Emilio Segrè and Joseph W. Kennedy of element 94, which they named \\"plutonium\\" in 1941. Another avenue of research, spearheaded by Meitner, was to determine if other elements could fission after being irradiated with neutrons. It was soon determined that thorium and protactinium could. Measurements were also made of the amount of energy released. Hans von Halban, Frédéric Joliot-Curie and Lew Kowarski demonstrated that uranium bombarded by neutrons emitted more neutrons than it absorbed, suggesting the possibility of a nuclear chain reaction. Fermi and Anderson did so too a few weeks later. It was apparent to many scientists that, in theory at least, an extremely powerful energy source could be created, although most still considered an atomic bomb an impossibility. =Nobel Prize= German stamp honouring Otto Hahn and his discovery of nuclear fission (1979). Both Hahn and Meitner had been nominated for the chemistry and the physics Nobel Prizes many times even before the discovery of nuclear fission for their work on radioactive isotopes and protactinium. Several more nominations followed for the discovery of fission between 1940 and 1943. Nobel Prize nominations were vetted by committees of five, one for each award. Although both Hahn and Meitner received nominations for physics, radioactivity and radioactive elements had traditionally been seen as the domain of chemistry, and so the Nobel Committee for Chemistry evaluated the nominations in 1944. The committee received reports from Theodor Svedberg in 1941 and in 1942. These chemists were impressed by Hahn's work, but felt that the experimental work of Meitner and Frisch was not extraordinary. They did not understand why the physics community regarded their work as seminal. As for Strassmann, although his name was on the papers, there was a long-standing policy of conferring awards on the most senior scientist in a collaboration. In 1944 the Nobel Committee for Chemistry voted to recommend that Hahn alone be given the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for 1944. However, Germans had been forbidden to accept Nobel Prizes after the Nobel Peace Prize had been awarded to Carl von Ossietzky in 1936. The committee's recommendation was rejected by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which decided to defer the award for one year. The war was over when the Academy reconsidered the award in September 1945. The Nobel Committee for Chemistry had now become more cautious, as it was apparent that much research had been undertaken by the Manhattan Project in the United States in secret, and it suggested deferring the 1944 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for another year. The Academy was swayed by Göran Liljestrand, who argued that it was important for the Academy to assert its independence from the Allies of World War II, and award the Nobel Prize in Chemistry to a German, as it had done after World War I when it had awarded it to Fritz Haber. Hahn therefore became the sole recipient of the 1944 Nobel Prize in Chemistry \\"for his discovery of the fission of heavy nuclei\\". Meitner wrote in a letter to her friend Birgit Broomé-Aminoff on 20 November 1945: In 1946, the Nobel Committee for Physics considered nominations for Meitner and Frisch received from Max von Laue, Niels Bohr, Oskar Klein, Egil Hylleraas and James Franck. Reports were written for the committee by Erik Hulthén, who held the chair of experimental physics at Stockholm University, in 1945 and 1946. Hulthén argued that theoretical physics should be considered award-worthy only if it inspired great experiments. The role of Meitner and Frisch in being the first to understand and explain fission was not understood. There may also have been personal factors: the chairman of the committee, Manne Siegbahn, disliked Meitner, and had a professional rivalry with Klein. Meitner and Frisch would continue to be nominated regularly for many years, but would never be awarded a Nobel Prize. In history and memory At the end of the war in Europe, Hahn was taken into custody and incarcerated at Farm Hall with nine other senior scientists, all of whom except Max von Laue had been involved with the German nuclear weapons program, and all except Hahn and Paul Harteck were physicists. It was here that they heard the news of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Unwilling to accept that they were years behind the Americans, and unaware that their conversations were being recorded, they concocted a story that they had never wanted their nuclear weapons program to succeed in the first place on moral grounds. Hahn was still there when his Nobel Prize was announced in November 1945. The Farm Hall scientists would spend the rest of their lives attempting to rehabilitate the image of German science that had been tarnished by the Nazi period. Inconvenient details like the thousands of female slave labourers from Sachsenhausen concentration camp who mined uranium ore for their experiments were swept under the rug. Lise Meitner in 1946 with physicist Arthur H. Compton and actress Katharine Cornell. For Hahn, this necessarily involved asserting his claim of the discovery of fission for himself, for chemistry, and for Germany. He used his Nobel Prize acceptance speech to assert this narrative. Hahn's message resonated strongly in Germany, where he was revered as the proverbial good German, a decent man who had been a staunch opponent of the Nazi regime, but had remained in Germany where he had pursued pure science. As president of the Max Planck Society from 1946 to 1960, he projected an image of German science as undiminished in brilliance and untainted by Nazism to an audience that wanted to believe it. In contrast, in the immediate aftermath of the war Meitner and Frisch were hailed as the discoverers of fission in English-speaking countries. Japan was seen as a puppet state of Germany and the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki as poetic justice for the persecution of the Jewish people. In January 1946, Meitner toured the United States, where she gave lectures and received honorary degrees. She attended a cocktail party for Lieutenant General Leslie Groves, the director of the Manhattan Project (who gave her sole credit for the discovery of fission in his 1962 memoirs), and was named Woman of the Year by the Women's National Press Club. At the reception for this award, she sat next to the President of the United States, Harry S. Truman. But Meitner did not enjoy public speaking, especially in English, nor did she relish the role of a celebrity, and she declined the offer of a visiting professorship at Wellesley College. In 1966, the United States Atomic Energy Commission jointly awarded the Enrico Fermi Prize to Hahn, Strassmann and Meitner for their discovery of fission. The ceremony was held in the Hofburg palace in Vienna. It was the first time that the Enrico Fermi Prize had been awarded to non- Americans, and the first time it was presented to a woman. Meitner's diploma bore the words: \\"For pioneering research in the naturally occurring radioactivities and extensive experimental studies leading to the discovery of fission\\". Hahn's diploma was slightly different: \\"For pioneering research in the naturally occurring radioactivities and extensive experimental studies culminating in the discovery of fission.\\" Hahn and Strassmann were present, but Meitner was too ill to attend, so Frisch accepted the award on her behalf. During combined celebrations in Germany of the 100th birthdays of Einstein, Hahn, Meitner and von Laue in 1978, Hahn's narrative of the discovery of fission began to crumble. Hahn and Meitner had died in 1968, but Strassmann was still alive, and he asserted the importance of his analytical chemistry and Meitner's physics in the discovery, and their role as more than just assistants. A detailed biography of Strassmann appeared in 1981, a year after his death, and a prize-winning one of Meitner for young adults in 1986. Scientists questioned the focus on chemistry, historians challenged the accepted narrative of the Nazi period, and feminists saw Meitner as yet another example of the Matilda effect, where a woman had been airbrushed from the pages of history. By 1990, Meitner had been restored to the narrative, although her role remained contested.

After being released in 1868 he settled in the Russian Far- East in Sidemi, Primorsky Krai, in a region now known as the Yankovsky Peninsula where he established a horse-breeding farm, reared deer for their antlers, established ginseng plantations, and became a well-known hunter and naturalist. He collected specimens of fauna and flora for museums and collectors and many species were named after him including Jankowski's bunting.  Life and work  255x255px Jankowski was the son of Jan and Elżbieta of Więckowski, born in Złotoria, and came from the nobility of the Novina clan who claimed descent from the knight Tadeusz Novina who fought in the Crusades. He grew up in Złotoria and Tykocin and then went to study at the agricultural university in Hory-Horki near Mogilev. He took part in the January Uprising of 1863 and was captured by the Russians, and sent to Siberia. The prisoners travelled on foot from Smolensk to Siberia. Near Siwakowa near Czyta, he met the fellow Polish zoologist Benedict Dybowski. His sentence was shortened and ended in 1868 after which he applied and received permission to settle in Badajsk in the Irkutsk region. Here he worked in a gold mine from November 1868. In 1872-74 he helped Benedict Dybowski and Viktor Godlewski and joined them on an expedition, providing the team with a boat and learned to prepare specimens from Dybowksi. They travelled along the Amur River to the mouth of the Ussuri River. From 1874, Jankowski managed a gold mine owned by Captain Fridolf Heck on the island of Askold near Vladivostok and in 1877 he established a meteorological station on the island. He married the widow of a soldier on the island, and in 1876 their son Alexander was born but the mother died. Unable to care for the child, he sought a woman, choosing from among several other brides just by examining a set of photographs. He then visited Olga Kuzniecowa who belonged to a Buryat Kurtuk family and she agreed to the marriage. The couple adopted an orphan boy Andrei Agranat on the island of Askold and then also had their own children Elżbieta (born 1878) and Jerzy (born 1879) (Anglicized as George, and Yuri in Russian). He later purchased 550 hectares on the Sidemi peninsula where the family moved to in 1880. The area is now known as the Yankovsky Peninsula. His children Anna (1884), Jan (1886), Sergei (1888) and Paweł (1890) were born there. The Sidemi area was a rich wilderness with leopards, tigers and threatened by roving gangs of Honghuzi bandits against whom Jankowski and the other settlers waged war. In one attack, the wife of his neighbour Captain Heck was killed along with several workers while his son was kidnapped. Heck, Jankowski, and a group of his trusted Korean farmhands chased the bandits into the Chinese border and Jankowski eventually shot the chief. Jankowski's hunting exploits and brushes with the Honghuzi transformed him into a legend. The Koreans nicknamed him as \\"nenuni\\" or four-eyed for his sharp eyesight, spotting bandits, boars, and beetles. Jankowski build a strong house as a defence against future attacks, managed orchards, began ginseng plantations, and maintained herds of sika deer (maintained for their velvet antlers which were much sought after in China and Korea) apart from breeding horses. He collected natural history specimens which he sent to Russian and European museums, earning a good income from them. In 1889 he sponsored part of the museum in Vladivostok, now named after Vladimir Arsenyev, and also contributed specimens to it. His sons Yuri (\\"George\\") and Alexander also helped in collecting natural history specimens. Yuri and Alexander were also sent to the United States where Yuri studied horse management on Texan farms. They returned with English thoroughbreds aboard a ship from San Francisco. Alexander took an interest in construction, and led a collecting expedition for Vladimir Leontyevich Komarov. Jankowski's horses, bred for a variety of purposes, were used in the cavalry, won races, and pulled plough-shares. He later built leather factories, began a bookstore, and moved to Vladivostok in 1905. During the Russo-Japanese War, he commanded a defence unit. In 1909 he suffered from severe pneumonia and was treated at Semipałatyn and later at Sochi where he lived until his death in 1912. The estate was managed by Yuri after his death.  Family escape to Korea  George and his children (Valery at left and Arseny at extreme right) with leopard The remaining Jankowski family lived in the region along with other settler families including that of Captain Fridolf Heck and Julius Ivanovich Briner, grandfather of the American actor Yul Brynner, who owned 50 hectares of land. After the Russian Revolution, the Bolsheviks moved into the area and their lands were seized by the government. Most of the Jankowski family moved out in 1922 to settle further south in what is now North Korea. Jankowski's daughter Anna studied some medicine in Russia and became a member of the Sisters of Mercy. She, contrary to the family political stance, joined the communist party where she came to be called as Comrade Galya and took part in protests against the Tsar, following which she had to flee back east to Sidemi and then forced to live in exile for a while in Japan. She later returned to Sidemi and with her links to the communist party, was the only member of the family that stayed on after the Bolsheviks moved into the area in 1922. Moving to Korea, Yuri sold off the horses and many of their possessions in Harbin. The family then purchased some land near Chongjin and built up an estate called Novina (after their clan name but also meaning new place). Yuri (now increasingly better known as George) managed this as farm and as a resort which became very successful, attracting many Russian exiles in Korea and their friends. The family later also ran a second resort called Lukomorie closer to the coast. The brothers continued to breed Sika and reindeer, hunt, and grow ginseng. Yuri became a famous tiger hunter and wrote several books. All the children learned to ride horses and hunt. When the Japanese took over Korea, the family earned a living by supplying fresh meat from the forests and from their farm. When the Soviets invaded northern Korea in 1945, Yuri was arrested by the NKVD and the lands taken away. Yuri was sent to the Gulags where he died in 1956. A biography of George Yankovsky was published as The tiger's claw (1956) by Mary Linley Taylor. Yuri's sister Anna who stayed back in Sidemi committed suicide in 1952 following the death of her husband. Yuri's son Valery (28 May 1911 - 17 April 2010), became a sharpshooter and writer of note. He was nicknamed \\"nenuni sonja\\" (grand-son of four-eyes). While in Korea, the Japanese who knew of his hunting prowess showed him a photograph and offered a 10000 yen bounty for hunting a rebel who lived in the forests. Being sympathetic to the local Koreans, he declined to take it up and many years later he realized that the Japanese target had been none other than Kim Il-sung. Valery was also arrested and sent to the Gulags in 1946 but he survived and was released in 1955 after Stalin's death after which he went to live in Magadan. His wife and son had escaped to southern Korea and then emigrated to Canada. He became a writer and wrote several novels and a biographical account of the family in From the crusades to Gulag and beyond (2007).Church in North Korea. Translated from Новый храм Воскресения Христова в благодатной Сев. Корее,\\" Хлеб Небесный, ном. 10, 1937 Yuri's daughters Victoria and Muza moved to the United States of America and Chile. Victoria, noted for wearing earrings made from tiger claws, published a book of her poems. Yuri's son Arseny (1914–1978) escaped to southern Korea and because he knew Korean, Japanese, Russian and English, he was recruited by the Americans and became a CIA operative who went by the name of Andy Brown. As many of his agents got caught and executed in Korea, he was suspected to be a mole and dismissed.  Legacy  A statue to Michał Jankowski made by O.S. Kulesh was unveiled on September 15, 1991 in the village of Bezverkhovo, Primorsky Krai. Numerous species are named after the Jankowskis including Emberiza jankowksii described by the Polish ornithologist Taczanowski , Cygnus columbianus jankowskyi described by Russian ornithologist Alpheraky, and Pica pica jankowksi described by Boris Stegmann. Jankowski senior sent many of his lepidoptera to Charles Oberthür. Insects carrying the family name include Xanthocosmia jankowksi, Spilosoma jankowksi, Marumba jankowksii, and Carabus jankowksii. There are also plants like Alpinia jankowski. A moth Olene olga is named after his second wife. A large number of insects were also collected by the oldest son Alexander between 1937 and 1940 and many are in the Smithsonian Institution collections. A cranefly Prionolabis yankovskyana was named after him by C.P. Alexander.  References  External links  * Jankowski's long return - a biography of Valery Jankowski * Biography in Russian by E.V.

HistoryEarly radio= Radio Broadcasting began in June 1923 during the British Raj with programs by the Bombay Presidency Radio Club and other radio clubs. According to an agreement on 23 July 1927, the private Indian Broadcasting Company Ltd (IBC) was authorized to operate two radio stations: the Bombay station which began on 23 July 1927, and the Calcutta station which followed on 26 August 1927. The company went into liquidation on 1 March 1930. The government took over the broadcasting facilities and began the Indian State Broadcasting Service (ISBS) on 1 April 1930 on an experimental basis for two years, and permanently in May 1932 it then went on to become All India Radio on 8 June 1936. When India attained independence, there were six radio stations within Indian territory, at Delhi, Bombay, Calcutta, Madras, Tiruchirapalli and Lucknow.FM broadcasting began on 23 July 1977 in Chennai, then Madras . Transmission Currently, analog terrestrial radio broadcast in India is carried out in Short Wave(SW) (6–22 MHz), Medium Wave(MW) (526–1606 KHz)and Frequency Modulation (FM) (88–108 MHz). All India Radio the public service broadcaster - has established 467 radio stations encompassing 662 radio transmitters, which include 140 MW, 48 SW, and 474 FM transmitters for providing radio broadcasting services in India. Private sector radio broadcasters transmit in FM mode only. Public radioAll India Radio= All India Radio(AIR), officially known since 1956 as 'Akashvani' is the national public radio broadcaster of India. It was established in 1936. All India Radio is the largest radio network in the world, and one of the largest broadcasting organizations in the world in terms of the number of languages broadcast and the spectrum of socio-economic and cultural diversity it serves. AIR’s home service comprises 420 stations located across the country, reaching nearly 92% of the country’s area and 99.19% of the total population. AIR originates programming in 23 languages and 179 dialects. Private radio Private participation wasn’t allowed until 1993 when the government experimented with a daily, two-hour slot on the FM channels in Delhi and Mumbai. In 2001 the first phase of private sector participation (FM Phase I) India’s radio sector began and the government conducted open auctions for a radio licenses. Of the 108 licenses issued, only 22 became operational in 12 cities . Radio City Bangalore, started on July 3, 2001, is India's first private FM radio station. The second development phase of radio privatization was in 2005(FM Phase II) with 338 FM slots up for auction. 245 frequencies were taken up in the auction and the government earned US$295 million in one-time entry fees. In 2019 the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (India) has sought Telecom Regulatory Authority of India's recommendation on reserve prices for auction of radio frequencies in 283 cities to expand private FM radio across the country. This includes 23 existing cities where the government has auctioned private FM radio frequencies in the previous batches, while 260 cities will see auction of private FM radio for the first time. In 2020 April TRAI had issued recommendations on reserve price for auction of FM radio channels under FM Phase III policy. The major private radio players in India are Entertainment Network India Limited which hosts Radio City, BIG FM 92.7, Music Broadcast Limited which hosts Radio Mirchi, D B Corp Ltd. which hosts My FM & Sun Network which hosts Red FM.Currently, there are 371 private FM stations operating across 107 cities in India. Out of these, 31 are operated by micro, small & medium enterprises (MSMEs). Community Radio Stations In December 2002, the Government of India approved policy for the grant of licenses for setting up of Community Radio Stations to well established educational institutions including IITs/IIMs.On 1 February 2004, Anna FM was launched as India’s first campus “community” radio station by the students of the Anna University. In 2006, the Government of India amended the community radio policy which allowed the agricultural universities, educational institutions and civil society institutions such as NGOs to apply for a community radio broadcasting license under the FM band 88–108 MHz. First NGO operated community Radio in India was Sangham Radio licensed to Deccan Development Society which started broadcasting on 2008 in Pastapur village, Medak district, Andhra Pradesh. Government of India announced in November 2019 that 118 new community radio stations are in the process of setting up. Currently India has 262 Community radio stations serving Farmer, Tribal, Coastal communities, ethnic minorities and special interests. Amateur Radio Stations The first amateur radio operator was licensed in 1921, and by the mid-1930s, there were around 20 amateur radio operators in India. Amateur radio operators played an important part in the Indian independence movement with the establishment of illegal pro-independence radio stations in the 1940s. India has around 16,000 licensed users of Amateur radio in India. Market Share In April 2020, as per a survey by AZ Research PPL, commissioned by the Association of Radio Operators for India (AORI) Radio listenership in India touched a peak of 51 million. =Advertising Revenue= According to a 2019 report by FICCI-EY, the radio industry grew 7.5% in 2018. It contributes 4.2% to the overall advertising revenues of the media and entertainment sector. Radio advertising revenue in India is estimated to almost double in the next five years, to ₹ 3,900 crore from ₹ 2,000 crore in 2015, rating agency CRISIL said in a report released on March 2020.

Parts of the structure date to 1130, though it was extensively renovated in 1892. It is unusual in having the main entrance door on the north side, with the southern entrance reserved for members of the Mosley family, local landowners and key donors to the church. The church features stained glass dating to the medieval period and more recent windows by Charles Eamer Kempe. The tower houses eight bells, one dating to 1586. The church is grade I listed and there are associated grade II listings for churchyard railings, a memorial, the lychgate and a former church grammar school. The lychgate, by Cecil Greenwood Hare, also functions as a war memorial. A Saxon cross in the churchyard was relocated from Tatenhill.  Description The church is the parish church of Rolleston on Dove, Staffordshire in the Diocese of Lichfield in the Church of England. It lies within the deanery of Tutbury and the archdeanery of Stoke-upon-Trent. By 2018 the vicar also covered Holy Trinity Church in Anslow and St Mary's Church, Tutbury. The church is grade I listed by Historic England and was first listed on 12 March 1964. The Mosley family, local landowners, were closely associated with the church. They had their own private entrance on the south of the building and had rights over seating and the erection of monuments in the south aisle. They retain the right of burial in the churchyard, which is otherwise full.  Structure  View from the north-east The church dates to the 12th and 13th centuries but underwent a major restoration in 1892 by the architect Sir Arthur Blomfield. The oldest surviving portion is the north entrance (unusual in a church, whose entrances are usually on the south), in Romanesque style and dating to 1130. It is constructed of ashlar sandstone and consists of a nave, chancel and tower with spire. There are aisles on the north and south sides of the structure. The nave, much of which is 13th century, is almost entirely enclosed by the aisles. There are two bays exposed on the south of the church, the one to the left of the aisle holds the 12th- century round-arched entrance doorway and the one to the right a pointed window with three lights. The single bay exposed on the north side of the church contains a window described as of unusual 17th-century construction with three treofil-topped lights and a criss-cross panel over. The nave is supported by buttresses, two stages in height. There is a three-light pointed window to the eastern end of the chancel and a cinquefoil-headed window on the north wall. The nave and chancel are roofed in red tiles. The north aisle was added in 1892 and consists of three bays, each with a two-light pointed window, with two-stage buttresses between. The easternmost bay is larger than the others and contains a priest's door. The south aisle, extended in 1892 by demolishing an external vestry, consists of four bays, again divided by two- stage buttresses. There is a pent-porched door at the south-western end, the Mosley entrance, dating to 1821. The aisles are both roofed in lead, behind stone parapets. The tower dates to the 14th century and sits at the western end of the nave. It is of three stages buttressed on the external corners to the full height. The tower is topped by a crenellated parapet, with gargoyles, and a stone-built spire added in 1892. The bell openings are pointed and have louvres. There is a window at the western side, on the lowest stage.  Interior  The chancel features stained glass by the Victorian designer Charles Eamer Kempe and a window in the south aisle contains medieval stained glass. The chancel roof is supported by scissor trusses, the nave roof is on collar and arch braces. There are two octagonal pulpits at the western end, one of fretted oak on a stone base and one 19th-century in date of stone with quatrefoil panelled sides. The font is also octagonal. The tower is behind a wooden screen. The interior was extensively remodelled in 1884 with new pews installed, recycling oak from the former seats; rendering and whitewash removed from the walls; the tower arch exposed and a gallery removed. The tower houses eight bells, including one dating to 1586, and an electrically- operated clock. An organ was provided by the Mosley family during the 1892 renovation. The church features a 1536 monument to Robert Sherborne, Bishop of Chicester. There are also monuments for Thomas Caldwell (died 1554), an unknown couple (c.1600), Sir Edward Mosley (died 1638) and a Wilman (1692). There are plaques for numerous members of the Mosley family including Sir Oswald Mosley, 4th Baronet (1915).  Churchyard  The Saxon cross The churchyard is surrounded by a sandstone curtilage wall. It was extensively remodelled in the 19th century with entrances stopped up, walls moved and rebuilt and new entrances formed. In 1897 Sir Oswald Mosley, 4th Baronet relocated a Saxon cross to the churchyard from the grounds of Rolleston Hall. The cross had formed part of the floor of the porch of the church in Tatenhill before it was removed by the Mosleys to their grounds. An iron fence was installed in 1900 to prevent cattle from gaining entrance and in 1923 Sir Oswald Mosley, 5th Baronet extended the churchyard with a grant of land. Floodlighting was installed in 1996 and a millennium yew planted in 2000. One of the memorials in the churchyard, to George Ridgway, and some of the railings, with a gate, were separately granted grade II listed building protection on 26 March 1986. The south-west of the churchyard included St. Mary's Grammar School until the churchyard was remodelled in 1837, with the boys' entrance moved to the southern side to save vandalism to the windows and gravestones. The school was first endowed by Bishop Sherbourne in 1520 and rebuilt by Sir Edward Mosley, 2nd Baronet in 1640. It closed as a school in 1909 when a council school was opened in the village and is now used by various village organisations. The former school was granted protection as a grade II listed building on 26 March 1986. The churchyard as a whole is listed as a scheduled monument. The lychgate at the northern entrance to the churchyard doubles as a war memorial and was erected by public subscription and a donation from the Mosley family in 1919. Designed by Cecil Greenwood Hare and built in Lichfield the structure contains a bronze crucifix and lists of those villagers killed during the two world wars. The pierced side panels were replaced with new versions, in oak, in the 2000s. The lychgate was granted protection as a grade II listed building on 26 March 1986.

Initially a monk in the Tendai school, he later joined Dōgen at his first monastery, Kōshōhōrin-ji. He would go on to become Dōgen's attendant (jisha) there, and he later compiled the first and ninth volumes of Dōgen's collected works known as Eihei Kōroku. He is one of a small number of students believed to have received dharma transmission from Dōgen, along with Koun Ejō and Sōkai. According to legend, Dōgen even gave Senne the kāṣāya, or dharma robe, of Furong Daokai, a famous 11th century Chinese Zen master, which had in turn been allegedly given to Dōgen by his teacher Tiantong Rujing. After Dōgen's death, Senne returned to Kyoto and founded his own temple called Yōkō-ji. It was located near Kennin-ji, the temple where Dōgen first practiced Zen and was later cremated, but Yōkō-ji no longer exists and its precise location is unknown. A record from around 1340 suggests the temple was already in decline by that time. Senne's student Kyōgō (経豪), who had also studied under Dōgen, became the second abbot of Yōkō-ji. Kyōgō compiled two commentaries on the 75-fascicle version of Dōgen's Shōbōgenzō, the first of which is called Shōbōgenzō shō (正法眼蔵抄) and the second Shōbōgenzō gokikigaki (正法眼蔵御聴書). Collectively, they are called Gokikikgakishō (御聴書抄), which is usually abbreviated as Goshō (御抄). Senne is believed to be the author of the Shōbōgenzō gokikigaki due to the use of the honorific modifier go (御), which would not normally be used to refer to one's own writing. The Gokikigaki contains a date of 1263, suggesting Senne may have completed it around that time. Kyōgō began his Shōbōgenzō shō in 1303 and completed it in 1308, likely suggesting that Senne had already died by this time. The oldest manuscript of the Goshō also contains a commentary on the Brahma Net Sutra dated 1309 but the explanations are attributed to Kyōgō's \\"former teacher,\\" which could refer to Senne, but likely refers to Dōgen due to extensive quotation of him in the commentary. Although Senne and Kyōgō's commentaries were not widely read during their lifetimes, they played a decisive role in defining the modern orthodoxy of modern Sōtō Zen doctrine. Starting in the Tokugawa era in Japan, resurgent interest in the Shōbōgenzō and Dōgen's thought led scholars to Senne and Kyōgō's Goshō in order to make sense of Dōgen's difficult writing. The reliance of Tokugawa scholars on the Goshō for understanding Dōgen has meant that current understandings of the Shōbōgenzō and other aspects of Dōgen's approach to Zen have been heavily mediated through the writing of Senne and Kyōgō.

In 1924 he represented New Zealand in the 3rd test in Dunedin against the touring England and became Kiwi number 163 in the progress. Early Life Lyall Douglas Stewart was born on July 10, 1900 in Auckland, New Zealand. His parents were William Stewart and Sarah Ann Stewart. He was the youngest of 7 children and had 4 brothers and 2 sisters; Robert William Wilson (1887), Henry Charles Stewart (1889), Luke Erroll Stewart (1891), Sarah May Elvin Stewart (1893), Mary Jane Stewart (1896), and David Arthur Stewart (1898). His birth registration shows his first name as in fact spelt “Lyell” as it also was on his death certificate. However on his marriage registration he spelt it “Lyall”. He also named one of his younger children Lyall, and it was spelt this way in newspaper articles on the rare occasion where his full name was used while he was alive. Playing careerCambridge and Hamilton= Lyall Stewart began playing rugby league at the senior level in 1921 for the Power Board team in Cambridge. He was aged 20 at the time, turning 21 mid-season. His first match was against the City Rovers club team also from Cambridge on April 16 with his side losing 6-3. Two weeks later Stewart played for the Cambridge sub union representative team against the touring Ponsonby United side which featured a young Frank Delgrosso. Stewart scored a try in a 9-3 win. With rugby league in its infancy in the Cambridge area Stewart played for the Power Board side and representative teams interchangeably throughout the year. By the season end he had played 6 matches for Power Board, 4 for Cambridge, 3 for a combined Cambridge-Hamilton team, 3 for the South Auckland representative team and 1 for Hamilton Athletics at the season end in the Hamilton knockout competition. The first match for South Auckland was against Hawke's Bay on August 10 and saw his side win easily by 35 points to 3 with Stewart scoring a try after some lead up play by Huatahi Paki. Five days later Stewart scored a try for Cambridge against the touring City Rovers team from Auckland at Victoria Square in Cambridge. His Cambridge team won 16-14 over a City side which featured George Paki, Maurice Wetherill, and Tim Peckham. The following weekend Stewart played for South Auckland against Auckland at Claudeland Showgrounds in Hamilton and in front of 2,500 spectators South Auckland ran out 13-3 victors. In the August 31 edition of the Waikato Times it was said of Stewart that he “is a tricky player who will reach big football. He has a nice side-step, and should be played inside five-eighth. [But] he has the failing of passing too soon when on attack. Stewart then played in a win for Cambridge over Hamilton 18-16 where he scored another try “as a result of smart following up and good judgment”. Stewarts last representative match of the season came in his first appearance on Carlaw Park. On September 17 South Auckland played Auckland and were defeated 35-13 in front of 5,500 spectators. Stewart scored South Auckland’s first try after picking up a loose ball and cutting through scoring by the posts. His final match of the season was on September 24 in his first appearance for Hamilton Athletics, a club side he would not appear for again until 1923. In October, 1921 a special meeting was held in Cambridge by the Cambridge Rugby League. The meeting was to select the player who had shown the most improved form during the season. Lyall Stewart was nominated along with R. Pau, C. McMillan, Kidd, and J Hemmingway. After voting had taken place Stewart was announced as the winner and was presented with a gold football badge which had been given to the union by Ernie Asher of the Auckland Rugby League who had recently visited with the City Rovers side. In 1922 Stewart turned out for the newly formed Cambridge Athletics side in the Cambridge competition which featured 4 teams (Cambridge Athletics, Matangi, City Rovers, and Suburbs). He was then granted a transfer to go to the Newton Rangers club in Auckland. This move turned out to be brief as he only played 3 matches for Newton. These included a 15-5 loss to Marist Old Boys, a 32-8 win over Richmond Rovers, and a 19-13 loss to City Rovers. These matches would have been a significant step up in quality for Stewart. Although there were many talented players in the Waikato competitions the Auckland Rugby League was reasonably well established by 1922 and the City side featured George Davidson, Ben Davidson (who would go on to play for Wigan), Bill Davidson, Maurice Wetherill, Alf Townsend, George Paki, and Bert Laing, while Stewart was playing alongside Clarrie Polson, Wally Somers, Bill Williams and Lou Brown (who would go on to play over 300 games professionally in England). On July 3 Stewart then transferred back to Cambridge where he re-joined his Cambridge Athletics team. He played 2 matches for them and 4 matches for Cambridge with at least two of them as captain. The first was in a 21-12 loss against Hamilton where he scored a try and kicked a conversion and a penalty. Stewart then led his side to Auckland where he scored a try and kicked a conversion though this would have been overshadowed by the 73-29 score line in favour of Auckland. The home side running in a remarkable 17 tries. Stewart then played in a trial match for Cambridge before representing them twice more in losses to Lower Waikato and Auckland B, by 36 to 8 and 22 to 8 respectively. Cambridge and Hamilton then fielded a combined side against Hawke's Bay though Stewart was again on the losing side in a 17-3 defeat. He was selected days later to play for South Auckland against the same Hawke's Bay side and this time he was on the winners team, playing five eighth in a 17-15 victory. At this point in the season disappointment was expressed at Stewart's non selection in the South Auckland side to play Auckland from Cambridge rugby league quarters. It was said that “Stewart is a cool, collected player, possessing much initiative and ability to demonstrate same. Many times on Saturday he placed the locals on attack from defence. Although given fewer opportunities his play was ahead of Wilson Hall… apart from that it is distinctly disappointing to the Cambridge League and the selectors will find that it is a mistake”. Nonetheless the South Auckland team won on Carlaw Park 21-20. Stewart did gain selection for South Auckland on September 30 when they played Auckland at Steele Park in Hamilton and they ran out 26-18 winners. He then wrapped up his 1922 season with a 20-9 win for South Auckland over Waihi in Waihi. In 1923 Stewart joined the Hamilton Athletic club which played in the Hamilton league. He played 6 matches for them before playing for the Hamilton representative side against the Marist Old Boys, a team he was to play for the following year. They won the match 23-13 though Stewart took a knock to the head which saw one observer state that “for a long period in the first session he was quite dazed”. Over the following 2 months he played 4 matches for Hamilton Athletics and 2 for the Hamilton representative side against Cambridge and Taumarunui which were won 32 to 11, and 43 to 7 respectively. Stewart scored a try and kicked a goal in the match against his old Cambridge side on Victoria Square in Cambridge, and a try against Taumarunui at Hinemoa Park, Hamilton. The match with Taumarunui was a defence of the Endean Shield which Hamilton had won off Lower Waikato two weeks prior. On August 18 South Auckland played Wellington with Stewart in the five eighth position alongside F. Jackson, with Tim Peckham at halfback. South Auckland won by 27 points to 11.. Stewart then wore the red and white of Cambridge against Hamilton in a 13-9 loss, and the following week switched sides, playing in the black and white jersey of Hamilton in a 27-20 win over Lower Waikato. He then played for a combined Cambridge-Hamilton team against Lower Waikato and he scored twice in a 31-25 victory at Victoria Square in Cambridge. Stewart’s next match was for South Auckland against Auckland at Steele Park. The match was for the Northern Union Challenge Cup which South Auckland held. Stewart score a first half try in a 20-20 draw which meant his side retained the trophy. He followed this up with an appearance for the Auckland Provincial team against Auckland at Carlaw Park. He continued his try scoring run with a 3-pointer in a heavy 44-15 loss to the Auckland ‘city’ team before a crowd of 7,000. He finished the season playing for South Auckland against Auckland again. He scored his 6th try in as many matches, however his team were well beaten in front of 6,000 spectators at Carlaw Park by 35 to 11. =Move to Auckland and New Zealand Test Appearance= In 1924 Stewart was to move to Auckland to play rugby league for a more lengthy period than the 3 games he stayed for in 1922. After two matches for Hamilton Athletic against the Frankton Albions, and United teams, Stewart transferred to Marist Old Boys in the Auckland Rugby League competition. He had applied for a transfer on May 6 but it was not granted by the Hamilton Rugby League and was instead referred to the South Auckland Rugby League. The matter was discussed at length at the South Auckland Rugby League monthly meeting and it was eventually decided to grant him a transfer. The league was not particularly keen on allowing the move however and wrote a “strongly-worded protest against the apparent recruiting in the country districts by Auckland clubs, also intimating that this League would not grant transfers of players under its jurisdiction, unless good reason be shown. The delegates of from the League to the New Zealand Council were instructed to bring the matter very strongly before the members of the Council”. After the transfer was granted Stewart made his debut for Marist in a round 5 match against Richmond Rovers in the five eighth position. He played a match against Athletic before being selected for an Auckland Probables side to play against the Auckland Possibles. With the tour of the England side approaching efforts were underway to choose the best players in the country to face them. Stewart was to partner Wilson Hall in the five eighths positions against Peebles and Hector Cole in the Possibles side. Stewart’s side lost 9 to 14. After more club matches Stewart was then selected for the Auckland B team to play Hamilton on July 16. Auckland B won the match 28-18 with Wilson Hall breaking his collar-bone. On July 28 Auckland played the English side and after the match the New Zealand squad was selected to go into training for the first test with England. Stewart was named in the squad though despite Wilson Hall being out injured there were still many five eighths and halves named in the squad. Charles Fitzgerald and Maurice Wetherill were named in the five eighth positions in the first test which New Zealand won 16 to 8 however Wetherill was unable to travel to Wellington for the second test. In addition to this halfback Thomas McClymont was injured in the first test and so Stewart was pulled into the side to travel south. Despite the unavailability of at least 3 potential halves Clarrie Polson and Frank Delgrosso were selected ahead of Stewart for the second test which New Zealand won 13-11. Stewart’s opportunity came in the 3rd test where he was selected in the second five eighth position with Frank Delgrosso on his inside and Hec Brisbane his outside. The match was played at Tahuna Park, Dunedin and saw a crowd of 12,000 in attendance. Opposite him stood Sid Rix in the England side. It was an inauspicious debut for Stewart with New Zealand going down to the brilliant back play of the English side by 31 points to 18. He was described as “being the weak link in the chain, and in consequence of this the New Zealand three-quarters were starved”. Stewart was to finish the season by playing in 9 further matches for his Marist Old Boys club side. On September 27 he played in the championship final against Devonport United in front of an enormous crowd of 17,000. His side were victorious by 20 points to 17 and won their first ever title in the process. =Hiatus, Return for Devonport United, and Retirement= In 1925 Stewart appears to have not played at all before a return to the game in the jersey of Devonport United. He played 13 matches for them and for the only time in his career did not play in any representative matches. At the end of the season it appears that Stewart retired from rugby league and he moved to the Opotiki area in the Bay of Plenty where league was not played. Personal Life He married Moyra (Moira) Clare Kelly on August 22, 1928. Moyra was born in Opotiki, Bay of Plenty in 1905. Together they had 6 children. Moyra died on December 23, 1954 aged 49. In the Otago Daily Times of 25 February, 1931 it was reported that at about midnight Stewart's one year old child was bitten by a rat with the bite going through the baby’s left hand and “caused considerable bleeding”. The only other mentions beyond this time of Stewart and his family were of his children’s efforts at school in the Opotiki area and an accident Stewart suffered with an axe whilst cutting wood in 1933. He cut his foot and required several stitches. Lyall Stewart passed away on July 7, 1968 three days short of his 68th birthday in Opotiki, Bay of Plenty.
