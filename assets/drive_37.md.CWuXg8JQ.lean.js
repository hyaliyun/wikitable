Education Wiseman graduated from Elam School of Art in Auckland with a Preliminary Diploma in 1959. In 1963 she graduated from Goldsmiths School of Art in London with a National Diploma in design, gaining an Art Specialist Teachers Diploma the following year. Career Wiseman has been working as a professional ceramicist since the mid 1970s. She became interested in working with clay while on a working holiday at a small pottery in Ireland; she returned to New Zealand and built a wood-fired kiln near Albany in 1976. She recalls > I was a complete novice but with constant reference to A Potter's Book and > persistent telephone calls to generous long-suffering established potters > such as Ian Smail, Warren Tippett and many others, I started potting. In 1988 she contributed the following statement to Profiles: 24 New Zealand Potters: > I have been involved with clay for about ten years, spending the first few > years learning to throw, discover suitable glazes, and to fire my wood kiln. > Gradually I became more and more interested in hand-building, playing around > with forms which I could not throw in the wheel. It has been a slow process, > teaching myself new techniques only because that was the way to solve > problems and give form to the concept – a very satisfying way of learning > about clay.

Changes and developments in my work have become gradual, > new ideas forming while I am working with clay rather than from some > intellectual exercise outside the work Wiseman's early work reflected the contemporaneous interest Japanese ceramics spread in New Zealand by influential English figures including Bernard Leach, but she quickly came to develop her own style. Her mature work is characterised by curvaceous and sensuous shapes, influenced by forms found in nature, and colours she creates through mixing glazes to match her needs.

This was part of a plan by Charles Morgan, 1st Baron Tredegar to increase Newport's importance and develop his land; in 1807 he had granted a lease on 200 acres of land to allow the Tredegar Wharf Company to create the new mile-long road. The new road led approximately south-southeast from the junction with High Street (and Westgate Hotel), linking the town centre with Pillgwenlly and the early Newport Docks.

The site occupies four and a half acres comprising the old Georgian works and offices of the Mander family firm, founded in 1773, as well as the site of the former Queens Arcade (promoted privately by Charles Tertius Mander), which had stood on the site since 1902. When the main part of the Mander Centre opened in 1968, the Central Arcade retained its Edwardian architecture and was refurbished as the main entrance to the Mander Centre from Dudley Street. In May 1974 the Central Arcade was destroyed by a severe fire that reduced it to rubble, which was declared unsafe and was subsequently demolished. The area was later rebuilt as the entrance to the centre.http://www.historywebsite.co.uk/lost/centralarcade.htm Recent history =1987 to 2016= The centre was refurbished in 1987, when it was described as \\"a covered pedestrianised shopping complex at the centre of the principal shopping area of Wolverhampton\\" with more than 150 shops. In 2003 the centre embarked on a further multi-million pound refurbishment programme. It was an opportunity to complete the enclosure of the centre to make it fully climate controlled. The marble floor in the entire centre was replaced along with the relocation of the escalators and stairways. The biggest change was the creation of the large New Look store which took over numerous stores. In 2010 the Mander Centre was acquired by Delancey Estates and Royal Bank of Scotland from Manders Holdings Plc and its successor companies. In the spring of 2014 this led to heated national controversy when they proceeded to remove a landmark bronze sculpture, Rock Form (Porthcurno),Rock Form, Porthcurno by Barbara Hepworth, specially commissioned for the site and donated by the Mander family and shareholders in 1968. Its sudden disappearance led to questions in Parliament in September 2014. Paul Uppal, Member of Parliament for Wolverhampton South West said: \\"When the Rock Form was donated by the Mander family, it was done so in the belief it would be enjoyed and cherished by the people of Wolverhampton for generations… It belongs to, and should be enjoyed by, the City of Wolverhampton.\\" In 2011 Delancey announced that they would invest £25 million in the Mander Centre, completing a major refurbishment and reconfiguration of the centre and creating a new 90,000 sq ft department store. On 4 December it was announced that the Mander Centre had been acquired by Benson Elliot Capital Management for £59 million, and that the £35 million investment was still going ahead.

As part of the investment the centre was slated to be completely refurbished and configured, and a series of new larger stores will be created, forcing some stores to close down and relocate within the centre. WH Smith and Tesco were to be closed, and Superdrug relocated. The reconfiguration was also to include new escalators and lifts, the removal of the Lower Central Arcade and the relocation of the toilets. The biggest change would be the demolition of the old TJ Hughes store and Tesco to make way for the new 93,000 sq ft Debenhams Store over three floors, the opening of which would confirm the completion of the redevelopment in the autumn of 2017.https://www.expressandstar.com/news/2016/01/27/35m-mander-centre-revamp- gets-underway/ It was announced that Debenhams would open in the Mander Centre on 12 October, signalling the end of the two-year refurbishment and reconfiguration.

Guatemala's ethnic composition is mostly made up of immigrants from Europe and a few are Asian and African slaves. Currently, the composition of Guatemala consists mostly of mestizos, Amerindians and Europeans, and to a lesser extent, Garifuna. In recent decades, immigration to Guatemala has led to an increase in desire for more businesses and tourist attractions, after there had been a considerable drop from 1950 to 1980. From the Americas This can refer to immigrants and residents of neighboring countries, or of the same continent. There are communities from Argentina, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama and Canada, to a lesser extent. =Salvadorans= Salvadorans in Guatemala refers to one of many recent Salvadoran diaspora when residents of the Central American country migrate to the exterior. Due to the Salvadoran civil war in the 1980s many refugees were forced to leave the country. The majority received support in Guatemala, although the country also had his political problems, the capital was not being affected and other urban areas, where Salvadorans prefer to emigrate. By the 1980s, Central America began to manifest international migration within the region. By 1981, there were about 16,805 Salvadorans in Guatemala. Although for 1990 after the war, the number decreased, but in 2000 went back to manifest a new emigration that every time is growing. =Americans= Americans have come as immigrants since the 1940s. During the revolutionary period, the United Fruit Company overthrew President Jacobo Arbenz, and throughout the 1950s, the company controlled 80% of the banana business in Guatemala, as well as in other countries in Central America.Historia de Guatemala--Jacobo Arbenz Retrieved 4 December 2014. Since the 1990s, Guatemala has had a notable growth of Americans in the country, some of which whom work in the tourism industry.InterNationsAmericans in Guatemala - American expats in Guatemala Retrieved 4 December 2014. =Mexicans= Guatemala has the fourth-highest number of Mexicans living outside of Mexico. The Mexican community has been primarily established in Guatemala City, Huehuetenango, Antigua Guatemala and Guatemalan border towns. Mexicans are the fourth-largest foreign community in the country, after the Germans, Koreans and Salvadorans. In the 1990s, major Mexican business groups such as Grupo Bimbo, Gruma, Elektra, Banco Azteca, Soriana, Jumex, The Coca- Cola Company, Aeromexico and others moved or expanded operations, and found a growing market in Guatemala. As a result, many Mexicans living in Guatemala's large cities today have a high purchasing power.Empresas mexicanas en Guatemala Capital mexicano en la la Región Countless numbers of indigenous Mexicans in Chiapas, Campeche and Tabasco share familial bonds with some indigenous Guatemalans. The civil war during the 70s and 80s created a mass exodus to North American countries. The migration of Mexican peoples between the fifth and thirteenth centuries established the common languages through the western and central Mesoamerica - as far south as Veracruz, Chiapas, the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, penetrating the Maya territory of Guatemala, Cuscatlan, El Salvador and Ometepe, Nicaragua. These countries have a common culture stretching back from the Hispanic period. Guatemala was part of the First Mexican Empire. =Costa Ricans= Costa Ricans are a small but growing group of immigrants from the Americas.

From Europe This can refer to immigrants and residents of European countries. There are communities from England, Russia, Poland, Ireland and Portugal to a lesser extent. =Germans= Coffee plantation estates built by the Germans Immigration began with Rodolfo Dieseldorff in 1863. When he spoke highly of it, other Germans followed his example. The country was promoted by the liberal government of Justo Rufino Barrios (1873-1885), who invited to foreigners to come live in Guatemala. They showed a preference for the Germans, who made the move motivated by the fertile land fit for coffee cultivation. Regina Wagner, in her book The Germans in Guatemala, 1828-1944, said that what attracted the Germans to Verapaz was its \\"natural insulation, mild climate and fertile land, and the possibilities of agricultural and commercial development.\\" By the end of 1890, two thirds of coffee production in that department was in the hands of Germans. By 1888, the Germans had formed their own world in Alta Verapaz, and a German Club was founded in Cobán, as well as a German school in 1930. In Cobán, the Germans came to monopolize trade in wholesale stores, and their coffee farms were dispersed in almost every region of Alta Verapaz. Due to this, German immigration expanded to other places such as San Juan Chamelco, Carlos V, etc. The Germans also worked to improved transportation. Younger Germans began mixing with indigenous Q'eqchi' women, which caused a gradual whitening of the population in that department.Julieta Sandoval Deutschland en la Verapaz Revista D, Guatemala 24 June 2005. Retrieved 4 December 2014. By 1940, 8,000 Germans, or three quarters of Germans in Central America were in Guatemala. This growth of Germans in Guatemala also led to fascism and Nazism in Guatemala. In the mid-1930s, all Germans living in Guatemala were Nazis; all fincas of German had the Nazi flag, and all German finqueros were involved in local meetings organized by the Nazis. however, this claim is unfounded, as it is only anecdotal, and not all of German descent were in effect also Nazi. Guatemala continues to be the country which houses the largest German colony in Central America.

That was how they left the Port of Antwerp on March 16, 1843 bound for Izabal, Guatemala. They embarked on the schooners of Theodore, Marie Louise and Ville de Bruxelles, which were established in the port of Santo Tomas de Castilla, May 20, 7 and 8 June of that year. Later to Santo Tomas de Castilla, on March 5, 1844 arrived the vessel Jean van Eycke, with 190 settlers, including settlers as Laurence Bhaten Korsz, Modeste Vanderhaegen, Theodore Vandestadt and others more. On March 22, 1844, also arrived the vessel named Emma, in which settlers came Aerens Pierre and his wife, and other settlers such as the Guise family, the Wirtz, Esmenhaud and others.These settlers apart from creating infrastructure in the region, and make families and descendants.

The early European immigrants from Guatemala were Spaniards, and were soldiers from Andalucia, Extremadura and La Mancha, sent by Hernán Cortés to colonize Central America. who they conquered the indigenous Mayan population in 1524 and ruled for almost 300 years. By 1525 Don Pedro de Alvarado was named conqueror of Guatemala, as well as of Honduras and El Salvador. The Captaincy General of Guatemala was the primary province where the Spanish elite of Central America was. Approximately nearly 60% of Guatemala's population is descended from Spaniards, whether they are mixed or direct descendants. By the 1950s, the cultural center of Spain in Guatemala was founded and it is in Zone 4 of the capital. And since 1999 the Training Centre of the Spanish Cooperation in Antigua Guatemala has a Library and Documentation Centre specializes in Social Science and Development Cooperation in Antigua Guatemala. =French= The first French immigrants were politicians such as Nicolas Raoul, Isidore Saget, Henri Terralonge and officers Aluard, Courbal, Duplessis, Gibourdel and Goudot. Immigration was mainly driven due to the struggles of the independence in South America, where they acted French to such independence, later some French politics moved to Guatemala City, where struggles existed between liberals and conservatives. Later, when the Central American Federation was divided in the five countries of the isthmus, some of them went to establish Costa Rica, others to Nicaragua, although the majority still remained in Guatemala. Relationships also started in 1827, where the French began to arrive as politicians, scientists, painters, builders, singers, along with some families. Later a conservative government annihilated nearly all of relations between France and Guatemala, and most of French immigrants went to Costa Rica, but these relationships were to return again later in the nineteenth century.Asociación para el Fomento de los Estudios Históricos en Centroamérica (AFEHC) Relaciones entre Francia y Guatemala (1823-1954) Guatemala, 2007.

He was greatly interested in bringing Italian families to the country, including: Bocaletti, Garzaro, Bonnato, Maselli, Comparini and others, who devoted themselves mainly to agriculture. The second wave of Italian immigration was developed during the government of José María Reyna Barrios, between 1892 and 1898, during this period came mostly Italian architects and painters who with their help, modernized the country with infrastructure and new streets such as Avenida de la Reforma. The third period was during the government of Manuel Estrada Cabrera, between 1898 and 1920, during this time immigration was less than two times before.

The first Korean immigrants came to the country around 1985, two decades after massive migration to Hispanic America. Koreans in Guatemala are involved in processing activities, such as clothing factories which export to the United States, and other businesses such as restaurants, supermarkets, beauty salons, butcher shops, travel agencies and bakeries. In 1997, there were 2,000 Koreans. That number has been increasing. According to Youl Yoo Dong, president of the Association of Koreans in Guatemala, between 6,000-7,000 Koreans live in Guatemala. 90% live in the capital city.Plaza Publica Corea en Guatemala Retrieved 4 December 2014.

Guatemala was not a route favorable to the Jews, and the governor try to limit their arrival. In 1932, the governor ordered the expulsion of all Jewish traders in the nation. Even after World War II, Guatemala had a large Jewish influx, from Greece, Turkey and Poland. Most Jews live in the city of Guatemala, with the rest in Quetzaltenango and San Marcos. As of 2012, 900 Jews were living in Guatemala.Jewish Virtual Library Jacqueline Shields The virtual Jewish World-- Guatemala Archived Retrieved 4 December 2014. =Japanese= The Japanese are another Asian community in Guatemala that resides mostly in Guatemala City since the 1980s, and have taken part in economic development in the country. In October 2014, the Japanese princes Akishino and Kiko came to visit Guatemala with their main objective to strengthen ties between Guatemala and Japan.Príncipes Akishino visitan Guatemala para fortalecer lazos El Periodico Retrieved 4 December 2014. From Africa In Guatemala, Africans came as slaves in Spanish vessels during the seventeenth century, who replaced the forced labor of the indigenous. Later these slaves mixed with the indigenous women in the Caribbean region of Izabal, causing another type of mestizaje called Zambo, but in Guatemala they are called the Garifuna. After the English pirates took control in the island of St Vincent and Livingstone, Spain did not let allow passage of other Europeans to Puerto Barrios. Santo Tomás was the only predominantly mestizo region of the Caribbean coast. Africans later arrived from the former French African colony of Santo Domingo to Izabal, although later the French move most of them to Trujillo, Honduras.Africanos en Guatemala Retrieved 4 December 2014.

It is located in thevillage of Fjell on the island of Sotra. It is one of the three churches for the Fjell parish which is part of the Vesthordland prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Bjørgvin. The white, wooden church was built in a long church style in 1874 using designs by the architect Conrad Fredrik von der Lippe. The church seats about 700 people. History The first church at Fjell was in existence in the Middle Ages. It was likely a stave church that may have been built in the 13th century. In the 1600s (before 1686), that church was torn down and replaced with a new wooden church. In 1725, the church was sold into private ownership. The new owner was Abraham Wessel from Bergen. It changed hands over the years and in 1869, the church was sold back to the parish by the Krohn family. Shortly thereafter, in 1871, the parish decided that the present church was too small and it needed to replace that church. In 1874, a new church was built about to the north of the old church. Shortly afterwards, the old church was torn down and turned into a cemetery area. The new church was designed by the architect Conrad Fredrik von der Lippe.

For 12 years, Said evaded arrest for the January 1, 2008, fatal shootings of his two daughters, Amina (18), and Sarah (17). Their bodies were found in his abandoned taxi cab in Irving, Texas, on the property of the Omni Mandalay Hotel (now the Omni Las Colinas Hotel). Said disappeared after the killings and remained a fugitive from law enforcement for 12 years, with six of those years being on the FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives List for the fatal shootings. It is widely believed that Said killed his daughters as an honor killing. Said, who was very controlling over his family, felt that his daughters Amina and Sarah dishonored the family by refusing to adhere to his perceived standards of Islam and traditional Egyptian cultural behavior. On January 1, 2008, he lured them into his taxi cab on the pretense of taking them out to eat, where it is alleged he fatally shot them. Said was captured on August 26, 2020, without incident in the town of Justin, Texas. His son, Islam, and his brother, Yassein, were arrested in Euless, Texas for aiding a fugitive. The FBI said Said is in federal custody and will soon be transferred to Dallas County. The Northern District of Texas will be the jurisdiction in which Said will be tried for \\"Unlawful Flight to Avoid Prosecution.\\" Background and family Said was born in Sinai, Egypt. He came to the U.S. on a student visa in 1983. Said married Patricia \\"Tissie\\" Owens in February 1987 when he was 30 and she was 15. Patricia later alleged that Said abused her during their marriage. Amina was born in 1989, and Sarah was born in 1990. The couple also had a son named Islam Said born in 1988, and Said also had a previous daughter, born in 1987, with another woman. Said later became a permanent resident, eventually gaining citizenship in 1997. Abuse of Amina and Sarah The girls told family and friends that their father had physically and sexually abused them. Sarah wrote \\"he treats me like a whore\\" in an instant message conversation to a friend. On several occasions, Amina appeared at school with bruises, and had a split lip as well at one point. Amina told her friends that the wounds were inflicted by her father, and her mother did not allow her to seek medical attention. Amina told authorities she had been penetrated at least once. Said would often spy on his daughters by video or audio-taping them without their knowledge. Amina stated she was afraid of using the public telephone \\"because he [Said] gets in everywhere, he knows everything\\". She also wrote in emails that her father intended to kill her. When she was 16, Said took Amina to Egypt, allegedly to arrange a marriage for her to a much older friend of his, but Amina rejected the marriage. Sarah got an after-school job working in a convenience store. Said began video-taping her at work and punished her for smiling too much at the customers. Amina began dating a boy named Joseph Moreno whom she met while taking Taekwondo classes. When Said was out of the country, she felt anxious about meeting Moreno, imagining that Said would be watching her with binoculars. Amina told Moreno not to call or text her if she sent a codeword to him because she was afraid that her father would go through her phone. Eventually, Said found a note that she had written to Moreno. Amina told him that these notes were to an imaginary boyfriend. Said, not trusting Amina, continued his search in order to uncover Amina's relationship. Said moved his family to a new house in Lewisville, Texas, prompting Amina to make plans to run away with Moreno, get married in Las Vegas, and start a new life. Moreno then dropped out of high school in order to earn money, so that he could save up enough money in order to help her leave. Moreno also stated: \\"[Said] regularly threatened to kill Amina, and she knew he meant it.\\" Amina was worried that Moreno would be killed by her father, and she refused to give her father his name while she was beaten, following Said's persistent accusations. Murders of Amina and Sarah After Christmas in 2007, Amina and Sarah ran away with their mother Patricia to Tulsa, Oklahoma, where Amina's boyfriend had relatives. Patricia allegedly told her daughters that December 31 was her mother's death anniversary and that she wanted to drive to East Texas to put flowers on her grave, later telling them they would return to Said. Sarah reluctantly went, while Amina refused. Patricia drove to Amina's friend's house and pounded on the door, starting an argument with Amina to try and convince her to return to Said. Amina still refused to go. Patricia insisted and stood unmoved in the doorway, saying that her father had forgiven her and would like the girls to return home. On January 1, 2008, Yaser Said took Amina and Sarah to his taxi cab, kissed them, and told them he was taking them out to eat. Patricia initially wanted to come along, but Said told her that he wanted to talk to the girls himself. He drove them both to Irving, where he allegedly shot both girls to death in the taxi cab. Amina died instantly, while Sarah managed to call 911 before she died, screaming \\"Help, my dad shot me! I'm dying, I'm dying!\\" Said's taxi was soon discovered by another cab driver outside the service entrance of the Omni Mandalay Hotel (now the Omni Las Colinas Hotel). Aftermath After the murders, Said disappeared and although it was first assumed he flew to Egypt, no such record was ever found. Owens filed for divorce in 2009. Said evaded capture by law enforcement for 12 years and spent six years on the FBI's top 10 Most Wanted list. Alleged sightings of Said driving a taxi in New York City and in Newark, New Jersey prompted the FBI to issue a statement suggesting as much. On December 4, 2014, Said was added to the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list with a $100,000 reward for any information leading to his arrest. Capture A break in the case came on August 14, 2017, when a maintenance worker at an apartment complex owned by Yaser's son, Islam Said, reported seeing a man matching Yaser's description inside of Islam's apartment. When detectives showed him a picture of Yaser Said, the worker identified him as the man he had seen in the apartment. A search warrant was executed on the apartment, which was empty at the time. On August 17, 2020, police began 24-hour surveillance on a home in Justin, Texas purchased under the name Dalal Said, the daughter of Yaser's brother Yassein. They observed Islam and Yassein entering and exiting the home and the shadow of another man inside the home after the two men had left. On the afternoon of Wednesday, August 26, 2020, S.W.A.T. agents of the FBI's Dallas Field Office captured Yaser, age 63, in Justin. On the same day in nearby Euless, Texas, the FBI also arrested Islam, age 32, and Yassein Abdulfatah Said, age 59. Said's son and brother are both charged with concealing a person from arrest. If convicted, both could face up to five years in prison. Authorities suspect that other people helped Said evade arrest over the years, and a federal criminal complaint says Islam Said was in contact with two more of his father’s brothers.

The project was commissioned by James Stewart as a residence incorporating a performance space, and was designed by Brigitte Shim and Howard Sutcliffe of the Toronto architectural firm Shim-Sutcliffe Architects. The name of the house is derived from the mathematical integral symbol, commonly used in calculus; Stewart's wealth derived from his authorship of widely used calculus textbooks. It has won several architectural awards, including a 2012 Governor-General's Medal in Architecture. Glenn D. Lowry, director of the Museum of Modern Art, said of Integral House, \\"I think it's one of the most important private houses built in North America in a long time.\\" The house went on sale in the autumn of 2015. The house was sold in 2016 by Sotheby's to a high profile musical couple. It had been rumoured the couple was Chantal Kreviazuk and Raine Maida but it was not them. Kreviazuk's music video for Into Me was filmed in the house and released in January 2016. Commissioning of the design and building process In the late 1990s, James Stewart first conceived of creating a house whose design included both curves and a large and flexible performing space. After drawing up a list of architects he admired, he granted the commission to Brigitte Shim and Howard Sutcliffe of Shim-Sutcliffe Architects in 1999, and they began work on the design. In 2002, Stewart purchased the property where Integral House now stands, and then demolished the original house. Design work continued, and building began in 2003, with the project being completed in 2009. Even before the construction was complete, Architectural Digest magazine included the house in its annual Toronto tour. The final cost of the house was estimated at $24 million.  Architecture  Integral House Toronto Integral House is a house built into a hillside. The three lower stories are built into the ravine, below street level; only the two uppermost stories are visible from the street. The rear exterior is glass and oak. The design incorporates environmentally friendly features, including geothermal heating and cooling and planted roofs. The lowest level is a pool area with an outdoor patio separated from the house by a wall of glass that can be lowered into the floor at the press of a button. The study, located on the second level, overlooks the ravine, with a view of the roof garden over the level below. The large performance space is located on the third level. The second floor, which is at street level, includes the kitchen as well as dining and living room areas that overlook the performance space below and are used as balconies during performances. The upper level contains the master bedroom, as well as guest bedrooms and a guest suite.  As a performance space  In addition to the private performances that Stewart has hosted, he also made the performance space available to selected arts and cultural groups for fundraising events. While Stewart was resident in the house, he hosted about a dozen events a year. The first fundraising event was for the Mark S. Bonham Centre for Sexual Diversity Studies, part of the University of Toronto.  In popular culture  Integral House was used as a filming location in several episodes of the second season of Star Trek: Discovery, appearing as the home of Vulcan ambassador Sarek and his family.

Allan Gilbert, book 1, chapter 18, p. 241. Legal socialization is the process through which, individuals acquire attitudes and beliefs about the law, legal authorities, and legal institutions. This occurs through individuals' interactions, both personal and vicarious, with police, courts, and other legal actors. To date, most of what is known about legal socialization comes from studies of individual differences among adults in their perceived legitimacy of law and legal institutions, and in their cynicism about the law and its underlying norms. Adults' attitudes about the legitimacy of law are directly tied to individuals' compliance with the law and cooperation with legal authorities. Legal socialization consists of an individual's attitudes toward the legal system (referred to as legitimacy), the law (legal cynicism), and moral codes that guide behaviour (moral disengagement) Definition Judith Torney includes, recognition of law, understanding function of the law, accurately recognising source of law, developing relevant attitudes towards those who enforce the law, bringing personal behaviour into line with morality and legality. Psychologist June Louin-Tapp, credited for her \\"pioneering efforts in legal socialization,\\" defines the concept this way: Legal internalisation and jurisprudential reception and process of acculturation Laws are only observed with the consent of the individuals concerned and a moral change still depends on the individual and not on the passage of any law. ~ Eleanor Roosevelt Internalisation (or internalization) in sociology and other social sciences is the process of acceptance of a set of norms and values established by people or groups which are influential to the individual through the process of socialisation. John Finley Scott described internalisation as a metaphor in which something (i.e. an idea, concept, action) moves from outside the mind or personality to a place inside of it. The structure and the happenings of society shapes one's inner self and it can also be reversed. The process of internalisation starts with learning what the norms are, and then the individual goes through a process of understanding why they are of value or why they make sense, until finally they accept the norm as their own viewpoint. Internalised norms are said to be part of an individual's personality and may be exhibited by one's moral actions. However, there can also be a distinction between internal commitment to a norm and what one exhibits externally. Through internalisation individuals accept a set of norms and values that are established by other individuals, groups, or society as a whole. Norm acceptance, norm conformity and norm compliance can be achieved by coercion, acculturation, or persuasion. But the commitment to the law can be better achieved by process of internalisation and legitimacy of law helpful in this process.Koh, Harold Hongju, \\" Internalization Through Socialization \\" (2005). Faculty Scholarship Series. Paper 1786. http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/fss_paper s/1786 According to Marju Luts reception is chiefly defined as the transfer of a legal phenomenon of a different legal culture, other area or other period of time to a new legal climate. Awareness of the recipient that its activity is truly the adoption of an element of law that is, in a legal-cultural context, hitherto alien (or already forgotten). The matter is further specified on the basis of whether such awareness is characteristic of the whole recipient society or only the initiators of reception.http://www.juridicainternational.eu/?id=12458 awareness, Voluntariness The Author(s): Chantal Kourilsky-Augeven believe pre- eminence previously given to the transmission processes of values, norms and behavioural models should be renounced in favour of a definition of legal socialisation during childhood and adolescence, from the perspective of the subject playing an active part; Law must be considered as a fundamental part of the culture the subject belongs to; The subject acquires the common knowledge of the dominant legal culture in his society by \\"legal acculturation of the subject\\" ; In parallel occurs the \\"acculturation by the subject\\" concerning different objects of the common legal culture. The \\"legal acculturation of the subject\\" would thus occur thanks to the transmission by school (or other channels conveying of the common culture), integrating the historical experience assimilated by national culture and fundamental concepts and values of the national legal heritage (in particular regarding the state, the citizen, law or justice) while the subject would himself proceed to the \\"acculturation of these concepts\\" in light of the codes of interpretation of reality acquired within his close environment in order to integrate them within his own system of representations. Judith Torney describes three processes of legal socialisation namely, \\"accumulation process\\", \\"identification process\\" and \\"role transfer process\\". In accumulation process, law is learned from range of various sources. In \\"the identification process\\", attitudes and values of significant adults are absorbed in a natural psychological process wherein a tendency to adopt beliefs with whom one identifies and is socially bonded makes the impact. Whereas in \\"the role transfer process\\" from immediate surroundings like home or school one accepts rule making and implementing authority of the seniors and imputes the same and provides legitimacy to law making and/or enforcing agencies like police. =Legal necessity reception= Where there is an apparent need for a change of legal system in one culture and another existing culture provides an opportunity to satisfy the need =Legal veneration reception= Veneration reception is one example which occurs if alien norms, institutes or a whole system is adopted for their venerated position and prestige of cultural background. =Imposed legal reception= If a legal phenomenon is imposed upon another nation by force on another nation is referred to as imposed legal reception, in few instances under certain conditions imposed reception may transform into a voluntary process and thus become genuine reception but usually imposed legal phenomenon would not be considered genuine legal reception . =Legal transplantation= is a process whereby a legal phenomenon transfers to another geographic area or culture together with people. A situation where a norm of another legal culture is established in a different legal climate by enacting legislation regardless of its original implementation background may also be interpreted as a mere transplantation of a legal phenomenon. Transplantation also occurs where a legal theory is taken to another geographical area. As in the case of imposed reception or voluntary reception, an original transplantation may become true reception: of course not among the group or nation which is the carrier of transplantation but among the legal culture surrounding it in the new area. The transformation of transplantation into reception is perhaps of greater significance in the history of legal science than it is in positive law. =Methodological and systematic reception= in which the spread of legal doctrines and theories plays an especially important role. It is quite clear that the spread of methods brings about the spread of their conceptual and systematic basis. In this regard, system not only refers to a certain classification of legal material, but an internally consistent and systematic approach to law. Explicit and implicit legal socialisation \\"Explicit legal socialisation\\", which covers socially obvious aspects of law, consciously identified with what he calls law, should be distinguished from \\"implicit legal socialisation\\" which regulates every day situations that the subject does not associate with law, due to their familiarity in every day life. \\"Implicit\\" or \\"subconscious\\" legal socialisation – whereby the subject does not realise it is a matter of law, but thinks it is only ordinary practice – seems as effective as the first type of socialisation. Approaches *legal socialization measure Procedural justice (the perceived fairness of legal system i.e. the police, judge, and defense attorney) is related to the overall measure of legal socialization and each of its individual components wise legitimacy, legal cynicism, and moral disengagement According to Chantal Kourilsky - Augeven, phenomena of individuals' socialisation have been developed in three disciplines: psychology, anthropology and sociology. Psychologists, who study at the level of the individual, emphasize the construction of the personality or identity of the subject. Anthropologists start with a specific culture, considered as an entity formed by a group of people who share \\"ways of thinking, feeling and acting\\", values and behavioural norms. These common values and norms are then internalised by new generations and ensure the cohesion and continuance of the community. Like anthropologists, sociologists view the object of study from the perspective of society as a whole, but perceive socialisation more strongly in terms of the transmission of behavioural norms and models by persons and institutions. They tend to assign to them, for functional purposes, the role of socialisation agents. Socialisation of subjects is also considered in terms of learning of social roles or attainment of social skills. These three approaches tend to combine into two schools of thought. The first gives pre-eminence to the subject's viewpoint, but can only consider its development in relation to the interactions with the culture and society in which he is immersed. The second gives pre-eminence to society or culture as a whole, but can only apprehend subjects' modalities of adaptation or participation in this society by looking at modalities of individual development. Authority and legitimacy Just laws which uphold human rights are the necessary foundation of peace. ~ Aung San Suu Kyi It is not the enactment, but the observance of laws, that creates the character of a nation. ~ Calvin Coolidge When experiences with legal actors are perceived as fair, just and proportionate, these experiences reinforce the legitimacy of the law, and can contribute to compliance and desistance. However, when punishment is delivered unfairly, unjustly and/or disproportionately, it leads to cynicism about the law, and can contribute to anger and persistence (Sampson and Bartusch, 1998; Kirk and Papachristos, 2011; Papachristos,Meares and Fagan, 2012). It is easier in a democratic and pluralist society to exercise authority through legitimacy, i.e. Acting in ways that people find appropriate, reasonable and just.http://web.law.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/microsites/tax- policy/files/LTW/police_stops_and_legitimacy_january_22_2014.pdf According to Tom R. Tyler, People obey the law if they believe it's legitimate, not because they fear punishment—this is the startling conclusion of Tom Tyler's classic study. Tyler suggests that lawmakers and law enforcers would do much better to make legal systems worthy of respect than to try to instill fear of punishment. He finds that people obey law primarily because they believe in respecting legitimate authority. Brute coercive power may achieve obedience but will not sustain it. Only a sense of fairness, trust and legitimacy can do that by nurturing feelings of obligation. When outcomes are fair, and the procedures that lead to those outcomes transparent and just, people will follow rules, cooperate with police, pay fines, and accept punishment. Procedural justice - the experience directly or vicariously of transparency, fairness, neutrality and respect in dealings with criminal justice - is vital for any rule-following behaviour. Legal socialization among children and youth Settled Irish socializing with modern-day traveller to promote integration In order to better understand representations and behaviours of adults in relation to law and rights, their origin in childhood and adolescence are of relevance. Legal socialization is shaped during adolescence and that these attitudes are influenced by perceptions of fairness of interactions with authority figures and are important because they are related to delinquent behavior. (Fagan & Tyler, 2005). School specific (un-)fairness experiences can affect legal socialisation of students. Youth who perceive their experiences procedural justice being less fair have more negative attitudes about the law, legal system, and moral rules and codes. Youth with more negative views of the legal system and moral codes participate in more delinquent behavior. Legitimacy and moral disengagement components and overall measure of legal socialization are related to higher levels of delinquent behavior.

Prior to his election as Property Appraiser, he served as a member of the Florida House of Representatives, representing the 58th District from 1998 to 2006. History Henriquez was born in Tampa, Florida, and attended Princeton University, graduating with a degree in political science in 1986. After he graduated, he began working as an urban planner for the Hillsborough City-County Planning Commission and the Hillsborough County Planning and Growth Management Department, and as an assistant football coach at Tampa Catholic High School. Henriquez was the head coach at Tampa Catholic from 1990 to 1999 before he took an assistant coach position at Jefferson High School. He returned to Tampa Catholic in 2005 as head coach once again. Florida House of Representatives In 1998, when first-term Republican State Representative Deborah Tamargo, who had first been elected in a special election the year prior, ran for re-election, Henriquez ran against her in the 58th District. During the campaign, Tamargo sent out controversial campaign literature that asserted that Henriquez could not understand problems like child abuse because he did not have children of his own, to which Henriquez said, \\"The Lord has not seen fit to bless our marriage with any children yet.\\" \\" Ultimately, Henriquez defeated Tamargo by a wide margin, winning 56% of the vote to her 44% in one of the few bright spots for the Florida Democratic Party that year. Running for re-election in 2000, he was opposed by Eddy Calcines, a hairdresser and the Republican nominee, and he campaigned on his productivity in the legislature, noting, \\"Relationships are so important in Tallahassee. So much of what we do is not partisan. If you are into law-making and policy- making, there is not much room for an ideologue.\\" Henriquez did not have a difficult time dispatching Calcines, winning re-election with 62% of the vote. In 2002, Henriquez faced Hector Vila, the Republican nominee and a small business owner who ran in the Republican primary in 2000, but lost. Henriquez campaigned on continuing his emphasis on improving public education, providing assistance to seniors, protecting the environment, increasing economic prosperity, and improving public safety, and argued that his experience made him the best candidate. He defeated Vila in a landslide, winning 63% of the vote to Vila's 37%. When Henriquez ran for his final term in the legislature in 2004, he was opposed by Republican James Riis, whom he defeated in a rout with 70% of the vote. He was not able to seek re-election in 2006 due to term limits. Florida Department of Children and Families On April 3, 2008, Bob Butterworth, the former Attorney General of Florida and the Secretary of the Florida Department of Children and Families, announced that Henriquez would serve as the circuit administrator for the Department in Pasco and Pinellas Counties. Butterworth praised Henriquez as \\"a strong local leader whose passion for serving the community made him right for the job,\\" and Henriquez asserted that there was not any room for error on the job, noting, \\"You can't be 99 percent successful in this agency. You have to be 100 percent successful.\\" Henriquez held the position from 2008 to 2011, when Rick Scott became governor. Hillsborough County Property Appraiser In 2012, it emerged that the incumbent Hillsborough County Property Appraiser, Rob Turner, had sent \\"dozens of pornographic emails\\" to the human resources director in his office, an ex-girlfriend of his who then filed a sexual harassment claim against him. Henriquez jumped into the race and won the Democratic nomination, as did State Senator Ronda Storms, who challenged Townsend in the Republican primary. Storms defeated Turner decisively in the primary and squared off against Henriquez. As the general election got underway, Henriquez campaigned on his ability to manage the office effectively, saying, \\"I'm not an appraiser by trade, but I feel like I have the requisite experience to run the office effectively and efficiently,\\" and was able to fundraise his campaign as Storms's campaign momentum stalled. The Tampa Tribune endorsed Henriquez over Storms, praising him for his \\"appropriate experience and personality for a job in which objectivity and restraint are needed\\" and his \\"detailed plans for improving the appraiser's office.\\" During the campaign, Henriquez was criticized for evaluations he received from his time at the Department of Children and Families, where his superior, though praising him for \\"running an efficient organization,\\" urged him to \\"instill more of his own management styles and pursue goals for the circuit beyond maintenance of a once-troubled and recovering system of care.\\" Ultimately, Henriquez defeated Storms by a wide margin, winning 52% of the vote to her 43%.

Justifying it, Pizzi says that \\"It is like a voiceover without voice,\\" as the different formats can \\"communicate\\" with the audience in each specific scene. The 8mm allows Pizzi to shows Bianca's most personal feelings to the viewers, for example. In another scene, however, there are the use of six cameras to film musical sequence of the in-film film. The story is based on Karine Teles' real life experience as she was selected to appear in Rio Sex Comedy but was later replaced. On the film's theme, Pizzi stated he wanted to question how talent and luck are associated on one's career: Reception Upon its release, it has been well received, mostly for Teles' performance. Craft had its world premiere held at the 2010 Rio Film Festival, where Teles received the Best Actress Award. Teles won the same award at the 2011 Gramado Film Festival, where the film also garnered the Best Director, Best Screenplay and Best Music awards. At the 2011 Cartagena Film Festival, Craft was nominated for the Best Film Award. Mark Adams of ScreenDaily declared, \\"[Craft] may well be a familiar tale but it has a good-natured honesty as well as a series of fine performances that help make it memorable.\\" Writing for Variety, Jay Weissberg dubbed Teles' acting as \\"terrific\\" and said, \\"It's been a while since a film captured an actor's world with the intelligence, creativity and insight of Craft.\\" References External links * Category:2010 drama films Category:Brazilian drama films Category:Brazilian films Category:Brazilian independent films Category:2010 directorial debut films Category:2010 independent films ","title":"Craft (film)"},{"id":"44603534","text":"Herbet is a surname.

The botanical classification of the species, hybrids, varieties and cultivars belonging to the genus Citrus is called \\"citrus taxonomy\\". Citrus taxonomy refers to the botanical classification of the species, varieties, cultivars, and graft hybrids within the genus Citrus and related genera, found in cultivation and in the wild. Citrus taxonomy is complex. Cultivated citrus are derived from various citrus species found in the wild. Some are only selections of the original wild types, while others are hybrids between two or more ancestors. Citrus plants hybridize easily between species with completely different morphologies, and similar-looking citrus fruits may have quite different ancestries. Some differ only in disease resistance. Conversely, different-looking varieties may be nearly genetically identical, and differ only by a bud mutation. Detailed genomic analysis of wild and domesticated citrus cultivars has suggested that the progenitor of modern citrus species expanded out of the Himalayan foothills in a rapid radiation that has produced at least 10 wild species in South and East Asia and Australia. Most commercial cultivars are the product of hybridization among these wild species, with most coming from crosses involving citrons, mandarins and pomelos. and Supplement Many different phylogenies for the non-hybrid citrus have been proposed, and the phylogeny based on their nuclear genome does not match that derived from their chloroplast DNA, probably a consequence of the rapid initial divergence. Taxonomic terminology is not yet settled. Most hybrids express different ancestral traits when planted from seeds (F2 hybrids) and can continue a stable lineage only through vegetative propagation. Some hybrids do reproduce true to type via nucellar seeds in a process called apomixis. As such, many hybrid species represent the clonal progeny of a single original F1 cross, though others combine fruit with similar characteristics that have arisen from distinct crosses. Genetic history All of the wild 'pure' citrus species trace to a common ancestor that lived in the Himalayan foothills, where a late-Miocene citrus fossil, Citrus linczangensis, has been found. At that time, a lessening of the monsoons and resultant drier climate in the region allowed the citrus ancestor to expand across south and east Asia in a rapid genetic radiation. After the plant crossed the Wallace line a second radiation took place in the early Pliocene (about 4 million years ago) to give rise to the Australian species. Most modern cultivars are actually hybrids derived from a small number of 'pure' original species. Though hundreds of species names have been assigned, a recent genomic study by Wu, et al. identified just ten ancestral species of citrus among those studied. Of these, seven were native to Asia: pomelo (Citrus maxima), the 'pure' mandarins (C. reticulata – most mandarin cultivars were hybrids of this species with pomelo), citrons (C. medica), micranthas (C. micrantha), the Ichang papeda (C. cavaleriei), the mangshanyegan (C. mangshanensis), and the oval (Nagami) kumquat (Fortunella margarita or C. japonica var. margarita). Three from Australia were identified: the desert lime (C. glauca), round lime (C. australis) and the finger lime (C. australasica). Many other cultivars previously identified as species were found to be closely related variants (subspecies or varieties) or hybrids of these species, though not all cultivars were evaluated. Interbreeding seems possible between all citrus plants, and between citrus plants and some plants which may or may not be categorized as citrus. The ability of citrus hybrids to self-pollinate and to reproduce sexually also helps create new varieties. The three predominant ancestral citrus taxa are citron (C. medica), pomelo (C. maxima), and mandarin (C. reticulata). These taxa interbreed freely, despite being quite genetically distinct, having arisen through allopatric speciation, with citrons evolving in northern Indochina, pomelos in the Malay Archipelago, and mandarins in Vietnam, southern China, and Japan. The hybrids of these taxa include familiar citrus fruits like oranges, grapefruit, lemons, limes, and some tangerines. Citrons have also been hybridized with other citrus taxa, for example, crossed with micrantha to produce the Key lime. In many cases, these crops are propagated asexually, and lose their characteristic traits if bred. However, some of these hybrids have interbred with one another and with the original taxa, making the citrus family tree a complicated network. Citrus fruits clustered by genetic similarity of partial sequences. Ternary diagram of hybrids of the three major ancestral species. Data from Curk et al. (2016). Kumquats do not naturally interbreed with core taxa due to different flowering times, but hybrids (such as the calamondin) exist. Australian limes are native to Australia and Papua New Guinea, so they did not naturally interbreed with the core taxa, but they have been crossbred with mandarins and calamondins by modern breeders. Humans have deliberately bred new citrus fruits by propagating seedlings of spontaneous crosses (e.g. clementines), creating or selecting mutations of hybrids, (e.g. Meyer lemon), and crossing different varieties (e.g. 'Australian Sunrise', a finger lime and calamondin cross). Citrus naming systems Initially, many citrus types were identified and named by individual taxonomists, resulting in a large number of identified species: 870 by a 1969 count. Some order was brought to citrus taxonomy by two unified classification schemes, those of Chōzaburō Tanaka and Walter Tennyson Swingle, that can be viewed as extreme alternative visions of the genus. Swingle's system divided the Citrinae subtribe into three groups, the 'primitive citrus' distant relatives, the closer 'near citrus' including citrus-related genera like Atalantia, and the 'true citrus', which included Poncirus, Citrus, Fortunella, Eremocitrus, Microcitrus, and Clymenia, all but the first now viewed to fall within Citrus. His Citrus he likewise subdivided into two subgenera: citrons, pomelos, mandarins, oranges, grapefruits and lemons were placed in subgenus Eucitrus (later called simply subgenus Citrus), while the hardy but slow-growing trees with relatively unpalatable fruit he placed in subgenus Papeda. His genus Citrus consisted of just 16 species, dividing them further into varieties, and lastly cultivars or hybrids. The Swingle system is generally followed globally today with much modification; however, there are still large differences in nomenclature between countries and individual scientists. The 'Tanaka system' (1954) instead provides a separate species name for each cultivar, regardless of whether it is pure or a hybrid of two or more species or varieties, and resulted in 159 identified species. It thus represents an example of taxonomic \\"splitting\\", and in assigning separate species names to horticultural variants does not conform to the standard species concept. Tanaka also divides into subgenera, but differently than Swingle did, introducing Archicitrus (which he subdivided into five sections, Papeda, Limonellus, Aruntium, Citrophorum and Cephalocitrus) and Metacitrus (divided into Osmocitrus, Acrumen and Pseudofortunella). This system is commonly used in Tanaka's native Japan. A 1969 analysis by Hodgson intended to harmonize the two schemes accepted 36 species. These initial attempts at Citrus systematization all predate the recognition, which began to gain traction in the mid-1970s, that the majority of cultivars represent hybrids of just three species, citron, mandarin and pomelo. Phylogenetic analysis confirms the hybrid origin of most citrus cultivars, indicating a small number of founder species. While the subgenera suggested by Tanaka proved similar to the phylogenetic divisions, Swingle's subgenera were polyphyletic, and hence do not represent valid taxonomy. Historical genera are also dubious. Swingle had elevated kumquats into a separate genus Fortunella, while two genera were suggested by him for the Australian limes, Microcitrus and Eremocitrus. However, genomic analysis has pointed to these groups nesting within the phylogenetic tree of Citrus. Since their placement in distinct genera would make Citrus a paraphyletic grouping, it has been suggested that all of these are correctly members of the genus Citrus. Similarly, genomic analysis has suggested that other genera previously split off from Citrus may likewise belong within this expanded phylogenetic concept of the genus Citrus, including Clymenia, Oxanthera and more controversially Poncirus, along with a genus not previously recognized as a close citrus relative, Feroniella. There remains a lack of consensus as to which wild plants and hybrids merit distinct species status, a phenomenon exacerbated by the prior failure to correctly identify the genetically pure citrus strains and distinguish them from hybrids.Ollitrault system of citrus species names. Not all possible combinations are known to exist. In 2020, a new nomenclatural system was proposed by Ollitrault, Curk and Krueger, with the goal of harmonizing traditional naming systems with the new genomic data that have allowed both the pure ancestral species to be distinguished from hybrids, and for the ancestry of those hybrids to be identified among the ancestral species. In their system, each ancestral species has a binomial name, while a unique species name is reserved for each combination of ancestral species, independent of the specific order of crossing or proportional representation of the ancestral species in a given hybrid. Individual hybrids of each type are then distinguished by a variety name. Thus hybrids that are crosses between mandarin (C. reticulata) and pomelo (C. maxima) would all be C. aurantium, with specific crosses including: C. x aurantium var. sinensis for the sweet orange, C. x aurantium var. paradisi for grapefruit, and C. x aurantium var. clementina for the clementine. Likewise, hybrids combining mandarins and citrons would all be varieties of C. x limonia, those of pomelo and citron, C. x lumia, while tri-species hybrids of citrons, pomelos and mandarins would be C. x limon, and a tetra-species cross involving these three species along with C. micrantha would be C. x latifolia. This naming system focussed on the four species ancestral to most commercial hybrids, and did not include similar species designations for more exotic hybrids involving other citrus species, such as the Ichang papeda, kumquat, or trifoliate orange. Likewise, Ollitrault, Curk and Krueger accept that the whole-genome characterization necessary to unambiguously assign a hybrid species name under their system is not available for many varieties. Examples of hybrid Citrus, showing their derivation from the pure founder species Core species and hybrids Most commercial varieties are descended from one or more of the 'core species', citrons, mandarins, and pomelos, which share in common a complex floral anatomy that gives rise to more complex fruit. These core species, and to a lesser extent other citrus, have given rise to a wide variety of hybrids for which the naming is inconsistent. The same common names may be given to different species, citrus hybrids or mutations. For example, citrus with green fruit tend to be called 'limes' independent of their origin: Australian limes, Musk limes, Key limes, kaffir limes, Rangpur limes, sweet limes and wild limes are all genetically distinct. Fruit with similar ancestry may be quite different in name and traits (e.g. grapefruit, common oranges, and ponkans, all pomelo-mandarin hybrids). Many traditional citrus groups, such as true sweet oranges and lemons, seem to be bud sports, clonal families of cultivars that have arisen from distinct spontaneous mutations of a single hybrid ancestor. Novel varieties, and in particular seedless or reduced-seed varieties, have also been generated from these unique hybrid ancestral lines using gamma irradiation of budwood to induce mutations. =Ancestral species= Mandarins Mandarin oranges (tangerines, satsumas – Citrus reticulata) are one of the basic species, but the name mandarin is also used more generally for all small, easily peeled citrus, including a large range of hybrids. Swingle saw three species of mandarin, while Tanaka identified five groups with a total of 36 species. Webber (1948) divided them into four groups, king, satsuma, mandarin, and tangerine, and Hodgson (1967) saw in them four species. Genomic analysis suggests just one species, Citrus reticulata, with even the divergent Tachibana orange (Tanaka's Citrus tachibana), native to Taiwan, the Ryukyu Islands and southern Japan, nesting within the wild mandarins of the East-Asian mainland, and showing enough similarity to be considered just a subspecies. All characterized varieties commercially called mandarins are actually hybrids. Wang, et al., found that domesticated mandarins fell into two genetic clusters that linked to different branches of the tree of wild mandarins, had different deduced population histories and had distinct patterns of pomelo introgression, suggesting that they derive from separate domestication events. Wu, et al., divided mandarins into three types, based on their degree of hybridization. In addition to genetically pure mandarins, a second type are the result of hybridization with pomelos followed by subsequent backcrossing with mandarins to retain only a few pomelo traits. The third type arose more recently from the crossing of these hybrids again with pomelos or sweet oranges (which are themselves crosses of hybrid mandarins and pomelos). This produces mandarins with more, longer stretches of pomelo DNA. Some commercial mandarins are hybrids with lemons, while several were found to have a significant contribution (35–65%) from papedas. Mangshan wild mandarin (C. mangshanensis) is a name used for the similar-looking wild mandarin-like fruit of the Mangshan area, but has been found to include two genetically-distinct groups, one representing pure, wild 'true' mandarins, and the other the genetically distinct and only distantly related mangshanyegan, akin to another local fruit known as the 'yuanju', and found to be the most distant branch of all the citrus. In a limited genomic analysis, Feroniella was surprisingly found to cluster with C. reticulata deep within Citrus, leading botanist David Mabberley to propose that its sole member, F. lucida, be rechristened C. lucida. Pomelos The pomelo (Citrus maxima), a second of the core species from which most citrus hybrids have derived, is native to southeast Asia. Among the hybrids deriving from mandarin/pomelo crosses, there is a direct correlation between the proportion of pomelo DNA in the hybrid and fruit size, while the more palatable mandarins are those that have received specific genes from pomelos that alter their acidity. Some of the more common pomelos are genetically pure, while a number have a single small region of introgressed mandarin DNA on one chromosome, the result of a cross followed by extensive backcrossing with pomelo. Citrons Varieties of true (non-hybrid) citron (Citrus medica) have distinctly different forms. The citron usually propagates by cleistogamy, a self- pollination within an unopened flower, and this results in the lowest levels of heterozygosity among the citrus species. Because of this, it will generally serve as the male parent of any hybrid progeny. Many citron varieties were proven to be non-hybrids despite their rather dramatic morphological differences; however, the florentine citron is probably of hybrid origin. Genetic analysis of citrons has shown that they divide into three groups. One cluster consists of wild citrons that originated in China and produce non- fingered fruit with pulp and seeds. A second cluster, also native to China, consist of the fingered citrons, most of which are seedless and must be propagated artificially. The third cluster represents the Mediterranean citrons, thought to have originally been introduced there from India. Some fingered citron varieties are used in buddhist offerings, and some more common varieties are used as the etrog in the Jewish harvest festival of Sukkot. There is also a specific variety of citron called etrog. The Mountain citron is a complex citrus hybrid that only includes trace amounts of true citron. Papedas Swingle coined the Citrus subgenus Papeda to separate its members from the more edible citrus, that also differ from other citrus in that its stamens grow separately, not united at the base. He included in this group the kaffir lime (Citrus hystrix), as well as its possible taxonomic synonym the micrantha (Citrus micrantha) and Ichang papeda (Citrus cavaleriei). Since the latter two species locate to different branches of the citrus phylogenetic tree, the group would be polyphyletic and not a valid division. Papedas have also given rise to hybrids with other citrus. Kumquats Kumquats were originally classified by Carl Peter Thunberg as Citrus japonica in his 1784 book, Flora Japonica. In 1915, Swingle reclassified them in a separate genus, Fortunella, named in honor of Robert Fortune. He divided the kumquats into two subgenera, the Protocitrus, containing the primitive Hong Kong kumquat (F. hindsii), and Eufortunella, comprising the round (F. japonica), oval kumquat (F. margarita) and Meiwa kumquats (F. crassifolia), to which Tanaka added two others, the Malayan kumquat (which he christened F. swinglei but more commonly called F. polyandra) and the Jiangsu kumquat (F. obovata), and Huang added another, F. bawangica. Since the kumquat is a cold hardy species, there are many hybrids between common citrus members and the kumquat. Swingle coined a separate hybrid genus for these, which he called × Citrofortunella. Subsequent study of the many commercial citrus lineages revealed such complexity that the genera could not be separated, and genomic analysis rooted Fortunella within the polyphyletic tree of Citrus. This placement would restore the kumquats to Citrus, but recently Ollitrault, Curk and Krueger found the degree of detailed genomic characterization of the kumquats insufficient to force this placement. The Flora of China unites all kumquats as the single species, Citrus japonica. Based on chromosomal analysis, Yasuda, et al., identified Jiangsu and Malayan kumquats as hybrids and see the remainder of Eufortunella as a single species, while retaining the Hong Kong kumquat as a distinct species. Australian and New Guinean species Australian and New Guinean citrus species had been viewed as belonging to separate genera by Swingle, who placed in Microcitrus all but the desert lime, which he assigned to Eremocitrus. However, genomic analysis shows that though they form a distinct clade from other citrus, this is nested within the citrus phylogenetic tree, most closely related to kumquats, suggesting that all these species should be included in the genus Citrus. Wu, et al., found that several of the finger lime cultivars were actually hybrids with round lime, and concluded there were just three species among those tested, desert lime (C. glauca), round lime (C. australis) and the finger lime (C. australasica), though their analysis did not include other types previously identified as distinct species. In more limited genomic analysis, the New Guinea wild lime, Clymenia and Oxanthera (false orange) all cluster with the Australian limes as members of Citrus. The outback lime is a desert lime agriculturally selected for more commercial traits, while some commercial varieties of the Australian lime are hybrids with mandarins, lemons, and/or sweet oranges. Clymenia, will hybridize with kumquats and some limes. Trifoliate orange The trifoliate orange is a cold hardy plant distinguishable by its compound leaves with three leaflets and its deciduous nature, but is close enough to the genus Citrus to be used as a rootstock. Swingle moved the trifoliate orange from Citrus to its own genus, Poncirus, but Mabberley and Zhang reunited the genera Swingle had separated back into Citrus. Early phylogenetic analysis nested Poncirus within the citrus, consistent with a single genus, but the genomic sequencing of Wu, et al., placed it outside the cluster representing Citrus, and the authors retained a separate genus Poncirus. Ollitrault, Curk and Krueger indicate that the majority of data are consistent with the enlarged Citrus that includes the trifoliate orange, though they recognize that many botanists still follow Swingle. A further complication to the placement of Poncirus is the conflicting phylogenetic data: its nuclear genome places Poncirus as an outgroup to other citrus, while its chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) nests within a Citrus subclade. This led Talon, et al. to conclude that the trifoliate orange likely is either the progeny of an ancient hybridization between a core citrus and an unidentified more distant relative, or at some time in its history acquired an introgressed cpDNA genome from another species. A second species in this genus, Poncirus polyandra, was discovered in Yunnan (China) in the 1980s. However, Zhang and Mabberley later concluded this was likely a hybrid between the trifoliate orange and some other Citrus. Were Poncirus subsumed into Citrus, C. polyandra would be unavailable, so C. polytrifolia has been suggested as a replacement species name for this Yunnan Poncirus, or, if a hybrid, C. x polytrifolia.

This is done not only for the useful characteristics of the fruit, but also for plant size and growth characteristics such as cold-tolerance. Some citrus hybrids occurred naturally, and others have been deliberately created, either by cross pollination and selection among the progeny, or (rarely, and only recently) as somatic hybrids. The aim of plant breeding of hybrids is to use two or more different citrus varieties or species, in order to get traits intermediate between those of the parents, or to transfer individual desirable traits of one parent into the other. In some cases, particularly with the natural hybrids, it has been viewed as hybrid speciation and the new plants have been viewed as different species from any of their parents. In older taxonomic systems, citrus hybrids have often been given unique hybrid names, marked with a multiplication sign after the word \\"Citrus\\", for example the Key lime is Citrus × aurantifolia, and also are referred to by joining the names of the crossed species or hybrids that produced them, as with sunquat – Citrus limon × japonica. Styling a hybrid as such a cross between two species can present challenges. In some cases the parental species that gave rise to a hybrid have yet to be determined, while genotyping reveals some hybrids to descend from three or more ancestral species. In the Ollitrault system, a hybrid will be given a species name corresponding to the ancestral species contributions to it, as well as a distinctive variety name. =Labelling of hybrids= Hybrid taxonomy is inconsistent. There is disagreement over whether to assign species names to hybrids, and even modern hybrids of known parentage are sold under general names that give little information about their ancestry, or even give technically incorrect information. This can be a problem for those who can eat only some citrus varieties. Drug interactions with chemicals found in some citrus, including grapefruit and Seville oranges, make the ancestry of citrus fruit of interest; many commonly sold citrus varieties are grapefruit hybrids or pomelo-descended grapefruit relatives. One medical review has advised patients on medication to avoid all citrus juice, although some citrus fruits contain no furanocoumarins. Citrus allergies can also be specific to only some fruit or some parts of some fruit. =Major citrus hybrids= common oranges as well as the grapefruits are hybrids between the mandarin and the pomelo. Lumia The most common citrus hybrids that are sometimes treated as a species by themselves, especially in folk taxonomy, are: * Orange: a name used for several distinct crosses between pomelo and a mandarin orange. They have the orange color of the mandarin in their outer peels and segments, and are easier to peel than the pomelos. Oranges are all intermediate between the two ancestors in size, flavor and shape. The bitter orange and sweet orange both arose from mandarin-pomelo crosses, the former involving a pure mandarin, the latter with a mandarin already containing small amounts of pomelo. * Grapefruit: Grapefruits, like oranges, include genetic contributions from both mandarin and pomelo, but more of the latter, arising from a natural backcross of a sweet orange with a pomelo. The 'cocktail grapefruit', or Mandelo, is distinct, instead the product of a low-acid pomelo variety hybridized with a mandarin that itself was a cross between two distinct mandarin stocks. * Lemon: 'true' lemons derive from one common hybrid ancestor, having diverged by mutation. The original lemon was a hybrid between a male citron and a female sour orange, itself a pomelo/pure-mandarin hybrid; citrons contribute half of the genome, while the other half is divided between pomelo and mandarin. There are other hybrids also known as 'lemons'. Rough lemons arose from a cross between citron and mandarin, without the pomelo contribution found in true lemons, while the Meyer lemon comes from a citron crossed with a sweet (as opposed to sour) orange. * Limes: A highly diverse group of hybrids go by this name. Rangpur limes, like rough lemons, arose from crosses between citron and mandarin. The sweet limes, so-called due to their low acid pulp and juice, come from crosses of citron with either sweet or sour oranges, while the Key lime arose from a cross between a citron and a micrantha. All of these hybrids have in turn been bred back with their parent stocks or with other pure or hybrid citrus to form a broad array of fruits. Naming of these is inconsistent, with some bearing a variant of the name of one of the parents or simply another citrus with superficially-similar fruit, a distinct name, or a portmanteau of ancestral species. The Ponderosa lemon (Citrus limon × medica) and Florentine citron (Citrus x limonimedica) are both true lemon/citron hybrids, the Bergamot orange is a sweet orange/lemon hybrid and the Oroblanco is a grapefruit/pomelo mix, while tangelos are tangerine (mandarin)/pomelo or mandarin/grapefruit hybrids, orangelos result from grapefruit backcrossed with sweet orange, and a sweet orange backcrossed with a tangerine gives the tangor. One lumia, a member of the sweet lemons, is the product of crossing a lemon with a pomelo/citron hybrid, though another lumia variety, the Pomme d'Adam, is a micrantha/citron cross, like the Key lime. The most common and commercially popular 'limes', the Persian limes, are Key lime/lemon hybrids that combine the genetic lineages of four ancestral citrus species: mandarin, pomelo, citron and micrantha. While most other citrus are diploid, many of the Key lime hybrid progeny have unusual chromosome numbers. For example, the Persian lime is triploid, deriving from a diploid Key lime gamete and a haploid lemon ovule. A second group of Key lime hybrids, including the Tanepao lime and Madagascar lemon, are also triploid but instead seem to have arisen from a backcross of a diploid Key lime ovule with a citron haploid gamete. The 'Giant Key lime' owes its increased size to a spontaneous duplication of the entire diploid Key lime genome to produce a tetraploid. Historically, hybrids with similar characteristics have been placed together in a number of hybrid species, yet relatively recent genomic analysis has revealed some hybrids assigned to the same species to be of quite distinct ancestry. No alternative system of grouping fruit in hybrid species has been adopted. =Hybrids from other citrus species= While most citrus hybrids derive from the three core species, hybrids have also been derived from the micrantha, Ichang papeda, kumquat and trifoliate orange. The best known hybrid from micrantha is the Key lime (or Mexican lime), derived from the breeding of a male citron and a female micrantha. Several citrus varieties are Ichang papeda/mandarin crosses (for which Swingle coined the term ichandarin), including Sudachi and Yuzu (which also includes smaller contributions from pomelo and kumquat). Other more exotic citrus have likewise proved hybrids that include papeda. For example, the Indian wild orange, once suggested as a possible ancestor of today's cultivated citrus fruits, yielded conflicting phylogenetic placements in more limited genetic analysis, but study of nuclear markers and chloroplast DNA showed it to be of maternal citron lineage, with further genetic contributions from mandarin and papeda. The wild Mountain citron, native to the Malay peninsula and called Citrus halimii at the time of its discovery, has been found to be a complex mix, being half papeda (type not specified), the other half including kumquat, mandarin and pomelo, with only trace amounts of citron. Citrofortunella A large group of commercial hybrids involve the kumquat, Fortunella in the Swingle system. Citrofortunella was coined as a genus containing intergeneric hybrids between members of the Citrus and the Fortunella, and is named after its parent genera. Such hybrids often combine the cold hardiness of the kumquat with some edibility properties of the other Citrus species. As members of a hybrid genus, these crosses were marked with the multiplication sign before the genus name, for example × Citrofortunella microcarpa. With the return of kumquats to within Citrus, Citrofortunella are no longer viewed as being intergeneric hybrids and thus likewise belong in Citrus, while Citrofortunella as a distinct genus name would no longer be valid. Examples of the Citrofortunella include the calamondin, limequat and yuzuquat, crossing kumquat with tangerine, Key lime and yuzu respectively. Citroncirus As with kumquats, the trifoliate orange does not naturally interbreed with core taxa due to different flowering times, but hybrids have been produced artificially between Poncirus and members of the genus Citrus. In the Swingle system the name coined for these intra-generic crosses, represented as a hybrid genus, is \\"× Citroncirus\\". The group includes the citrange, a hybrid between the trifoliate and sweet oranges, and the citrumelo, a hybrid of trifoliate orange and 'Duncan' grapefruit. As with Citrofortunella, were Poncirus subsumed into Citrus, these hybrids would no longer be intergeneric, and would likewise fall within Citrus, rendering Citroncirus invalid. Graft hybrids Bizzaria, an unusual graft-chimera. Due to the sterility of many of the genetic hybrids as well as disease- or temperature-sensitivity of some Citrus trees, domesticated citrus cultivars are usually propagated via grafting to the rootstock of other, often hardier though less palatable citrus or close relatives. As a result, graft hybrids, also called graft-chimaeras, can occur in Citrus. After grafting, the cells from the scion and rootstock are not somatically fused, but rather the cells of the two intermix at the graft site, and can produce shoots from the same tree that bear different fruit. For example, the 'Faris' lemon, has some branches with purple immature leaves and flowers with a purple blush that give rise to sour fruit, while other branches produce genetically-distinct sweet lemons coming from white flowers, with leaves that are never purple. Graft hybrids can also give rise to an intermixed shoot that bears fruit with a combination of the characteristics of the two contributing species due to the presence of cells from both in that fruit. In an extreme example, on separate branches Bizzaria produces fruit identical to each of the two contributing species, but also fruit that appears to be half one species and half the other, unmixed. In taxonomy, graft hybrids are distinguished from genetic hybrids by designating the two contributing species with a '+' between the individual names (Citrus medica + C. aurantium).

It is found in mixed evergreen and deciduous forests of Thailand, where it fruits singly to scattered in soil under Pinus and Castanopsis trees. Its fruit bodies have caps measuring in diameter. They are white but stain brown to reddish brown, hence the epithet, which combines the Latin words for \\"white\\" (albo) and \\"becoming brown\\" (brunnescens). The stipe measures long by thick except for the swollen base, which is up to in diameter. The top of the stipe has a prominent network pattern (reticulations) that diminishes as it extends down to over half its length. Like the cap, it also stains brown after handling. The smooth spores are roughly spindle-shaped (fusoid), and measure 10.5–11.9 by 4.2–4.9 μm. B. albobrunnescens is a good edible mushroom; it is the most expensive mushroom sold in the market of Nakhon Phanom, where in 1998 it sold for 150 Baht per kilogram.

Construction of stage one, from south of Margaret River to Rosa Brook Road, began in December 2014 and was completed in May 2015. Construction of stage two – the remaining northern section – began in September 2017 and was completed in February 2019, with an opening in December 2018. An extension of John Archibald Drive and the redevelopment of Bussell Highway in the town were included in the business case for constructing stage two. Stage two of the project received $60 million of funding from The Nationals Western Australia to enable a complete bypass to be constructed, rather than a \\"road to nowhere\\". The state government provided the $13 million to construct stage one. The total cost was $47.6 million. The project underwent an Environmental Impact Assessment and Aboriginal Heritage survey. Action was taken to compensate for the loss of native vegetation, and a zoologist was employed to identify and relocate native fauna at the start of stage one construction.

History Perry Engineering had its origins in 1899 when Samuel Perry purchased from the estate of James Wedlock the Cornwall Foundry on Hindley Street, renaming it the Victoria Foundry. He leased or purchased a nearby property on North Terrace and there established a bridge and girder factory. He purchased a large block of land at Mile End with potential for a private railway siding and around 1911 established the factory there, by 1916 it was known as Perry Engineering. In 1915, Perry purchased the James Martin & Co Phoenix Foundry works in Gawler from the estate of the owner Henry Dutton of Anlaby. The company had recently lost a major contract for locomotives, which may have affected the price, as may have World War I which was then consuming capital and manpower.James Martin & Co Phoenix Foundry Town of Gawler James Martin's locomotive manufacturing business was also being challenged by the state-owned Islington Railway Workshops. Samuel Perry transferred most of the heavy work to the Mile End factory, leaving the Gawler works with the rump of the business. He took on his nephew Frank as works manager at Mile End around 1918; In 1930, on the death of his uncle, Frank took over the company, which in 1937 was registered as Perry Engineering Co. Ltd. Perry Engineering built locomotives for the Commonwealth Railways, South Australian Railways and Tasmanian Government Railways. It also built 19 locomotives for Queensland sugar cane line operators.Sugar cane transport Light Railway Research Society of Australia The Victorian State Rivers & Water Supply Commission purchased eight for construction of the Hume Weir and nine for the rebuilding of Silvan Reservoir. During World War II much of the factory was converted to manufacture munitions and defence equipment including two types of vehicles which were sold to the Americans. One of the two vehicles was the Ferret scout car. A heavy steel manufacturing plant was established in Whyalla in 1958, and the factory at Mile End expanded.Cumming, D. A. and Moxham, G.

The story begins on August 15, 1945, the day Japan loses World War II. Set in 1945–47, the protagonist, Tetsuzo Kunioka, is an owner of a company that sells oil. Most of his company is either missing, in the army, or otherwise not available. The fate of the company's network of overseas offices is also unknown. Not fazed by the defeat of Japan, he is determined that Japan will rise again, and is driven to create a large oil company.

It consists of a length of magnetized stainless steel wire 0.25 mm in diameter and typically 1.1 mm long. The tag is marked with rows of numbers denoting specific batch or individual codes. The tag is usually injected into the snout or cheek of a fish so that it may be tracked for research or fisheries management. Fish, crustaceans, insects, gastropods, and many other animals have been successfully tagged with Coded Wire Tags. The coded wire tag program in the Pacific Northwest has been described as the largest animal tagging program in history, with over 1 billion salmon tagged. Data retrieval The CWT is not visible once inside the fish; its presence is detected at close range by using a handheld wand or tunnel type detector that can sense the magnetized metal. A number code unique to either a group of fish or an individual fish is etched into the surface of the CWT, and to read the code the fish is killed first so that the tag can be removed and inspected under a microscope. Upon insertion, information about the fish such as hatching date, release date, location, species, sex, and length are recorded along with the corresponding tag code into a database, so that codes on recovered tags can be matched to information within that database. Coded wire tags have been used to research fish species from over 40 different families.Vander Haegen, G., Blankenship, H.L., Knutzen, D., McKenzie, J.R., Parsons, B., Seitz, A.C., Kopf, R.K., Mesa, M., Phelps, Q., 2011. Advances in coded wire tag technology: meeting changing fish management objectives, in: Advances in Fish Tagging and Marking Technology. American Fisheries Society, Symposium.  History  Coded wire tags were first introduced in the 1960s as an alternative to fin clipping.Jefferts KB, Bergman PK, Fiscus HF. 1963 A coded wire identification system for macro-organisms. Nature 198:460-462 The first CWTs used colored stripes and allowed about 5000 different color combinations to uniquely identify groups of tags. The next development was binary codes marked on tags by electrical discharge machining in 1971. Binary codes allowed 250,000 unique code combinations. The sequential coded wire tag was introduced in 1985, which allowed tags with sequentially increasing numbers, or codes, to be cut from the same spool of wire, so that individual or small groups of fish could be uniquely identified. With advancements in laser technology, digits could be etched on tags, which caused the switch from binary to decimal codes. Currently, coded wire tags are marked using a decimal system, which is a row of numbers. The decimal system allows 1 million unique codes for batch tags, and 100,000 unique codes for individual sequential tags.Solomon, D.J., 2005. Coded Wire Tag Project Manual.

Coded Wire Tag Placement Affects Homing Ability of Pink Salmon. Transactions of the American Fisheries Society 127, 652–657. and different sized tags are used depending on the length of the fish to be tagged. A small handheld injector is portable and can be used where small numbers of fish will be tagged. For large scale tagging projects, an automatic tag injector is used, which cuts and magnetizes the wire. In manual tagging, a juvenile fish's snout is pressed into a molded guide so that the tag will be positioned correctly and the tag is automatically injected by the machine. These automatic injectors can be integrated into a fully automated process inside of a mobile trailer called an AutoFish trailer, or autotrailer, where fish are mechanically sorted, adipose fin clipped, and tagged. Autotrailers do not require anesthetic or the fish to be removed from water. When fish are tagged, their tag code and other information such as release date and location are entered into a database. In the Pacific Northwest, the Regional Mark Information System is used.Regional Mark Processing Center  Applications  The head of this steelhead is being scanned with a CWT wand. Coded wire tags are used to track groups or individual fish for research and fishery management purposes. Commonly tagged species are coho, chinook, steelhead, chum, sockeye, and pink salmon.Nandor, G.F., Longwill, J.R., Webb, D.L., 2010. Overview of the coded wire tag program in the Greater Pacific Region of North America. PNAMP Special Publication: Tagging, Telemetry and Marking Measures for Monitoring Fish Populations—A compendium of new and recent science for use in informing technique and decision modalities: Pacific Northwest Aquatic Monitoring Partnership Special Publication 2, 5–46. In Alaska, British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, and California, the adipose fin is removed from CWT tagged salmon as a visual indicator of the presence of the tag. However, in Washington the adipose fin is removed from nearly all hatchery salmon in mass marking programs to distinguish them from wild fish.Mass Marking Fact Sheet , Washington Department of Fish & Wildlife. In order to study the impacts of mark selective fisheries, where marked hatchery salmon are selected by fisheries rather than unmarked wild fish, some fish receive what is called a double index tag.Hoffmann, A., Pattillo, P.L., 2008. The practical application of mark- selective fisheries, in: American Fisheries Society Symposium. American Fisheries Society, p. 451. In double index tagging, some hatchery fish are tagged with a CWT but do not have their adipose fin clipped. This means that the adipose fin clip cannot always be depended on as an indicator that a tag is there, since some fish with adipose fin clips will not actually have tags, and some fish with intact adipose fins will have tags. In places where mass marking or double index tagging is practiced, an electronic detector such as a wand or tunnel must be used to determine if a tag is present so the snout can be dissected to read the tag. Electronic tag detection is used in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho. Alaska and California depend on the adipose fin clip to indicate the presence of a tag.Review of 2008 Mass Marking and Mark Selective Fishery Proposals No. SFEC (08-2) , 2008. Pacific Salmon Commission Selective Fishery Evaluation Committee. Coded wire tags have also been used to track the diet of piscivorous birds, because when the head of a tagged fish is eaten, the tag passes through the bird's digestive system.Sebring, S.H., Ledgerwood, R.D., Morrow, M., Sandford, B.P., Evans, A., District, W.W., 2012.

Early life and education Cutler was born in Ouray, Colorado on February 19, 1883. He studied engineering and architecture at the Rochester Athenium and Mechanics Institute in Rochester, New York (today known as Rochester Institute of Technology), graduating with a Bachelor of Architecture. Cutler married Marie Katherine Zahn.

Fremantle Prison was administered by a comptroller general, sheriff, or director, responsible for the entire convict or prison system, and a superintendent in charge of the prison itself. Prison officers, known as warders in the 19th century, guarded against escapes, enforced discipline, oversaw prisoner work, and instructed inmates in trades. Officers worked under stringent conditions until they achieved representation through the Western Australian Prison Officers Union. Convicts were initially of good character, as potential future colonists, but eventually less desirable convicts were sent, until the end of transportation in 1868. As a locally run prison, Fremantle's population was generally short-sentenced white prisoners in the 1890s, with very few Aboriginal prisoners; however, by the late 20th century, most prisoners were serving longer sentences, a higher proportion of them were violent, and Aboriginal people were over-represented. Administration Comptroller General Edmund Henderson Western Australia's first comptroller general of convicts, Edmund Henderson, arrived in the colony with the first convicts on board Scindian in June 1850. Henderson administered Western Australia's convict establishment for thirteen years; Battye writes that \\"its success was no doubt due to his wisdom and tact.\\" The primary responsibilities of the comptroller general were to \\"direct convict labour and be responsible for convict discipline\\". After Henderson's resignation in 1863, William Newland was appointed his successor. Newland's arrival closely followed the appointment of Governor John Hampton, who had previously been comptroller general of convicts in Van Diemen's Land. Hampton assumed far more direct control of Western Australia's convict establishment than his predecessors, and was in perpetual disagreement with Newland. As a direct consequence, Newland retired early in 1866, and was recalled to Britain at the expense of the Imperial Government. While awaiting a successor to the position, Governor Hampton appointed his son, George Hampton, to act in the position. George Hampton had no particular qualifications for the position, and already held a number of salaried posts. This \\"unusually blatant act of nepotism\\" was extremely unpopular within the colony, both Hamptons thereafter being figures of public hostility and ridicule. Under George Hampton, convict discipline became extremely strict, and escape attempts increased markedly. Henry Wakeford was appointed comptroller general of convicts in 1867, and the following year Governor Hampton's term ended. Wakeford reduced the size of the chain gangs, and the system returned to what it had been under Henderson. In 1872 Wakeford was transferred to the Colonial Office, leaving the responsibilities of the comptroller general's position to his office's chief clerk, W. B. Fauntleroy. Fauntleroy was confirmed as acting comptroller general later that year. In December 1877 the office of comptroller general was abolished, with Fauntleroy superannuated; his duties were passed on to the superintendent, John F. Stone, who was later appointed comptroller of convicts. With the transfer of Fremantle Prison to the colonial government in 1886, the role of the comptroller was replaced by that of the sheriff, responsible for all of the prisons in the colony. By the 1890s, the sheriff also held the post of inspector of prisons. The position of comptroller general was split off from the sheriff's office in early 1911, following the retirement of Sheriff Octavius Burt. In 1971, the Prisons Department was renamed the Department of Corrections, restructured, and the position of comptroller general was replaced with director of the department. =Superintendent= While the comptroller, sheriff, or director was responsible for the overall convict or prison system, largely centred around Fremantle Prison, the responsibility of the prison itself lay with the superintendent. Thomas Hill Dixon was the first superintendent of convicts, and was succeeded by Henry Maxwell Lefroy in 1859. Both men operated a prisoner classification system, until at least 1865, based on the type of convict, as well as their conduct and quality of their work. When Fremantle became a colonial prison, there was a restaffing, and as per other colonial prisons, there was no attempt at classification, until the end of the 19th century. W. A. George was superintendent at this time, appointed in 1897 amidst increasing population, prisoners, and escapes. While some writers consider George a repressive figure, who instigated little or no reform except as a result of the Royal Commission, others take the view that he was appointed at an inexpedient time for reform, with his endeavours opposed by his superiors. Hugh Hann was appointed superintendent following the retirement of George in 1911. Hann had prison experience outside Western Australia, and oversaw a period of reform at Fremantle Prison, working with a new Labor government and new comptroller general. Prisoner self-respect was an important concept for Hann, who noted in his 1912 report that \\"all our efforts are thrown away unless we can make them feel that they are not mere brutes, and get them to hold their heads up again like men.\\" Following a series of escapes in 1918, Hann was investigated by an enquiry, suspended, and charged with neglect of his duties; though eventually vindicated, his poor health ensured his retirement. Hann was succeeded by Andrew Badger, and remained in the position until 1933. Badger persisted with Hann's efforts for prisoner self- respect, with initiatives such as entertainment nights, where prisoners could see a films or concert. By the 1940s, the role of superintendent became a position filled through internal promotions. Officers =Pensioner guards= On convict ships, the convicts were guarded by pensioner guards, who were soldiers awarded pensions for their service in areas such as China, Crimea, and Afghanistan. Some remained in the military, but many opted to stay in the colony as settlers, having brought their wives and children with them. The pensioner guards were expected to help deal with any incidents of unrest at the prison. =Convict-era warders= The prison's officers were known as warders until the early 20th century. The first warders at Fremantle Prison, in the 1850s and 1860s, were a mixture of experienced men, who had guarded British prisons, and colonial men. There were varying levels of literacy and numeracy – no minimum standard was initially required. Warders lived in specially built terrace houses, within walking distance of the prison as their lives were just as regimented as the prisoners. They had to arrive on schedule, assemble for the superintendent, keep records of the convicts' behaviour and work, discipline prisoners, and face danger when prisoners refused to obey instructions. They were not paid well, and faced fines or dismissal for drinking alcohol, sleeping on the job, or other breaches of regulations. =Colonial prison warders= In the 1890s warders still have \\"little more freedom than the prisoners in their charge\\", due to the stringent living and working conditions, including ten- to twelve-hour working days. The warder's role became clearly defined in 1902, having previously been unwritten, and poorly known due to a high turnover rate in those immediately in charge of prisoners. Warders guarded against escapes, enforced discipline, oversaw prisoner work, and instructed inmates in trades. The warders were also supposed to be moral role models for prisoners, while maintaining a formal, distant, relationship. =20th century officers= The nature of 20th century prison officers did not change much, with the job entailing a boredom-inducing daily routine focused on security. The most significant difference was that prison officers achieved representation through the Western Australian Prison Officers Union. The strength of the union was based on the ability to almost cripple the prison system through strike action, first taken in 1975. The union agenda went beyond improvements to pay and conditions, which were achieved, and pushed objectives and policies that contradicted official policy. Prisoners =Convicts= Convicts were introduced into Western Australia for three main purposes: inexpensive labour, additional labour, and an injection of British government spending into the local economy. During the initial years of transportation, convicts were generally young, from a rural background, and of good character, having only committed minor offences – potential future colonists, after their sentence had been served. By the 1860s the majority were older, more serious offenders from urban areas, and the final group of convicts, arriving in January 1868 on Hougoumont, included sixty-two Fenians, political prisoners considered to be \\"difficult and dangerous\\". =19th century prisoners= Following the transfer of Fremantle Prison to local control in 1886, it became Western Australia's primary prison. Though some long term locally sentenced prisoners had been imprisoned there since 1858, in the late 1880s and 1890s the number of prisoners swelled dramatically. This increase predominately comprised prisoners serving shorter sentences of under three months. At the turn of the century, the majority of prisoners were \\"white Australian or European men, mostly working class, below the age of forty years and serving short sentences for minor offences\\". However, there was much diversity in the prisoner population: there were Chinese and other Asian prisoners, a small number of Aboriginal men, eighty juveniles, as well as range of people with low social status – \\"paupers, deaf mutes, the retarded\\" and \\"vagrants, lunatics and persons of weak intellect\\". Poverty, drunkenness, behavioural issues, and recidivism were major contributing factors in imprisonment for minor offences. =20th century prisoners= The number of prisoners in 1897 was 379, and Inspector of Prisons James Roe viewed the prison as \\"inconveniently full\\"; despite a large expansion of the prison system, the problem of overcrowding remained throughout the 20th century. So too did Western Australia's high incarceration rate relative to the rest of Australia. The nature of prisoners changed, with three times the proportion of 16- to 19-year-olds in 1984 compared to 1898, and a growing over-representation of Aboriginal prisoners to nearly half the prison population. The sentences also increased in length, such that in 1984 more than 80% of inmates were serving more than a year. In the 1970s and 1980s, there was an increasing number of prisoners committed for violent crimes, but still a minority of the population. Both staff and prisoners, however, perceived a notable increase in violence during these years, coinciding with the rise of illegal drugs in prison, and of sentences for drug-related offences.

Oil on canvas, 194 x 286 cm. Musée Fabre, Montpellier. Phaedra is a later work of Alexandre Cabanel, a French academic painter working from the 1840s until his death in 1889. This work was exhibited in the Salon of 1880 and later donated by Cabanel to the Musée Fabre, located in his hometown of Montpellier, France. Phaedra is a large oil painting of a classical subject in literature, which can be attributed to Cabanel's studies in the Paris École des Beaux-Arts.Blühm, Alexandre Cabanel, 94. As Cabanel's painting career developed, he expanded his style to preserve the French Academy while appealing to his personal interests in literature, often depicting new perspectives in contradiction with tradition. Alexandre Cabanel's painting of Phaedra exemplifies his pull toward academic paintings of theatrical heroines in reference to the social happenings of late nineteenth-century France. The painting depicts Phaedra stretched out on her side in a lavishly decorated bed, one arm at supporting her head and one hanging off the edge fingering the expensive drapery. She stares out of the left side of the picture plane, her face dark and resolute, while her unkempt hair is splayed on the decorated pillow. Her pale nude body covered by a sheer white sheet contrasts with the deep red, black, and gold tones around her. Two ladies in waiting are on the right. One is standing, but crouched over slightly, and active. Her body is half out of the picture plane as she peers over at Phaedra, hands clasped as if silently imploring the woman to move. The second lady sits at Phaedra's bedside sleeping, eyes closed, head leaned back, as if resting from the exhaustion of some heavy emotion. The luxurious fabrics on the bed are scattered and slipping off, as if the bed hadn't been made for a while. On the floor sits an expensive fur rug, its golden tones reminiscent of the shield, helmet, and sword tied to a column before Phaedra's bed. The furniture and architecture are adorned with oriental designs, creating a foreign look of drama and wealth. The light source for the painting comes from outside of the picture plane on the left, contrasting with the dimly lit lantern in the background. Technical properties =Medium= Cabanel used the oil painting technique, which creates a luminosity akin to the wealth and luxury of the subject, due to the shiny quality of the medium. This also gives the work a greater sense of depth, as the thin layers of paint provide striking visual effects to the contrasting dark and light colors in the scene. =Size= The size of the painting, a little over six by nine feet, is congruent with a traditional history painting, or a work depicting a historical event in monumental size in order to convey the importance and influence of that moment. This painting type was heavily used and venerated by the traditional group of academic painters, of which Cabanel was a part. However, in Cabanel's time, subjects from literature and mythology were also used for this painting type, as exemplified in Phaedra. Therefore, Cabanel, in alignment with his time, is taking an element of the traditional style and applying it to an alternate intelligent subject matter. Subject The subject of the work was brought on by Cabanel's affiliation with literature, an infatuation that began with the Paris École des Beaux-Arts. Cabanel spent time at the school as a student and teacher, where he was exposed to classical works of literature, as well as important French writers of the past centuries.Blühm, Alexandre Cabanel, 96. Cabanel would have studied Euripides' Hippolytus, written in 429 BCE, a play that details Phaedra's love and betrayal of her stepson, Hippolytus, who denies his stepmother's love. In her sorrow, Phaedra hangs herself, but leaves a suicide note of sorts calling Hippolytus her seducer. Theseus, her husband, banishes and ultimately kills his son, although the truth is revealed and their relationship reconciled before Hippolytus finally dies.James and Jondorf, \\"Introduction,\\" 1. However, a more recent version of the subject had been written by Racine in 1677, and was performed and celebrated during Cabanel's life.Blühm, Alexandre Cabanel, 109. Sylvain Amic suggests that, because of the contemporary attention to the play, Cabanel was likely trying to revive an interest in antiquity among the rapidly progressing art that rejected traditional subjects. In fact, the Salon program's description of Phaedra contained an excerpt from Euripides' classical play: “Consumed with love's sorrow, Phaedra has locked herself in her palace. A delicate veil covers her head. This is the third day she has gone without food as she is intent on ending her wretched existence.” This reference to antiquity was Cabanel's way of stating his own intelligence, while attempting to reach a larger group with the academic reminder of the subject's origins in antiquity. This excerpt also places Cabanel's Phaedra in a weakened and emotional moment, showing the artist's innovation in contrast to the often heroic and instructive works of the Academy. Further, Cabanel tended to progress his works according to people's tastes.Blühm, Alexandre Cabanel, 103. While opposed to the anti-academic modes of painting, Cabanel was able to accept certain changes within the painting world, attempting to use the progression as a way of circling contemporary thoughts back to the classical subjects accepted by the Academy. Phaedra can be understood as another way that the artist tried to assimilate his own artistic ideals with a developing artistic age. Rome and theatricality This work relays a certain level of theatricality, which can definitely be attributed to the main source of the work being a play, but also to the result of Cabanel's time spent painting in Italy, influencing his decorative works commissions. Cabanel received the Prix de Rome award for his accomplishments in history painting in 1845.Blühm, Alexandre Cabanel, 26. He spent the next five years in Rome, absorbing the dramatic Renaissance and Baroque works that permeate the city. Upon his return to Paris, Cabanel was commissioned to help decorate the Salon des Cariatides in the Hôtel de Ville.Blühm, Alexandre Cabanel, 45. The final work was destroyed, but his cartoons show influences of Michelangelo's heroic and thoughtful figures of the Sistine Chapel ceiling, Raphael's introspective philosophers and mathematicians of the School of Athens, and the theatrical compositions and movement of Annibale Carracci's Farnese Gallery decorations.Blühm, Alexandre Cabanel, 13. These cartoons are evidence of the effect that Roman works of the past had on Cabanel. The heroic figures are absent from Phaedra, but there is an air of brooding tension and drama that can reasonably be attributed to his influence by the Renaissance and Baroque masters. Elements from his past works Cabanel incorporates various elements of his earlier works into Phaedra, namely the aforementioned dramatic literature (see Subject), portraiture, and the female nude. =Portraiture= Alexandre Cabanel, Olivia Peyton Murray Cutting, 1887. Oil on canvas, 276 x 149 cm. Museum of the City of New York. Cabanel produced many works of portraiture throughout his painting career. His soft and precise depictions of women were very popular among the upper classes, establishing the artist as a viable resource for beautiful likenesses.Blühm, Alexandre Cabanel, 82. In his painting Olivia Peyton Murray Cutting, Cabanel utilized a dark background in order to emphasize the light skin of the woman.Blühm, Alexandre Cabanel, 75. Her dress is shiny and ornate, scrunched up where the fabric meets the furniture. Her chair and pillows are lavish and decorated, adding a luxurious effect. These elements can all be seen in Phaedra in the dark background illuminating her pale body, the luscious fabrics that shine and ripple, and the opulent luxury of her bedchamber's adornments. Further, Cabanel's model for the work was a distinguished banker's wife, alluding to the popularity of his portraiture techniques. =The Female Nude= Alexandre Cabanel, Birth of Venus, 1863. Oil on canvas, 130 x 225 cm. Musée d'Orsay, Paris. Cabanel's most famous female nude figure is his Birth of Venus. This work shows a reclining female nude with her hands above her head, harkening back to Titian's Bacchanal of the Andrians.Wolf, \\"Pointing the Way Ahead,\\" 62. Her sexualized pose emphasizes the erotic nature of Venus, while her overlapped legs suggest a soft modesty. While Phaedra is not overtly sexual, she is a horizontal nude whose character is associated with lustful love, showing continuity between Cabanel's past works and this one. What the critics thought Cabanel reached the height of his popularity when he showed the Birth of Venus, receiving critical acclaim for its innovation and beauty, recognizable even by Napoleon III who purchased the work. However, by the time he painted Phaedra, admiration for his style had dramatically lessened. Critics called the work lackluster and confusing. This was likely due to the odd mixture of Cabanel's wish to please the public while retaining the academic style and adding a personal, unique perspective. Academic critics thought Cabanel's portrayal of the classical Phaedra in a weak state was unbefitting, and his composition boring, especially in contrast to the luxurious setting. The avant-gardists completely rejected the academic style as a part of their struggle for artistic progression. Further, his public was either strictly academic or progressive, so Cabanel's in-between style appeared flat and uninteresting to his contemporaries. Even after his death in 1889, later critics looked back on Cabanel's works with disdain. Camille Mauclair in The Great French Painters described other of Cabanel's works from the Salon of 1880 as “unpleasant,” “without life or emotion,” and “pictures that do not take their proper place in the building.”Mauclair, The Great French Painters, 27-8. However, a modern audience can view the work with a different perspective, not bound by the French Academy or the need to expressly think in terms of the avant-garde. Cabanel's Phaedra can be seen as a culmination of the artist's practices and experiences melding together as a retrospective of his past, while struggling to retain a foothold in a fast-pace art world. Now, the richness of painting can be appreciated as it appears from an expert hand, finding the beauty in the “unpleasant” and emotion in the mundane, asserting, finally, a “proper place.” Notes References *Blühm, Andreas, ed., Sylvain Amic, Michel Hilaire, Wallrof-Richartz-Museum, and Musée Fabre.

St. Anthony is shown with some of his signature attributes, dressed in a monk's religious habit and cowl, carrying a staff with a tau-shaped handle and his bound girdle book hanging from his belt. The literary source from which this image derives is debated. The image could depict chapter 65 from Athanasius's Life of St. Anthony, where the hermit has a vision of himself floating through the air and undefined beings prevent him from ascending back to reality or it could show the ninth chapter of Athanasius's Life of St. Anthony, where St. Anthony is attacked by the devil in the form of animals and beasts in the Egyptian desert and is levitated in the air by his practice of rigorous asceticism.Massing 1984 Technique In The Temptation of St. Anthony, Schongauer's engraving technique forms the image from dots, lines and areas of hatching, varying spaces between them in order to enhance the interaction of white and black.Koreny 1993, p. 385 The engraving exists in two states with only minor details added to the second.Martin Schongauer, The Temptation of St Anthony, engraving at the British Museum Parallel and fine cross hatching can be seen in the hermit's drapery and in the texture of the devils. Contour hatching can also be seen in the drapery of the monk as well as on the battered crags in the right hand corner. Tick hatching is seen in sky which indicates the atmosphere. The vast amount of negative space in the background accentuates St. Anthony's vulnerability while the curving and horizontal lines of the devils add energy and movement. The grotesque devils are illustrated with a mixture of body parts from different animals. Schongauer's mastery of texture is shown by giving the viewer a sense of how each beast would feel ranging from the roughness of the scales to the soft hairiness of the fur. The heavily worked foreground is balanced by progressively more isolated lines in the background, showing his control of light. Literary source The Temptation of St. Anthony depicts no real landscape besides a battered crag in the right hand corner leaving room for debate on what exact moment in the life of St. Anthony this scene depicts. Some scholars believe the scene depicts chapter 65 of Athanasius’s Life of St. Anthony, their primary argument being that the attack takes place in the air which parallels with St. Anthony’s description of ecstasy in this chapter. Chapter 65 tells the tale of when St. Anthony was about to eat dinner and suddenly felt himself carried off as if he was outside of his body. Undefined beings stood in his way preventing him from ascending and “as his guides offered resistance, the others demanded on what plea he was not accountable to them…. Then as they brought accusations but could not prove them, the way was opened up to him free and unhindered and presently he saw himself approaching so it seemed to him and halting with himself and so he was the real Anthony again.” This chapter emphasizes the difference between good and bad spirits then goes on to talk about the devil and how many battles one must pass through the air in order to achieve celestial ascent. Michelangelo, The Torment of Saint Anthony, , Kimbell Art Museum Some scholars argue the image instead depicts chapter nine of Athanasius's Life of St. Anthony. In chapter nine Athanasius records when the saint was living in a cave in Egypt when the devil attacked him and left him half-dead. A friend found him and helped him recover and once St. Anthony had regained consciousness he asked to be sent back to fight these demons who took the shape of animals and beasts. The British Museum which owns a copy of the print describes the hermit's ascent: “the rigorous asceticism practiced by St Anthony in the Egyptian desert allowed him to levitate in the air, where he was attacked by devils trying to beat him to the ground,” and soon after the creatures were driven away by the apparitions of Christ. Texts that describe the attack provide few descriptive details, leaving room for artistic expression. In the Golden Legend, Jacopo da Voragine describes the devils as animals that attacked the saint with horns, claws and teeth.Heck 1996, p. 288 Schongauer's monogram Schongauer was the first artist to sign all of his prints with a monogram. In The Temptation of St Anthony one can identify the date of the print by Schongauer's monogram. The image is one of the artist's early works. In his first ten prints his monogram is characterized by the M having vertical shanks, as opposed to the oblique shanks which appear in the rest of his prints after. The S in his earlier works is much thicker around the curves and finishes in diagonal strokes similar to roman capitals. This trait is seen in more than his first ten works but seems to decrease in his later works. It is hypothesized that Schongauer used a stamp in his first ten engravings, which he later lost and began hand writing his monogram thereafter.  Legacy  This etching inspired many artists after Schongauer including Michelangelo who copied the engraving as a boy in his 1487-88 painting, The Torment of Saint Anthony. now in the collection of the Kimbell Art Museum. In addition, this engraving has served as inspiration for later paintings on the same episode, such as The Temptation of St. Anthony by Jan Brueghel the Elder, where the same scene is shown in the upper right.  Collections  The prints can be found for example in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Art Institute of Chicago, Rhode Island School of Design Museum.

The forests of Mexico cover a surface area of about 64 million hectares, or 34.5% of the country. These forests are categorized by the type of tree and biome: tropical forests, temperate forests, cloud forests, riparian forests, deciduous, evergreen, dry, moist, etc.. The agency in charge of Mexico's forests is the Comisión Nacional Forestal. History Forest areas were historically part of indigenous communities' commons for hunting, gathering, and fuel. Areas of Mexico were deforested in the prehispanic period around Teotihuacan. In the colonial era, forests were a source of timber for construction, for fuel in smelting metals, and for household fuel. Forested lands were included in indigenous community lands in the colonial era. In the late nineteenth century, during the Proficiat (1876-1910), the national government ignored previous practices of leaving many forested areas in the hands of indigenous communities began implementing forest management policies and unfettered exploitation of woodlands for their timber and water resources. Wood was used for construction and fuel, as well as in the Puebla-Tlaxcala region, for pulp paper.Juárez Flores, José Juan, \\"Besieged Forests at Century's End: Industry, Speculation, and Dispossession in Tlaxcala's La Malintzin Woodlands, 1860-1910\\" in Christopher R. Boyer, ed. The Land Between Waters: Environmental Histories of Modern Mexico. Tucson: University of Arizona Press 2012, pp. 100-123. In Chihuahua and in Michoacán and forests were exploited by timber companies. One scholar argues that the change in practice politicized the forested landscape and was an aspect of the commodification of nature, with liberal economic policies undermined collective indigenous rights to land and its resources.Boyer, Christopher R. Political Landscapes: Forests, Conservation, and Community in Mexico. Durham: Duke University Press 2015. Although forests had historically been utilized, the late nineteenth century marked the beginning of industrial-scale exploitation.Boyer, Political Landscapes, p. 29. Tropical rainforests Rainforest canopy at the Parque-Museo La Venta (open-air museum of La Venta). Rainforests are found predominantly along the southeastern Atlantic coast, in regions with frequent rain and warm temperatures that allow for plants to retain their foliage year-round. The average rainfall in these forests is above 2,000 mm and temperature is always higher than 18 °C, with little variation (usually staying between 23 °C and 25 °C). = Lacandon Jungle = The Lacandon Jungle is an area of rainforest which stretches from Chiapas into Guatemala and into the southern part of the Yucatán Peninsula. The heart of this rainforest is located in the Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve in Chiapas near the border with Guatemala in the Montañas del Oriente region of the state. Although most of the jungle outside the reserve has been partially or completely destroyed and damage continues inside the reserve, the Lacandon is still the largest montane rainforest in North America and one of the last ones left large enough to support jaguars. It contains 1,500 tree species, 33% of all Mexican bird species, 25% of all Mexican animal species, 44% of all Mexican diurnal butterflies and 10% of all Mexico's fish species. Temperate forests Mexico is home to 50 species of pine (about half of pine species) and about 200 species of oak (about a third of oak species). It is estimated that temperate forests in Mexico contain about 7,000 species of plants. =Monarch butterfly forests= Monarch butterflies clustering on the trunks and branches of oyamels. The Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve contains the over-wintering habitats of the eastern population of the monarch butterfly. The reserve is located in the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt pine-oak forests ecoregion on the border of Michoacán and Mexico State. Millions of butterflies arrive in the preserve annually. Butterflies only inhabit a fraction of the 56,000 hectares of the reserve from October–March. The biosphere's mission is not only to protect the butterfly species, but its habitat as well. The composition of the forest varies with altitude: * oak species up to 2900 metres above sea level * oak and pines between 1500 and 3000 masl * oyamel fir between 2400 and 3600 masl. Tropical and subtropical dry forests Dry pine- oak forest during the dry season Paralleling the Pacific Coast in southwestern Mexico is a series of diverse tropical dry forests, adapted to an absence of rainfall for certain months of the year. Many trees here drop their leaves during the dry season but warm temperatures help to nurture plant life, which in turns supports a large number of animal species. This global ecoregion is made up of eight terrestrial ecoregions: Jalisco dry forests; Balsas dry forests; Bajío dry forests; Chiapas Depression dry forests; Sonoran-Sinaloan transition subtropical dry forest; Southern Pacific dry forests; Sinaloan dry forests; and Sierra de la Laguna dry forests. The Jalisco Dry Forests are a region of large diversity in Mexico. Characteristic features of this forest are that the trees lose their leaves for a long period of time during the dry season and the forest is unusual in that it rarely burns. The Chiapas Depression is a dry forest valley in southern Mexico and western Guatemala. Variations in altitude here have created amazingly diverse habitats for nearly 1,000 different dry adapted plant species. Cloud forests Five environmental requirements seem to govern the presence of cloud forests in Mexico: high relative humidity, montane environments, irregular topography, deep litter layer and temperate climate. Cloud forests are found in small areas of 20 states, at altitudes between 600 and 3,100 masl. It is estimated that they are composed of nearly 10% of the plant species in the country (about 2,500 species) of which 30% are unique to these forests. Of these, about 1,300 species are dicots, 700 are monocots, 500 are ferns and 10 are gymnosperms. There are also 800 epiphytes. %- Issues in forestry The National Forestry Commission has taken an important role in managing Mexico's forests. Policy-makers have attempted to address deforestation in some areas by paying landowners (cash or non-cash) to conserve forests, upstream management of forests aimed at long term sustainability of downstream water.Muñoz-Piña, Carlos, Alejandro Guevara, Juan Manuel Torres, and Josefina Braña. \\"Paying for the hydrological services of Mexico's forests: Analysis, negotiations and results.\\" Ecological economics 65, no. 4 (2008): 725-736.

Clement, \\"A Westport Artist Whose Inspiration Is Cinematic,\\" Fairfield County Times Monthly (March 1, 1998): 22-24.Jules Heller and Nancy Heller, North American Women Artists of the Twentieth Century: A Biographical Dictionary (New York: Taylor and Francis, 2013): 123.Joyce Zimmerman, \\"Blue Monday,\\" Woman: Where Women Make The News (August 1, 1998). Born and raised in New York City, Chernow studied music and art from a young age and acquired an affinity for the arts. Chernow was exposed to several movies that left a lasting impression and prompted her to make the likenesses of leading ladies. Bette Davis, Joan Crawford, Norma Shearer and Katharine Hepburn were the subjects of some of her works in the late 1990s. In most of her works, however, Chernow avoids specificity, choosing instead to portray universal situations through figures who are inspired by film but reinterpreted to transcend stereotypes.Herbert Lust, \\"Reel to Real,\\" in Ann Chernow: A Catalogue Raisonné, Prints 1968–2000 (West Haven, CT: Amity Art Foundation, 2001), 3–6. Chernow has worked extensively in the mediums of lithography, silkscreen, etching, and colored pencil. She currently resides in Westport, Connecticut, and serves her community through the arts.Rita Papazian, \\"Westport artist brings to fruition the work of her late husband,\\" Connecticut Post (March 8, 1998). Early life and education Born in New York City, to Mollie Citrin and Edward Levy, Chernow was the oldest of three girls.Deborah Frizzell, \\"Ann Chernow: Transforming Hollywood's Heroines.\\" Woman's Art Journal 22 (2001): 34-39. Her mother was an amateur singer and her father was a performing violinist, so she and her sisters received music and art lessons as children; Ann began at the age of five. Her first formal art education was at the Memorial Art Gallery in Rochester in the early 1940s, where she attended art classes in the museum galleries. After her family moved to Flushing in 1946, she studied under a local Italian painter, Giuseppe Trotta. Years after taking lessons with Trotta, Chernow eventually entered the School of Fine Arts at Syracuse University in 1953, but transferred soon after to New York University, where she earned her Master of Arts degree in 1969. As an undergraduate and graduate at NYU (1955–69), Chernow studied under the direction of several artists. Her instructors and mentors included Howard Conant, Jules Olitski, Irving Sandler, Lawrence Alloway and Hale Woodruff, all of whom influenced her through their teachings and artistic viewpoints. Toward the end of her academic education and for a few years afterwards, she worked for the art educator Victor D’Amico, and taught at the studio school of the Museum of Modern Art (1966–71). Personal life After completing her undergraduate degree at NYU in 1957, Chernow married her first husband, Phil Chenok, and had two sons, David (b. 1959) and Daniel (b. 1964). The couple divorced in 1969, when Chernow was enrolled in graduate school. While studying with Howard Conant, she met her second husband, Burt Chernow, with whom she subsequently worked at the Museum of Modern Art. Burt Chernow was an art historian and professor at Housatonic Community College, where he founded the Housatonic Museum of Art in 1967. The couple married in 1970 and remained together until his death in 1997. She was the life partner of actor Martin West until his death on 31 Dec 2019.https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/nytimes/obituary.aspx?n=martin- west&pid;=194899133 Work In the 1950s, Chernow's style was centered on colorful abstractions, which were influenced by Jean Dubuffet, who was famous during that period. She subsequently dabbled in a variety of styles in the 1970s, including huge billboard paintings, sepia drawings of individual women and colored pencil drawings. Already in 1968, she had begun to explore lithography, although she only began to work seriously in printmaking (both lithography and etching) in 1978. She reached the height of her career with a number of evocative paintings in the late 1980s and early 1990s, which depicted starlets of the 1930s and 1940s, as in Artist and Models (1998). In these later works, Chernow used close-ups of women who were quickly passed by the camera, as opposed to celebrated stars of the screen.Michael Rush, \\"Ann Chernow: Silver Screen,\\" Art New England 18 (June/July 1997): 31. Chernow aims to reveal the \\"unsentimental truth\\" in her art by showing an image that jogs a memory and brings about a nostalgia which her viewers can understand because they see something familiar.

On 22 August 2014, the Botswana High Court in Gaborone ordered the government of Botswana to provide ARV medication to the prisoners. Background The case was brought by two Zimbabwean citizens who were imprisoned in Gaborone Central Prison and the Botswana Network on Ethics, Law and HIV/AIDS (BONELA). The two prisoners were both diagnosed as HIV-positive in prison. They were denied ARV treatment despite that their physical conditions met the treatment criteria under the government's Treatment Guidelines. The government denied them ARV treatment on the basis that they were not citizens. HIV-positive prisoners who were citizens were given access to ARV treatment at state expense in terms of the government's policy at the time. Litigation The applicants brought a legal challenge against the government's refusal to provide the inmates with ARV treatment in the High Court in Gaborone. They argued that their denial of access to treatment, and the policy underlying the government's refusal to provide treatment, were unlawful and unconstitutional. =Default judgment= The state respondents initially failed to defend the application. Default judgment was therefore issued in the applicants' favour in March 2014. The default judgment was rescinded with the parties’ consent on 19 March 2014. =High Court judgment= The merits of the case were argued in the Gaborone High Court on 10 June 2014. On 22 August 2014, Judge Bengame Sechele ruled in the applicants' favour. The Court held that the policy denying foreign prisoners ARV treatment was unlawful in terms of the common law, statutory law and the Constitution of Botswana. The Court held that denying the prisoners ARV treatment unjustifiably limited their rights to life, equality, and freedom from inhuman and degrading treatment. The Court ordered the Botswana government to enroll all foreign prisoners who meet the treatment criteria on ARV treatment. The government respondents initially indicated an intention to comply with the Court's order but have since appealed the High Court decision to the Botswana Court of Appeal.

Properties 1\\\\. \\\\omega_n(0)=0, \\\\omega_n(0+)=0. 2\\\\. \\\\omega_n is non- decreasing on [0,\\\\infty). 3\\\\. \\\\omega_n is continuous on [0,\\\\infty). 4\\\\. For m\\\\in\\\\N, t\\\\geq 0 we have: ::\\\\omega_n(mt)\\\\leq m^n\\\\omega_n(t). 5\\\\. \\\\omega_n(f,\\\\lambda t)\\\\leq (\\\\lambda +1)^n\\\\omega_n(f,t), for \\\\lambda>0. 6\\\\. For r\\\\in \\\\N let W^r denote the space of continuous function on [-1,1] that have (r-1)-st absolutely continuous derivative on [-1,1] and ::\\\\left \\\\f^{(r)} \\\\right \\\\_{L_{\\\\infty}[-1,1]}<+\\\\infty. :If f\\\\in W^r, then ::\\\\omega_r(t,f,[-1,1])\\\\leq t^r \\\\left \\\\f^{(r)} \\\\right \\\\_{L_{\\\\infty}[-1,1]}, t\\\\geq 0, :where \\\\g(x)\\\\_{L_{\\\\infty}[-1,1]}={\\\\mathrm{ess} \\\\sup}_{x\\\\in [-1,1]}g(x). Applications Moduli of smoothness can be used to prove estimates on the error of approximation. Due to property (6), moduli of smoothness provide more general estimates than the estimates in terms of derivatives. For example, moduli of smoothness are used in Whitney inequality to estimate the error of local polynomial approximation. Another application is given by the following more general version of Jackson inequality: For every natural number n, if f is 2\\\\pi-periodic continuous function, there exists a trigonometric polynomial T_n of degree \\\\le n such that :\\\\left f(x)-T_n(x \\\\right )\\\\leq c(k)\\\\omega_k\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{n},f\\\\right),\\\\quad x\\\\in[0,2\\\\pi], where the constant c(k) depends on k\\\\in\\\\N.

Bohnen's work is generally conceptual in nature, often in the form of self-portraits that capture the motions of her body. She originally created works using predominantly graphite, but added photography to her repertoire in 1974 to continue her exploration of movement and the human form, titling each work after the motions she was making to create each work. Her drawings feature a grid format that she used to arrange the severely limited and carefully executed motions of her hand that she captured in the graphite, resulting in monochromatic drawings that assert their reality as markings on paper instead of an illusion of something else, as seen in Motion Touching Five Points with Graphite Stick (1973), One Motion with Graphite Stick, Horizontal and Vertical (1974), and Motion Touching Five Points (1975; Art Institute of Chicago). In contrast to her drawings, which focus on the motions of the arm and hand, Bohnen's photographs primarily address the motions of the head. With her photography, Bohnen used various shutter speeds to overlap blurred images to provoke strong emotional and intellectual reactions about motion and identity,Koeppel, Fredric. \\"Brooks Exhibit a Sum of Many Parts—Asst.

One's threshold is said to reflect levels of anaerobiosis and lactate accumulation. As the intensity level of the activity being performed increases, breathing becomes faster; more steadily first and then more rapid as the intensity increases. When breathing surpasses normal ventilation rate, one has reached ventilatory threshold. For most people this threshold lies at exercise intensities between 50% and 75% of VO2 max. A major factor affecting one's ventilatory threshold is their maximal ventilation (amount of air entering and exiting lungs). This is dependent on their personal experience with the activity and how physically fit the person is. Comparison studies of more athletic people have shown that your ventilatory threshold occurs at a higher intensity if you are more active or have been training for that exercise; although, in some cases shorter continuous tests can be used because of rapid alterations in ventilation.  Methods  * Ventilation Curve – Plot VE vs. VO2 or Watts or Time – The point at which there is a non‐linear increase in ventilation * V‐Slope Method – Plot VO2 vs. VCO2 – The point at which the increase in VCO2 is greater than the increase in VO2 * Ventilatory Equivalents Method – Plot VE/VO2 and VE/VCO2 vs. Watts or time or VO2 – Point at which VE/VO2 increases while VE/VCO2 decreases or stays the same.  Sample values  Frangolias DD, Rhodes EC School of Human Kinetics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise [1995, 27(7):1007-1013]: A government experiment to test ventilatory threshold was held between November and December 2004. Subjects included 32 physically active males (age: 22.3; TV: 180.5; TM: 75.5 kg; VO2max: 57.1 mL/kg/min) encountered a continuous test of increasing loads on a treadmill, cardiorespiratory and other variables were observed using ECG (recording of the electrical activity of the heart) and gas analyzer. During the test, subjects were asked to point at a scale from 6 to 20 reflecting their feeling of discomfort. The RPE threshold was recorded as constant value of 12-13. Averages of ventilatory and RPE threshold were conveyed by parameters that were monitored and then compared by using t-test for dependent samples. No significant difference was found between mean values of ventilatory and RPE threshold, when they were expressed by parameters such as: speed, load, heart rate, absolute and relative oxygen consumption. The conclusion of this experiment was: the fixed value (12-13) of RPE scale may be used to detect the exercise intensity that corresponds to ventilatory threshold.  VO2 max levels  Maximum oxygen intake, VO2, is one of the best measures of cardiovascular fitness and maximal aerobic power. VO2 max averages around 35–40 mL/(kg∙ min) in a healthy male and 27–31 mL/ (kg∙ min) in a healthy female. These scores can improve with training. Factors that affect your VO2 max are age, sex, fitness, training, and genetics. While scores in the upper 80s and 90s have been recorded by legendary endurance athletes such as Greg Lemond, Miguel Indurain, and Steve Prefontaine, most competitive endurance athletes have scores in the mid to high 60s. Cycling, rowing, swimming and running are some of the main sports that push VO2 levels to the maximum. Ventilatory threshold and lactate threshold are expressed as a percentage of VO2 max; beyond this percentage the ability to sustain the work rate rapidly declines as high intensity but short duration energy systems such as glycolysis and ATP-PC are relied on more heavily.

The driving force for heat transfer can also be indirect. It comes from cross-couplings among different transport processes and transfer heat isothermally in thermal waves/resonances. It can be in various forms and tuned precisely via manipulating the cross coupling.Wang L. Q., Zhou X. S. and Wei X.

Gynomorph is a word used to describe an organism with female physical characteristics. Mythology In Greek mythology and religion, a gynomorph was a bi-gendered god with both masculine and feminine characteristics. Gynomorphs were portrayed as effeminate young males, like Dionysos, a masculine god who possessed distinctly feminine features. Gynomorphs retained the creative capacity of female divinities, they had cosmic wombs, but they also possessed the inseminating abilities attributed to male divinities. Biology In biology, a gynomorph is an organism with female physical characteristics, whereas an andromorph is an organism with male physical characteristics. For instance, some female damselflies show colour variations typically found in males. Andromorphs, by resembling males, are thought to benefit from avoiding male harassment. Some authors have proposed that this benefit is offset by a higher probability of detection for andromorphs compared to gynomorphs owing to differences in body colouration.

He lived in Mangalvedhe, near Pandharpur - where the chief temple of Vithoba stands. He was in charge of the revenue of the district and the keeper of the royal grain storehouses. A great famine struck the region. A Brahmin (the priest caste) from Pandharpur comes begging for food at Damaji's house. Damaji Pant Deshpande invites him home and serves him dinner. The Brahmin breaks down seeing the food and talks about the suffering of his starving family, which he left behind at Pandharpur. Damaji promises to send food for the family too. Damaji's servants bring two loads of grain to the Brahmin's family in Pandharpur, however the people of the famine-hit town pounce on the grains and loot them. A delegation of other Brahmins from Pandharpur approach Damaji and beseech him to solve their problem of hunger. Damaji thinks that if he distributes the royal grain, numerous people will saved from starvation, however the sultan will kill him. Damaji decides to sacrifice his life to save the lives of the people. He opens the two royal grain storehouses to the famished people. Damaji granted the grain disregarding the differences of caste or class. An \\"evil\\" Brahmin muzumdar (deputy revenue collector) shot off a letter to the sultan in Bidar informing him of the plunder of the royal grain. The sultan was enraged how Damaji distributed the grain without his permission. He sent soldiers to recover money for the grain from Damaji or bring Damaji to Bidar for decapitation if he failed to pay. Receiving the royal summons, Damaji leaves for Bidar to visit the sultan, but requests the soldiers for a halt in Pandharpur. He visits Vithoba's temple and worships the god. He says to Vithoba that he has wronged the sultan, but he is ready to face the consequences of his noble deed, and his life was complete by worshipping Vithoba. Vithoba disguises him as a Mahar (outcaste) and reaches the sultan's court in Bidar. Vithoba introduces himself as a child who was brought up in Damaji's house and works as his servant. He presents the minister a letter in Damaji's handwriting. The letter reads how Damaji sold the grain for high prices when food had become scarce in the famine, thus increases the sultan's earnings. Further, it said that he had sent his servant with the money and the accounts. Vithoba presents the king with a small bag of gold, but when opened, the \\"countless\\" coins flow out of it. The sultan is pleased and accepts the money. He gives Vitoba a receipt of the money received and sends many gifts to Damaji with Vithoba. The next day, Damaji arrives at the royal court. The sultan embraces him and tells about his Mahar messenger. Damaji realizes that Vithoba rescued him assuming the form of a Mahar and sings a panegyric in honour of the god. The sultan is astonished and praises Damaji, due to whom, the sultan met God. Damaji asks permission to leave the sultan's service, the sultan consents saying that God was now Damaji's debtor. Damaji settles in Pandharpur with his family and serves the god and sings kirtans in his honour. Dating and historicity While some scholars had dismissed Damaji as a legendary figure earlier, a discovery of an undated mahajar (testimonial of right) document is interpreted by historian V.K. Rajwade to be historical evidence for Damaji. The first part of the document states which kind of animal should be ridden by a bridegroom of a particular caste in his marriage procession. The second part deals with what a Mahar should get from different castes. The document mentions: \\"By order of the Badshah (king of Bidar) and his seal and in the handwriting of Damaji Pant\\". The famine of 1460 is called \\"Damaji Pant's famine\\" in the Deccan region, as it is believed to the famine when Damaji distributed the grain. The famine was a result of failure of the monsoon and widespread across Western India. Others relate Damaji to the Durga Devi famine (1396-1408) or the famine from 1468 to 1475. Remembrance Apart from being formally included in the list of Sants (saints) in the Bhaktavijaya, the abhangas of Eknath and Tukaram accord him sainthood and mention him with other saints. Eknath's abhanga praises Vithoba who came a Mahar to rescue Damaji. Besides naming the 1460 famine on him, his contributions were also alluded to in the Great Famine of 1876–78. Mr. Grant, the collector of Solapur, was called Damaji Pant for his efforts to remedy the famine. A temple in his honour stands in his home town at Mangalvedha.

As a painter, she used the pseudonym Cupera.  Biography  Nelly van Doesburg Moorsel was born on 27 July 1899 in The Hague. She was a life long champion of De Stijl movement and advisor to notable American art collector, bohemian and socialite Peggy Guggenheim. In 1920 she met Theo Van Doesburg through her brother, who had a subscription to the magazine De Stijl, published by Van Doesburg. During the opening of the La Section d'Or exhibition in The Hague on 11 July 1920, she would immediately fell in love with him. Her Catholic parents did not appreciate the association with Van Doesburg, who was not only Protestant, but also married. She ran away from home around the turn of the year from 1920-1921 and was received in Leiden by J.J.P. Oud and Van Doesburg's wife Lena Milius. During her relationship with Van Doesburg she was introduced to the world of modern art. Van Doesburg took her on a lecture tour through Europe in March 1921, during which they also visited Piet Mondriaan in Paris. From April 1921 she lived with Van Doesburg in Weimar. In December she spent a few weeks in Vienna to reflect on her future. Here she met the Hungarian artist Lajos Kassák, publisher of the magazine Ma. Aktivista Folyóirat (Present Activists Magazine). After this a correspondence between Kassák and Theo van Doesburg arose. On 24 September 1922 she visited with Theo, Cor van Eesteren and others, the Städtische Kunstverein by Walter Dexel in Jena. The following day she played compositions by Vittorio Rieti during a dada evening at Hotel Fürstenhof in Weimar, in which Jean Arp and Tristan Tzara also participated. In January-February 1923 she participated with her future husband and the artists Kurt Schwitters and Vilmos Huszár, under her stage name Pétro, on the Dutch Dada tour. During these evenings she played music by Satie and Rieti. After this tour, she played compositions by Arthur Honegger, Daniël Ruyneman, Francis Poulenc, Josef Hauer and Egon Wellesz during a \\"Modern Soirée\\" on 12 March at the Lily Green dance school in The Hague. The Taste of Style Art by the composer Jakob van Domselaer also featured in her repertoire. In addition, under the pseudonym Cupera she made a number of paintings, in which influences from De Stijl can be recognized. In Paris she enjoyed some fame as a dancer as Sonia Pétrowska. From 2 October 1929 to 5 January 1930 she organized the ESAC (Expositions Sélectes d'Art Contemporain) of \\"contemporary young Parisian painting\\" at the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam and Pulchri Studio in The Hague. Van Doesburg also participated in this exhibition under her pseudonym P. Cupera. After Theo van Doesburg's death, widow Nelly van Doesburg committed herself to keeping the memory of her husband alive. She wanted to help the one-sided image, that he was primarily a follower instead of an innovator of modern art, out of the world. To this end, she organized a series of exhibitions of his work. She also provided a good shelter for a large part of his paintings by selling them to the best collections of modern art in the world. Many paintings by Van Doesburg ended up in the United States, for example in the Museum of Modern Art and the Guggenheim collections, because Van Doesburg was friends with Peggy Guggenheim, who acted as her agent in America. In the fifties she also made some reproductions in silkscreen of her husband's works. Van Doesburg's remaining collection, consisting mainly of archive material, studies, photographs and drawings, left Nelly van Doesburg to her cousin Wies van Moorsel, who donated it to the Dutch Nation in 1981. The collection is managed by the Netherlands Institute for Cultural Heritage and the Netherlands Institute for Art History. She also remained active in the artists' circuit. She had a short relationship with the German architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. She was also, as an important witness of the entire Stijl movement, a good source for, among others, the book Holland Dada by K. Schippers. At the end of her life she returned to her roots and she became Catholic again. It is rumoured that Nelly van Doesburg had an affair with Jazz musician Thelonious Monk who she met whilst in at the Minton's Playhouse, and continued the relationship in the De Stijl house in Meudon. Nelly van Doesburg died at the age of 76 from the consequences of breast cancer in the home and studio designed by Theo van Doesburg in Meudon, France.

The mill is listed as a Rijksmonument. History In 1856, a tower mill was built for B Vels. It was named the Velsmolen. The mill was demolished in 1920 due to its poor condition. The mill was replaced by a smock mill, which used the smock of the Buursinkmolen, Zelhem, Gelderland and machinery from various mills. It had a pair of Patent sails and a pair of Common sails. On 10 August 1925, the mill was severely damaged in a storm. Most of the shutters of the Patent sails were lost, with some of them being found away. The mill was not repaired, and was used by the local fire brigade for training exercises. In 1976, the mill was sold to the Gemeente Doetinchem. The mill was restored in 1980. Its name was changed from Velsmolen to Benninkmolen, after its first owner, J F Bennink. On restoration, the Patent sails were replaced by Common sails.

The first issue of the series released on 8 October 2014 and is currently published through Image Comics. The rights for a film adaptation have been purchased by Plan B Entertainment. Synopsis The series follows the Rook family, in particular their daughter Sailor. The family moved to the town of Litchfield, NH following an incident involving Sailor and a particularly vicious school bully named Annie. In this incident, Sailor was attacked and Annie went missing, prompting rumors that Sailor killed her. Eventually the speculation grows to the point where Sailor's father Charlie and mother Lucy decide that the only thing to do is move the family to a neighboring town in the hopes of starting over again. This proves to be unsuccessful as some of the rumors have followed the family and Sailor still feels ostracized from her new school peers. The family is also largely unaware that the town is home to its own supernatural secrets, in particular a tradition where a person will pledge another to strange beings, wytches, in the nearby forest in order to gain a boon from them. Sailor is eventually captured by the wytches after being \\"pledged\\", smeared with a green liquid that attracts them and identifies the pledge as a sacrifice. Charlie is attacked by a hunter at the same time, who tells him how to hide from and fight the wytches, whose lair is hidden beneath an enormous tree with ginger root clumps growing above ground. Charlie and Sailor escape and race home, closely pursued by a large number of devotees of the wytches. At home, Charlie and Sailor are attacked by Lucy, who reveals she pledged Sailor in exchange for having her paralysis healed, as well as paying a debt to the wytches owed by her great-grandfather. She begs Charlie to pledge Sailor again, after which they'll erase their memories of her and be able to restart their lives. Charlie smears the pledge on himself and Lucy, telling Sailor to run and find the Irons, a family of wytch hunters. Sailor escapes through the basement, and is confronted by a large number of her schoolmates, all of whom have received boons from the wytches. Sailor uses a garden sprayer to dose them all with pledge, and the wytches slaughter all of them as Sailor escapes. Development Snyder came up with the idea for Wytches after recalling a childhood experience where he and a friend made up stories about a family of satanists living in a nearby Pennsylvania forest that were constantly trying to capture the two boys. He later revisited the area out of nostalgia and saw a moving object that looked vaguely human, which made Snyder think that there was something in the forest that had been waiting for him to return. This idea translated into the concept of witches that would patiently wait for their victims as opposed to chasing after them, as they knew that the victims would inevitably be drawn back to the witches' location. This further expanded into the idea that the witches would have \\"this incredible knowledge of their ancient natural science\\" that would enable them to perform various feats like curing various illnesses and extending life spans, which they would trade with locals in exchange for the individual pledging a person to the witches. Snyder also choose to have the witches not possess magical abilities and instead be \\"a bestial, primal creature that lives deep in the woods\\" and decided to add in the concept of parental fear, that a parent would be ultimately incapable of protecting their children 24 hours a day, regardless of effort. Film adaptation Shortly after the series released its first issue in October 2014, Plan B Entertainment announced that they had purchased film rights to the work with the intent to turn it into a major motion picture. They also announced that Snyder and Jock would serve as executive producers, with Brad Pitt, Dede Gardner and Jeremy Kleiner producing. Reception Comics Alliance and Comic Book Resources both praised the first issue of the series, and Comic Book Resources noted that although the issue \\"has a few minor slips\\" it was ultimately \\"at once outlandish and grotesque and alarmingly intimate in the way it dishes out horror.\\" IGN also gave a favorable review, writing \\"Wytches #1 proves a great debut, driven by the artistic pairing of Scott Snyder and Jock. The narrative, though rushed, is an intriguing one, Snyder ably balancing the mystery with the menace. The art by Jock is both shocking and enticing, made better by the moody colors provided by Matt Hollingsworth. This is a book you'll want to be reading.\\" References Category:Comics by Scott Snyder ","title":"Wytches (comics)"},{"id":"44606349","title":"Husne Ara Shahed"},{"id":"44606384","text":"Rear Admiral Peter Tomlinson was a South African Navy officer.

As more than 80% of these crab were caught by Wanli fishermen, the New Taipei City Government decided to establish a Wanli Crab brand name in 2012 to boost the market value of the branded crab. Once caught, the Wanli Crab are immediately tied up using a unique neon-green nylon cord. This unique colored cord thus becomes the identification to distinguish Wanli Crab from other crab caught by non-Wanli fishermen.  Species  The Wanli Crab brand includes three species: the flower crab (Charybdis feriatus), the three-spot crab (Portunus sanguinolentus, red-spotted swimming crab), and the Charybdis natator.  Fisheries  Most of the Wanli Crab comes from the Northwest Fishery located 35 nautical miles from the Fugui Cape in New Taipei City. Besides unloading the crab caught at nearby fishing ports in Wanli and Shimen, Wanli Crab fishermen will also distribute the crab via ports in Taichung and Penghu when they go crabbing down-south during the spring emerging to summer seasons. Approximately 550 to 600 tons of Wanli Crab are caught each year. Wanli Crab accounts for more than 80% of the annual production of sea-crab in Taiwan.  Crabbing methods  Wanli Crab fishermen use fishy lures boxed inside a round- shaped crabbing cage to lure the crab to come inside via one of the three openings in the cage. Fishermen dropped up to 360 cages per fishing rope to seabeds and let them sit for 16 to 20 hours before retrieving. Once caught, each crab will be tied up with the symbolic neon-green nylon cord before putting them back to the water tank inside the bottom of the crabbing boat. Starting in April 2014, the government in Taiwan mandated that the crab caught must be larger than 6 to 8 cm by measuring their back-shells. Also all egg- bearing crab caught must be released immediately between August 16 and November 15. Violators can be fined up to 150,000 New Taiwan Dollars.

He is best known for his 1935 book Beowulf and the Seventh Century: Language and Content. Life Girvan was born in Campbeltown, Argyllshire, Scotland in 1877; his mother was Mary Girvan of Milknowe Terrace, Campbeltown. Girvan began his studies at Glasgow in 1894, taking his MA in 1889. He became an English Language lecturer at the university in 1907, remaining there for the rest of his career; he was made professor in 1947. He was awarded an honorary LLD by the university in 1950, and served as Dean of Faculties between 1954 and 1958. Beowulf criticism Girvan is best known for his 1935 book Beowulf and the Seventh Century: Language and Content; Reviewing the book for Modern Language Notes in 1938, Elliott Van Kirk Dobbie noted that Girvan dates Beowulf to about 680–700, earlier than generally accepted at that time, and that Girvan generalizes where details of word forms are important. He notes also that the poem cannot be used as a guide to life at the time of the Anglo-Saxon migration to England (c. 550) because of the long period between then and the time of writing. However Girvan accepts \\"the accuracy of the poet's knowledge regarding Geatish history ... [and] the historicity of Beowulf as king of the Geats.\\" Dobbie writes that \\"some of this may seem very far-fetched, ... but his book, as an honest and unprejudiced attempt to reconcile the inconsistent and often baffling evidence, deserves earnest consideration from every student of the poem.\\" Girvan's work on Beowulf is mentioned and critiqued in J.R.R. Tolkien's Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics: Legacy While a professor at Glasgow, Girvan presented a stained glass window to Hyndland Parish Church, Glasgow.

While still at Darlington, he had loan spells at Northern Premier League club Bishop Auckland, and went on to play non-league football in the north-east of England for a number of clubs, mostly in the Northern League. He also played American college soccer for the Stetson Hatters. Football career Alexander was born in Middlesbrough, and despite receiving offers of a traineeship from Wolverhampton Wanderers and Burnley, began his football career in the youth system of Darlington in June 2002. He was included among the substitutes for the Division Three match against Carlisle United on 27 August, chosen in preference to the injured Danny Mellanby and the out-of-form Mark Sheeran, but remained unused. The 16-year- old Alexander was given his debut the following Saturday, as a second-half substitute in the visit to Kidderminster Harriers. He entered the game together with Neil Wainwright and Phil Hadland just after the home side had taken a lead, and the energy of the fresh players helped Darlington exert enough pressure to draw the match. A trial with Premier League club Blackburn Rovers, in which he scored twice for their under-17 team against Tottenham Hotspur under-17s, came to nothing, and Alexander made no more first-team appearances before December, when he joined Northern Premier League club Bishop Auckland on loan. He returned to Darlington's first team in December 2003, when he made three appearances, each time as a late substitute. After another brief loan spell with Bishop Auckland, Alexander was released in April 2004 and signed for Billingham Synthonia. He scored on his Northern League debut, against Dunston Federation, and finished the season with the club. He then took up a place at Stetson University, in DeLand, Florida, where he played college soccer for the Stetson Hatters. He helped them reach the 2004 Atlantic Sun Conference post-season tournament, but was sent off in the quarter-final match which the Hatters lost after two periods of overtime. He returned to Billingham Synthonia in January 2005, and took his total appearances for the club to 18, with two goals. Alexander signed for Marske United in January 2006, and was Billingham Town's top Northern League scorer in 2008–09 with 21 goals. He joined Conference North club Blyth Spartans ahead of the next season, and scored six goals from 56 appearances in all competitions for them over two seasons. He then signed for Northern League champions Spennymoor Town, but only four weeks into the season and having scored four times already, he was transfer-listed and returned to Blyth. After four more games for Blyth, and a loan spell with Ashington during which he played once, in the Northern League Cup, Alexander signed for fellow Northern League club Norton & Stockton Ancients. In March, he made a sideways move to Newcastle Benfield, where he finished the season. In 2012 pre-season, Alexander had a trial with former club Darlington, who had lost most of their players after administrative demotion to the Northern League, but no contract ensued, and he remained with Benfield until rejoining another former club, Marske United, in another sideways move in October. He was their top scorer in 2013–14 with 21 goals in all competitions, 14 in league matches, and started in the Northern League Cup final as Marske beat Whitley Bay 2–1 after extra time. In October 2014, he joined yet another Northern League club, Crook Town.

The river winds through the gardens of Sorgenfri Palace to Fuglevad water mill which later became part of the Brede Copper Works. The river then continues to the north past the Frilandsmuseum and on to Brede Museum. It then proceeds past Øhrholm and Ravneholm to Nymølle which hammered out copper and brass from the mid-17th century. It then flows under the Helsingør Motorway to Stampen where there used to be a textile factory, a flour mill and a bakery. After passing through Raadvad, the Millstream finally arrives at Strandmøllen before reaching the Øresund. History As far back as the Viking period, the river was used for milling. From the Middle Ages, the water power of the river was increased by means of dams between the lake of Furesø and the river mouth at the Øresund. In the 17th century, sizeable industrial enterprises were established along the river giving it the reputation of being the cradle of Danish industry. They included mills for the production of textiles, metals, paper and armaments. The factories operated until the 1950s after which they began to close, leaving buildings that were put to other uses. They included the Brede Works, now an industrial museum, and the Strandmøllen paper mill.

Næsseslottet on Furesø is a country house from 1783 which was built by the Dutch shipping entrepreneur Frédéric de Coninck. The park with several obelisks is open to the public. Frederiksdal House at the south end of Furesø is a white Rococo mansion designed by Nicolai Eigtved and Johann Gottfried Rosenberg in the mid-18th century. It is not open to the public. The open-air museum Frilandsmuseet in Lyngby consists of a collection of old houses, farms and mills which have been moved to the site to show how people lived in former times. Sophienholm between the river to the north and Lake Bagsværd to the south dates from 1768 but was completely rebuilt by the affluent businessman Constantin Brun in 1805. It is now an exhibition centre. Owned by the Danish royal family, Sorgenfri Palace was built by the French architect François Dieussart in 1706. The main building was redesigned in the Neoclassical style by Peter Meyn in 1790. Some parts of the gardens are open to the public.

The museum documents the growth of industry along the river and has a large collection of historic clothing. Located at the mouth of the river, Strandmøllen (the Beach Mill) from 1599 is a historic paper mill. With a history dating back to at least the 15th century, Lyngby Mill with its large water wheel has been restored and is the only mill in the Mølleå Valley which is still fully operational. Other former mills between Sorgenfri and the Øresund include Fuglevad (1492), Ørholm (from 1370), Nymølle (mid-17th century), Stampen (13th century) and Raadvad (1643).

He was a professor at Greifswald University. In 1990 he served as Minister for Research and Technology in East Germany's only democratically elected government. Life =Early years= Frank Terpe was born a couple of weeks before the US Stock Market famously collapsed, in a small country town some 25 km (15 miles) down river of Meißen in central Germany. His father was a crane operator. When Terpe was slightly more than three years old, Germany became a one party state. He attended junior school locally in Nünchritz between 1936 and 1940 and the Adolf Hitler Middle School from 1942 to 1945. He successfully completed his schooling at the upper school in Riesa, a short distance down the river and on the other side if it. =Academic career= By 1948 one one-party state had been replaced, for those living in the Soviet occupation zone of what had previously been Germany, with another. The area was being systematically converted into the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). In 1948 Terpe moved on to study Mathematics and Physics at Greifswald. He then got a position as an assistant, later promoted to senior assistant, at the town's Ernst Moritz Arndt University (EMAU). He received his doctorate in 1962 for a dissertation on the Descriptive Theory of Integration, and achieved further academic promotion (Habilitation) in 1967 for work on the Theory of Maximalen Integrals. In 1969 he was appointed Professor for Analysis. Between 1971 and 1980 Frank Terpe was in charge of the Mathematics Department at the EMAU. He remained a professor at Greifswald till his retirement in 1993. =Political career= In November 1989, a few weeks after his sixtieth birthday, Terpe joined the newly (re)formed SDP (party) (which in parallel with German reunification would merge with its western equivalent, the SPD (party), in September 1990). In February 1990 he was voted on to the party executive. In East Germany's only free election, which took place on 18 March 1990, Terpe was elected to membership of the country's National Assembly (Volkskammer), where he became the deputy Chairman of the SDP group. On 12 April 1990 he was appointed to the government being formed by Lothar de Maizière as Minister for Research and Technology in succession to Peter-Klaus Budig. He resigned from his ministerial position on 20 August 1990 following the controversial resignation from the government of its Finance Minister, Walter Romberg which led to the withdrawal of the SDP from the governing coalition.

It opened in 1860 and closed in 1981. History The Walter Cobb store was founded by Walter Cobb, who was born in Canterbury in 1835, and learnt his trade as a draper in Dover. In 1860, Cobb opened the store in Lawrie Place, a newly built parade, as a ladies outfitters, with his wife and their shop assistants living above the store. By 1862 the business was described as General Drapery Establishment, selling shawls, dresses, mantles, family mourning wear and having a millinery department. Cobb was an astute business and marketing man. He advertised his store as having the latest fashions from Paris and London. Over the next 30 years, he purchased shops either side of his property, expanding the Walter Cobb store into each unit with new departments. The business by 1898 occupied 297-301 Kirdale, 270-272 Kirkdale, a furniture depository in Silverdale and an estate agents and funeral parlour at 1-3 Railway Approach. By 1900, the Walter Cobb store ran the length of Lawrie Place except for the butcher store on the corner. The store was declared to be the equal of Harrods, Harvey Nichols and Marshall & Snelgrove in a Times article of the time. In 1900, the butcher store finally sold out and Walter Cobb built the grand corner entrance to his store which finally opened in 1902 with its grand dome pediment. Walter was also a costume maker for the 1911 Festival of empire at the Crystal Palace. The Walter Cobb store continued to operate, past Cobb's death in 1922 up and to the Second World War. During the London bombings of World War II, three quarters of the Walter Cobb store was demolished; however the business continued to operate in a condensed form. The Walter Cobb store was rebuilt slowly, with the building not being completed until 1960. During this time the business continued to open new departments including selling hardware. The 1970s saw the Walter Cobb store decline. The store closed in 1981.

It was built in the 12th century and used to be the seat of government of the Welf dukes. History  The first castle was occupied in around 1330 by the \\"noble lords of Rosdorf\\". In 1324, the Muthaus (Moshus = palas) was built by Conrad and Louis of Rosdorf and the place was expanded into large castle complex. The Muthaus has a height of 35 metres and is probably the oldest, fully surviving secular building in southern Lower Saxony. The expansion appears to have overstretched the lords financially. In 1379, Duke Otto of Brunswick and Göttingen (Otto the Evil) acquired the castle. In 1380, it was the seat of government for the Welf duke after he had been driven out of Göttingen; he died here on 13 December 1394. The castle then became the dower seat of Duchess Margareta. In 1560, Hardegsen ceased to be the princely residence and dower seat. From 1568 to 1823 the old castle became the head office of the Amt of Hardegsen, headed by a Drost or Amtmann. From 1725 to 1780 major remodelling work was carried out on the castle in order to turn it into domestic buildings for the future estate (Domäne). Of the old castle, only the Muthaus, the Hagenhaus and parts of the castle wall remain. In 1972 the estate and castle site were sold to the town of Hardegsen, who then rented it out. The Muthaus may be visited today, but is also hired out for events and celebrations. It is hired by the Hardegsen Cultural Project (Kulturinitiative Hardegsen). The income is used to maintain the castle. The great hall is used in spring and summer as a registry office.

December 1867, betreffend die allen Ländern der österreichischen Monarchie gemeinsamen Angelegenheiten; RGBl. 146/1867 The Basic Law on the General Rights of Nationals is a bill of rights stipulating, among other things, equality before the law for all the empire's ethnicities (articles 1, 2, 3, and 19), the end of all forms of serfdom (art. 7), freedom of the press (art. 13), freedom of religion (articles 14 and 15), freedom of assembly (article 12), and secrecy of correspondence (art. 10). It also established a limited form of due process; under the Basic Law, a person could not be arbitrarily deprived of the freedom of their person (art. 8), their property (art. 5), or the inviolability of their home (art. 9). The Basic Law of the Judiciary stipulated the separation of administration and judiciary and the independence of the courts. It also guaranteed the right of the people to participate in the administration of criminal justice; serious crimes would from now on require trial by jury. Last but not least, the Law established a system administrative courts, making executive acts of government subject to judicial review. The Delegation Law affirmed and ratified, for the Cisleithanian party to the conflict, the main outcome of the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867: Cisleithania and Transleithania would act as a single monolithic entity for the purposes of international law; they would have a joint diplomatic service, a joint foreign office, and joint armed forces. Otherwise, the Kingdom of Hungary would be a fully independent separate country. The remaining laws dealt mainly with procedural details and miscellanea such as the immunity of Imperial Council delegates. Genesis Until 1848, the Austrian Empire was an absolute monarchy with no written constitution and no modern concept of the rule of law. In 1848, a wave of revolutions swept Austria; the revolutionaries demanded, among other things, constitutionalism and freedom of the press. By March 15, Emperor Ferdinand I had been forced to promise to meet these demands. On April 25, pursuant to this promise, Ferdinand proclaimed the Pillersdorf Constitution, named after its principal framer, Minister of the Interior Baron Franz von Pillersdorf. The Pillersdorf Constitution, written essentially by the cabinet with no consultation of any kind of elected council, was widely seen as inadequate and did nothing to stem the tide of revolutionary unrest. In December, Ferdinand was forced to abdicate. Among other desperate measures, he had already declared the constitution \\"provisional\\" in May and completely scrapped it in July. Ferdinand's successor, Franz Joseph, was determined to reassert absolute monarchy. By March 1849, he had taken back the streets and mostly neutralized the intellectuals. He still needed to sideline the revolutionaries' unauthorized constitutional assembly, the Kremsier Parliament, which had promulgated its own draft constitution, the Kremsier Constitution. Between March 4 and 7, to preempt the Kremsier Parliament, he proclaimed his March Constitution, seemingly giving in to most of the Kremsier demands. The Kremsier Parliament dealt with, he revoked his own constitution with the December 31, 1851 New Year's Eve Patent. No written constitution left in force, Austria was once again an absolute monarchy. The empire, and with it the personal authority of the Emperor, was severely weakened by a series of diplomatic setbacks, the rise of civic nationalism, and the growing disaffection of the empire's Hungarian and Slavic subjects with the Habsburgs' rule. By 1860, Franz Joseph was forced to formally share power again. A new constitution, the 1860 October Diploma, granted more autonomy to the provinces and strengthened regional nobility; regional legislative and administrative authority would partially lie with each region's respective aristocracy. The October diploma proved to be too little, too late: it neither satisfied the nobles nor, in particular, the people of the Kingdom of Hungary. The 1861 February Patent made further concessions, again failing to pacify Hungary. Hungary had come close to independence during the 1848 revolutions, had been beaten into submission only with the help of the Russian Empire, and had lived under what effectively was a military dictatorship ever since. In 1866, Austria was defeated in the Austro-Prussian War and lost its claim to being the leading German state, plunging the Habsburg dynasty and their German- speaking realms into an unprecedented identity crisis. The monarch's moral authority gravely damaged once more, unrest in Hungary threatened to erupt again. His back to the wall, Franz Joseph saw no choice but grant Hungary all but full independence in the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867. To prevent the empire's non-Hungarian ethnicities from demanding similar levels of autonomy, Franz Joseph then had to return to constitutionalism and vest the empire's peoples with participation rights in the legislative and administrative process. Abrogation As a result of Austria's defeat in World War I, Austria-Hungary collapsed in October 1918. Both the Kingdom of Hungary and the Slavic provinces of Cisleithania broke away from the German- speaking core lands to form modern nation states. Many of the institutions established by the December Constitution collapsed; in particular, the Imperial Council could no longer function. Many of the provisions of the Constitution became moot outright. It was obvious the emerging rump state would need a new legal framework. On October 21, 1918, parliamentarians from the German-speaking regions convened to form a Provisional National Assembly (Provisorische Nationalversammlung) to manage this transition. On October 30, the Assembly proclaimed a provisional constitution. The provisional constitution did little more than establish the Assembly as a provisional parliament, establish the parliament's three-member presidium as the provisional head of state, and set up a provisional cabinet. Even so, most of the articles of the December Constitution were thus implicitly abrogated.Beschluss der Provisorischen Nationalversammlung für Deutschösterreich vom 30. Oktober 1918 über die grundlegenden Einrichtungen der Staatsgewalt; SGBl. 1/1918 did not include any catalogue of basic rights, although it was followed on the same day by a resolution abolishing censorship and establishing freedom of the press, leaving the Basic Law on the General Rights of Nationals on the books.Beschluss der Provisorischen Nationalversammlung vom 30. Oktober 1918; SGBl. 3/1918 General elections on February 16, 1919 replaced the Provisional Assembly with a Constitutional Assembly (Konstituierende Nationalversammlung). On October 1, 1920, the Assembly passed the Federal Constitutional Law, confirming and formalizing the abrogation of the December Constitution.

Together with the 1955 Austrian State Treaty and the 1955 European Convention on Human Rights, ratified by Austria in 1958 and part of the country's body of constitutional law since 1964, it serves as Austria's bill of rights to this day.

The funerary complex, consists of three Mughal period tombs, known as the Bara Batashewala Mahal, the Chota Batashewala Mahal, an unidentified Mughal tomb and arched compound wall enclosures. Location Humayun's Tomb, Delhi, India The complex is located in an land within arcaded enclosures. It was an integral part of the 16th century necropolis of Delhi. Within its neighbourhood is the famous dargah (shrine) of Sufi saint Nizamuddin Auliya who lived during the 14th century. The tomb complex is located next to the Humayun Tomb's enclosure. Access to the tomb is also from the north gate of Humayun's Tomb and also from the Sunder Nursery. Features The Tombs of Batashewala Complex lie in the buffer zone of the World Heritage Site of the Humayun Tomb Complex; the two complexes are separated by a small road but enclosed within their own separate compound walls. The complex has three tombs which are identified as Bara Batashewala Mahal and the Chota Batashewala Mahal, enclosed within a compound wall with arches of length built with stone masonry; and a Mughal tomb of an unidentified person, to the east of the other two tombs, in a separate enclosure. All three tombs are reported to have been built during the late 16th – early 17th century. It is said that such a funerary complex does not exist anywhere else in India. =Bara Batashewala Mahal= Refurbished Bara Battashewala Tomb The tomb, known as the Bara Batashewala Mahal, is a funerary structure where Mirza Muzaffar Husain, son- in-law of Akbar and the great-nephew of Humayun, is kept. It was built during 1603-4. Built in Mughal architectural style, it has a flat roof, which in the past, is stated to have been covered by a \\"textile canopy\\". A single storied square structure of square, its architecture is similar to the Jal Mahal and Humayun tomb. It has a central chamber consisting of eight small rooms, and it is said to be a replica of an Iranian design. The interiors around the sarcophagus (crypt) is richly decorated with incised plaster and tiles. All four identical facades of the square tomb have five half-domed entrances, also decorated on plaster and tiles. In the past, the west facing facade had collapsed and the southern facade had been repaired poorly during the 20th century. However, during 2012-15, this tomb, including the entire complex, has been renovated. =Chota Batashewala Mahal= As originally built, the tomb was in the form of an octagonal dome, extensively decorated. During the later part of the 20th century it had substantially deteriorated. The tomb has been partially restored now on the basis of the pictures of the structure as it existed during the 1960s, old drawings and from an examination of the features of the existing parts. =Mughal tomb= Unnamed Mughal tomb after renovation This tomb is a tall structure and is located in the eastern part of the Battashewala Complex. It is built with stone masonry over a raised fort-type platform. It measures in length and in width. It is a domed structure with rich decorations. As part of the structure had collapsed, restoration works were undertaken in a planned manner. Conservation measures On account of the site's occupation, on a perpetual lease basis, by the Delhi State Bharat Scouts and Guides since 1941 as a camping ground, the tomb structures in the complex suffered serious deterioration; the tombs were also ignored for several decades. However, after considerable efforts the ownership of the site was transferred to the Archaeological Survey of India in 2010 to undertake conservation works of the tombs. Soon after, in 2011, conservation efforts were initiated by the Aga Khan Trust for Culture (AKTC). A multi-disciplinary team of AKTC carried out the restoration works over a period of four years. The team adopted \\"traditional construction material and building techniques\\". The cement based repairs carried out in earlier times were all replaced. The complex of tombs have been refurbished at a cost of US$750,000, the first of its kind funded under the US Ambassadors Fund for Cultural Preservation Projects (AFCP). The initiative to restore this complex was taken after the visit of President Obama to the Humayun Tomb Complex in 2010. The restoration works have been carried out by the AFCP in association with the Archaeological Survey of India. The restored structures were formally opened to the public on 18 April 2015, which was also observed as the UNESCO declared World Heritage Day. The Ministry of Culture, Government of India, has now plans to pose this tomb complex for inclusion as part of the UNESCO heritage complex of the Humayun Tomb.

Summary Margaret Montoya's actions at the end of Contagious might have saved the lives of many, however most consider her to be a monster rather than a hero. Since that time she has turned into a shut-in out of guilt, something that has torn apart her relationship with the CIA agent Clarence Otto. However now she is called forth to help fight against a new version of the alien microorganisms, one that was launched by the probe just before it was destroyed. Montoya and the others try to do their best to combat the microorganisms and help keep the general public aware, only for many to assume that this is either a coverup for something more human in origin or an outright fabrication. However, as the book progresses things grow more dire and the world is plunged into an apocalyptic environment.

Hauser gained his first experience skydiving at the age of 18. At the age of 35 he received specialized training from Thomas Naef and Rolf Kuratle, two members of the Babylon Freefall Skydiving team, in Skydive Empuriabrava (Empuriabrava, Spain). He completed his first speed tracking attempt in 2009. In October 2012, Hauser set the world record for the fastest horizontal free fall in Empuriabrava, Spain. Hauser did not use specialized equipment to accelerate his speed. = Chasing the Jet Stream - Guinness World Record = Marc Hauser is also the first human ever to perform a free fall jump into the jet stream near Forbes, New South Wales, Australia, on 30 June 2018. Forbes/Australia: Marc Hauser jumping into the jet stream on 30 June 2018. As skydiving suit he was wearing a thermal protection jumpsuit without wings (no wingsuit). The exit altitude of the jump was at 7,400 m / 24,000 ft above sea level, the temperature at -40° Celsius / -40 °F. At exit altitude the jet stream speed was 137 km/h (85 mph). The groundspeed / horizontal speed of Marc performing this free fall skydive was at 270 km/h (167 mph). During his free fall Hauser covered a horizontal distance of 5.9 km / 3.66 miles in total. Hauser opened his parachute at 2,000 m / 6,500 ft altitude above ground. The BBC World News documentary Chasing the Jet Stream covers the free fall jump into the jet stream in three parts, which aired on 2, 8 and 15 December 2018. The documentary highlights both Marc Hauser’s goal to raise awareness for cleantech-pioneering enterprises using airborne wind energy systems, as well as the execution of the preparations that eventually lead to the free fall jump into the jet stream. In 2019, the Guinness World Records honored the parachute jump as the world's first skydive into the jet stream.

A Cinderella-esque story about a poor, kind-hearted girl who becomes the sole heiress of a rich, elderly woman who wants to teach her spoiled family a lesson, Brilliant Legacy became an unexpected hit, reaching a peak viewership rating of 47.1%, and catapulted its relatively unknown stars Han Hyo-joo and Lee Seung-gi to fame. Jin won Best Drama PD\\"PD\\" stands for Production Director. at the 17th Korean Culture and Entertainment Awards, and was nominated for Best New Television Director at the 46th Baeksang Arts Awards. He and Brilliant Legacy screenwriter So Hyun-kyung collaborated again for Prosecutor Princess (2010), a romantic comedy/legal drama in which a vain and shallow law graduate is forced to work as a public prosecutor which gradually changes her outlook on the world. City Hunter followed in 2011, which Jin considered a prequel of the same-titled manga by Tsukasa Hojo, transforming its protagonist into a Blue House IT expert by day, and a vengeful, justice- seeking vigilante by night. Despite middling domestic ratings for both series, Kim So-yeon (previously typecast in dramatic roles) drew praise for her comic acting in Prosecutor Princess, while her co-star Park Si-hoo and City Hunter lead actor Lee Min-ho increased their overseas fanbase due to their respective series. Jin received a Best Production Director nomination at the 4th Korea Drama Awards for City Hunter. He then worked with the Hong sisters for Master's Sun (2013), a horror/romantic comedy starring So Ji-sub and Gong Hyo- jin about a selfish shopping mall CEO who finds himself falling for a woman who can communicate with ghosts. In 2014, Jin cast Lee Jong-suk as a genius doctor who defected from North Korea then encounters the doppelgänger of his dead first love in Doctor Stranger. Jin is set to direct FHM 2, the sequel to the 2011 Chinese television drama FHM, which revolves around the friendship, desires, and ambitions of men in their thirties. Starring Park Hae-jin, Zhang Liang and Joker Xue, FHM 2 is a joint venture between a Chinese production company and Korean conglomerate CJ E&M; and will air in 2015.

Light-front quantization uses light- front (or light-cone) coordinates to select an initial surface that is tangential to the light cone. Equal-time quantization uses an initial surface that is horizontal, labeled here as the \\"hypersurface of the present\\". The light front quantization of quantum field theories provides a useful alternative to ordinary equal-time quantization. In particular, it can lead to a relativistic description of bound systems in terms of quantum-mechanical wave functions. The quantization is based on the choice of light-front coordinates, where x^+\\\\equiv ct+z plays the role of time and the corresponding spatial coordinate is x^-\\\\equiv ct-z. Here, t is the ordinary time, z is one Cartesian coordinate, and c is the speed of light. The other two Cartesian coordinates, x and y, are untouched and often called transverse or perpendicular, denoted by symbols of the type \\\\vec x_\\\\perp = (x,y). The choice of the frame of reference where the time t and z-axis are defined can be left unspecified in an exactly soluble relativistic theory, but in practical calculations some choices may be more suitable than others. The solution of the LFQCD Hamiltonian eigenvalue equation will utilize the available mathematical methods of quantum mechanics and contribute to the development of advanced computing techniques for large quantum systems, including nuclei. For example, in the discretized light-cone quantization method (DLCQ), periodic conditions are introduced such that momenta are discretized and the size of the Fock space is limited without destroying Lorentz invariance. Solving a quantum field theory is then reduced to diagonalizing a large sparse Hermitian matrix. The DLCQ method has been successfully used to obtain the complete spectrum and light-front wave functions in numerous model quantum field theories such as QCD with one or two space dimensions for any number of flavors and quark masses. An extension of this method to supersymmetric theories, SDLCQ, takes advantage of the fact that the light-front Hamiltonian can be factorized as a product of raising and lowering ladder operators. SDLCQ has provided new insights into a number of supersymmetric theories including direct numerical evidence for a supergravity/super-Yang—Mills duality conjectured by Maldacena. It is convenient to work in a Fock basis \\\\\\\\{n:p_i^+,\\\\vec{p}_{\\\\perp i}\\\\rangle\\\\\\\\} where the light-front momenta \\\\mathcal{P}^+ and \\\\vec\\\\mathcal{P}_\\\\perp are diagonal. The state \\\\underline{P}\\\\rangle is given by an expansion : \\\\underline{P}\\\\rangle=\\\\sum_n\\\\int [dx]_n\\\\,[d^2k_\\\\perp]_n\\\\, \\\\psi_n(x,\\\\vec{k}_\\\\perp)n:xP^+,x\\\\vec{P}_\\\\perp+\\\\vec{k}_\\\\perp\\\\rangle\\\\,, with : [dx]_n=4\\\\pi\\\\delta(1-\\\\sum_{i=1}^nx_i) \\\\prod_{i=1}^n\\\\frac{dx_i}{4\\\\pi\\\\sqrt{x_i}}\\\\,,\\\\;\\\\;\\\\; [d^2k_\\\\perp]_n=4\\\\pi^2\\\\delta(\\\\sum_{i=1}^n\\\\vec{k}_{\\\\perp i}) \\\\prod_{i=1}^n\\\\frac{d^2k_{\\\\perp i}}{4\\\\pi^2}\\\\,. \\\\psi_n is interpreted as the wave function of the contribution from states with n particles. The eigenvalue problem \\\\mathcal{P}^-\\\\underline{P}\\\\rangle=\\\\frac{M^2+P_\\\\perp^2}{P^+}\\\\underline{P}\\\\rangle is a set of coupled integral equations for these wave functions. Although the notation as presented supports only one particle type, the generalization to more than one is trivial.  Discrete light-cone quantization  A systematic approach to discretization of the eigenvalue problem is the DLCQ method originally suggested by Pauli and Brodsky. In essence it is the replacement of integrals by trapezoidal approximations, with equally-spaced intervals in the longitudinal and transverse momenta : p^+\\\\rightarrow\\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{L}n\\\\,,\\\\;\\\\; \\\\vec{p}_\\\\perp\\\\rightarrow(\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{L_\\\\perp}n_x,\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{L_\\\\perp}n_y), corresponding to periodic boundary conditions on the intervals -L and -L_\\\\perp. The length scales L and L_\\\\perp determine the resolution of the calculation. Because the plus component of momentum is always positive, the limit L\\\\rightarrow\\\\infty can be exchanged for a limit in terms of the integer resolution K\\\\equiv\\\\frac{L}{2\\\\pi}P^+. The combination of momentum components that defines H_{\\\\rm LC}=P^+\\\\mathcal{P}^- is then independent of L. The longitudinal momentum fractions x_i\\\\equiv p_i^+/P^+ become ratios of integers n_i/K. Because the n_i are all positive, DLCQ automatically limits the number of particles to be no more than K. When a limit on transverse momentum is supplied via a chosen cutoff, a finite matrix problem is obtained; however, the matrix may be too large for present numerical techniques. An explicit truncation in particle number, the light-cone equivalent of the Tamm—Dancoff approximation, can then be made. Large basis sizes require special techniques for matrix diagonalization; the one typically used is the Lanczos algorithm. For the case of one space dimension, one can readily solve for the hadron spectrum of QCD for any quark masses and colors. Most DLCQ calculations are done without zero modes. However, in principle, any DLCQ basis with periodic boundary conditions may include them as constrained modes, dependent on the other modes with nonzero momentum. The constraint comes from the spatial average of the Euler–Lagrange equation for the field. This constraint equation can be difficult to solve, even for the simplest theories. However, an approximate solution can be found, consistent with the underlying approximations of the DLCQ method itself. This solution generates the effective zero-mode interactions for the light-front Hamiltonian. Calculations in the massive sector that are done without zero modes will usually yield the correct answer. The neglect of zero modes merely worsens the convergence. One exception is that of cubic scalar theories, where the spectrum extends to minus infinity. A DLCQ calculation without zero modes will require careful extrapolation to detect this infinity, whereas a calculation that includes zero modes yields the correct result immediately. The zero modes are avoided if one uses antiperiodic boundary conditions.  Supersymmetric discrete light-cone quantization  The supersymmetric form of DLCQ (SDLCQ) is specifically designed to maintain supersymmetry in the discrete approximation. Ordinary DLCQ violates supersymmetry by terms that do not survive the continuum limit. The SDLCQ construction discretizes the supercharge Q^- and defines the Hamiltonian \\\\mathcal{P}^- by the superalgebra relation \\\\mathcal{P}^-=\\\\\\\\{Q^-,Q^-\\\\\\\\}/2\\\\sqrt{2}. The range of transverse momentum is limited by a simple cutoff in the momentum value. Effects of zero modes are expected to cancel. In addition to calculations of spectra, this technique can be used to calculate expectation values. One such quantity, a correlator \\\\langle T^{++}(x) T^{++}(y)\\\\rangle of the stress energy tensor, has been computed as a test of a Maldacena conjecture. A very efficient Lanczos-based method was developed for this calculation. The most recent results provide direct evidence for the conjecture.  Transverse lattice  The transverse lattice method brings together two powerful ideas in quantum field theory: light-front Hamiltonian quantization and lattice gauge theory. Lattice gauge theory is a very popular means of regulating for calculation the gauge theories that describe all visible matter in the universe; in particular, it manifestly demonstrates the linear confinement of QCD that holds quarks and gluons inside the protons and neutrons of the atomic nucleus. In general, to obtain solutions of a quantum field theory, with its continuously infinite degrees of freedom, one must put kinematical cutoffs or other restrictions on the space of quantum states. To remove the errors this introduces, one may then extrapolate these cutoffs, provided a continuum limit exists, and/or renormalize observables to account for degrees of freedom above the cutoff. For the purposes of Hamiltonian quantization, one must have a continuous time direction. In the case of light-front Hamiltonian quantization, in addition to continuous light-front time x^+, it is necessary to keep the x^- direction continuous if one wants to preserve the manifest Lorentz boost invariance in one direction and to include small light-front energies p^-. Therefore, at most one can impose a lattice cutoff on the remaining transverse spatial directions. Such a transverse lattice gauge theory was first suggested by Bardeen and Pearson in 1976. Most practical calculations performed with transverse lattice gauge theory have utilized one further ingredient: the color-dielectric expansion. A dielectric formulation is one in which the gauge group elements, whose generators are the gluon fields in the case of QCD, are replaced by collective (smeared, blocked, etc.) variables which represent an average over their fluctuations on short distance scales. These dielectric variables are massive, carry color, and form an effective gauge field theory with classical action minimized at zero field, meaning that color flux is expelled from the vacuum at the classical level. This maintains the triviality of the light-front vacuum structure, but arises only for a low momentum cutoff on the effective theory (corresponding to transverse lattice spacings of order 1/2 fm in QCD). As a result, the effective cutoff Hamiltonian is initially poorly constrained. The color-dielectric expansion, together with requirements of Lorentz symmetry restoration, has nevertheless been successfully used to organize the interactions in the Hamiltonian in a way suitable for practical solution. The most accurate spectrum of large-N_c glueballs has been obtained in this way, and as well as pion light-front wave functions in agreement with a range of experimental data.  Basis Light-Front Quantization  The basis light-front quantization (BLFQ) approach uses expansions in products of single-particle basis functions to represent the Fock-state wave functions. Typically, the longitudinal (x^-) dependence is represented in the DLCQ basis of plane waves, and the transverse dependence is represented by two- dimensional harmonic oscillator functions. The latter are ideal for applications to confining cavities and are consistent with light-front holographic QCD. The use of products of single particle basis functions is also convenient for incorporation of boson and fermion statistics, because the products are readily (anti)symmetrized. By employing two-dimensional basis functions with rotational symmetry about the longitudinal direction (where the harmonic oscillator functions serve as an example), one preserves the total angular momentum projection quantum number which facilitates determination of the total angular momentum of the mass eigenstates. For applications without an external cavity, where transverse momentum is conserved, a Lagrange multiplier method is used to separate the relative transverse motion from the total system's motion. The first application of BLFQ to QED solved for the electron in a two-dimensional transverse confining cavity and showed how the anomalous magnetic moment behaved as a function of the strength of the cavity. The second application of BLFQ to QED solved for the electron's anomalous magnetic moment in free space and demonstrated agreement with the Schwinger moment in the appropriate limit. The extension of BLFQ to the time-dependent regime, namely, time-dependent BLFQ (tBLFQ) is straightforward and is currently under active development. The goal of tBLFQ is to solve light-front field theory in real-time (with or without time-dependent background fields). The typical application areas include intense lasers (see Light-front quantization#Intense lasers}) and relativistic heavy-ion collisions.  Light- front coupled-cluster method  The light-front coupled cluster (LFCC) method is a particular form of truncation for the infinite coupled system of integral equations for light-front wave functions. The system of equations that comes from the field-theoretic Schrödinger equation also requires regularization, to make the integral operators finite. The traditional Fock-space truncation of the system, where the allowed number of particles is limited, typically disrupts the regularization by removing infinite parts that would otherwise cancel against parts that are retained. Although there are ways to circumvent this, they are not completely satisfactory. The LFCC method avoids these difficulties by truncating the set of equations in a very different way. Instead of truncating the number of particles, it truncates the way in which wave functions are related to each other; the wave functions of higher Fock states are determined by the lower-state wave functions and the exponentiation of an operator T. Specifically, the eigenstate is written in the form \\\\sqrt{Z}e^T\\\\phi\\\\rangle, where \\\\sqrt{Z} is a normalization factor and \\\\phi\\\\rangle is a state with the minimal number of constituents. The operator T increases particle number and conserves all relevant quantum numbers, including light-front momentum. This is in principle exact but also still infinite, because T can have an infinite number of terms. Zero modes can be included by inclusion of their creation as terms in T; this generates a nontrivial vacuum as a generalized coherent state of zero modes. The truncation made is a truncation of T. The original eigenvalue problem becomes a finite-sized eigenvalue problem for the valence state \\\\phi\\\\rangle, combined with auxiliary equations for the terms retained in T: : P_v\\\\overline{\\\\mathcal{P}^-}\\\\phi\\\\rangle=\\\\frac{M^2+P_\\\\perp^2}{P^+}\\\\phi\\\\rangle, \\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\; (1-P_v)\\\\overline{\\\\mathcal{P}^-}\\\\phi\\\\rangle=0. Here P_v is a projection onto the valence sector, and \\\\overline{\\\\mathcal{P}^-}\\\\equiv e^{-T}\\\\mathcal{P}^- e^T is the LFCC effective Hamiltonian. The projection 1-P_v is truncated to provide just enough auxiliary equations to determine the functions in the truncated T operator. The effective Hamiltonian is computed from its Baker--Hausdorff expansion \\\\overline{\\\\mathcal{P}^-}=\\\\mathcal{P}^-+[\\\\mathcal{P}^-,T]+\\\\frac12 \\\\mathcal{P}^-,T],T]+\\\\cdots, which can be terminated at the point where more particles are being created than are kept by the truncated projection 1-P_v. The use of the exponential of T rather than some other function is convenient, not only because of the Baker—Hausdorff expansion but more generally because it is invertible; in principle, other functions could be used and would also provide an exact representation until a truncation is made. The truncation of T can be handled systematically. Terms can be classified by the number of annihilated constituents and the net increase in particle number. For example, in QCD the lowest-order contributions annihilate one particle and increase the total by one. These are one-gluon emission from a quark, quark pair creation from one gluon, and gluon pair creation from one gluon. Each involves a function of relative momentum for the transition from one to two particles. Higher order terms annihilate more particles and/or increase the total by more than one. These provide additional contributions to higher-order wave functions and even to low-order wave functions for more complicated valence states. For example, the wave function for the q\\\\bar{q}g\\\\rangle Fock state of a meson can have a contribution from a term in T that annihilates a q\\\\bar{q} pair and creates a pair plus a gluon, when this acts on the meson valence state q\\\\bar{q}\\\\rangle. The mathematics of the LFCC method has its origin in the many-body coupled cluster method used in nuclear physics and quantum chemistry. The physics is, however, quite different. The many-body method works with a state of a large number of particles and uses the exponentiation of T to build in correlations of excitations to higher single-particle states; the particle number does not change. The LFCC method starts from a small number of constituents in a valence state and uses e^T to build states with more particles; the method of solution of the valence-state eigenvalue problem is left unspecified. The computation of physical observables from matrix elements of operators requires some care. Direct computation would require an infinite sum over Fock space. One can instead borrow from the many-body coupled cluster method a construction that computes expectation values from right and left eigenstates. This construction can be extended to include off-diagonal matrix elements and gauge projections. Physical quantities can then be computed from the right and left LFCC eigenstates.  Renormalization group  Renormalization concepts, especially the renormalization group methods in quantum theories and statistical mechanics, have a long history and a very broad scope. The concepts of renormalization that appear useful in theories quantized in the front form of dynamics are essentially of two types, as in other areas of theoretical physics. The two types of concepts are associated with two types of theoretical tasks involved in applications of a theory. One task is to calculate observables (values of operationally defined quantities) in a theory that is unambiguously defined. The other task is to define a theory unambiguously. This is explained below. Since the front form of dynamics aims at explaining hadrons as bound states of quarks and gluons, and the binding mechanism is not describable using perturbation theory, the definition of a theory needed in this case cannot be limited to perturbative expansions. For example, it is not sufficient to construct a theory using regularization of loop integrals order-by-order and correspondingly redefining the masses, coupling constants, and field normalization constants also order-by-order. In other words, one needs to design the Minkowski space-time formulation of a relativistic theory that is not based on any a priori perturbative scheme. The front form of Hamiltonian dynamics is perceived by many researchers as the most suitable framework for this purpose among the known options. The desired definition of a relativistic theory involves calculations of as many observables as one must use in order to fix all the parameters that appear in the theory. The relationship between the parameters and observables may depend on the number of degrees of freedom that are included in the theory. For example, consider virtual particles in a candidate formulation of the theory. Formally, special relativity requires that the range of momenta of the particles is infinite because one can change the momentum of a particle by an arbitrary amount through a change of frame of reference. If the formulation is not to distinguish any inertial frame of reference, the particles must be allowed to carry any value of momentum. Since the quantum field modes corresponding to particles with different momenta form different degrees of freedom, the requirement of including infinitely many values of momentum means that one requires the theory to involve infinitely many degrees of freedom. But for mathematical reasons, being forced to use computers for sufficiently precise calculations, one has to work with a finite number of degrees of freedom. One must limit the momentum range by some cutoff. Setting up a theory with a finite cutoff for mathematical reasons, one hopes that the cutoff can be made sufficiently large to avoid its appearance in observables of physical interest, but in local quantum field theories that are of interest in hadronic physics the situation is not that simple. Namely, particles of different momenta are coupled through the dynamics in a nontrivial way, and the calculations aiming at predicting observables yield results that depend on the cutoffs. Moreover, they do so in a diverging fashion. There may be more cutoff parameters than just for momentum. For example, one may assume that the volume of space is limited, which would interfere with translation invariance of a theory, or assume that the number of virtual particles is limited, which would interfere with the assumption that every virtual particle may split into more virtual particles. All such restrictions lead to a set of cutoffs that becomes a part of a definition of a theory. Consequently, every result of a calculation for any observable X_{\\\\rm observable}(\\\\mu) characterized by its physical scale \\\\mu has the form of a function of the set of parameters of the theory, p, the set of cutoffs, say \\\\Lambda, and the scale \\\\mu. Thus, the results take the form : X_{\\\\rm observable}(\\\\mu) = X_{\\\\rm theory}(p, \\\\Lambda, \\\\mu) \\\\, . However, experiments provide values of observables that characterize natural processes irrespective of the cutoffs in a theory used to explain them. If the cutoffs do not describe properties of nature and are introduced merely for making a theory computable, one needs to understand how the dependence on \\\\Lambda may drop out from X_{\\\\rm theory}(p,\\\\Lambda, \\\\mu). The cutoffs may also reflect some natural features of a physical system at hand, such as in the model case of an ultraviolet cutoff on the wave vectors of sound waves in a crystal due to the spacing of atoms in the crystal lattice. The natural cutoffs may be of enormous size in comparison to the scale \\\\mu. Then, one faces the question of how it happens in the theory that its results for observables at scale \\\\mu are not also of the enormous size of the cutoff and, if they are not, then how they depend on the scale \\\\mu. The two types of concepts of renormalization mentioned above are associated with the following two questions: * How should the parameters p depend on the cutoffs \\\\Lambda so that all observables X(p,\\\\Lambda,\\\\mu) of physical interest do not depend on \\\\Lambda, including the case where one removes the cutoffs by sending them formally to infinity? * What is the required set of parameters p? The renormalization group concept associated with the first question predates the concept associated with the second question. Certainly, if one were in possession of a good answer to the second question, the first question could also be answered. In the absence of a good answer to the second question, one may wonder why any specific choice of parameters and their cutoff dependence could secure cutoff independence of all observables X(p,\\\\Lambda,\\\\mu) with finite scales \\\\mu. The renormalization group concept associated with the first question above relies on the circumstance that some finite set p(\\\\Lambda) yields the desired result, : X_{\\\\rm observable}(\\\\mu) = \\\\lim_{\\\\Lambda \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty} X_{\\\\rm theory}[p(\\\\Lambda), \\\\Lambda, \\\\mu] \\\\, . In this way of thinking, one can expect that in a theory with n parameters a calculation of n observables at some scale \\\\mu is sufficient to fix all parameters as functions of \\\\Lambda. So, one may hope that there exists a collection of n effective parameters at scale \\\\mu, corresponding to n observables at scale \\\\mu, that are sufficient to parametrize the theory in such a way that predictions expressed in terms of these parameters are free from dependence on \\\\Lambda. Since the scale \\\\mu is arbitrary, a whole family of such n-parameter sets labeled by \\\\mu should exist, and every member of that family corresponds to the same physics. Moving from one such family to another by changing one value of \\\\mu to another is described as action of the renormalization group. The word group is justified because the group axioms are satisfied: two such changes form another such change, one can invert a change, etc. The question remains, however, why fixing the cutoff dependence of n parameters p on \\\\Lambda, using n conditions that n selected observables do not depend on \\\\Lambda, is good enough to make all observables in the physical range of \\\\mu not depend on \\\\Lambda. In some theories such a miracle may happen but in others it may not. The ones where it happens are called renormalizable, because one can normalize the parameters properly to obtain cutoff independent results. Typically, the set p(\\\\Lambda) is established using perturbative calculations that are combined with models for description of nonperturbative effects. For example, perturbative QCD diagrams for quarks and gluons are combined with the parton models for description of binding of quarks and gluons into hadrons. The set of parameters p(\\\\Lambda) includes cutoff dependent masses, charges and field normalization constants. The predictive power of a theory set up this way relies on the circumstance that the required set of parameters is relatively small. The regularization is designed order- by-order so that as many formal symmetries as possible of a local theory are preserved and employed in calculations, as in the dimensional regularization of Feynman diagrams. The claim that the set of parameters p(\\\\Lambda) leads to finite, cutoff independent limits for all observables is qualified by the need to use some form of perturbation theory and inclusion of model assumptions concerning bound states. The renormalization group concept associated with the second question above is conceived to explain how it may be so that the concept of renormalization group associated with the first question can make sense, instead of being at best a successful recipe to deal with divergences in perturbative calculations. Namely, to answer the second question, one designs a calculation (see below) that identifies the required set of parameters to define the theory, the starting point being some specific initial assumption, such as some local Lagrangian density which is a function of field variables and needs to be modified by including all the required parameters. Once the required set of parameters is known, one can establish a set of observables that are sufficient to define the cutoff dependence of the required set. The observables can have any finite scale \\\\mu, and one can use any scale \\\\mu to define the parameters p(\\\\Lambda), up to their finite parts that must be fitted to experiment, including features such as the observed symmetries. Thus, not only the possibility that a renormalization group of the first type may exist can be understood, but also the alternative situations are found where the set of required cutoff dependent parameters does not have to be finite. Predictive power of latter theories results from known relationships among the required parameters and options to establish all the relevant ones. The renormalization group concept of the second kind is associated with the nature of the mathematical computation used to discover the set of parameters p. In its essence, the calculation starts with some specific form of a theory with cutoff \\\\Lambda and derives a corresponding theory with a smaller cutoff, in the sense of more restrictive, say \\\\Lambda/2. After re-parameterization using the cutoff as a unit, one obtains a new theory of similar type but with new terms. This means that the starting theory with cutoff \\\\Lambda should also contain such new terms for its form to be consistent with the presence of a cutoff. Eventually, one can find a set of terms that reproduces itself up to changes in the coefficients of the required terms. These coefficients evolve with the number of steps one makes, in each and every step reducing the cutoff by factor of two and rescaling variables. One could use other factors than two, but two is convenient. In summary, one obtains a trajectory of a point in a space of dimension equal to the number of required parameters and motion along the trajectory is described by transformations that form new kind of a group. Different initial points might lead to different trajectories, but if the steps are self-similar and reduce to a multiple action of one and the same transformation, say T, one may describe what happens in terms of the features of T, called the renormalization group transformation. The transformation T may transform points in the parameter space making some of the parameters decrease, some grow, and some stay unchanged. It may have fixed points, limit cycles, or even lead to chaotic motion. Suppose that T has a fixed point. If one starts the procedure at this point, an infinitely long sequence of reductions of the cutoff by factors of two changes nothing in the structure of the theory, except the scale of its cutoff. This means that the initial cutoff can be arbitrarily large. Such a theory may possess the symmetries of special relativity, since there is no price to pay for extending the cutoff as required when one wishes to make the Lorentz transformation that yields momenta which exceed the cutoff. Both concepts of the renormalization group can be considered in quantum theories constructed using the front form of dynamics. The first concept allows one to play with a small set of parameters and seek consistency, which is a useful strategy in perturbation theory if one knows from other approaches what to expect. In particular, one may study new perturbative features that appear in the front form of dynamics, since it differs from the instant form. The main difference is that the front variables x^- (or p^+) are considerably different from the transverse variables x^\\\\perp (or p^\\\\perp), so that there is no simple rotational symmetry among them. One can also study sufficiently simplified models for which computers can be used to carry out calculations and see if a procedure suggested by perturbation theory may work beyond it. The second concept allows one to address the issue of defining a relativistic theory ab initio without limiting the definition to perturbative expansions. This option is particularly relevant to the issue of describing bound states in QCD. However, to address this issue one needs to overcome certain difficulties that the renormalization group procedures based on the idea of reduction of cutoffs are not capable of easily resolving. To avoid the difficulties, one can employ the similarity renormalization group procedure. Both the difficulties and similarity are explained in the next section.  Similarity transformations  A glimpse of the difficulties of the procedure of reducing a cutoff \\\\Lambda to cutoff \\\\Lambda/2 in the front form of Hamiltonian dynamics of strong interactions can be gained by considering the eigenvalue problem for the Hamiltonian H, : H \\\\psi = E \\\\psi , where H = H_0 + H_I, H_0 has a known spectrum and H_I describes the interactions. Let us assume that the eigenstate \\\\psi can be written as a superposition of eigenstates of H_0 and let us introduce two projection operators, P and Q, such that P projects on eigenstates of H_0 with eigenvalues smaller than \\\\Lambda/2 and Q projects on eigenstates of H_0 with eigenvalues between \\\\Lambda/2 and \\\\Lambda. The result of projecting the eigenvalue problem for H using P and Q is a set of two coupled equations : H_0 Q \\\\psi + Q H_I Q \\\\psi + Q H_I P \\\\psi = E Q \\\\psi \\\\, , : H_0 P \\\\psi + P H_I Q \\\\psi + P H_I P \\\\psi = E P \\\\psi \\\\, . The first equation can be used to evaluate Q \\\\psi in terms of P \\\\psi , : Q \\\\psi = \\\\frac{1}{E - H_0 - Q H_I Q } \\\\ Q H_I P \\\\psi \\\\, . This expression allows one to write an equation for P \\\\psi in the form : H_{\\\\rm eff} P \\\\psi = E P\\\\psi \\\\, , where : H_{\\\\rm eff} = H_0 + P H_I P + P H_I Q \\\\frac{ 1}{ E - H_0 - Q H_I Q } Q H_I P . The equation for P\\\\psi appears to resemble an eigenvalue problem for H_{\\\\rm eff}. It is valid in a theory with cutoff \\\\Lambda/2, but its effective Hamiltonian H_{\\\\rm eff} depends on the unknown eigenvalue E. However, if \\\\Lambda/2 is much greater than E of interest, one can neglect E in comparison to QH_0Q provided that QH_IQ is small in comparison to Q H_0 Q. In QCD, which is asymptotically free, one indeed has H_0 as the dominant term in the energy denominator in H_{\\\\rm eff} for small eigenvalues E. In practice, this happens for cutoffs \\\\Lambda so much larger than the smallest eigenvalues E of physical interest that the corresponding eigenvalue problems are too complex for solving them with required precision. Namely, there are still too many degrees of freedom. One needs to reduce cutoffs considerably further. This issue appears in all approaches to the bound state problem in QCD, not only in the front form of the dynamics. Even if interactions are sufficiently small, one faces an additional difficulty with eliminating Q-states. Namely, for small interactions one can eliminate the eigenvalue E from a proper effective Hamiltonian in P-subspace in favor of eigenvalues of H_0. Consequently, the denominators analogous to the one that appears above in H_{\\\\rm eff} only contain differences of eigenvalues of H_0, one above \\\\Lambda/2 and one below. Unfortunately, such differences can become arbitrarily small near the cutoff \\\\Lambda/2, and they generate strong interactions in the effective theory due to the coupling between the states just below and just above the cutoff \\\\Lambda/2. This is particularly bothersome when the eigenstates of H_0 near the cutoff are highly degenerate and splitting of the bound state problem into parts below and above the cutoff cannot be accomplished through any simple expansion in powers of the coupling constant. In any case, when one reduces the cutoff \\\\Lambda to \\\\Lambda/2, and then \\\\Lambda/2 to \\\\Lambda/4 and so on, the strength of interaction in QCD Hamiltonians increases and, especially if the interaction is attractive, Q H_I Q can cancel H_0 and E cannot be ignored no matter how small it is in comparison to the reduced cutoff. In particular, this difficulty concerns bound states, where interactions must prevent free relative motion of constituents from dominating the scene and a spatially compact systems have to be formed. So far, it appears not possible to precisely eliminate the eigenvalue E from the effective dynamics obtained by projecting on sufficiently low energy eigenstates of H_0 to facilitate reliable calculations. Fortunately, one can use instead a change of basis. Namely, it is possible to define a procedure in which the basis states are rotated in such a way that the matrix elements of H_I vanish between basis states that according to H_0 differ in energy by more than a running cutoff, say \\\\lambda. The running cutoff is called the energy bandwidth. The name comes from the band-diagonal form of the Hamiltonian matrix in the new basis ordered in energy using H_0. Different values of the running cutoff \\\\lambda correspond to using differently rotated basis states. The rotation is designed not to depend at all on the eigenvalues E one wants to compute. As a result, one obtains in the rotated basis an effective Hamiltonian matrix eigenvalue problem in which the dependence on cutoff \\\\Lambda may manifest itself only in the explicit dependence of matrix elements of the new H_{\\\\rm eff}. The two features of similarity that (1) the \\\\Lambda-dependence becomes explicit before one tackles the problem of solving the eigenvalue problem for H_{\\\\rm eff} and (2) the effective Hamiltonian with small energy bandwidth may not depend on the eigenvalues one tries to find, allow one to discover in advance the required counterterms to the diverging cutoff dependence. A complete set of counterterms defines the set of parameters required for defining the theory which has a finite energy bandwidth \\\\lambda and no cutoff dependence in the band. In the course of discovering the counterterms and corresponding parameters, one keeps changing the initial Hamiltonian. Eventually, the complete Hamiltonian may have cutoff independent eigenvalues, including bound states. In the case of the front-form Hamiltonian for QCD, a perturbative version of the similarity renormalization group procedure is outlined by Wilson et al. Further discussion of computational methods stemming from the similarity renormalization group concept is provided in the next section.  Renormalization group procedure for effective particles  The similarity renormalization group procedure, discussed in #Similarity transformations, can be applied to the problem of describing bound states of quarks and gluons using QCD according to the general computational scheme outlined by Wilson et al. and illustrated in a numerically soluble model by Glazek and Wilson. Since these works were completed, the method has been applied to various physical systems using a weak-coupling expansion. More recently, similarity has evolved into a computational tool called the renormalization group procedure for effective particles, or RGPEP. In principle, the RGPEP is now defined without a need to refer to some perturbative expansion. The most recent explanation of the RGPEP is given by Glazek in terms of an elementary and exactly solvable model for relativistic fermions that interact through a mass mixing term of arbitrary strength in their Hamiltonian. The effective particles can be seen as resulting from a dynamical transformation akin to the Melosh transformation from current to constituent quarks. Namely, the RGPEP transformation changes the bare quanta in a canonical theory to the effective quanta in an equivalent effective theory with a Hamiltonian that has the energy bandwidth \\\\lambda; see #Similarity transformations and references therein for an explanation of the band. The transformations that change \\\\lambda form a group. The effective particles are introduced through a transformation : \\\\psi_s = U_s \\\\, \\\\psi_0 \\\\, U_s^\\\\dagger \\\\, , where \\\\psi_s is a quantum field operator built from creation and annihilation operators for effective particles of size s \\\\sim 1/\\\\lambda and \\\\psi_0 is the original quantum field operator built from creation and annihilation operators for point-like bare quanta of a canonical theory. In great brevity, a canonical Hamiltonian density is built from fields \\\\psi_0 and the effective Hamiltonian at scale s is built from fields \\\\psi_s, but without actually changing the Hamiltonian. Thus, : H_s(\\\\psi_s) = H_0(\\\\psi_0) \\\\, , which means that the same dynamics is expressed in terms of different operators for different values of s. The coefficients c_s in the expansion of a Hamiltonian in powers of the field operators \\\\psi_s depend on s and the field operators depend on s, but the Hamiltonian is not changing with s. The RGPEP provides an equation for the coefficients c_s as functions of s. In principle, if one had solved the RGPEP equation for the front form Hamiltonian of QCD exactly, the eigenvalue problem could be written using effective quarks and gluons corresponding to any s. In particular, for s very small, the eigenvalue problem would involve very large numbers of virtual constituents capable of interacting with large momentum transfers up to about the bandwidth \\\\lambda \\\\sim 1/s. In contrast, the same eigenvalue problem written in terms of quanta corresponding to a large s, comparable with the size of hadrons, is hoped to take the form of a simple equation that resembles the constituent quark models. To demonstrate mathematically that this is precisely what happens in the RGPEP in QCD is a serious challenge.  Bethe-Salpeter equation  The Bethe-Salpeter amplitude, which satisfies the Bethe-Salpeter equation (see the reviews by Nakanishi ), when projected on the light-front plane, results in the light-front wave function. The meaning of the \`\`light-front projection\\" is the following. In the coordinate space, the Bethe-Salpeter amplitude is a function of two four-dimensional coordinates x_{1,2}=(ct_{1,2},\\\\vec{x}_{1,2}), namely: \\\\Phi=\\\\Phi(x_1,x_2;p), where p is the total four-momentum of the system. In momentum space, it is given by the Fourier transform: : \\\\Phi(k_1,k_2;p)=\\\\int d^4x_1 d^4x_2\\\\Phi(x_1,x_2;p)\\\\exp(ik_1 x_1+ik_2 x_2) (the momentum space Bethe- Salpeter amplitude \\\\Phi(k_1,k_2;p) defined in this way includes in itself the delta-function responsible for the momenta conservation k_1+k_2=p). The light- front projection means that the arguments x_1,x_2 are on the light-front plane, i.e., they are constrained by the condition (in the covariant formulation): \\\\omega\\\\cdot x_1=\\\\omega\\\\cdot x_2=0. This is achieved by inserting in the Fourier transform the corresponding delta functions \\\\delta(\\\\omega\\\\cdot x_{1,2}): : \\\\psi_{LF}\\\\propto\\\\int d^4x_1 d^4x_2\\\\delta(\\\\omega\\\\cdot x_1) \\\\delta(\\\\omega\\\\cdot x_2)\\\\Phi(x_1,x_2;p)\\\\exp(ik_1 x_1+ik_2 x_2). In this way, we can find the light-front wave function \\\\psi_{LF}. Applying this formula to the Bethe-Salpeter amplitude with a given total angular momentum, one reproduces the angular momentum structure of the light-front wave function described in Light front quantization#Angular momentum. In particular, projecting the Bethe-Salpeter amplitude corresponding to a system of two spinless particles with the angular momentum l, one reproduces the light-front wave function : \\\\psi_{lm}(\\\\vec{k},\\\\hat{n})=f_1(k, \\\\vec{k}\\\\cdot\\\\hat{n})Y_{lm}(\\\\hat{k})+ f_2(k,\\\\vec{k}\\\\cdot\\\\hat{n})Y_{lm}(\\\\hat{n}), given in Light front quantization#Angular momentum. The Bethe-Salpeter amplitude includes the propagators of the external particles, and, therefore, it is singular. It can be represented in the form of the Nakanishi integral through a non-singular function g(\\\\gamma,z): \\\\int_{-1}^1dz'\\\\int_0^{\\\\infty}d\\\\gamma' \\\\frac{g(\\\\gamma',z')}{\\\\left[\\\\gamma'+m^2 -\\\\frac{1}{4}M^2-k^2-p\\\\cdot k\\\\; z'-i\\\\epsilon\\\\right]^3}, }} where k=(k_1-k_2)/2 is the relative four-momentum. The Nakanishi weight function g(\\\\gamma,z) is found from an equation and has the properties: g(\\\\gamma,z=\\\\pm 1)=0, g(\\\\gamma\\\\to\\\\infty,z)\\\\to 0. Projecting the Bethe-Salpeter amplitude () on the light-front plane, we get the following useful representation for the light-front wave function (see the review by Carbonell and Karmanov): : \\\\psi_{LF}(k_\\\\perp,x)=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{4\\\\pi}}\\\\int_0^{\\\\infty}\\\\frac{x(1-x)g(\\\\gamma',1-2x)d\\\\gamma'} {\\\\Bigl[\\\\gamma'+k_\\\\perp^2 +m^2-x(1-x)M^2\\\\Bigr]^2}. It turns out that the masses of a two-body system, found from the Bethe-Salpeter equation for \\\\Phi(k,p) and from the light-front equation for \\\\psi_{LF}(k_\\\\perp,x) with the kernel corresponding to the same physical content, say, one-boson exchange (which, however, in the both approaches have very different analytical forms) are very close to each other. The same is true for the electromagnetic form factors This undoubtedly proves the existence of three-body forces, though the contribution of relativistic origin does not exhaust, of course, all the contributions. The same relativistic dynamics should generate four-body forces, etc. Since in nuclei the small binding energies (relative to the nucleon mass) result from cancellations between the kinetic and potentials energies (which are comparable with nucleon mass, and, hence relativistic), the relativistic effects in nuclei are noticeable. Therefore, many-body forces should be taken into account for fine tuning to experimental data.  Vacuum structure and zero modes  One of the advantages of light-front quantization is that the empty state, the so-called perturbative vacuum, is the physical vacuum. The massive states of a theory can then be built on this lowest state without having any contributions from vacuum structure, and the wave functions for these massive states do not contain vacuum contributions. This occurs because each p_i^+ is positive, and the interactions of the theory cannot produce particles from the zero-momentum vacuum without violating momentum conservation. There is no need to normal-order the light-front vacuum. However, certain aspects of some theories are associated with vacuum structure. For example, the Higgs mechanism of the Standard Model relies on spontaneous symmetry breaking in the vacuum of the theory. The usual Higgs vacuum expectation value in the instant form is replaced by k^+=0 zero mode analogous to a constant Stark field when one quantizes the Standard model using the front form. Chiral symmetry breaking of quantum chromodynamics is often associated in the instant form with quark and gluon condensates in the QCD vacuum. However, these effects become properties of the hadron wave functions themselves using the front form. This also eliminates the many orders of magnitude conflict between the measured cosmological constant and quantum field theory. Some aspects of vacuum structure in light-front quantization can be analyzed by studying properties of massive states. In particular, by studying the appearance of degeneracies among the lowest massive states, one can determine the critical coupling strength associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking. One can also use a limiting process, where the analysis begins in equal-time quantization but arrives in light-front coordinates as the limit of some chosen parameter. A much more direct approach is to include modes of zero longitudinal momentum (zero modes) in a calculation of a nontrivial light-front vacuum built from these modes; the Hamiltonian then contains effective interactions that determine the vacuum structure and provide for zero-mode exchange interactions between constituents of massive states.

It stands in the Swiss municipality of Lützelflüh in the Canton of Bern above the village Lützelflüh on a rocky outcrop. Today, only the ruins and the moat are still visible.  History  Brandis castle was built in 1230 as the headquarters of the Freiherr of Brandis. The first known member of the family was Konrad (1239–57). His grandson, Thüring (1280-1324), was involved in the murder of King Albert I by the king's nephew John Parricida in 1308. For this involvement, in 1313 Thüring lost the family estates in Spiez in the Berner Oberland. Howerver, he was supported by Bern and the Counts of Kyburg and retained the Lützelflüh lands. The castle from the 13th century was from where there was control of their possessions in the upper and middle Emmental. In 1337 the Freiherr of Brandis received Bernese citizenship. By the 15th century, the family owned lands in what is now eastern Switzerland and Vorarlberg. In 1437 Wolfhart V von Brandis inherited Marschlins Castle and the Maienfeld Herrschaft in Graubünden through his wife Verena von Werdenberg- Bludenz. He began selling off the western Brandis lands. In 1455 the family sold the lordship of Brandis in Bern to the Lords of Scharnachthal. Then there were several changes of ownership until the castle, in 1607, came into the possession of the city Bern and a Bernese bailiff was appointed and took up residence in the castle. During the 1798 French invasion, the castle was burned and almost totally destroyed. It was abandoned and continued to fall into ruin.

Facing a rematch against Tunisia's Anis Lounifi after his bronze medal defeat at the World Championships, Pak could not mount enough strength to topple his opponent with a harai goshi (sweeping hip throw), and thereby lost his opening bout by an ippon at one minute and twenty-eight seconds.

It does not hold exhibitions but acquires and stores works of art that it loans to museums, cultural institutions and temporary exhibitions in France and abroad. It is the largest collection of contemporary art in France. Collection FNAC is little-known, but is the largest collection of living art in France. As of 2014 it had 70,000 works of visual art, photography, decorative art and design. The FNAC has its origins in the Bureau des travaux d'art (Office of Art Works) created in 1878, which became the FNAC in 1976. In 1981 it became the responsibility of the Délégation aux arts plastiques of the French Ministry of Culture. It supports creation of art through acquisition of the work of living artists, and disseminates the work. As well as purchasing work by established artists, it tries to discover new creations of young artists. The FNAC adapts to contemporary trends and is open to diverse artistic approaches. FNAC stores its collection in a facility under the Esplanade de la Défense. The Centre national des arts plastiques (CNAP) manages the collection. Information on the collection is maintained by Videomuseum. FNAC does not exhibit the works, which are meant to be placed on deposit or loaned to museums and cultural institutions, or loaned to exhibitions in France and abroad. Every year almost 2,000 items are loaned for temporary displays in France or abroad, including thematic exhibitions, solo exhibitions, retrospectives and so on. The FNAC takes care of packaging, transportation, ensuring a suitable environment in the place of exhibition, and restoration. Acquisition process Between 1981 and 2014 about 9,000 works by 3,500 different artists have been acquired by the FNAC. FNAC buys 600 to 1,000 new works each year. Purchasing recommendations are made by a commission of members of the arts community, including critics, collectors, artists, and representatives from the Ministry of Culture. The commission meets several times each year to review requests for acquisitions made by artists or galleries. Artists must not have sold their work to the state for two years, and only one nomination is allowed every two years unless specifically requested by the commission. The works are acquired by specialized committees for visual arts, photography, decorative art and design. Members are appointed by the Minister of Culture for three-year terms.

The property includes a traditional New England connected farmstead with house, ell, and barn, all of which date to the mid-19th century, and a landscaped garden area developed beginning in the 1930s by Bernard McLaughlin that now houses more than 500 varieties of flowers. It is one of a small number of such specimen gardens in the state, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. The property is now owned by a local nonprofit organization, and is open to the public free of charge between May and October. Description and history The McLaughlin House is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, three bays wide, which is set close to busy Main Street in South Paris. The main entrance is in the center bay, flanked by sidelight windows and topped by a fanlight, with a sheltering hood supported by heavy Italianate brackets. The bay to the left of the entry has a projecting polygonal bay. A two-story wing is recessed from the main block, and joins the house via a connecting ell to a period barn. The wing and ell have an enclosed porch extending along the south facade. The interior of the main block has woodwork that is transitional Greek Revival/Italianate in style. The house is believed to have been built c. 1851 by John Holmes, who purchased the land in that year, and sold it at a markedly higher price the following year. It remained in the hands of members of the Holmes and Bicknell families until 1890, when it was acquired by Frederick Tribou. Tribou's daughter Rena married Bernard McLaughlin in 1936, and the couple lived there until their deaths (hers in 1986, his in 1995). The Tribous and McLaughlins did not farm the land, instead selling most of it off over time for development. Bernard McLaughlin was an amateur horticulturalist, and he used tracts of the former agricultural lands of the property to build a landscaped specimen garden over a period of six decades. A 1994 survey of the property identified more than 500 different species of plants, predominantly irises and lilacs, although other annual and perennial flowers and woodland plants are also represented in the collection. Although McLaughlin was an amateur, this collection has come to have some importance in Maine as one of only three such gardens statewide. Although McLaughlin's will stipulated that the property be sold off, local preservationists banded together to preserve the property. The property is open to the public free of charge between May and October; guided tours are available for a fee, and its facilities are available for rental.

Newton (November 6, 1908 – October 17, 1976) was an American country music bass player. Career Newton was born in Hartford, Connecticut. By the age of five he had been orphaned and he then lived in several children's homes until the age of 15, when he ran away to appear across the US in various Minstrel shows. He worked as a musician on WLS Radio in the Chicago area, recording with “The Hill Toppers” before becoming a regular bassist for Fred Waring’s Pennsylvanians in 1935. It was whilst he was working for Waring that Newton met up initially with Les Paul, becoming an original member of the famed Les Paul Trio along with Jim Atkins (Chet Atkins' brother). Newton eventually became acquainted with well known singer Red Foley and travelled south to Nashville in 1946 as bass player in Foley’s band “The Foggy River Boys” when Foley was engaged to host the \\"Prince Albert\\" segment of the WSM Grand Ole Opry. In Nashville, Newton's reputation for versatility and professionalism landed him a spot as the Opry's \\"house\\" bass player and he became one of the most utilised session musicians in the country field of music between the late 1940s to the mid 1950s, featuring on numerous recording sessions at leading Nashville studios. At a time when drums were effectively taboo in country music, Newton was the first Nashville bassist to develop and master the technique of mounting a drum head to the bass for rhythmic effect when between plucking the strings he would hit the drum head with a brush held in his right hand.countrymusichalloffame.org/OralHistoryCollection/OralDetailHistory/ernie- newton As a session man, Newton was prolific and can be heard on many of the most iconic country songs of the period such as I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry and Lost Highway (Hank Williams), Making Believe (Kitty Wells), I'm Moving On (Hank Snow), There Stands the Glass (Webb Pierce), I Forgot More Than You'll Ever Know (The Davis Sisters), Blue Moon Of Kentucky (Bill Monroe 1954) and Man of Constant Sorrow (The Stanley Brothers). Newton also introduced maracas into country music when he suggested to Johnnie Wright and Jack Anglin (Country duo “ Johnnie and Jack” ) that they should differentiate themselves from other similar groups by introducing the instrument into their 1951 song Poison Love. The result was a massive hit for the duo and a great feat of technical skill from Newton who played the bass and maracas simultaneously on the recording. Outside of music, Newton was a talented golfer and in the late 1950s he chose to curtail his musical career and became a golf professional at a country club in the Nashville area. Newton died in Nashville, Tennessee on October 17, 1976.

Byzantine mosaic at the Chora Church, Constantinople 1315–20. Publius Sulpicius Quirinius (c. 51 BC – AD 21), also translated as Cyrenius,King James Version of , a back-transliteration of the Greek Κυρήνιος. was a Roman aristocrat. After the banishment of the ethnarch Herod Archelaus from the tetrarchy of Judea in AD 6, Quirinius was appointed legate governor of Syria, to which the province of Judaea had been added for the purpose of a census.Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews, Book XVIII, Chapter 1: \\"Cyrenius came himself into Judea, which was now added to the province of Syria, to take an account of their substance ...\\" Life Born into an undistinguished family in the neighbourhood of Lanuvium, a Latin town near Rome, Quirinius followed the normal pathway of service for an ambitious young man of his social class. According to the Roman historian Florus, Quirinius defeated the Marmaridae, a tribe of desert raiders from Cyrenaica, possibly while governor of Crete and Cyrene around 14 BC, but nonetheless declined the honorific name \\"Marmaricus\\".Erich S. Gruen, \\"The Expansion of the Empire under Augustus\\" in The Cambridge Ancient History, Volume X: The Augustan Empire, 43 BC – AD 69, (Cambridge University Press, 1996) page 168. In 12 BC he was named consul, a sign that he enjoyed the favour of Augustus. From 12 to 1 BC, he led a campaign against the Homanades (Homonadenses), a tribe based in the mountainous region of Galatia and Cilicia, around 5–3 BC, probably as legate of Galatia. He won the campaign by reducing their strongholds and starving out the defenders.Erich S. Gruen, \\"The Expansion of the Empire under Augustus\\" in The Cambridge Ancient History, Volume X: The Augustan Empire, 43 BC – AD 69, (Cambridge University Press, 1996) pages 153–154; see also Ronald Syme, The Roman Revolution, (Oxford University Press, 1939, reissued 2002), page 399. Justin K. Hardin, Galatians and the Imperial Cult, (Mohr Siebeck, 2008) page 56, suggests that it is uncertain whether Quirinius actually served as legate; he may have served only as a military general. For this victory, he was awarded a triumph and elected duumvir by the colony of Antioch of Pisidia.Justin K. Hardin, Galatians and the Imperial Cult, (Mohr Siebeck, 2008) page 56. By 1 AD, Quirinius was appointed tutor to Augustus' grandson Gaius Caesar, until the latter died from wounds suffered on campaign.Livius.org: \\"P. Sulpicius Quirinius\\" When Augustus' support shifted to his stepson Tiberius, Quirinius changed his allegiance to the latter. Having been married to Claudia Appia, about whom little is known, he divorced her and around 3 AD married Aemilia Lepida, daughter of Marcus Aemilius Lepidus and sister of Manius Aemilius Lepidus, who had originally been betrothed to Lucius Caesar.Robin Seager, Tiberius (Blackwell Publishing, 2005), page 129. Within a few years they were divorced: in 20 AD he accused her of claiming that he was her son's father, and later of trying to poison him during their marriage. Tacitus claims that she was popular with the public, who regarded Quirinius as carrying on a prosecution out of spite.Francesca Santoro L'Hoir, Tragedy, Rhetoric, and the Historiography of Tacitus' Annales (University of Michigan Press, 2006), page 177. After the banishment of the ethnarch Herod Archelaus in 6 AD, Iudaea (the conglomeration of Samaria, Judea and Idumea) came under direct Roman administration, with Coponius appointed as prefect. At the same time, Quirinius was appointed Legate of Syria, with instructions to assess Iudea Province for taxation purposes. One of his first duties was to carry out a census as part of this order.Erich S. Gruen, \\"The Expansion of the Empire under Augustus\\" in The Cambridge Ancient History, Volume X: The Augustan Empire, 43 BC – AD 69, (Cambridge University Press, 1996) pages 157 The Jews already hated their pagan conquerors, and censuses were forbidden under Jewish law. The assessment was greatly resented by the Jews, and open revolt was prevented only by the efforts of the high priest Joazar.Jewish Encyclopedia: QUIRINIUS, P. SULPICIUS: \\"The assessment caused great dissatisfaction among the Jews (ib.), and open revolt was prevented only by the efforts of the high priest Joazar (ib. 2, § 1). The levying of this assessment resulted, moreover, in the revolt of Judas the Galilean and in the formation of the party of the Zealots (Josephus, \\"B. J.\\" vii. 8, § 1; Lucas, in Acts v. 37). Josephus mentions the assessment in another passage also (\\"Ant.\\" xx. 5, § 2).\\" Despite efforts to prevent revolt, the census did trigger the revolt of Judas of Galilee and the formation of the party of the Zealots, according to JosephusH.H. Ben-Sasson, A History of the Jewish People, Harvard University Press, 1976, , page 274: \\"Josephus connects the beginnings of the extremist movement [called the Zealots by Josephus] with the census held under the supervision of Quirinius, the legate of Syria, soon after Judea had been converted into a Roman province (6 AD).\\" and of which Luke speaks in the Acts of the Apostles.Ac 5,37 There is a reference to Quirinius in the Gospel of Luke chapter 2, which links the birth of Jesus to the time of the Census of Quirinius, although this appears to contradict the time of Jesus' birth given in the Gospel of Matthew. Quirinius served as governor of Syria with authority over Iudaea until 12 AD, when he returned to Rome as a close associate of Tiberius. Nine years later he died and was given a public funeral. Archaeology The earliest known mention of his name is in an inscription from 12 BC discovered in Antioch Pisidia known as Res Gestae Divi Augusti ('The Deeds of the Divine Augustus'), which states: \\"A great crowd of people came together from all over Italy to my election, ... when Publius Sulpicius (Quirinius) and Gaius Valgius were consuls.\\" Two other inscriptions also found in Pisidian Antioch (Inscriptiones Latinae Selectae 9502–9503) mentioned Quirinius as a Duumvir, when Marcus Servilius was a Roman consul in 3 AD. The discovery of coins issued by Quirinius as governor of Syria, bearing the date \\"the 36th year of Caesar [Augustus]\\" (5/6 AD counted from the Battle of Actium) confirmed his position there. The census that he conducted in Syria has been confirmed by an inscription = ILS 2683 purchased in Beirut in 1674 and brought to Venice, commemorating a Roman officer who had served under him stating among other achievements: \\"By order of the same Quirinius I took a census of the city of Apamea\\". Historical accounts The Roman historian Tacitus wrote in his Annals Book III that when Quirinius died in 21 AD, Tiberius Caesar \\"requested that the Senate pay tribute...with a public funeral\\", and described him as a \\"tireless soldier, who had by his faithful services become consul during the reign of Augustus, ... [and] later was appointed to be an adviser to Caius Caesar in the government of Armenia...\\" The Jewish historian Josephus wrote in more detail about the census of Judea around 6 AD that Quirinius undertook as the governor of Syria.

He killed two of the hostages after releasing the third. A subsequent police investigation officially concluded that Ahmed suffered from mental health issues and acted alone, while the incident was not classified as an act of terrorism. Details On August 13, 2013, Ahmed entered the St. Joseph branch of Tensas State Bank, armed with both a handgun and an AK-47 rifle. His duffel bag was packed with items that he planned to use to torture his hostages. He held three people hostage: Charles Henry \\"Jay\\" Warbington, Jr., of Wisner in Franklin Parish;http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/thetowntalk/obituary.aspx?n=charles- warbington-jay&pid;=166444309 All three were employees at the bank for more than twenty years. During negotiations, state police superintendent, Colonel Mike Edmonson, located a friend of Ahmed's in Alaska, who talked him into releasing one of the hostages, Patricia White. According to Edmondson, Ahmed was \\"mad at people that he said were mean to him. He had voices in his head.\\" Authorities said that Ahmed believed the family of his ex-girlfriend in Lake Providence had caused their breakup and had placed a \\"microphone device\\" of some kind in his head. Eventually, Ahmed shot the remaining two hostages. Warbington died at the scene, while McDaniel was critically wounded and died two days later at Rapides Regional Medical Center in Alexandria. Soon afterward, the Louisiana State Police broke into the bank and fatally shot Ahmed. It did not appear that Ahmed knew the hostages, but the hostages recognized him. The perpetrator Fuaed Abdo Ahmed ( 1993 - August 13, 2013) was identified as the hostage-taker and shooter. His family owned a Trak service station located across the street from the bank. His parents were from Yemen. According to Ahmed on Facebook, he was born in Fresno, California, and was a \\"fan\\" of comedian Jerry Seinfeld and rapper Eminem, and that he was Muslim. Ahmed had been a football player at the private Briarfield Academy, located in Lake Providence in East Carroll Parish in far northeastern Louisiana. His coach, Ben Durham, said that Ahmed had 2,700 rushing yards and 40 touchdowns in his senior year. Durham described Ahmed as never displaying aggressive behavior when playing football, \\"He was a normal good kid. It's not like he ever had any fits of rage. Ever.\\" Sometime later, Durham said that he had a Facebook conversation with Ahmed and noticed the emergence of his paranoid tendencies. =FBI encounter on April 2013= On August 23, 2013, it was disclosed that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had interviewed Ahmed in April while he was visiting in Yemen; his family reported him missing or possibly kidnapped. Ahmed told the agents that he had not been kidnapped and was hearing voices in his head and at times felt suicidal but claimed he would not injure others. Ahmed was also interviewed in June by the Department of Homeland Security in Los Angeles, when he returned to the United States from Yemen. Agents asked him about a Facebook photo posted of himself holding an AK-47 rifle in Yemen. During this interview, DHS said that Ahmed denied any criminal activity or inclination toward terrorism. Authorities in Los Angeles conducted their own evaluation of Ahmed and placed him a medical facility for several days of mental evaluation. =Mental health problems= On March 12, 2014, state police confirmed after a months-long investigation that Ahmed had been treated at a California hospital several weeks prior to the shooting for paranoid schizophrenia. His brother, Yasser, told police that Ahmed had employed yoga for six hours a day in a vain attempt to \\"cure himself\\", rather than taking medication prescribed by doctors. Police found in Ahmed's room a bottle of Risperidone, a drug used to treat schizophrenia; only three of the sixty pills were missing. Yasser confirmed too that Ahmed had used narcotics and bath salts before he left Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, where he had been a short-term student. An investigation found that the four-member SWAT team that breached the bank fired a total of twelve shots and struck Ahmed eight times, finding the police actions justifiable. In a letter found inside the vehicle that he drove to the bank, Ahmed claimed to have ended his ties to Islam, his family, and Middle Eastern culture and heritage. Instead, he extolled his American citizenship and said that he had become a \\"born again Christian\\". Even with those claims, Ahmed contradicted himself when he wrote in the letter, seen by officials as a last will and testament, that neither whites nor non-Muslims could attend his funeral. Aftermath Some 300 St. Joseph residents came together on the evening of August 20 to commemorate the victims. Ronny McDaniel, the husband of Tamara McDaniel, told the gathering that he is relying on his faith, saying, \\"I know in my heart it was meant to be. It was God's will to take them home. If they could come back right now, they wouldn't come back. I just believe they're in a better place.\\" Robby White, husband of Patricia White, the hostage who was released, explained the loss to the community: > This tragedy wasn't on the scale of 9/11, but it had the same effect on this > community. There's no way to describe the feelings that each of us felt when > we discovered the situation had turned so very wrong. We became stunned, > shocked and so damn angry. Colonel Edmonson addressed the gathering and announced a thorough investigation would be undertaken to determine why Ahmed attacked the bank and its employees. Edmonson said that a final report since released would attempt to reveal Ahmed's state of mind to help perhaps prevent future attacks of this kind.

The most northerly one, in brown, is the Archeparchy of Polotsk The cathedral of the archeparchy was Saint Sophia Cathedral in the city of Polotsk.  History  Previously an Eastern Orthodox eparchy headed by a suffragan bishop of the Kiev Metropolitan in Vilnius, in 1596 the eparchy of Polotsk, entered in full communion with the Catholic Church as a Greek Catholic Church through the Union of Brest. The eparchy was among the first that joined the union in 1596 along with eparchies of Kiev, Pinsk, Lutsk, Volodymyr and Kholm. Due to the Union of Brest, Belarus, the former Orthodox Church became known as the Ruthenian Uniate Church. To the archeparchy of Polotsk were later added the territories of the eparchy of Mstislav (also of 13th-century origin) and the 10th-century eparchies of Orsha and Vitebsk.Girolamo Petri, Gerarchia della Santa Chiesa cattolica apostolica Romana, Rome 1851, p. 162Girolamo Petri, Prospetto della gerarchia episcopale in ogni rito e dei vicariati, delegazioni e prefetture in luogo di missione della S.

Those include Havryil Kolenda, Kyprian Zochovskyj, Lev Zalenskyj and many others. In the 1800s, the archeparchy was classified by the Catholic Church as a Ruthenian jurisdiction.

It had a magnitude of at least 5.5 with an epicenter south west of Popayán at a depth of . The earthquake killed 267 people and resulted in the passing of new laws requiring earthquake resistant building materials in zones at risk of tremors. Background Popayán had been founded in 1537 and was renowned for its beauty and surviving examples of architecture from the Spanish colonial period. The city had already suffered natural disasters and had been destroyed on three occasions by an earthquake and two volcanic eruptions. Earthquake The 1983 earthquake occurred at 08:13 on Maundy Thursday of that year. Although it lasted less than half a minute, damage to property was extensive and 267 people were killed, with a further 7,500 people injured. In total, 14,000 buildings were damaged, the majority of them in the city's historic centre. 6,885 of them suffered damage greater than 50% to the structure and a further 4,500 minor damage. 2,470 houses collapsed. Approximately $50 million of damage was caused. Serious damage was also caused to local infrastructure. The residents were left without electricity and water, communications were affected and the damage to the town's airport meant that it could only be used by helicopters and smaller planes. Many of the injured had to be airlifted to Cali, the nearest large city. The quake also affected many of the neighbouring towns and regions and in Cajibio, at least ten people were killed. Aftermath The President of Colombia, Belisario Betancur, accompanied by other members of the government, visited the scene and attended the funerals which followed the disaster. The government responded by securing credit from the World Bank and earmarked $80 million for the city, with half of this to be used for reconstruction and the rest for economic regeneration. Colombia also received assistance from other countries. The Spanish Red Cross sent material to help those injured, the Spanish government also offered assistance, while Venezuela sent a plane to provide medical assistance to the survivors and the United States sent material and medical supplies worth US$700,000. Many one and two-storey buildings which were damaged had been constructed using materials which could not resist earthquakes, based on a mistaken belief that these buildings would be unaffected by any earth tremors. Consequently, the following year, the Colombian government passed a new building code () into legislation which required the construction of dwellings capable of resisting earthquakes. The Colombian Seismic Network was also created, tasked with monitoring seismic changes.

Solomin competed in men's 20 km walk at the 1980 Summer Olympics and contended for the gold medal, but was disqualified from the lead shortly before the finish. He was European indoor champion in men's 5000 m walk in 1983 and briefly held the 20 km world best. He was born in Komarovka in Penza Oblast. Career Track & Field News ranked Solomin in the world's top 10 at 20 km seven times between 1977 and 1984. In July 1978 he walked 20 km in 1:23:30 in Vilnius, breaking the unofficial world record of Mexico's Daniel Bautista by ten seconds. The following month Solomin placed third at the European Championships in Prague, behind Roland Wieser and Pyotr Pochynchuk; Wieser's winning time of 1:23:12 broke Solomin's fresh record by 18 seconds. At the 1980 Summer Olympics Solomin broke away from the main group with Bautista, who was the defending champion and had been ranked #1 in the world every year since 1975; for much of the way, the two seemed headed for gold and silver. In one of the most dramatic moments of the 1980 Games, both Bautista and Solomin were disqualified near the finish for improper walking, and the gold went to Italy's Maurizio Damilano, who had been in third place. Solomin won gold in men's 5000 m walk at the 1983 European Indoor Championships, defeating his teammate Yevgeniy Yevsyukov by almost 22 seconds. He did not compete in the 1983 World Championships, but later that year he placed third at the IAAF Race Walking Cup in Bergen, losing only to the top two from the World Championships, Jozef Pribilinec and Ernesto Canto. Solomin's time of 1:19:43 was his personal best, only 13 seconds off the world best Pribilinec set in winning the race, and remained the Ukrainian record until Ivan Losev broke it at the 2014 Ukrainian championships. Solomin was Soviet champion in the 20 km walk in 1977 and 1981 and placed second behind Nikolay Vinnichenko at the 1979 Soviet Spartakiad. He remains active in race walking as a coach.

The film is a short reconstruction, using miniature models, of a recent historical event: the eruption on 8 May 1902 of Mount Pelée, which destroyed the town of Saint-Pierre, Martinique. Summary Mount Pelée looms over the town of Saint-Pierre. Fire and smoke rises from the crater; then lava begins pouring down the sides of the mountain. The village is soon engulfed in smoke and flames. Production The film is one of the most frequently cited examples of Méliès's \\"reconstructed newsreels,\\" staged re-enactments of current events. The Eruption of Mount Pelee was his third-to- last work in the genre. It was followed by two others also made in 1902: The Catastrophe of the Balloon \\"Le Pax\\" and the most complex one of all, The Coronation of Edward VII. Stylistically, the film is reminiscent of the dioramas popular in the 19th century, which offered simulated views of places and events that would otherwise be inaccessible to spectators. Méliès's table- top miniature models recreate the eruption in a \\"storybook illustration\\" style highly indebted to Romanticism. Academic opinion is divided on the exact method Méliès used to create the eruption. The Méliès descendant and film scholar Jacques Malthête hypothesized that a type of flare known as the Feu de Bengale was used (as Méliès did four years later to create an eruption of Mount Vesuvius in The Merry Frolics of Satan); film historians René Jeanne and Charles Ford nominated a flammable combination of cloth, colored water, cinders, and a kind of powdered chalk called Blanc d'Espagne; Méliès's granddaughter, Madeleine Malthête-Méliès, indicated that starch was poured down the model to simulate lava, and that pieces of paper and unseasoned wood were burned to create smoke; and the Méliès expert John Frazer suggested that the model was made of cardboard and paper and that \\"the eruption [was] created by a combination of flashing lights, powdered chalk, and cinders.\\" According to the film historian Pierre Lephrohon, the poet Guillaume Apollinaire once asked Méliès himself how he made The Eruption of Mount Pelee. Méliès said simply: \\"By photographing cinders and chalk.\\" Apollinaire remarked to a friend who was with them: \\"Monsieur and I have the same occupation, we enchant ordinary materials.\\" Release and other versions The Eruption of Mount Pelee was released by Méliès's Star Film Company and is numbered 397 in its catalogues. Two other filmmakers contemporary with Méliès, Ferdinand Zecca and Thomas Edison, produced their own miniature-model reconstructions of the Pelée eruption. Zecca's version, produced in May 1902 as Catastrophe de la Martinique (number 544 in the Pathé Frères catalogue), used four stagehands to create the eruption effect: one burning sulfur behind the model mountain, another pouring down smoke from a ladder off screen, a third on another ladder throwing down handfuls of sawdust to represent cinders, and a fourth agitating the miniature sea and raising the water level to suggest a tidal wave. The film historian Georges Sadoul notes that Zecca's version aims for academic realism in its style, creating an effect markedly different from Méliès's deliberately Romanticized portrayal. The Edison Manufacturing Company version was released in three parts: Mt. Pelee Smoking Before Eruption (St. Pierre, Martinique), Mt. Pelee in Eruption and Destruction of St. Pierre (Martinique), and Burning of St. Pierre (Martinique). The Edison Company had sent the photographer J. Blair Smith to Martinique to film the aftermath of the accident; meanwhile, the filmmaker Edwin S. Porter stayed at the Edison studio in Orange, New Jersey to recreate the eruption using a studio model. A dozen clips of Smith's real-life footage, and all three of Porter's films simulating different stages of the eruption, were sold by the Edison Company in July 1902; the catalogue encouraged exhibitors to combine the real and faked films to \\"make a complete show in themselves.\\" According to the film historian Lewis Jacobs, the crew that created the Edison version found their own unique way to simulate the eruption: they exposed a barrel of beer to direct sunlight and waited for it to explode. The Eruption of Mount Pelee was presumed lost for many years; a film in the collection of the Cinémathèque Française was sometimes misidentified as Méliès's film, but it was in fact Zecca's version. Méliès's film was finally recovered in 2007, when a copy was found and restored by the Filmoteca de Catalunya.

Active since the mid-1980s, he has been involved as a programmer, musical arranger and producer on projects spanning all music genres. The early years In the mid-1980s, chasing up a job advertisement in The Melody Maker, Wright started working for a keyboard hire company in London, delivering and setting up studio equipment for recording sessions. Although, this was at a time when keyboard and drum programming technology was advancing, the operation of the equipment was unfamiliar to most people. Wright studied the instruction manuals of synthesisers, drum machines etc., in order to obtain offers of programming work in recording studios. In the 1990s, Wright set up his own recording studio and despite the economic recession in the UK creating difficult marketing conditions, the projects soon started to pour in. Working as a musician/producer/programmer, he worked on The KLF hit \\"America:What Time Is Love?\\" This was followed up by a programming stint with Massive Attack on their seminal album Protection. 1995 also saw the beginning of Wright's long and successful working relationship with Simply Red on the album Life. The number one hit \\"Fairground\\" which featured on the record owed plenty to Wright's musical vision of blending Brazilian rhythms and trance house keyboards. Since Life, Wright has worked on every Simply Red and Mick Hucknall album, including eight records over eighteen years. The 1990s By 1996, Wright's career had really started picking up. Friendly with Curve vocalist Toni Halliday and her producer husband, Alan Moulder, he was introduced by them to Dave Stewart of Eurythmics fame. This led to successful collaborations on pop records for Shakespear's Sister, Imogen Heap, Sinead O'Connor and Alisha's Attic. A co-production credit for Tom Jones on the album The Lead and How To Swing It with Alan Moulder and U2 producer, Flood, came soon after. Working with Stewart was an exciting time for Wright: > \\"I still maintain that the 2-3 years I spent working with Dave Stewart was > probably the most fun I've had in my working life. Dave was unpredictable, > always coming up with some idea, project, adventure and often in some far- > flung destination – like a songwriting trip down the Amazon river... Dave > surrounds his projects with huge positivity and that's something I've sought > to inject into my own production style – it really seems to create an > environment that brings out the best in everybody.\\" In 1999 Wright was involved with the production of the Eurythmics album Peace which contained the hit singles \\"I Saved the World Today\\", \\"17 Again\\" and the title track \\"Peace\\". 2000 onwards In 2000 Wright began working with guitar legend Jeff Beck. The resulting album, You Had It Coming, produced a Grammy award-winning track \\"Dirty Mind\\" in the best rock instrumental performance category. Also in 2000 he provided additional production on S Club 7's singles \\"Reach\\" and \\"Bring It All Back\\", as well as co-production for Eurythmics \\"Peace Is Just A Word\\". 2001 saw Wright score a UK number one single with Atomic Kitten's \\"Eternal Flame\\", this was followed by production of Gianna Nannini's album Aria' in 2002. In 2003 Wright and Jeff Beck worked together again on the eponymously titled album Jeff. This too, produced a Grammy winning track, \\"Plan B\\", also in the category best rock instrumental performance. Wright's output in 2003 also included the hit \\"Sunrise\\", the first track off the album Home by Simply Red, work on \\"A Thousand Beautiful Things\\" for Annie Lennox, plus the song \\"Caruso\\" for the Italian tenor Luciano Pavarotti on the album \\"Ti Adoro\\" 2004 / 2005 involved extensive work for Simply Red including co-production of the album Simplified. In 2006 Wright began his collaboration with Macedonian superstar, Toše Proeski on songs for the album The Hardest Thing. Toše was killed in a road accident in October 2007 - he was twenty-six years old. He was given a state funeral on 17 October 2007 in his home town of Krusevo. The Hardest Thing was released posthumously in January 2009 and reached the top of the charts all over the Balkan region. Also in 2006 Wright worked with Soho Dolls, chart-topping Icelandic popsters, Nylon, plus further projects for Simply Red. In 2007 Wright was kept busy on Stay, the final Simply Red album. Following this, in 2008 Wright worked on production of Mick's first solo album post-Simply Red: Tribute to Bobby. =Highlights from recent projects= 2020 - co-production of 'Blue Eyed Soul' Simply Red's 12th Studio Album - which debuted at no 6 on the UK album chart https://www.officialcharts.com/charts/albums-chart/20191115/7502/ 2019 - Simple Minds album (mixing) 'Live in the City of Angels'.

The cartoon parodies radio crime stories and film noir dramas. Plot Donald Duck's imagination, enhanced by scary stories on the radio and in books, moves him into a seemingly real crime world, which ultimately turns out to be imaginary. Donald's dream is enhanced by the backgrounds that abruptly change each time a new character appears in it. Scenes where Donald is threatened with a knife and the detective is threatened with an axe were at one time cut, but have been restored for the DVD release. The cartoon is perhaps the closest Disney ever got to the zany world of Tex Avery, and specifically references his Who Killed Who? (1943) in two ways: the use of an organ instead of a traditional orchestral score, and having Billy Bletcher voice the detective. Additionally, the character of Pauline is an obvious inspiration for the character of Jessica Rabbit in the 1988 feature Who Framed Roger Rabbit.

The film, which is based on Moon landing conspiracy theories, had its world premiere at SXSW on March 14, 2015. It had a limited release on January 15, 2016 and was available through video on demand by Alchemy. Plot In the days leading up to the Apollo 11 Moon landing, CIA agent Tom Kidman is tasked with hiring Stanley Kubrick to film a fake moonwalk, in the event the astronauts fail in their mission. The CIA views the Moon landing as a potential ideological victory over the Soviet Union, necessary for American morale. The CIA gives Kidman a large sum of cash as an incentive for Kubrick, and orders him to murder Kubrick when the film is complete to prevent the story from leaking. Unbeknownst to the CIA, Kidman is suffering from post traumatic stress disorder due to his time in Vietnam, and responds to any frustration with extreme violence. Kidman travels to England to speak with Kubrick's agent, only to accidentally hold a meeting with the agent's cousin, Jonny Thorpe, a struggling band promoter in debt to an East End gangster named the Iron Monger. Jonny agrees to arrange a sit-down between Kidman and Kubrick, then convinces his stoner roommate Leon to pose as the director. Leon and Kidman meet, and Jonny accepts the briefcase of money, promising the movie will be made. Thinking Kidman is simply a Hollywood producer, the pair go on a spending spree before the Iron Monger's henchman break into Jonny's house, beat him, and steal the briefcase. Kidman sees Stanley Kubrick on television and realizes he's been duped. He confronts Jonny, who confesses his scheme. Seeing an opportunity to establish himself as a success, Jonny promises that a friend of his, a director named Renatus, can film a fake Moon landing. Jonny takes Kidman to meet Renatus at the director's mansion, which he has turned into a commune. Thinking he's being hired for an art project, Renatus accepts. Meanwhile, a hippie girl named Ella takes an interest in Kidman. Kidman takes Jonny to confront the Iron Monger and get the briefcase of money back. Rather than negotiate with the Iron Monger, Kidman murders several of his henchmen and takes the briefcase back by force. Production is stalled when Renatus insists on approaching the film as a piece of performance art, intending to include several artistic flourishes. In an attempt to show off his alleged immunity to marijuana, Kidman takes a hit from a bong, which turns out to have been laced with opium. In an effort to help him recover from its effects, Ella gives him LSD, sending Kidman on a bad trip, after which he has sex with Ella. In the throes of his trip, Kidman tells Ella and Leon he no longer feels compelled to solve his problems with violence. Afterwards, he makes an incoherent call to the CIA, attempting to update them on his status. Alarmed by Kidman's call, the CIA sends several agents to England. They take the entire commune hostage and force everyone to begin filming the fake Moon landing. Jonny and Leon take on the roles of the astronauts; Leon, nervous at the prospect of being on television, gets high and begins having a trip on set, stumbling around the fake Moon surface. Meanwhile, the Iron Monger arrives and engages in a shootout with the CIA, in which most of the Iron Monger's henchmen and CIA agents are killed. In the midst of the shootout, the fake footage is successfully broadcast via closed circuit to CIA headquarters. Jonny, feeling he finally has the opportunity to make a difference in the world, attempts to protect Kidman from the Iron Monger, but is shot. After killing the Iron Monger, Kidman tells a stunned Jonny that his spacesuit absorbed the bullet, and lies that Jonny's interference saved his life. Now wanted by the CIA, Jonny, Leon, Kidman and Ella flee England. A montage shows news clips of American life through the 1960s, culminating with Apollo 11 reaching the Moon. In Spain, Jonny, Leon, Ella and Kidman enter a bar in time to watch the Moon landing with several villagers. They are unable to tell if the landing is real or if they're watching their own fake footage.

Release The film premiered at South by Southwest on March 14, 2015. On March 16, 2015, Alchemy picked up distribution rights to the film. The film was released in the United States on January 15, 2016, in a limited release and through video on demand. Critical reception Moonwalkers received mixed reviews from film critics. It holds a 42% \\"Rotten\\" rating on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 38 reviews, with an average score of 5.06/10. On Metacritic, the film holds a rating of 39 out of 100, based on 10 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews. John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter gave the film a mixed review writing: \\"Too much faith has been put in the comic value of Dean Craig's screenplay, which offers plenty of mishaps and shocking violent outbursts, but not so many laughs. Aside from a look at Renatus's pretentiously goofy most recent film, the funniest thing here is the most predictable scene, a sequence in which crew-cut, all-business Kidman gets dosed with acid. For a moment, Johnny turns into the grown-up of the bunch — a terrifying prospect for a plan that was counting on having a perfectionist cinematic genius at the helm.\\" Susan Wloszczyna of RogerEbert.com gave the film a negative review, writing: \\"Forget a fake moon landing. \\"Moonwalkers\\" is a fake comedy, one that mistakes an endless bloody splatter-fest of a finale for the height of hilarity and never quite gets off the ground after takeoff.\\" References External links * * (rating 2/5) Category:2015 films Category:2015 comedy films Category:Films about conspiracy theories Category:Films about filmmaking Category:Films about the Apollo program Category:Films set in 1969 Category:French films Category:French comedy films Category:Moon landing conspiracy theories Category:2015 directorial debut films ","title":"Moonwalkers (film)"},{"id":"44608521","text":"Vykintas Vaitkevičius is a Lithuanian archaeologist.Vykintas Vaitkevičius, papers at academia.edu Vaitkevičius graduated from the Vilnius University (1996: B.S. history, specialty archaeology; 1998: M.S. history, specialty archaeology; 2000: doctorate in humanities)Vykintas Vaitkevičius, profile at the Vilnuis University website (retrieved December 3, 2014) His research interests include Baltic and ancient Lithuanian religion, comprehensive studies of Lithuania and Belarus, and digitization of cultural heritage.

The system was first noted as an ill-defined low-pressure area (\\"low\\") located within the intertropical convergence zone near the Cape York Peninsula. Over the next few days the low moved eastwards and increased in strength; it was named Nigel on January 16 as it developed into a tropical cyclone. Meteorological history Severe Tropical Cyclone Nigel was first noted as an ill-defined low, located within the intertropical convergence zone near the Cape York Peninsula during January 1985. Over the next several days, the system gradually moved eastwards into the Coral Sea, before the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) reported that a recognizable circulation had developed during January 14. Over the next two days, the low moved eastwards and slowly developed further, before the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) initiated advisories on the system and designated it as Tropical Cyclone 13P early on January 16. Later that day the BoM named the system Nigel as it became equivalent to a modern-day category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale and moved out of the Australian region into the South Pacific basin. By this time, the JTWC were reporting that Nigel, had become equivalent to a category 1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. During January 17, Nigel developed an eye and became equivalent to a category 3 severe tropical cyclone, before it passed very near to or over various northern Vanuatuan islands, including Espiritu Santo. During January 18, Nigel's eyewall started to appear on Nadi airports surveillance radar, as it had started to move south-eastwards towards Fiji. Early the next day the JTWC estimated that Nigel had peaked with 1-minute sustained wind speeds of 195 km/h (120 mph), which made it equivalent to a category 3 hurricane on the SSHWS. At around the same time, it was estimated that Nigel had peaked with 10-minute sustained wind speeds of 150 km/h (90 mph), which made it equivalent to a category 3 severe tropical cyclone on the Australian scale. During January 19, as the system moved closer towards Nadi its eye became more distinct on the radar, which showed that Nigel had started to slowly weaken, possibly due to strong vertical wind shear and dry air driven up from higher latitudes by Cyclone Eric. Later that day at around 04:00 UTC (16:00 FST), the system passed near Fiji's southern Yasawa Islands and northern Mamanuca Islands. The centre of Nigel's eye subsequently made landfall on Fiji's largest island Viti Levu about an hour later, while equivalent to a category 3 severe tropical cyclone. As Nigel moved inland it rapidly weakened due to frictional forces and became equivalent to a category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian scale. The system subsequently emerged into the Pacific Ocean later that day, before it passed through the Tongan Islands and to the south of Niue during January 20. Nigel weakened below tropical cyclone intensity during January 22, before it was last noted during January 28, while located about to the north of Auckland, New Zealand. Preparations and impact =Vanuatu= Cyclone Nigel was the second of three tropical cyclones to affect Vanuatu within a week, and the second of five tropical cyclones to impact Vanuatu in 1985. Nigel affected the islands of Espiritu Santo, Ambae, Maewo and Pentecost between January 17 and 18, and was thought to have caused more damage than Cyclone Eric. As the system passed near the weather station on Espiritu Santo, an anemometer was destroyed as it recorded a wind gust of , while a minimum pressure of was also recorded. After assessing the damage and finding thousands of people homeless, the Government of Vanuatu established a disaster relief and reconstruction fund. The Government of Vanuatu asked the Australian Government for emergency food aid and other emergency humanitarian relief assistance including shelters and sanitation equipment. Australia flew in four survey teams by helicopter and sent six C-130 plane loads of humanitarian assistance which included plastic sheeting, ropes, medical supplies, clothing and rice. UNDRO and the governments of the UK and the USA donated money to the Vanuatuan Government, while France donated a cargo of food that was flown in from Nouméa, New Caledonia. =Fiji= Nigel was the second of two severe tropical cyclones to make landfall on the Fijian Island of Viti Levu within 36 hours, and the second of four tropical cyclones to impact Fiji in 1985. Ahead of the system making landfall, relief efforts for Cyclone Eric, which had hit the same region just two days earlier, had to be suspended. As the system affected Fiji, around 1000 people took shelter in the Nadi International Airport passenger terminal. Once Nigel left Fiji, on January 19, the relief effort from Cyclone Eric was resumed with ships sent to the outer islands to assess the damage. 272 tourists were flown back to Melbourne Airport during January 21, after they had been through both systems. The following day the Fijian Government outlined their long-term rehabilitation needs and requested international assistance from the United Nations Disaster Relief Organization and various countries. These needs included a six-month food-rationing project for 10,000 households, a rehabilitation program for 10,000 shelters and improved internal communication including between the FMS in Nadi and the capital city Suva. Australia donated to the Fijian Prime Ministers Relief Fund in order to provide food to those who needed it.

It is a home for refugees from Burundi,DR Congo,Rwanda, Kenya and South Sudan.  Population  As of 2018,the camp, Kiryandongo Refugee Settlement, hosted over 60,0000 refugees. History The Kiryandongo area was first used for resettling refugees in 1954 when the British colonial administration asked the Bunyoro Native Government to give the Colonial Government of the Governor to move Kenyan refugees fleeing the Mau Mau Uprising to Kigumba in what was then Masindi District. The Bunyoro Native Government gave land to the Governor for the period of 49 years. During the Idi Amin administration, the land was part of a large-scale government ranching scheme, of which reminders remain today in the names of the subdivisions of the camp. This left the land sparsely populated. In 1990 the Ugandan government gazetted the virtually uninhabited land around Kiryandongo for refugee resettlement. Ethnic Acholi people fleeing the Sudan People's Liberation Army from Parjok in South Sudan were settled in Kiryandongo after temporarily being held in Kitgum and Masindi. During the 1990s the Sudanese refugees were joined by Ugandan Acholi IDPs from the LRA-affected areas of Gulu and Kitgum. Kiryandongo also served as an interim stop for displaced people transiting to other camps, including 22,000 who moved from the Achol- Pii Refugee Settlement to Kyangwali in 2002.  Social services  The youth program at Kiryadongo refugee settlement Partnering with the Western Union Foundation, the Youth Peacemaker Network directly into the Kiryandongo Refugee Settlement, which hosts over 65,000 people, a majority of them young people has come in to engage the young people at the camp in worthwhile events and programs to keep them at work and development. Filming in refugee camps in Uganda is possible as Film crew fixers as your local fixers will handle all the ground process and give all relevant information, Kirandongo is one of the best filming refugee locations in the country of Uganda.  Education  Many children and youth drop out of school due to high school fees and related costs, such as uniforms and school materials. Secondary school-aged students are particularly affected and reported that non-governmental organizations provide only a few opportunities for scholarships. Respondents also noted that classrooms are overcrowded and reportedly under-qualified teachers rarely follow the standard curriculum.  Health care and Sanitation  The Kiryandongo Refugee Settlement in Bweyale, Uganda, is a UNHCR managed refugee settlement that provides shelter, land, and support for more than 100,000 people based on health care, education, and vocational training since 2008. Water crisis at Kiryandongo Refugee Settlement is brewing conflict among the different ethnic communities in the settlement, leaders say. The residents of the settlement said the population is very high and the water sources in place is not enough for them. Wilbrord Turimaso, the project manager of Austrian Development Agency said, though the project took long to pick up, they are hopeful that soon the water shall start flowing. He warned the contractor to be careful while working in the settlement because the law is very strict. The water supply system is being constructed in Ranch one and will also serve the host community of Panyadoli.

After college and then a brief teaching stint, Jackson left the school system, and became the label head for Silk Entertainment (owned by Steve \\"Silk\\" Hurley). It was there that he learned the executive side of the business, as well. There was also a creative opportunity for Jackson, as he remixed Ann Nesby’s rendition of “Lovin’ Is Really My Game (George's Deep Lovin' Dub)”. He also assisted Hurley (as assistant engineer), on the remix of “Soul Shakedown” by Bob Marley, which was released on Koch Records (Canada) and Silk Entertainment, and then Grammy nominated for best remixed recording in 2002. As one of the featured producers on the Chicago LP and DVD, Jackson joined forces with many other Chicago house music hit-makers (past and present) which formed one of the greatest house music collaborations of all-time. His production of “Another Day” (featuring Xaviera Gold) can be heard on the Chicago LP on S&S; Records. Also, he remixed \\"Wastelands\\" by Hippie Torrales, George Mena and singer Robin Reed, which was released on Universe Media - UK. Throughout the years as a DJ, Jackson has had residencies and regular guest spots in the Chicago area, at clubs such as Zentra Nightclub, The Prop House, and Red Dog. He has also DJed at Sidecar Cafe, Tom's Hidden Lounge, The Upstairs Lounge, and more. Outside of Chicago, George has premiered alongside CeCe Peniston and DJ Eddie X for Pride 2007 in Albuquerque, New Mexico. He has traveled overseas playing in Australia at Tankclub (Sydney, Australia) and Chevron Nightclub (Melbourne, Australia). He has also played in Sheffield, England as well.  History  In 2002, Jackson teamed up with Markeydisko (Diskonauts), resulting in two productions, one being a house and jazz-infused tune entitled \\"Lost In Hyperspace\\" (Diskonauts). Their other production, \\"Call My Name\\" (Sharon Pass and Greg Gibbs ), was released on vinyl on Jackson's label, Ruff N' Tuff Records, and was eventually licensed to Mousse T's label, Peppermint Jam. It was then remixed by Richard Earnshaw, Shik Stylko, and Syke 'n' Sugarstarr, and appears on many compilations worldwide. Jackson collaborated with UK house music producers Audiowhores (Graham Lord and Adam Unsworth) in 2003, which led to a trans-Atlantic co-production of a house tune called “Work It Out”, sung by recording artist RaShaan Houston and released on Peppermint Jam. Not long afterward, Jackson reunited with Houston and co-wrote the lyrics to “Happy”; which in turn, was a co-production with producer and entertainment attorney, Babatunde Williams. It was released on vinyl on an underground Chicago label, Bumpin' City Records. \\"Happy\\" caught the attention of legendary New Jersey DJ, Tony Humphries, who then featured \\"Happy\\" in his DJ mix on the Southport Weekender Vol. 4 double cd mix compilation. Using the moniker DJ George J, in 2004, Jackson produced the UK dance anthem entitled “Never Gonna Let You Go”, sung by Chicago recording artist Cristina Sanchez (DJ George J. feat. Sevynn). Signed and released on Mel Medalie's UK-based label Champion Records, it soon climbed to number 6 on the UK Club Charts; and in 2005, it went into pop radio rotation on the UK radio shows of Pete Tong & Judge Jules. In 2005, Jackson and Houston collaborated again, recording \\"Warrior\\" (RaShaan Houston/Ruff N' Tuff Records), which got remixes from Chicago house music Ron Carroll and Eric \\"E-Smoove\\" Miller. Houston, Jackson, and CeCe Peniston co-wrote \\"It's Alright\\" [(Redsoul & RaShaan Houston (Generate Music)]. In 2014, Jackson and childhood friend Evette Clark co-wrote the lyrics to \\"Love Don't Take Over\\". This time, Peniston delivered the vocals and once again, Markeydisko and George collaborated on the production. This time, they called themselves, \\"MG Select\\". The song caught the attention of Frankie Knuckles, and was then remixed by both Knuckles and Eric Kupper (collectively known as Director's Cut).

History  Rwamwanja settlement was established in 1964 to host refugees from Rwanda and closed in 1995 when many repatriated after the 1994 Genocide against Tutsi. The settlement was later reopened in 2012 to host refugees fleeing the Democratic Republic of Congo due to violence in North and South Kivu. The settlement, currently hosting almost 76,000 refugees, is at full capacity and no longer receives new arrivals. as of the recent influx from the democratic Republic of Congo The Rwamwanja camp is managed by the UNHCR and the Ugandan Office of the Prime Minister's Department of Refugees (OPM). Services to refugees are implemented by a host of \\"implementing partner\\" NGOs, principally the Lutheran World Federation, the Windle Charitable Trust, Africa Humanitarian Action and African Initiative for Relief Development. Most of the current residents of the Rwamwanja settlement are Congolese nationals who fled the M23 rebellion and the broader Kivu conflict beginning in early 2012.  Social Services  Accessing land within the Rwamwanja settlement, is 92% where the shelter is located where as 13% of the population access land in a separate plot. There are more than 280 U-reporters in the settlement, a system that allows refugees and host communities to exchange information in the camp and share with the world, both the refugee community and child protection officers from various implementing partners including United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), Lutheran World Federation (LWF) and GOAL, are working together in this program at the camp to increase the number of U-reportersas it continues to grow. Trained to expand their rice and pepper harvests, Congolese refugees in Uganda use earnings to start new businesses and become more self-reliant with the support rendered by the implementing organizations and humanitarian bodies in the Rwamwanja refugee settlement. There is a building of a 10,000 tree native food forest at the Rwamwanja Refugee Settlement in Uganda. The settlement which houses over 70,000 refugees, most with little food access or employment opportunities is an immediate beneficiary to this long term project for the benefit of the refugees as well as the Host Community. The food forest will employ refugees, provide healthy food sources, and decrease soil degradation. With a 100 acre piece of land already donated, fundraising for income for the refugee forest workers, tools, and seedlings is underway and on process to see to it that the implementation and success of this is seen and recorded..  Water and Sanitation  IN 2013,Rwamwanja had 55 functional boreholes and shallow wells providing clean and safe water to the refugees.51 of these were installed with handpumps, while 4 are motorized with pipeline distribution to 11 tap stand locations (40 water taps). Water coverage at the end of 2013 was 13 liters per person per day. Rainwater harvesting is also done at all health centers, schools and reception Centers In a baseline study conducted by SPOUTS in 2019, it was found that more than 53% of the population does not treat their drinking water before consumption. Moreover, the 47% who occasionally treat their drinking water, mainly boil it using firewood and charcoal, which contributes to deforestation and environmental degradation. During the survey, 168 cases of diarrhea, 92 cases of Typhoid and 11 cases of Bilharzia were reported which is an alarming rate and a deadly thing in the development of the Rwamwanja Refugee settlement.  Education  in 2013,There were 20 early childhood development centers and child friendly spaces that were run by Windle Trust Uganda (WTU) and Save the Children. At the time were 5 primary schools in the settlement, 3 of which are run by UNHCR/WTU: Rwamwanja primary, Mahani primary, Nteziryayo primary and the newest - Kyempango primary and 1 secondary school. UNHCR, through WTU, recruited 100 trained teachers across the settlement. Child rights clubs have been set up in 5 schools in Rwamwanja (Mahani primary, Nteziryayo primary, Rwamwanja primary, Nkoma church of Uganda primary and Rwamwanja secondary) along with Parent Teacher Associations (PTAs) and School Management Committees (SMCs). 8,135 refugee children were enrolled in 2013, giving 77 % of the total number of school going age enrolled in primary education.  Sports activities  The Taekwondo project is located in Rwamwanja refugee settlement, Uganda, and is an aspiration of Uganda Taekwondo Federation to open clubs in other settlements, if there is consistent institutional support and some prospect of sustainability. OPM - Office of the Prime Minister and UNHCR Rwamwanja welcomed the idea very much as there is so little activity being offered at the youth centres, and as contribution to combating Sexual Gender Based Violence (SGBV). Six taekwondo demonstration sessions have taken place there and as a result a Congolese practitioner of taekwondo was identified and invited for intensive training as a coach in Kampala.  Housing and Property  According to REACH reports , 81% of shelter tenure is owned by the head of the household, 13% Owned jointly between household member. 5% rented and 1% Owned by neighbors (rent free). In May 2019, 30% of the households reported owning no property at all out of 70 % who do not have access to the property in the refugee camp. This is an indicator that the property owned at the refugee camp at Rwamwanja is closed to and restricted only to Ugandan Host community.

It was incorporated in 1848 to connect the Taunton Branch Railroad in Weir Village, Taunton with the Fall River Railroad and newly built Cape Cod Branch Railroad in Middleborough through the town of Raynham. In 1853, the railroad changed its name to the Middleborough and Taunton Railroad. On July 1, 1873, the railroad merged with the Taunton Branch Railroad and the New Bedford and Taunton Railroad to form the New Bedford Railroad, linking the line with the deep-water whaling port of New Bedford. The merger caught the attention of the Boston, Clinton and Fitchburg Railroad, which had leased the Mansfield and Framingham Railroad that connected its terminus in Framingham with the northern end of the Taunton Branch Railroad just six months earlier on January 1, 1873. Less than a year later, on February 2, 1874, the New Bedford Railroad was leased for fifty years to the Boston, Clinton and Fitchburg Railroad, and two months after the lease was signed, on April 8, 1874, the Legislature of Massachusetts authorized the sale of the former Middleborough and Taunton Railroad to the Old Colony Railroad. In 1893, the Old Colony Railroad was leased to the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad. By the 1960s, the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad, like many railroads, was struggling to stay solvent in the face of increased competition from alternate modes of transportation, and so in 1961 it petitioned to be included in the newly formed Penn Central Transportation Company. On December 31, 1968 all of its properties were purchased by Penn Central.Drury, George H. (1994).

On August 22, 1998, the Surface Transportation Board approved the buyout of Conrail by CSX and Norfolk Southern, with the former assuming control of the former Taunton and Middleborough Railroad line and continuing operations along its tracks to this day.

Early life and education David DeBoor Canfield (birth name, David Ellis Canfield) was born in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on September 23, 1950. Early musical studies were with his father, John Canfield, who taught his son piano, violin and music theory beginning when he was six years old. Canfield's first juvenile compositions date from 1957 when he was seven, but throughout high school and the first two and a half years of college, he pursued studies in chemistry, only changing his major to music halfway through his junior year. Graduate studies in composition were undertaken at Indiana University, where Canfield studied primarily with John Eaton, as well as with Frederick Fox and Bernhard Heiden. He received his Master of Music in 1977 and Doctor of Music in 1983. Not wishing to pursue a career in academia, he instead began in 1978 a business, Ars Antiqua, selling classical LP records around the world, becoming the largest such dealer for several decades. All the while, however, he continued to compose, building up a catalog of more than 130 mature works. It was in graduate school that he replaced his given middle name with his mother's maiden name for professional use. Music Canfield's music has been heard on five continents, and has been performed by some of the world's most accomplished soloists, including saxophonists Claude Delangle, Otis Murphy, Stephen Page, Timothy Roberts (saxophonist), Kenneth Tse, and the Oasis Quartet and Zzyzx Quartet; violinists Andrés Cárdenas and Rachel Patrick; pianists John O’Conor, David Brunell, and Benjamin Boren, and ensembles such as the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra, United States Marine Band, United States Navy Band, Orchestre de la Garde Republicaine, Columbus Indiana Philharmonic, Thailand Philharmonic Orchestra, Poznan Philharmonic Orchestra (Poland), Sinfonia da Camera, and the Southeast Iowa Symphony Orchestra. Canfield's music has won numerous accolades including first place in the Jill Sackler Composition Contest and the Dean's Prize from Indiana University. His music formed the basis of a three-day festival given by faculty and students of the University of Central Oklahoma in 2001, and has been featured at the World Saxophone Congresses of 2003, 2006, 2009 & 2012\\\\. His music is published by Jeanné, Inc., TRN, and Evensong Music, and is recorded on the Albany, Bloomington Symphony Orchestra, Crystal, Enharmonic, Jeanné Digital Recordings, Move, MSR, Recherché, Toccata Classics, and US Navy Band labels. In recent years, he has augmented the works he has written in his usual style of \\"free tonality\\" with a group of pieces he terms his \\"after\\" series. This group includes numerous works written in the style of older composers who did not happen to write for certain instruments. The earliest of these works, his 2007 Concerto after Glière, has received more than 100 performances in 30 countries to date, given that it was written for saxophone and orchestra in a romantic style for an instrument that has little original romantic music. Although this work draws upon some of Glière's music, subsequent works in the \\"after\\" series, including Quintet after Schumann (for saxophone quartet and piano), Trio after Brahms (for alto sax, violin and piano) and Rhapsody after Gershwin (for violin and orchestra) utilize no direct quotes from the composers in whose tribute they have been written. http://www.jeanne-inc.com/mm5/graphics/Composer%20Bios/Canfield%20bio.htm References Category:Living people Category:1950 births Category:American male classical composers Category:American classical composers Category:20th- century classical composers Category:21st-century classical composers Category:21st-century American composers Category:Musicians from Fort Lauderdale, Florida Category:Indiana University Bloomington alumni Category:20th-century American composers Category:20th-century American male musicians Category:21st-century American male musicians ","title":"David DeBoor Canfield"},{"id":"44608976","text":"The Rally for Democracy and Socialism (, RDS) is a political party in Burkina Faso led by Salfo Théodore Ouédraogo.Tom Lansford (2014) Political Handbook of the World 2014, CQ Press, p204 History The party was established on 20 June 2009.Présidentielle 2010 : Le RDS pose ses conditions Le Faso, 28 June 2010 It received 0.8% of the vote in the 2012 parliamentary elections, winning a single seat in the National Assembly.

It is a tree that can be found throughout the Caribbean islands from Cuba to Trinidad. Description Its growth habit is a small tree or large shrub. It grows to about . It has simple, alternate leaves that are rough and hairy below but dark green above. The flowers on the plant are fragrant and cream colored; growing in branched, determinate, and erect clusters. The ripe fruits are across, white, with a waxy texture and sticky pulp inside. Ecology C. sulcata is found in places where the annual rainfall is between , with high humidity. It grows in humid subtropical areas of the Caribbean. This plant uses pollinators such as bees to pollinate and birds eat the fruit as a form of seed dispersal. Thus, it cannot tolerate shade and the seedlings cannot survive under a closed canopy. It grows in soil derived from various parent rocks: limestone, sedimentary, and volcanic (including serpentine), and thus multiple soil properties are accepted by this species, including soil texture which can vary from sandy to clay. The small bowl-shaped flowers are probably pollinated by generalist insects. The fruits are eaten mainly by birds, such as Spindalis portoricensis – the sticky pulp of the fruits does not seem to be a problem and it is a valuable food source. Cultivation and uses The wood from C. sulcata is used for barrels and boxes since it is a soft/lightweight type of wood. It is also normally used for fuel, charcoal, and poles. From the fruit of the tree, the mucilage (viscous solution that is extracted from the fruit) is used for glue and maintaining dreadlocks. Parts of the tree have been used in the past for folk medicine, such as treating bronchitis and as a diuretic.

She is notable for her work in the Hamilton-based comics collective Oats Comics, her own long running serial comic Nice Gravy and in recent times taking a prominent role in the promotion and recognition of New Zealand women's comics through her association with the Three Words anthology. Indira Neville is also notable for her work as an educationalist. She was a CORE Education eFellow, a winner of a Microsoft Innovative Teacher Award for her teaching, and a former principal of a primary school. She is also an active performer, and is currently fronting the Auckland band The Biscuits.  Biography  Neville began her career working in television production after graduating from Auckland University of Technology in 1993. After gaining a graduate diploma in teaching in 1997, Neville worked in the field of primary education. She became recognised for her educational work in ICT and eLearning, and was principal of Mulberry Grove School, on Great Barrier Island, New Zealand. She currently works for the National Library of New Zealand as a principal adviser. She has appeared in numerous New Zealand and Australian exhibitions and anthologies, including Oats, Dad and Tracy, My Soiled Sample, Pictozine, Tiny Peeks, Blood and Thunder, My Life as a Mega-rich Bombshell, and Loser Gurrl. Her work has also appeared in the mainstream magazines f*INK, Pavement, Loose, and Werewolf, and she is a regular contributor to the published Melbourne comics periodical Dailies.  Oats Collective  Oats Comics was established in 1993 in Hamilton, New Zealand. Neville began drawing mini comics, both solo and in collaboration with fellow Oats creators Clayton Noone and Stefan Neville, her brother. She contributed to Oats collective publications, including Dad and Tracy and The Hood, as well as their exhibitions. In 2005 they held an exhibition entitled A Fist or a Club or Something at Special Gallery, in Customs St. East, Auckland, and here she launched her solo comic book I am a Comic. She started her most notable solo comic Nice Gravy while a member of Oats Comics collective.  Nice Gravy  From 1994 Neville wrote and drew the serial comic Nice Gravy which ran for fifteen issues. It is acknowledged by Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand as one of a growing number of New Zealand women's comics produced in the 1990s and 2000s. Copies of her comics are held in important library collections around the world, including Duke University's Sallie Bingham Center for Women's History and Culture Zine Collections and Alexander Turnbull Library.  Three Words  In mid-2014 Indira Neville joined up with New Zealand graphic novelists, writers and fellow comics artists Rachel Fenton and Sarah Laing. They set about to develop the first anthology of New Zealand women's comics in a book format. The anthology \\"...will incorporate both existing and new work. We want to make visible the depth and breadth of New Zealand women’s comics; showing off some of the beautiful, amazing and often-unseen women’s comics of the past, as well as providing an opportunity for collaboration and the creation of new book- specific pieces via the Three words concept\\". The book is still in development phase, but has now attracted funding from the New Zealand public arts funder Creative New Zealand. The Three Words project has also proved to be a catalyst for promoting the work of New Zealand women comics artists and writers through their blog and Facebook group. The project has resulted in some controversy, as it has highlighted the marginalisation of women in New Zealand comics (as discussed on National Radio by Adrian Kinnaird, editor of From Earth's End: The Best of New Zealand Comics). Square Planet Comics publisher Tara Black argues for the importance of the Three Words project because it will help to address \\"the invisibility of the work of women in the creative sphere\\" by existing \\"...forever as documented evidence of women producing comics\\".  Career in education  Neville has had an extensive career in education. Gaining a teaching diploma in 1997, in 1999 she was an ICT specialist teacher in Glen Eden Intermediate School, Auckland. She was later principal of Mulberry Grove School on isolated Great Barrier Island, New Zealand, a primary school with a strong focus on ICT and initiator of the Great Barrier Island ICT professional development cluster. Neville was actively involved in this cluster, whose aims are to connect the educational organizations on the island, \\"...developing a shared vision that runs through early childhood, primary and secondary schooling, and working cooperatively to achieve it\\".http://gbi-ict-cluster.wikispaces.com/ During her time as a principal she produced the blog 100 School Demons: All the Things that Fascinate and Vex the Principal. On this blog Neville adapts an ancient Japanese drawing exercise in which an artist attempts to illustrate 100 demons. She posted cartoons used in the Mulberry Grove School newsletter that depict strange beasts inspired by the things she found vexing and fascinating in her job as principal. This included Nits as Demon #4, Forgetting my Lunch as Demon #11 and Parents who yell at me as Demon #19. Neville has also been influential outside of school. In 2005 she was an eFellow on the CORE Education eFellowship scheme, and awarded contestable funding to carry out research as part of The New Zealand Ministry of Education e-Learning Strategy. She published a report of her project entitled What impact can the use of high-end software have on the creativity of gifted under-achievers?. That same year she was awarded a Microsoft Innovative Teacher Award. From this work she was invited to deliver a CORE Education EDtalk in 2009 called Key competencies as edupunk. This talk considers the possibilities for developing a local school curriculum and the introduction of the key competencies within the New Zealand Curriculum. EDtalks are advertised as \\"Interviews, discussions, and presentations from thought leaders, innovative educators, and inspirational learners\\". She has also published educational resources for teachers on topics such as ICT and the Visual Arts in the Classroom (2004), An introduction to multimedia in the classroom (2004) and Flax : a cross-curricula integrated theme = Harakeke (2003).  Music  Neville has been involved in performing music alongside her comics and education activities. She currently plays guitar and does vocals for The Biscuits, and has played a number of gigs including several at the Audio Foundation. The Biscuits have a similar aesthetic to Neville's comics and they write songs about nobody wanting to go swimming and monsters lurking. She was also a member of Thee Ideal Gus, which held Yoko Ono and Eddie Murphy in equal high regard.

Goller has participated in art restoration courses at the Stuttgart Art Academy. He has restored church altarpieces. In 1974 a work by Goller was sold to the Cleveland Museum of Art for $1 million. It was purchased by the museum as a painting of St Catherine by Matthias Grünewald. The painting was on a panel that contained a crack, woodworm holes and evidence of repairs, all of which it appears had been added to give the painting an antique appearance. After an art historian questioned the painting's authenticity, the museum engaged conservator Hubert von Sonnenburg to examine it. His analysis of pigments from the painting showed the presence of processed chalk and the absence of silver traces in the lead paint, both indicating that the materials used were modern. Because the painting had passed through the hands of several intermediaries before being sold to the museum, Goller was not prosecuted. He claimed that he had sold the painting under his own name and that the attribution had been the work of one of the intermediate owners. Michael Hofbauer, a German art historian who specialises in the works of Cranach the Elder, has alleged that Goller has produced up to 55 fake Cranachs. Hofbauer says that a portrait of the emperor Charles V, described and attributed by Christie's Amsterdam saleroom as \\"Circle of Lucas Cranach II (Wittenberg 1515-1586 Weimar) Portrait of Charles V oil on panel, transferred onto canvas laid down on panel 54.9 x 49.5 cm.\\", was in fact painted by Goller; the painting was withdrawn from the 25 November 2014 sale. Accompanying the painting was a copy of a certificate by , a German art historian who had apparently examined the painting in the 1950s in Munich. Hofbauer has stated that he attributes to Goller more than 60 paintings presently attributed to various artists, including Cranach, adding that the paintings have certain common features: they are painted on soft gauze or similar, on a base of gesso, which is then affixed to a wooden panel; the palette is limited to a few dull colours; and an analysis of the chemical composition of the pigments in these paintings, such as white lead, shows that the pigments used in the paintings are typical of those that would have been used in the 16th century. However, the hands of the figures are not characteristic of Cranach, and the craquelure evident in the paintings is not the result of aging but has been artificially produced. In addition, Hofbauer says he has in his possession correspondence from of Basel, an expert in the paintings of the Cranachs, stating that Goller had produced forgeries though he did not know the specific paintings. The District Court of Passau and the Baden-Württemberg State Office of Criminal Investigation have begun an investigation into Goller's activities.

Labour, the Tories, Lib Dems and the Scottish Greens said the bill was \\"railroaded\\" through by the SNP. The Scottish Government faced calls for an early review into how the legislation operated.  Support and opposition  Opponents argue that the Offensive Behaviour Act compromises the principle of free speech. In June 2013, The Herald described it as \\"knee-jerk legislation\\" which needed to be revisited, arguing that \\"Scotland cannot arrest its way out of sectarianism\\". In December 2014, MSPs met with representatives from Fans Against Criminalisation (FAC), an organisation that campaigns against the Offensive Behaviour Act. The meeting came after an incident where a football fan wearing a \\"Free Palestine\\" T-shirt was questioned by police at Tynecastle. Defending the legislation, SNP MSP John Mason told FAC he believes fans wearing \\"Yes\\" badges at football matches should also be susceptible to police action. Fans groups have also raised concerns about the law. At their annual conference in 2014, the Scottish Socialist Party backed calls for the Offensive Behaviour Act to be repealed immediately. = Opinion polls = Opinion polling conducted by Panelbase and YouGov consistently suggests that a clear majority of Scottish voters support the Act and its provisions. In May 2015, 60% of all respondents said they supported the Act – including 59% of self-identified \\"Rangers fans\\" and 64% of self-identified \\"Celtic fans\\" – with only 14% wanting it to be abolished.http://wingsoverscotland.com/how-the-north-was-lost/ Both polls were criticized by Fans Against Criminalisation.http://fansagainstcriminalisation.com/faqs-on-the-ob-act/ Effects Singing \\"sectarian songs\\"—such as Irish rebel songs, or anti- Catholic songs such as No Pope of Rome—was prohibited, although what counted as a sectarian song was left to the judgement of police. 268 charges were made in the year after the law was passed, 99% of them male and 73.5% under the age of 30. In 27.6% of cases, someone under the influence of alcohol was involved. Charges were reported in all of Scotland's 32 regional councils, but 42.2% were in Glasgow. 87 convictions were made in the first thirteen months.  Repeal  Labour MSP James Kelly introduced the Offensive Behaviour at Football and Threatening Communications (Repeal) (Scotland) Bill on 21 June 2017. Kelly had described the 2012 legislation as having \\"completely failed to tackle sectarianism\\" and as \\"illiberal\\" which \\"unfairly targets football fans\\", and was \\"condemned by legal experts, human rights organisations and equality groups\\". Professor Sir Tom Devine previously spoke of the Football Act as \\"the most illiberal and counterproductive act passed by our young Parliament to date\\" and a \\"stain on the reputation of the Scottish legal system for fair dealing\\". Much was made of when a Sheriff described the law as \\"mince\\". After passing Stage 1 on 25 January 2018, Stage 2 on 27 February and Stage 3 on 15 March, the bill received royal assent on 19 April, repealing the 2012 Act. Following violent incidents during and after the Old Firm derby (Celtic vs Rangers), on 31 March 2019, David Hamilton, vice-chairman of the Scottish Police Federation, stated that because of the repeal of the act, \\"some people feel wrongly legitimised to behave in a way that they wouldn’t otherwise behave.\\"  References  Category:Acts of the Scottish Parliament 2012 Category:Football in Scotland Category:2012 in Scottish sport Category:2018 in Scottish sport Category:Censorship in the United Kingdom Category:Repealed Scottish legislation ","title":"Offensive Behaviour at Football and Threatening Communications (Scotland) Act 2012"},{"id":"44609384","text":"Lynette Delgado is a Mexican model who represented her State in Nuestra Belleza México 1999.

One dog and one handler form a team. The dogs must find a hidden target odor, often ignoring distractors (such as food or toys), and alert the handler. After the dog finds the odor they are rewarded with food or a toy. Odors Dogs hunt for specific odors. Unlike working with professional detection dogs, all odors used in sport nosework are legal to carry and own. Each governing body sets their own standard for which odors are the target odors and which levels they are paired with. At the lower levels, a single odor would be used. At higher levels, two or three of the odors might mixed to create a unique combination odor. The odor is often dripped on a cotton swab, which is then hidden in a search area. The odor-dipped swap is called the 'hide'. The odors used include: Anise, Birch, Clove, Myrrh, Pine, Thyme, Vetiver oil, and Wintergreen. Elements Containers are often boxes or luggage An element is a specific type of search area used in nosework. Interior building search takes place on the inside of any building. Searches can be a single one room or multiple rooms. There is often an option for the search to be done on or off-leash. Exterior area search takes place outside, often it contains grass, dirt, cement and/or gravel. These searches can be especially difficult for the dogs as there are a number of new smells (trash, food, animals, etc.), the dogs work in all weather conditions, and the dogs may be tempted to mark or eliminate. Vehicle searches are usually three or more vehicles. The 'hide' is always on the outside of the vehicle. The types of vehicle used varies from compact cars to horse trailers to semi-trucks. In container searches, the types of containers used varies depending on the level. Beginning levels use plain white cardboard boxes. More advanced levels use luggage, plastic bins, etc. Containers may be arranged in a pattern or randomly on the floor, or they may be placed up on chairs in a higher level. Governing bodies * National Association of Canine Scent Work (NACSW): is the oldest governing body in nosework, established in the mid-2000s. *United Kennel Club (UKC) Nosework: UKC was the second organization to become a sanctioning body for nosework trials. Official trials are set to begin after January 1, 2015. * Sport Detection Dog Association (SDDA): The SDDA is the first Canadian sanctioning body for nosework. Established in 2013, their first trial in western Canada took place in October 2014. * Australian Canine Scent Work (ACSW): ACSW is the only governing body for nosework in Australia, established in 2014. Levels The National Association of Canine Scent Work has three title levels. the first level (NW1) shows proficiency in one odor, four elements, with one 'hide' in each element. Level NW2 has two odors, four elements, two hides per element, and the container search will contain at least one distractor (food, toys etc.). Level MW3 has three odors, multiple hides in each element, and the interior search may even have no hides at all and must be called \\"Clear\\" by the team. The Sport Detection Dog Association uses only three elements; they don't use vehicle. With SDDA, level SD-S has one odor, three elements, and one hide per element. Level SD-A has two odors, three elements, up to two hides for each element, and one distractor for container. Level SD-E has three odors, three elements, up to three hides for each element, and one distractor for container. The United Kennel Club uses five odors and has five levels/titles including: Novice Nosework, Advance Nosework, Superior Nosework, Master Nosework, and Elite Nosework. The Australian Canine Scent Work follows the rules and format of NACSW. Benefits for behavioral problems in dogs Nosework is a relatively new sport so little research has been done on it as a behavior modification tool. A paper was presented at the 2011 American College of Veterinary Behaviorists and American Veterinary Society of Animal Behavior symposium, by Dr. Valli Parthasarathy on using nosework as a behavior modification protocol. One pilot study has been done to see if human perceptions of canines change after a nosework class. Some anecdotal evidence suggests nosework has helped dogs with behavior problems. Canines with a fear of humans can work and be rewarded in an environment with people around, but the dogs are not forced to interact. In nosework dogs are worked one at a time, so canines with dog aggression are able to have fun without other dogs in close proximity.http://www.campwaggingtails.com/wp-content/uploads/Nose- Work-Article-from-Vet-Behavior-Newsletter.pdf There can also be an increase in time spent with the dog, while participating in nosework. Research has shown that even a slight increase in time spent interacting with your dog, will decrease the dog's separation anxiety, improve obedience and help form a stronger human-canine bond.Clark, G. and Boyer, W. (1993). The effects of dog obedience training and behavioural counselling upon the human-canine relationship. Applied Animal Behaviour Science, 37(2), pp.147-159.

It briefly share ownership before 1700 with Great Fulford, in Dunsford, about to the south-west. The Elizabethan mansion house originally called Fulford House was first built by Sir William Peryam (1534-1604), a judge and Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer. It acquired the diminutive epithet \\"Little\\" in about 1700 to distinguish it from Fulford House, Dunsford and was at some time after 1797 renamed Shobrooke House, to remove all remaining confusion between the two places. Peryam's mansion was demolished in 1815 and a new house erected on a different site away from the River Creedy. This new building was subsequently remodelled in 1850 in an Italianate style. It was destroyed by fire in 1945 and demolished, with only the stable block remaining today.

She travelled to Paris to study the teaching methods at the Institut National de Jeunes Sourds de Paris, the institution for the deaf and dumb run by the Venerable Abbe Sicard (died 1822). On her return home she sought out two similarly affected children and taught them herself. She was successful in her methods and was instrumental in establishing a school in Alphington Road, in Exeter, the precursor of the present Royal West of England School for the Deaf. She wrote a series of articles later published in a book entitled \\"Education for the People\\".

It is produced by Amaro Lucano S.p.A., a family-owned company based in Pisticci, Basilicata. The adjective \\"Lucano\\" comes from Lucania, another name for Basilicata. History It was originally created in 1894 by Pasquale Vena, a pastry chef who blended more than 30 herbs. The secret recipe has been passed from generation to generation in the Vena family. In 1900, Amaro Lucano gained fame throughout the Kingdom of Italy, after the Vena family became the official supplier to the House of Savoy, whose coat of arms appears on the label. After a period of recession during World War II, in 1950 the workshop became an industrial enterprise under the management of Vena's sons Leonardo and Giuseppe and in 1965 a new factory in the frazione Pisticci Scalo was opened. In the 1970s, the Vena family also began producing other alcohol-based drinks under the name \\"Lucano\\" such as the Sambuca, Limoncello and Caffè varieties, as well as liqueur-filled chocolates.  The making of Amaro Lucano  The process of preparing Amaro Lucano is divided in seven steps: the selection, the infusion, the processing, the secret, the control, the mixture, and the bottling. = The Selection = The herbs needed for the mixture come from different areas of the world. They are dried naturally, crushed and mixed together. Among the herbs used, there are:. * Artemisia absinthium * Artemisia pontica * Salvia sclarea (Clavy Sage) * Musk yarrow * Cnicus (Holy Thistle) * bitter orange * Gentiana * Angelica * Sambucus elderberry * Ruta * aloe * cinnamon Essential oil = The Infusion = The mixture is steeped in solutions of pure alcohol and water; it then goes through hot infusion process in thermo-controlled baths (55°/60°C) overnight. = The Processing = The mixture undergoes hot pressing to obtain an infusion. = The Secret = Once the infusion is ready, the family secret ingredient is added to obtain the extract. = The Control = Laboratory tests are run; the extract is aged for a period of five months. During the aging process there is stratification, which means that heavy components are on the bottom, while lighter components are on the top. The “heart” of the extract is the one kept. = The Mixture = Pure alcohol, essential oils, water, the aged extract, sugar, caramel and water are mixed in a large tank to get a hydro-alcoholic solution. = The Bottling Line = The mixture is then filtered, bottled and ready to be sold. Overview Amaro Lucano is caramel brown in color, has a bittersweet flavor, and its strength is 28% ABV. It can be savoured neat, chilled, with ice or orange zest. It is usually served as a digestif after a meal and also as a base for cocktails.  Cocktails  Amaro Lucano is used as an apéritif and digestif, after-dinner drink, and all-day drink. It is used in cocktails such as Italian Sangria, Gelato Lucano, Amarcord.

November 30 is the date that was chosen since it is symbolically the day following November 29, a day the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine was adopted, and when many communities of Jews in Arab countries and Iran started to feel the pressure and hostility from their Arab and Persian neighbors and as a result of that were forced to leave their countries. It is based on a law sponsored by MK Shimon Ohayon (Yisrael Beiteinu) and passed in the summer of 2014 by the Knesset. For many Mizrahi Jews in Israel it is considered to be a belated recognition of their collective trauma, after years of what many of them claimed to be the marking of European Jewry suffering only from the part of Israel, or the marking of 1948 Palestinian exodus only from the part of the Arab countries. The Knesset established this observance in 2014. The purpose of this observance is to recognize the collective trauma of Mizrahi Jews during the period around the establishment of the State of Israel. Many Mizrachi Jews felt that their own suffering was being ignored, both in comparison to the suffering of European Jewry during the Holocaust and in comparison to the 1948 Palestinian exodus. The Gregorian-calendar date chosen is the day after the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine was adopted, as that date marked the beginning of concentrated pressure and hostility against the community.

The French ruled between 1806 and 1811. The British took over for 1811 to 1815, and transferred its control back to the Dutch in 1815. The fall of the Netherlands to the French Empire and the dissolution of the Dutch East India Company led to some profound changes in the European colonial administration of the East Indies, as one of the Napoleonic Wars was fought in Java. This period, which lasted for almost a decade, witnessed a tremendous change in Java, as vigorous infrastructure and defence projects took place, followed by battles, reformation and major changes of administration in the colony.  Prelude  In 1800, Dutch East India Company ( (VOC)) was declared bankrupt and nationalised by the Dutch government. As a result, its assets, which included seaports, storehouses, fortifications, settlements, lands and plantations in the East Indies were nationalised as a Dutch colony, the Dutch East Indies. Based in Batavia (today Jakarta), the Dutch ruled most of Java (with exception of interior lands of Vorstenlanden Mataram and Banten), conquering coastal West Sumatra, wrestled former Portuguese colonies in Malacca, the Moluccas, South and North Celebes also in West Timor. Among these Dutch possessions, Java was the most important one, as the production of cash-crops and Dutch-controlled plantations was located there. On the other side on the world, Europe was devastated by the Napoleonic Wars. A conquest and revolution were shifting the politics, relations and dynamics among the European empires and nations, which affected their colonies in the Far East. The Netherlands under Napoleon Bonaparte in 1806, oversaw the Batavian Republic become the Commonwealth of Batavia and then dissolved and replaced by the Kingdom of Holland, a French puppet kingdom ruled by Napoleon's third brother Louis Bonaparte (Lodewijk Napoleon). As a result, the East Indies during this time were treated as a proxy French colony, administrated through Dutch intermediary. The power struggle and rivalry between France and Britain had spilled to other parts of the world, involving the colonies of each empires in Americas, Africa, as well as in Asia. Since 1685 the British had consolidated their rule in Bencoolen on western coast of Sumatra, and also had established their rule in Malaccan strait, the island of Singapore and Penang. As the British coveted the Dutch colonies in the region, the French-controlled East Indies was bracing for the predicted incoming British invasion.  French interregnum 1806–1811  Java Great Post Road, commissioned by Daendels. In 1806, King Lodewijk Napoleon of the Netherlands sent one of his general, Herman Willem Daendels, serving as governor-general of East Indies based in Java. Daendels was sent to strengthen Javanese defences against a perceived incoming British invasion. He arrived in the city of Batavia (now Jakarta) on 5 January 1808 and relieved the former Governor General, Albertus Wiese. He raised new forces, built new roads within Java, and improved the internal administration of the island. Daendels' rule was a harsh and martial one, as the colony prepared for the British threat. He built new hospitals and military barracks, a new arms factories in Surabaya and Semarang, and a new military college in Batavia. He demolished the Castle in Batavia and replaced it with a new fort at Meester Cornelis (Jatinegara), and built Fort Lodewijk in Surabaya. However, his best-known achievement was the construction of the Great Post Road () across northern Java from Anjer to Panaroecan. The road now serves as the main road in the island of Java, called Jalur Pantura. The thousand-kilometre road was completed in only one year, during which thousands of Javanese forced labourers died.Pramoedya sheds light on dark side of Daendels' highway. The Jakarta Post 8 January 2006. The reign of Catholic King Lodewijk in the Netherlands ended the centuries-old of religious discriminations against Catholics both in the Netherlands and in the East Indies. Previously the Netherlands only favoured Protestantism. The Catholics were permitted freedom of worship in the Dutch Indies, though this measure was mainly intended for European Catholics, since Daendels ruled under the authority of Napoleonic France. This religious freedom would be consolidated later by Thomas Raffles. Daendels — known as an avid Francophile — built a new governor general palace in smaller version Château de Versailles-style in Batavia, known as Daendels' Palace or Witte Huis (White House) is often referred to Groote Huis (Big House). It is now Indonesia's Ministry of Finance office on the east side of Lapangan Banteng (Waterlooplein). He also renamed Buffelsveld (buffalo field) to Champs de Mars (today Merdeka Square). Daendels' rule oversaw the complete adoption of Continental Law into the colonial Dutch East Indies law system, retained even until today in Indonesian legal system. Indonesian law is often described as a member of the 'civil law' or 'Continental' group of legal systems found in European countries such as France and the Netherlands. Daendels displayed a firm attitude towards the local Javanese rulers, with the result that the rulers later were willing to work with the British against the Dutch. He also subjected the population of Java to forced labour (Rodi). There were some rebellious actions against this, such as those in Cadas Pangeran, West Java. He was also responsible for the dissolution of Banten Sultanate. In 1808, Daendels ordered Sultan Aliyuddin II of Banten to move the Sultanate capital to Anyer and to provide labour to build a new port planned to be built at Ujung Kulon. The Sultan refused Daendels' command, and in response Daendels ordered the invasion of Banten and destruction of Surosowan palace. The Sultan, together with his family, was arrested in Puri Intan and held as a prisoner in Fort Speelwijk, and later sent into exile in Ambon. On 22 November 1808, Daendels declared from his headquarters in Serang that the Sultanate of Banten had been absorbed into the territory of the Dutch East Indies.  British interregnum 1811–1815  Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles, British lieutenant governor of Java. In the middle of 1809 the Colonial Governor of India, the 1st Earl of Minto wanted to conquer the lucrative Spice islands. For the East India Company the occupation of these islands meant not only a curtailment of Dutch and French trade and power in the East Indies but also an equivalent gain to the company of the rich trade in spice. In addition the conquer of these islands meant that they would be a good base in which conquer Java. In 1810 the most heavily defended islands Banda Neira, Ambon and Ternate fell, and by August the region had been conquered with little loss. In 1811, Java fell to a British force force under Minto. He appointed Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles as lieutenant governor of Java. Raffles carried further the administrative centralisation previously initiated by Daendels. He planned to group the regencies of Java into 16 residencies. He ended Dutch administrative methods, liberalised the system of land tenure, and extended trade. Raffles tried to implement the liberal economic principles and the cessation of compulsory cultivation in Java. Raffles took his residence at Buitenzorg and despite having a small subset of Britons as his senior staff, he kept many of the Dutch civil servants in the governmental structure. He also negotiated peace and mounted some significant military expeditions against local Javanese princes to subjugate them into British rule. Most significant of these was 21 June 1812 assault on Yogyakarta, one of the two most powerful indigenous polities in Java. During the attack the Yogyakarta kraton was badly damaged and extensively looted by British troops. Raffles seized much of the contents of the court archive. The event was unprecedented in Javanese history. It was the first time an indigenous court had been taken by storm by a European army, and the humiliation of the local aristocracy was profound.Ricklefs, M. C. A History of Modern Indonesia Since C. 1200, 4th Edition, Palgrave Macmillan, 2008 Although peace returned to Central Java in the immediate aftermath of the British assault, the events may have fuelled the deep-seated instability and hostility to European involvement that ultimately gave rise to the Java War of the 1820s.Carey, Peter, The Power of Prophecy: Prince Dipanagara and the End of an Old Order in Java, 1785-1855, 2008 Raffles also ordered an expedition to Palembang in Sumatra to unseat the local sultan, Mahmud Badaruddin II, and to seize the nearby Bangka Island to set up a permanent British presence in the area. Other than Javanese court archives, Raffles also took numbers of Javanese important archaeological artefacts, such as Buddha's head taken from Borobudur and two large ancient Javanese stone inscriptions, known today as Minto Stone and Calcutta Stone. Raffles particularly holds special interest on the history, culture and the people of Java. During his short reign, British Java saw the surge of archaeological surveys and government attention on local culture, art and history. His administration rediscovered the ruins of the great Buddhist mandala of Borobudur in Central Java. Other archaeological sites in Java such as Prambanan Hindu temple and ancient Majapahit city of Trowulan, also came to light during his administration. Under Raffles patronage, a large number of ancient monuments in Java were rediscovered, excavated and systematically catalogued for the first time. Raffles was the enthusiast of the island's history, as he wrote the book History of Java published later in 1817. In 1815, the island of Java was returned to control of the Netherlands following the end of Napoleonic Wars, under the terms of the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814. In 1816, the Dutch regained the full control of their colony in Java and other parts of the archipelago, and they would embark on their conquest over other independent polities in the archipelago.

Life =Early years= Friedrich Wehmer was born during the closing years of the Bismarck era, near Schwerin, in the coastal region of central northern Germany. His father worked in forestry and in brick making. Wehmer was schooled locally between 1892 and 1900, and then trained for farm work till 1903. From then on he was employed intermittently by the Buchholz Forestry Office till 1941. In parallel to that, between 1912 and 1955 he worked a small holding on his own account as a tenant farmer. =Military service and politics= From 1905 till 1907 he undertook his military service, and was then called up in 1914 when the war began, serving in the army till 1918. After the war he began to take an interest in politics. In the revolutionary year of 1918 he joined a Workers' and Soldiers' Council. He returned to Plate and became chairman of his Forestry Office. In February 1919 he joined the Social Democratic Party (SPD / Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands). Later that year he also joined the Agricultural Workers' Union. In October 1919 Wehmer was elected mayor of Plate. He would retain that position till 1933. In 1920 he also became a member of the SPD group in the regional assembly (Landtag) for the Mecklenburg-Schwerin district. Again, he retained the position till 1933, becoming in 1923 the leader of the SPD group in the chamber. In connection with his political work Wehmer also served as Chairman of the regional \\"Krankenkasse\\" (state mandated health insurance provider). He was a member of the Mecklenburg-Schwein region Agriculture Chamber of Commerce and for the Agricultural Tribunal. =Nazi Germany and the aftermath= In January 1933 the NSDAP (Nazi party) seized power and moved fast to create a one-party state. As a member of the SPD Friedrich Wehmer was, from the government's point of view, a member of the wrong party and he was relieved of all his official functions later in the year. He concentrated on forestry work, at least till 1941. After that, now aged 56, he took charge of the \\"Raifessen\\" (agricultural produce) cooperative in Plate, remaining in post till 1944. In July 1944 there was a serious (though unsuccessful) assassination attempt against Reichs Chancellor Hitler. One of the government's responses was \\"Operation Grill\\" (\\"Aktion Gitter\\") which involved rounding up and interning large numbers of suspected dissidents. Wehmer was taken into \\"protective custody\\" (\\"Schutzhaft\\") and held, locally. in the prison at Dreibergen (Bützow) till 1945. At the start of 1945 the population of Plate had stood at around 800. By August 1945 the figure had been swollen to as much as 2,400 by refugees streaming through, as part of the enforced relocation of millions of ethic Germans from parts of what had been Germany that were now controlled by the Soviet army and being integrated into Poland and the Soviet Union. Many of those passing through were sick and had lost children and parents. There was a desperate shortage of food and shelter. In political terms, although the entire region would end up in the Soviet occupation zone, when the fighting stopped in May 1945 Plate found itself at the meeting point of the American and Soviet forces. In the summer of 1945 typhoid was rife. Into all this, on 16 August 1945, Friedrich Wehmer, recently released from prison, was returned by the occupation forces to the position of mayor from which he had been removed by the Nazis twelve years earlier. In October 1945 the local school was reopened, with just one classroom for 223 pupils and hardly any books: teaching took place in shifts. =Postwar local politics= As soon as it became legal to do so, Wehmer had also rejoined the SPD, re-establishing a party committee in the village of Plate and becoming its chairman. He remained mayor, this time, only till April 1946. It was probably on account of his extensive experience with agriculture and the politics of land holding, and also because of his work as a regional deputy during the Weimar years that in September 1945 he was called upon to join the newly formed national Land Commission for the roll-out of land reform across the Soviet occupation zone, which was now in the process of mutating into the German Democratic Republic, under Walter Ulbricht with the backing of the Soviet military. At the same time, now no longer being the local mayor, he involved himself in the newly formed Peasants Mutual Aid Association (VdgB / Vereinigung der gegenseitigen Bauernhilfe). In April 1946, following the forced merger in East Germany of the SPD (party) with the old KPD (Communist party), Wehmer became a member of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED / Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands). Wehmer acted as the regional secretary of the VdgB from May 1946. In October 1946 he was elected to the regional assembly (Landtag) as a member of the VdgB. The VdgB was not, and never became, a conventional political party, but under the political system unfolding in the Soviet occupation zone it was one of the mass movements entitled to have members elected (or, later, nominated) to sit in regional and national assemblies. By this time he was already an executive committee member of the Landtag's Advisory Assembly. He continued as a member of the regional assembly till 1950. The Assembly itself limped on for only another two years before being abolished under a sweeping downgrade of local government institutions in 1952. From 1947 till 1950, along with his work in the regional assembly, he was the Chairman of the regional Ececutive of the VdgB in Mecklenburg. In November 1947 he was also voted on to the VdgB Central (i.e. national) Committee as a deputy Chairman. =National politics= Wehmer was part of the German People's Council (Volksrat) and the People's Chamber (National Assembly / Volkskammer) which succeeded it in 1949, and from October 1950 till 1963 he was the Section leader of the VdgB group and comrade organisations. The National assembly was controlled (and its membership dominated) by the ruling SED party, but the presence in the National Assembly of members representing officially sanctioned mass organisations, including the VdgB, gave the assembly a greater measure of plurality. Between 1950 and 1958 he was also deputy chairman of the Volkskammer's Clemency Committee (Gnadenausschuss). In November 1950 he was elected to the chairmanship of the VdgB Central committee, a position he retained till his death in 1964. He was also, between June 1954 and his death, a member of the Central Committee of the ruling SED (party).

She is reported to have been the subject of portraits of renowned photographers such as David Bailey and Anthony Snowdon and has made a cameo appearance, as herself, in the 1971 Satyajit Ray movie, Seemabaddha. Manvendra Kishore Dev Burman, Devi's husband, whose favorite past time was twice daily feeding the stray dogs of Khan Market area of Delhi, has since died, leaving her no children. She lives in Delhi, in the neighbourhood where the renowned writer, Kushwant Singh lived, attending to her duties as the head of Ila Trust. Ila Trust and social career Reeta Devi has been associated with Mother Teresa from the age of sixteen and the Blessed Nun of Kolkata is reported to have inspired Devi in her social career. Devi visited the refugee camps in the aftermath of the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War, living in the camps to take care of the victims. She used to be a frequent visitor to Nirmal Hriday, a hospice set up by Mother Teresa for the sick, destitute and the dying where she cleaned the floors and attended to the inmates. In order to streamline her social activities, Reeta Devi founded Ila Trust, a non governmental organization named after her mother in Law, Ila Devi, on 26 October 1994. The next year, she launched the first ambulance service with doctors and paramedical staff in Guwahati and in 1996, she assisted in the establishment of a hospice for the Missionaries of Charity. One year later, in 1997, she set up another hospice for AIDS victims at a tribal village in Assam. Reeta Devi moved her activity to Delhi and the first mobile clinic for the capital city was started in 2003. The same year, the trust built a hospice for HIV and Tuberculosis patients at Betkuchi, Guwahati. It is reported that Devi sold her vehicle to raise the money for the construction. The centre, a twenty bedded unit, was donated to Snehalaya, a charity organization run by Fatima sisters of the catholic community and is now called Ila Snehalaya. The second Delhi based unit was started in 2007 with the assistance of Elton John Aids Foundation, followed by the third unit in 2012. The mobile clinic network of Ila Trust is manned by 12 doctors, 4 pharmacists, 6 screeners, 3 drivers and 2 administration personnel. Reeta Devi was successful in inducting a few highly trained medical doctors to work with the network. The mobile units provide medical service to the poor at various locations in Delhi six days a week and Diagnoses, tests, treatments and medicines are provided free of cost. The units are equipped with Electronic Medical Record (EMR) System, developed by the Trust. The Trust operates from its office at Sujan Singh Park, New Delhi and raises the required funds through donations and charity events.

In contrast to the Neolithic in other parts of the world, which saw the development of farming societies, the first form of African food production was mobile pastoralism, or ways of life centered on the herding and management of livestock. The term \\"Pastoral Neolithic\\" is used most often by archaeologists to describe early pastoralist periods in the Sahara, as well as in eastern Africa. In the Sahara, hunter/gatherers first adopted livestock (cattle, sheep, and goats) in the eighth to seventh millennia BP.Gifford- Gonzalez, Diane.

As the grasslands of the Sahara began drying out in the mid-Holocene, herders then spread into the Nile Valley and eastern Africa. During the Pastoral Neolithic in eastern Africa (4500-1200 BP), archaeologists have identified two pastoralist groups who co-existed alongside Eburran phase 5 hunter/gatherers; these groups are known as the Savanna Pastoral Neolithic and the Elmenteitan.

These rebellions were poorly coordinated and were put down by the central government to little effect. Along with the rebellions in Rio Grande do Sol, the Liberal Rebellions marked the end of a series of state-level rebellions that threatened the Empire of Brazil's stability.  Background  The Emperor at the time of the revolts, Dom Pedro II. These rebellions occurred at the height of a long period instability between 1831 and 1840 where the Empire of Brazil was ruled by a regency. The regency was due to Dom Pedro I's decision to abdicate the throne because of the dissolving relations between the Emperor and the assembly, a failed war with Argentina, and a mounting constitutional crisis. Pedro I's decision to abdicate left the five-year-old Dom Pedro II in charge, requiring the establishment of the regency. In order to avoid mass succession by the individual states in Brazil, the regency undertook a massive decentralization process that saw the central government giving more powers to the then provinces of Brazil. However, the provinces seized these new powers and began to rebel. In an effort to prevent the collapse of the Empire of Brazil, the regents handed over power to the 14 year old Pedro II who began to recentralize power in the Empire. Furthermore, the end of the old regency created passed new powers to Dom Pedro II, for instance the ability to dissolve the Chamber of Deputies and remove and appoint cabinet ministers, powers that gave him more unquestioned authority. After assuming the throne, Pedro II enacted two laws that undid much decentralizing efforts taken by the regency and allowed the central government to take much more control. The first law reversed the decentralization of the police and gave the power to control them back to the central government, and the second law centralized the justice system. Immediately following the passage of these laws, Pedro II and the cabinet appointed loyalists as politic agents, chiefs of police, and judges in the provinces that would soon rebel. These initial actions paired with other centralization efforts deprived the provinces and cities of much power and authority. And, since these actions were taken by the conservative government, liberals in the more powerful provinces began to speak of rebellion. The change from the regency to Dom Pedro II's rule represented a change from liberal rule to conservative rule, which also contributed to unrest amongst the liberal elite in São Paulo, Minas Gerais, and Rio de Janeiro.  Causes  Unrest in the provinces of Maranhão (Balaiada) and Rio Grande do Sul (Ragamuffin War) had not been fully resolved, when, in 1840, the young emperor Pedro II assumed the throne. Francisco de Lima's Liberal Party had pushed through the premature declaration of the Emperor's majority on 23 July 1840.Barman, Roderick J. (1988). Brazil: The Forging of a Nation, 1798–1852. p. 209 The Ministry, dominated by conservatives since March 23 of 1841, adopted centralizing measures which resulted in intense agitation from Liberals. These measures reflected the fears among the elites about the potential social dangers that accompanied unrestrained social liberty and what that could cause for the power of the Emperor. The members of the Ministry also feared that Dom Pedro II's efforts would have a negative effect on the economic interests of the larger states. However, there was dissent stirring, for in May 1842 the Liberals would take over the House. In an attempt to minimize the influence of the Liberals in São Paulo, the emperor dismissed Tobias de Aguiar and, after the short tenure of Melo Alvim, appointed José da Costa Carvalho to replace Manuel Marques, since Manuel Marques de Sousa, Count of Porto Alegre was a rich farmer who interacted with the Reactionaries. Pedro also dissolved the Chamber of Deputies, which at that time was dominated by liberals. Pedro's actions were encouraged by members of his cabinet who belonged to the more conservative Party of Order. The actions taken by the central government to prevent the return to power of the liberals led to rebellion. In May 1842, liberals rebelled in the provinces of Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo and Minas Gerais in retaliation for the Emperor's decision—on the advice of a Council of State dominated by reactionaries—to call for new elections, annulling the previous election alleged to have been tainted by widespread fraud by the Liberal Party.Needell, Jeffrey D. (2006). The Party of Order: the Conservatives, the State, and Slavery in the Brazilian Monarchy, 1831–1871. p.102Barman, Roderick J. (1988). Brazil: The Forging of a Nation, 1798–1852. p. 215 Liberal elites in Minas Gerais, São Paulo, and Rio de Janeiro appointed new provincial presidents and began military resistance. They had expected much more control in Pedro II's new government due to their appointment of many supporters in the Chamber of Deputies. However, they had failed to anticipate Pedro II's ability to dissolve the chamber of deputies, which he did, rendering their influence useless. As a result, liberals in São Paulo, Minas Gerais, and Rio de Janeiro rose up in a spontaneous and armed rebellion, convinced that simply showing armed resistance would be enough to secure their demands.  The Revolt in São Paulo  A map of Brazil with São Paulo highlighted The revolt in São Paulo initialized on May 17, 1842. This revolt was one of the major events of the liberal rebellions of 1842. This rebellion had two causes. One, it comprised a reaction to the overall shift towards conservatism in government that the government of Dom Pedro II was leading. Two, and more specific to the state of São Paulo, it was a reaction to new laws that modified and regulated the criminal code, and the newly instituted forced adjournment of the House of Deputies. Furthermore, the government of Dom Pedro II recently banned the trading of horse and mules with the Southern province of Rio Grande du Sol due to rebel activity in that province. This represented a realization of the liberal elites' fears that the centralization of the new government would damage economic interests, as horse and mule training was an important economic engine in São Paulo; thus, rebellion broke out in Sorocaba, a town closely linked to this trade. The rebellion established new leadership to challenge the established leadership in São Paulo. Rafael Tobias de Aguiar, one of the wealthiest merchants in Brazil and a powerful Nativist leader, was sworn to \\"defend the Emperor and the Constitution until the last drop of his blood.\\" He named military commanders, dispatched emissaries, suspended the \\"law reform\\" and declared null and void acts performed under it. Under his military command, he established the Liberating Column, with some 1,500 men, to march to São Paulo where they would overthrow the President of the Province, José da Costa Carvalho. Sorocaba was declared the provisional capital of the province, and was joined by several inland villages such as Itu, Itapeva, Porto Feliz, Itapetininga and Capivari. However, the rebel forces were quickly opposed by the Rio de Janeiro National Guard and the federal army. The president (governor) of the province of Rio de Janeiro, Honório Hermeto, commanded the provincial National Guard, and traveled through the province to organize a response.Gouveia, Maurílio de (1962). Marquês do Paraná: um varão do Império. p.95 He joined forces in Ouro Preto with Luís Alves de Lima e Silva (then- Baron and later Duke of Caxias), who commanded the National Guard of São Paulo and Minas Gerais. Dom Pedro II put Luis Alves de Lima e Silva in charge of ending the rebellions in São Paulo because of his status as an effective and heroic military commander and because of his work in 1840 to quell a rebellion taking place in Maranhão which he ended with a decisive victory. The rebel capital of Sorocaba fell to the forces of Hermeto and Silva on June 20 of the same year. On 1 July, he advanced with troops towards Ouro Preto, where, after defeating the rebels, he freed his father and uncle, who they had held captive.Gouveia, Maurílio de (1962). Marquês do Paraná: um varão do Império. p.111 The defeated leaders of the rebellion were captured and then deported to Espirito Santo while their followers and general rebels were pushed into service in the Emperor's army. Response to the defeat of the Emperor's armies was limited. While some bishops attempted religious ceremonies to celebrate their victory, Luís Alves de Lima e Silva, the leader of the victors, argued that the dead should be remembered, but a victory over other Brazilians was not worth celebrating.  The Revolt in Minas Gerais  A map of Brazil with Mina Gerais highlighted. In the Province of Minas Gerais, the revolt broke out June 10, 1842 in Barbacena, which was chosen to host the revolutionary government. José Feliciano Pinto Coelho da Cunha was named as interim president of the Province. On July 4 in Queluz (now Conselheiro Lafaiete), legal forces were beaten by the insurgents commanded by Col. Antonio Nunes Galvão. The rebels received new volunteers, especially from Santa Luzia, Minas Gerais, Santa Quiteria, Santa Barbara, Itabira, Caeté and Sahara. Luís Alves de Lima e Silva, commander of the army, employed the same strategy used in São Paulo, taking the capital as quickly as possible, on August 6, 1842. He was able to narrowly defeat the rebels in August. The rebels come out winners in Lagoa Santa, under the leadership of Teófilo Ottoni. However Caxias reunited forces and attacked Santa Luzia, ending the insurgency in the province. The Liberals became known as \\"luzias\\" because of the Santa Luzia battle. The losers, among which were Teófilo Ottoni and Camilo Maria Ferreira Armond (count of Prados), were sent to prison in Ouro Preto and Barbacena. This rebellion was poorly coordinated with the one that took place São Paulo, as only rebels in Barbacena rebelled, and even the rebels in this city demonstrated a lack of fighting spirit and an uncertainty over the desired outcome which likely contributed to their lack of success.  End of the Revolt of 1842  The remaining rebels were easily defeated, and by late August, the uprisings had been quelled.Barman, Roderick J. (1999). Citizen Emperor: Pedro II and the Making of Brazil, 1825–1891. p. 215 Among the rebel leaders was the former regent, Diogo Antônio Feijó, who was arrested. He died shortly afterwards in 1843. As Honório Hermeto returned from Minas Gerais to Rio de Janeiro, he was welcomed with celebrations and demonstrations of joy by the authorities and populace of the districts he traversed.Gouveia, Maurílio de (1962). Marquês do Paraná: um varão do Império. p.119 Much of the failure of the rebellion can be attributed to the lack of coordination among the rebels, their trepidation about disrupting the social order, and their unwillingness to work together in a meaningful way. These shortcomings contributed to a general indecisiveness and hesitation when the rebellions initiated. Another key reason the rebellions were so unsuccessful was that the leaders of the rebellion ascribed to political philosophy that saw rebellion as a symbolic measure to defend the status quo, and not to change it. Therefore, the rebellion was not intended to use military means to overthrow the government or to allow the provinces to secede but to show their displeasure with the actions of the government. They did not intend to overthrow Pedro II as they made clear when they initiated rebellion, but to use rebellion as a way to reassert their rights in government, not change it. Ultimately, the rebels framed rebellion as a means to protect Dom Pedro II by forcing the resignation of the Cabinet Members and overturning of bad policies. This stance likely led to the muted response from the emperor and his cabinet. However, since the idealistic stance that the rebels took clashed with the nature of rebellion and because the rebels were unable to fight a civil war or sustain military action, they resorted to abandoning their principles and fleeing. Therefore, the rebellion was easily squashed. The end of the Liberal Rebellions also marked a significant step in the consolidation of government power in Brazil, moving from a less-centralized system to a full nation state that prioritized the national interest over the local interests. In the international system, Brazil was able to present itself as a nation state.  References   Bibliography  * MARINHO, José Antônio. História do Movimento Político (...) de Minas Gerais.

He is known for his fruit still lifes, vanitas still lifes, pronkstillevens and banquet pieces executed in a very delicate manner. Life Virtually nothing is recorded about Willebeeck's life and training. It is believed he was born before 1620.Liesbeth Helmus, Jan Davidsz de Heem en zijn kring, SDU, 1991 It is known that he was active in Antwerp from 1632 to 1648 after studying with Eduard Snayers.Peter Willebeeck at the Netherlands Institute for Art History It is possible that he became a master in the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke in 1646.Reginald Howard Wilenski, Flemish Painters: 1430–1830, Viking Press, 1960, p. 319 He was the teacher of Pieter Cosijn. Work Willebeeck painted fruit still lifes, vanitas still lives, pronkstillevens and banquet pieces. The only dated work by his hand is a fruit still life dated 1647, which represents a fruit garland around a grisaille bust of Christ. This painting was originally at the Harrach Gallery in Vienna and was last auctioned on 18 January 1983 at Christie's New York. A vanitas still life that was at B. Koetser in 1975 is related to a work of Joris van Son dated 1652 and may have served as the model for the van Son painting. Still life of fruit, with a butterfly Many of his still lifes reference the theme of vanitas and the transience of earthly glory and pleasure. An illustration is the Still Life in the collection of the Rockox House in Antwerp. It shows precious objects to refer to ideas of vanities and hollowness: the fallen rummer, the silver candle holder, tazza and Westerwald jug are all empty, the lighted cigar is about to go out, the pipe is finished and there is no further life in the shell. These objects all point to the transitoriness of luxuries, the pleasures of drink and tobacco. The pealed lemon references the bitterness of life.Peter Willebeeck, Still Life in the collection of the Rockox House Museum Willebeeck is deemed to be a member of the circle of painters who were influenced by Jan Davidsz de Heem, a Dutch still life painter who was active in Antwerp at the same time as Willebeeck and was himself influenced by Flemish still life painters such as Frans Snyders and Daniel Seghers.Sheila D. Muller, Dutch Art: An Encyclopedia, Routledge, 4 Jul 2013, p. 265 Pronkstilleven As was common in Antwerp at the time, Willebeeck collaborated with other painters, who were specialists in a particular genre. He worked with staffage specialists on still lifes and portraits. One example of such collaboration is a painting of a garland of fruit around a female bust which he made with Erasmus Quellinus II who painted the female figure (Christie's, New York City, 26 January 2001, lot 107, not sold).Peter Willebeeck and Erasmus Quellinus (II), Een vrouwenbuste in een gebeeldhouwde cartouche met vruchten at the Netherlands Institute for Art History  References  External links * Category:People from Antwerp Category:Flemish Baroque painters Category:Flemish still life painters Category:Year of birth uncertain Category:1648 deaths ","title":"Peter Willebeeck"},{"id":"44609927","text":"Farbror Pekkas handelsbod (Uncle Pekka's General Store) was the Sveriges Television's Christmas calendar and Sveriges Radio's Christmas Calendar in 1965.

He was President of the Ohio State Senate during 1904 and 1905. George H. Chamberlain was born June 21, 1862 in Grafton Township, Lorain County, Ohio. He was the son of George B. and Elizabeth (Cragin) Chamberlain. He remained on their farm until seventeen years old, and was educated at the district schools and Oberlin College. He taught school, read law in an office in Elyria, Ohio, and was admitted to the bar in 1887. Chamberlain practiced law in Elyria for two years, and then moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where he was engaged in insurance work until 1895. He returned to Elyria, in 1895, and was engaged in law and Republican politics. In 1896, he spoke in support of the presidential candidacy of William McKinley in Lorain County, and throughout the state. Chamberlain was elected to the combined 27th-29th district of the Ohio State Senate, (Madison, Lorain, Richland and Ashland counties), for the 75th and 76th General Assemblies, (1902-1905).

The company was created in June 2009. In 2012, following significant gas discoveries offshore Mozambique, Royal Dutch Shell and PTT Exploration and Production (PTTEP), a subsidiary of Thailand's national oil company PTT Public Company Limited, engaged in a prominent bidding war to acquire Cove. Ultimately, the company was sold in August 2012 to PTTEP. Share price of Cove Energy  The early days  In early 2009, Michael Blaha and John Craven, two industry veterans, teamed up to create a new oil & gas explorer with a focus on the largely unexplored deep waters of East Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean. They joined the Board of Directors of Lapp Plats plc, a cash-shell listed on the Alternative Investment Market of the London Stock Exchange and renamed the company Cove Energy plc. Michael Blaha was appointed Executive Chairman and John Craven became the CEO. Prior to joining Cove, Michael Blaha was the Country Chairman of Shell in Algeria. John Craven was the founder and former CEO of Petroceltic International. Michael Nolan was appointed Financial Director. The management team also consisted of Paul Griggs and Alexander Mollinger. The non-executive directors of Cove included Frank Moxon, Dr Steve Staley and Anthony Golding. Cove's strategy was to create value for shareholders through acquiring participations in exploration assets and appraisal programmes. The company focussed on young and emerging basins, de-risked through 3D seismic. It also aimed at partnering with proven and reliable operators.  Funding  Cove was listed on the Alternative Investment Market of the London Stock Exchange. Over a period of seventeen months, between June 2009 and November 2010, the company raised a total of £182 million through four placings. Each placing was done at a significant higher market capitalisation than the previous one: * June 2009: £4 million at £0.12 per share * September 2009: £42 million at £0.20 per share * March 2010: £26 million at £0.40 per share * November 2010: £110 million at £0.76 per share The funds were mostly used to acquire assets and then to keep up with the cost allotment of the fast-paced and expensive drilling campaign offshore Mozambique. A feature of the Cove business model was that it was sufficiently funded through all stages of its development to support the dynamic and active exploration programmes in all its operations and was also adequately funded to make strategic acquisitions.  The Artumas acquisition  In September 2009, Cove acquired several assets from Artumas Group Inc. (now known as Wentworth Resources Limited). These assets, located in Mozambique and Tanzania, consisted of: * 8.5% interest in Rovuma Offshore Area 1, offshore Mozambique * 10% interest in Rovuma Onshore Block, onshore Mozambique * 16.38% interest in the production and 20.475% interest in the exploration of the Mnazi Bay concession, offshore Tanzania  Portfolio of assets  Cove's portfolio consisted of oil & gas exploration assets in Mozambique, Tanzania and Kenya. The company was also part of a consortium to bid in two licensing rounds in the Eastern Mediterranean. = Mozambique =  Rovuma Offshore Area 1  In September 2009, Cove acquired from Artumas an 8.5% interest in Rovuma Offshore Area 1 (also known as Area 1), offshore Northern Mozambique. The block covered 9,562 km2 (c. 2.4 million acres), located in the deep waters off the coast of Northern Mozambique. It was operated by Anadarko Petroleum. The partnership consisted of Anadarko Petroleum (36.5%), Mitsui (20%), Empresa Nacional de Hydrocarbonetos, E.P. (15%), Bharat Petroleum (10%), Videocon (10%) and Cove Energy (8.5%). In late 2009, Cove and its partners started drilling their first exploration well, Windjammer. In February 2010, it discovered the giant Prosperidade field. In the period from 2010 to 2012, an additional seven exploration wells and five appraisal wells were drilled, and extensive flow testing was conducted and the recoverable resources increased from 5+ Trillion Cubic Feet (TCF) to 35-65+ TCF of gas.http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/1768c560-9ea6-11e1-a767-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3LDSJPjeH Prosperidade and the surrounding gas discoveries at Orca, Lagosta, Atum, Golfinho and Tubarão are among the world's largest gas discoveries in the last 20 years. Today, the recoverable resources are estimated at 50-70+ TCF of gas. Area 1 is due to start producing gas in 2019 and has the potential to transform Mozambique into one of the world's largest LNG exporters, similar to Qatar and Australia, and offer long-term benefits to the population.  Rovuma Onshore Block  In September 2009, Cove acquired from Artumas a 10% interest in Rovuma Onshore Block, onshore Northern Mozambique. The block covered 13,452 km2 (c. 3.3 million acres) and was operated by Anadarko Petroleum. The partnership consisted of Anadarko Petroleum (35.7%), Maurel & Prom (27.71%), Empresa Nacional de Hidrocarbonetos, E.P. (15%), Wentworth Resources (11.59%) and Cove Energy (10%). In Q1 2012, Cove and its partners shot a c. 1,200 km 2D seismic survey covering Rovuma Onshore Block. Interpretation of the seismic data resulted in two prospects being identified, which were believed to be gas prone. Cove was acquired by PTTEP in August 2012 before any of the prospects were drilled. = Tanzania =  Mnazi Bay  In September 2009, Cove acquired from Artumas a 16.38% interest in the production and 20.475% interest in the exploration of the Mnazi Bay concession, partly offshore and partly onshore Southern Tanzania. The concession covered c. 760 km2 (c. 0.2 million acres) and was operated by Maurel & Prom. For the production, the partnership consisted of Maurel & Prom (38.22%), Wentworth Resources (25.4%), Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation (20%) and Cove Energy (16.38%). For the exploration, the partnership consisted of Maurel & Prom (47.775%), Wentworth Resources (31.75%) and Cove Energy (20.475%). In July 2012, Cove sold its interests in the Mnazi Bay concession to Maurel & Prom and Wentworth Resources. = Kenya =  Blocks L5-L7-L11A-L11B-L12  In July 2010, Cove acquired from US-based Dynamic Global Advisers (DGA) a 15% interest in blocks L5-L7-L11A-L11B-L12, offshore Kenya. The blocks covered 30,632 km2 (c. 7.6 million acres) and were operated by Anadarko Petroleum. In Q3 2011, the blocks were farmed down by Anadarko Petroleum, DGA and Cove to Total, which left Cove with a 10% interest and substantial carry on further 3D seismic acquisition and drilling. Consequently, DGA sold its remaining interest to Total. The partnership then consisted of Anadarko Petroleum (50%), Total (40%) and Cove Energy (10%). In Q3-Q4 2011, Cove and its partners shot a c. 3,000 km2 3D seismic survey covering blocks L5-L7-L11A-L11B-L12. Interpretation of the seismic data resulted in a number of large prospects being identified, which were believed to be oil prone. Cove was acquired by PTTEP in August 2012 before any of the prospects were drilled.  Blocks L10A-L10B  In early 2011, Cove formed a consortium with BG Group, Premier Oil and Pan Continental Oil & Gas to participate in the upcoming bidding round in Kenya. Following two successful bid applications, Cove signed Production Sharing Contracts for blocks L10A and L10B, located in deep waters in the Southern portion of the Lamu basin and adjacent to, and inboard of, blocks L5-L7-L11A-L11B-L12. The blocks covered 10,516 km2 (c. 2.6 million acres) and were operated by BG Group. For block L10A, the partnership consisted of BG Group (40%), Premier Oil (20%), Pan Continental Oil & Gas (15%) and Cove Energy (25%). For block L10B, the partnership consisted of BG Group (45%), Premier Oil (25%), Pan Continental Oil & Gas NL (15%) and Cove Energy (15%). In Q4 2011, Cove and its partners shot a c. 2,000 km2 3D seismic survey covering blocks L10A and L10B. Interpretation of the seismic data resulted in a number of large prospects being identified, which were believed to be oil prone. Cove was acquired by PTTEP in August 2012 before any of the prospects were drilled. = Cyprus and Lebanon= In 2010, Cove formed a consortium with Cairn Energy and CC Energy Development SAL, an affiliate company of Consolidated Contractors Company, to participate in the upcoming licensing rounds in Cyprus and Lebanon. When Cove was acquired by PTTEP in August 2012, the licensing rounds had not taken place yet and thus Cove withdrew from the consortium.  The sale process  Notwithstanding its strong financial position, Cove put itself up for sale in December 2011. Given Prosperidade’s size and its close distance to the gas- hungry Asian markets, the sale attracted a long list of high-calibre suitors, including major independents and national oil companies. Between February and July 2012, Shell and PTTEP engaged in a prominent bidding war to acquire Cove. On 21 February 2012, Shell placed an indicative bid of £1.95 per share. Two days later, Cove received an indicative bid of £2.20 per share from PTTEP. On 3 May 2012, Shell made a recommended cash offer of £2.20 per share,http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/ffa30e3c-a4a8-11e1-9908-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3LDSJPjeH followed on 23 May 2012 by a recommended cash offer of £2.40 per share from PTTEP.http://ftalphaville.ft.com/2012/05/23/1012081/cove-energy-after- flirting-with-shell-gets-offered-bigger- ring/http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/3585b308-bebf-11e1-8ccd-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3LDSJPjeHhttp://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/3/7ebd6640-d0e1-11e1-8957-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3LDSJPjeHhttp://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/ffa30e3c-a4a8-11e1-9908-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3LDSJPjeH In July 2012, Shell retracted its offer and announced it was withdrawing from the bidding process.http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/751c765c-cf39-11e1-a1ae-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3LDSJPjeHhttp://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/3/7ecfa914-cf5a-11e1-a1d2-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3LDSJPjeHhttp://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/84929316-cf37-11e1-bfd9-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3LDSJPjeH In August 2012, Cove was sold to PTTEP for £1.2 billion (£2.40 per share). It was one of 2012's most prominent public takeovers worldwide.http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/4ed823ea-e863-11e1-b724-00144feab49a.html#axzz3LDSJPjeHhttp://blogs.ft.com/beyond- brics/2012/07/16/shell-cove-were- out/http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/8b801f3e-a676-11e1-aef2-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3LDSJPjeHhttp://blogs.ft.com/beyond- brics/2012/05/15/coves-gas-find-could-fire-up-the-bids/  Post-Cove  In November 2012, the former management team of Cove Energy (in its entirety) founded a new oil & gas exploration company, Discover Exploration Limited (also known as Discover). The management team consists of former-Cove executives Michael Blaha, John Craven, Michael Nolan, Alexander Mollinger and Paul Griggs. Similar to Cove, Discover's strategy is to deliver value to shareholders through participation in exploration and appraisal programmes focussing on deep-water petroleum systems. Discover has exploration assets in the Africa and New Zealand. The initial funding of Discover came in November 2012 from ONH B.V., and Discover's management team and Board of Directors.http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/d4cc6e4e-89a2-11e2-92a0-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3L3LS3wkrhttps://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/10/us- coveenergy- idUSBRE9290IZ20130310https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-11/cove-ex-ceo- craven-starts-new-oil-company-to-explore-east-africa.html ONH B.V. is the holding company of Oranje-Nassau Energie B.V., the largest privately owned Dutch exploration and production operating company.http://www.onebv.com/ In December 2013, The Carlyle Group announced that it was backing the management team of Discover Exploration by investing up to US$200 million in the company.http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/88b99c40-658c-11e3-8451-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3LDSJPjeH In November 2014, McKinsey & Company published A new approach to oil and gas exploration, an article on the management team of Cove Energy and Discover Exploration.http://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/dotcom/client_service/Oil%20and%20gas/PDFs/MoOGA%20new%20approach%20to%20OG%20exploration.ashx References  External links  * PTT Exploration and Production Public Company Limited * Article by McKinsey & Company on the management team behind the success of Cove Energy * Coverage of Cove Energy by the Financial Times * Coverage of Cove Energy by Reuters * Coverage of Cove Energy by Bloomberg Category:2009 establishments in England Category:Oil and gas companies of England ","title":"Cove Energy plc"},{"id":"44609963","text":"Lill-Stina på reportage i Storskogen (\\"Lill-Stina Reporting from the Big Forest\\") was the Sveriges Television's Christmas calendar and Sveriges Radio's Christmas Calendar in 1964.

The Chan–Lam coupling is catalyzed by copper complexes. It can be conducted in air at room temperature. The more popular Buchwald–Hartwig coupling relies on the use of palladium. History Chan, Evans, and Lam published their work nearly simultaneously. the mechanism however remained mysterious for many years. Mechanism Analysis of the mechanism is complicated by the lability of copper reagents and the multicomponent nature of the reaction. The reaction proceeds via the formation of copper-aryl complexes. A copper(III)-aryl-alkoxide or copper(III)-aryl-amide intermediate undergoes Reductive elimination to give the aryl ether or aryl amine, respectively: :Ar-Cu(III)-NHR-L2 → Ar-NHR + Cu(I)L2 :Ar-Cu(III)-OR-L2 → Ar-OR + Cu(I)L2 Example An example of the Chan–Lam coupling to synthesize biologically active compounds is shown below: :Reaction example of Chan–Lam coupling Compound 1, a pyrrole, is coupled with aryl boronic ester, 2, to afford product 3, which is then carried forward to the target 4. The nitrile group of 2 does not poison the catalyst. Pyridine is the ligand used for the reaction. Although the reaction requires three days, it was carried out at room temperature in ambient air and resulted in a 93% yield.

Life According to al-Tabari, he was a eunuch and originally a servant of Muhammad ibn Abi'l-Saj, who was also nicknamed \\"Afshin\\". He first appears in summer 906, during a ceremony in which he was bestowed a robe of honour by Caliph al-Muktafi. A little later, in October 906, during the Qarmatian assault on Kufa, he is mentioned as one of the officers of the central caliphal army sent to the city's aid, but were routed before the city by the Qarmatian rebels. In the year 912/3 he was appointed as governor of Tarsus and the Cilician borderlands (thughur) with the Byzantine Empire, succeeding Rustam ibn Baradu. In summer 914 he received the assistance of an army of 2,000 horsemen sent from Baghdad under Abu Umayr Adi ibn Ahmad ibn Abd al-Baqi for one of the customary summer raids (ṣā’ifa) into Byzantine territory, but the two commanders were unable to carry out the raid, instead postponing it until winter. In his report to the Caliph after the raid, Bishr claimed that he had captured no less than 150 Byzantine commanders and some 2,000 captives in all. In autumn 917 he oversaw, along with the Abbasid commander-in-chief Mu'nis al-Muzaffar, a prisoner exchange with the Byzantines at the Lamos River. In 918, he launched another raid into Byzantine territory, capturing a few forts and taking booty. He may also be identified with Bishr al-Khadim (\\"the Eunuch\\") who was named governor of Damascus and Aleppo in 933 and was killed in the same year by Muhammad ibn Tughj al-Ikhshid.

Early life and education An eighth-generation Texan, Murr is a maternal grandson of former Governor Coke R. Stevenson, who died in 1975, two years before Murr was born. Murr graduated from Junction High School and Texas A&M; University in College Station, with a degree in education. While at Texas A&M;, he worked in Washington D.C. on agricultural and natural resource policy matters, and in Austin as an assistant committee clerk for the Texas House Natural Resources Committee. He subsequently received a Juris Doctor degree with honors from the Texas Tech University School of Law in Lubbock.  Career  After practicing briefly in Dallas, Murr returned to Junction to establish his own law office. He moved rapidly in local political circles, having been elected county attorney and then county judge of Kimble County, a position which he filled for five years until September 30, 2013, when he resigned to run for the Texas House. Murr's grandfather had also held the same positions of county attorney, county judge, and state representative, with a stint as well as House Speaker. In 2011, then Governor Rick Perry named Murr to the Concho Valley Regional Review Board. As county judge, he was chairman of the regional Juvenile Board, which supervises probation in several counties. In the Republican primary election for state representative held on March 4, 2014, Murr handily led a five-candidate field with 10,089 votes (41.3 percent) and was placed into a runoff election on May 27 with the runner-up, Robert Earl \\"Rob\\" Henneke (also born 1977) and a lawyer in Kerrville, who received 7,051 votes (28.9 percent). Murr then defeated Henneke, 9,387 (60.6 percent) to 6,100 (39.4 percent). In the November 4 general election, Murr had no Democratic opposition and defeated the Libertarian nominee, Maximiliam Martin, 36,878 votes (89.9 percent) to 4,139 (10.1 percent). The District 53 House seat was vacated after twenty-six years by Harvey Hilderbran of Kerrville, who ran unsuccessfully against Glenn Hegar for Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts in the March 4 primary. Murr won his second term in the House in the November 8, 2016 general election. With 54,741 votes (76.9 percent), he defeated Democrat Stephanie Lochte Ertel (born 1946) of Kerrville, who polled 14,256 votes (20 percent), and the Libertarian Brian Holk, who trailed with 2,170 ballots (3 percent). Murr secured a third term in the state House in the general election held on November 6, 2018.

The center, located in Rockville, Maryland, was established in 2012 through a partnership with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the state of Maryland, and Montgomery County. The center is partnered with nearly 20 market-leading IT companies, which contribute hardware, software and expertise. The NCCoE asks industry sector members about their cybersecurity problems, then selects issues that affect an entire sector or reaches across sectors. The center forms a team of people from cybersecurity technology companies, other federal agencies and academia to address each problem. The teams work in the center's labs to build example solutions using commercially available, off-the-shelf products. For each example solution, the NCCoE publishes a practice guide, a collection of the materials and information needed to deploy the example solution, and makes it available to the general public. The center's goal is to “accelerate the deployment and use of secure technologies” that can help businesses improve their defenses against cyber attack. History =NIST= The NCCoE is part of NIST, a non-regulatory federal agency within the U.S. Department of Commerce that develops measurement standards and conducts research in measurement science. According to the NIST website, the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA) “reaffirmed NIST’s role of developing information security standards (Federal Information Processing Standards) and guidelines for non-national security federal information systems and assigned NIST some specific responsibilities, including the development of: Standards to be used by Federal agencies to categorize information and information systems based on the objectives of providing appropriate levels of information security according to a range of risk levels; Guidelines recommending the types of information and information systems to be included in each category; and Minimum information security requirements (management, operational and technical security controls) for information and information systems in each category.” Many private sector organizations voluntarily adopt these standards, guidelines and security requirements. As a NIST center, the NCCoE is an applied space for the demonstration of standards-based approaches to cybersecurity. =Executive Order 13636, “Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity”= President Barack Obama issued Executive Order 13636, “Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity,” in February 2013 tasking NIST to create a cybersecurity framework that helps organizations mitigate risks to the nation's essential systems such as power generation and distribution, the financial services sector, and transportation. NIST released the Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity in February 2014, which “consists of standards, guidelines and practices to promote the protection of critical infrastructure.” The NCCoE demonstrates how the framework can be implemented in real-world environments. When an industrial sector approaches the center with a cybersecurity problem, the center maps the solution's hoped-for capabilities to the Cybersecurity Framework, as well as to other standards, controls and best practices. =Media coverage= The NCCoE's launch was formally announced on February 21, 2012 by U.S. Senator Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.), Maryland Lt. Governor Anthony Brown, Montgomery County Executive Isiah Leggett and Under Secretary of Commerce for Standards and Technology and NIST Director Patrick D. Gallagher. NIST issued a press release the same day stating that the center was created to “work to strengthen U.S. economic growth by supporting automated and trustworthy e-government and e-commerce.” The NCCoE will “host multi-institutional, collaborative efforts that build on expertise from industry and government,” according to the press release. =Federally funded research and development center= In September 2014, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) awarded a contract to the MITRE Corporation to operate the Department of Commerce’s first Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC), the National Cybersecurity FFRDC, which supports the NCCoE. According to the press release on the NIST website, “this FFRDC is the first solely dedicated to enhancing the security of the nation’s information systems.” The press release states that the FFRDC will help the NCCoE “expand and accelerate its public-private collaborations” and focus on “boosting the security of U.S. information systems.” “FFRDCs operate in the public interest and are required to be free from organizational conflicts of interest as well as bias toward any particular company, technology or product—key attributes given the NCCoE’s collaborative nature…The first three task orders under the contract will allow the NCCoE to expand its efforts in developing use cases and building blocks and provide operations management and facilities planning.” Collaborators =Founding Partners= The partners that founded the NCCoE are the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the state of Maryland and Montgomery County. This partnership was instrumental in establishing the center as a nationally recognized cybersecurity resource that has the potential to increase the number of local cybersecurity companies, local workforce development and provide local companies with exposure to NIST's expertise. =National Cybersecurity Excellence Partners= National Cybersecurity Excellence Partners (NCEPs) offer technology companies the opportunity to develop long-term relationships with the NCCoE and NIST. As core partners, NCEPs can provide hardware, software, or personnel who collaborate with the NCCoE on current projects. =Industry representatives= Sector representatives approach the NCCoE on behalf of their industry to share business problems that can be solved through a cybersecurity solution. These representatives can also provide insight during the project build process and help validate the center's approach to developing an example solution. =Experts from government and academia= Members of government agencies and academic institutions can discuss their cybersecurity challenges with the NCCoE, provide insight and feedback on existing center projects, or collaborate with technology companies in the center's labs. =Users= Other users, such as businesses working to improve their cybersecurity, have the opportunity to test the NCCoE's example solutions, evaluate their effectiveness, and provide feedback.

The article would later be discredited. The story, titled \\"A Rape on Campus\\", was later found to be unsupported by evidence. The magazine retracted the article following a Columbia University School of Journalism review which concluded that Erdely and Rolling Stone failed to engage in \\"basic, even routine journalistic practice\\". As a result, Erdely was named in three lawsuits with demands of more than $32 million combined for damages resulting from the publication of the story. A graduate of the University of Pennsylvania, Erdely has written about rape and bullying. Prior to the Rolling Stone article, her work appeared in GQ, Self, The New Yorker, Mother Jones, Glamour, Men's Health and Philadelphia. In November 2016, a federal court jury found Erdely was liable for defamation with actual malice in a lawsuit brought by University of Virginia administrator Nicole Eramo, and Erdely was found personally responsible for $2 million in damages. Education and early life Erdely graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1994. According to Erdely, she was initially a pre-med student but became an English major while working on the staff of 34th Street, the magazine insert for the Daily Pennsylvanian, the campus newspaper. During her tenure at 34th Street, her colleague Stephen Glass \\"threw a righteous fit\\" after she and a colleague \\"concocted a funny and obviously made-up travel story\\" for the magazine. Later, in an article she wrote for the University of Pennsylvania alumni magazine, she called Glass a \\"sociopathic creep\\" because, she said, he fabricated stories published as factual journalism in The New Republic. After leaving Penn, Erdely went to work for Philadelphia before pursuing a career as a freelance magazine writer. Magazine writing =Early work= Erdely's 1996 story for Philadelphia, concerning a woman who alleged she had been raped by her gynecologist, was nominated for a National Magazine Award. A 2012 story for Rolling Stone, alleging bullying of gay students in Minnesota, was similarly nominated and received a GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Magazine Article. In 2003 Erdely wrote a feature article in GQ about famous con man Steve Comisar.The Creep With the Golden Tongue by Sabrina R Erdely, GQ, August 2003, 126-32, 155-156. Erdely's 2013 Rolling Stone article, \\"The Rape of Petty Officer Blumer,\\" chronicled the alleged drugging and rape of a US Navy female petty officer by three US Army soldiers. =Rolling Stone article: \\"The Catholic Church's Secret Sex-Crime Files\\"= Erdely's 2011 story on Philadelphia's Catholic church, which alleged Charles Engelhardt, a priest at St Francis de Sales (pictured) sexually abused a minor, has been criticized for over-reliance on a dubious source. In 2011, Erdely reported a story for Rolling Stone about child abuse within the Roman Catholic Church in Philadelphia. (The church had been under investigation in numerous cities since The Boston Globes exposé in 2002 of church protection of predatory priests.) Erdely's article described a fifth grade altar boy referred to by the pseudonym \\"Billy Doe\\" whom \\"brutal attacks turned ... into a sullen, drug-addicted loner,\\" alleging a \\"high-level conspiracy.\\" Billy Doe was an adult when he made his accusations, resulting in criminal charges leading to the jailing of three church employees. Doe also filed a major civil suit against the church. Ralph Cipriano wrote in Newsweek that \\"Erdely didn't know or bother to find out ... that Billy had already told his story to the archdiocese, police, and a grand jury, and would subsequently retell it to two different juries in two criminal cases. And every time he told his story, the details kept changing.\\" In the first iteration of the rape Billy Doe claimed to have endured, he was knocked unconscious, stripped, tied to a church altar with sashes, and anally raped on the altar for five hours. Subsequent iterations of the rape recounted by Doe were less dramatic; a final version omitted the five-hour altar anal rape. Instead, Billy Doe explained, he had been coerced into engaging in mutual masturbation. Cipriano criticized Erdely for failing to include information on Billy Doe's background that could have impugned his credibility; he had, for instance, been arrested six times, once while trafficking 56 bags of heroin. Doe's lawyer Slade McLaughlin, and David Clohessy, head of SNAP, have noted in response that substance abuse is a common reaction to childhood sexual abuse. When Erdely was covering the Billy Doe story, her husband was a criminal prosecutor for the District Attorney of Philadelphia, which was overseeing the case. Rolling Stone editors said that it was not a conflict of interest because he was not personally involved in the prosecution. William Anthony Donohue at the Catholic League denounced \\"malicious distortions of the kind found in Erdely's diatribe.\\" The conviction of one church employee has since been overturned, and a new trial ordered for the one remaining (the third church employee died in prison while appealing his conviction). =Rolling Stone article: \\"The Rape of Petty Officer Blumer\\"= \\"The Rape of Petty Officer Blumer\\" was published in Rolling Stone on February 14, 2013. The article denounced the military's handling of sexual assault cases, primarily through the story of Rebecca Blumer, a Navy petty officer (E-5) who claimed to have been slipped a date-rape drug and then sexually assaulted by three Army soldiers. After \\"A Rape on Campus\\" was discredited in late 2014, some began to question whether Erdely's other articles may have been similarly fabricated. Leon H. Wolf, writing in April 2015 for RedState, noted the similarities between \\"A Rape on Campus\\" and the \\"Rape of Petty Officer Blumer.\\" =Rolling Stone article: \\"A Rape on Campus\\"= Erdely's article for Rolling Stone, titled \\"A Rape on Campus\\", was published in the December 2014 issue of that magazine. It alleged that seven members of Phi Kappa Psi at the University of Virginia gang-raped a student at that fraternity house on September 28, 2012. Separate inquiries by both Phi Kappa Psi and The Washington Post revealed major errors and discrepancies in the report. Erdely's story was subject to intense media criticism and questions as to its truthfulness. The Washington Post and Boston Herald both issued calls for magazine staff involved in the report to be fired. Natasha Vargas-Cooper, a columnist at The Intercept, said that Erdely's story showed \\"a horrendous, hidden bias,\\" while an editorial in The Wall Street Journal charged that \\"Ms. Erdely did not construct a story based on facts, but went looking for facts to fit her theory.\\" As criticism of the story mounted, Erdely disappeared from public view, with various media outlets describing her as \\"MIA\\" and \\"off the grid.\\" Rolling Stone subsequently issued three apologies for the story. On December 10, 2014, The Washington Post published an updated account of its inquiry into the Rolling Stone article. Summarizing that report, Slate noted that it \\"strongly implies, without outright saying so, that the gang rape at the center of Sabrina Rubin Erdely's article might be fabricated.\\" Scott Goodman, a lawyer, speculated that legal action against the magazine by persons accused of the rape may result. Rolling Stone publisher Jann S. Wenner asked the dean of the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism to audit the editorial processes leading up to the publication of the controversial story. On January 12, 2015, the University of Virginia reinstated the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity after the police investigation concluded that no incident had occurred at the fraternity. According to Charlottesville police captain Gary Pleasants, Charlottesville police \\"found no basis to believe that an incident occurred at that fraternity, so there's no reason to keep them suspended.\\" The police investigation into the allegations made by Erdely was concluded (though not closed) on March 23, 2015; no evidence was found to support Erdely's claims, with Charlottesville police stating that they had \\"no basis to conclude that anything happened in [the] fraternity house, or any fraternity house, for that matter\\" and that there \\"is no substantive basis to support the account alleged in the Rolling Stone article.\\" On April 5, 2015, Rolling Stone retracted the article. Erdely publicly apologized for the article on April 5, 2015, though her apology did not include any mention of the fraternity, or the members of the fraternity who were accused. The Columbia Journalism Review called the apology \\"a grudging act of contrition.\\" Both a spokesman for publisher Wenner and Will Dana, managing editor, said that Erdely would continue to write articles for Rolling Stone. On May 12, 2015, the associate dean of students at the University of Virginia, Nicole Eramo, who oversaw sexual violence cases at the time of the article's publication, filed a lawsuit against both Rolling Stone and Erdely, seeking $7.5 million in damages based upon her claim that the article contained \\"highly defamatory and false statements\\", which she alleged, led to the destruction of Eramo's credibility, permanently damaging her reputation, and causing her emotional distress. Beginning on October 17, 2016, a 10-member federal court jury heard testimony from 12 witnesses and saw 11 hours of video statements and more than 180 exhibits of evidence over 16 days during the trial for defamation brought by Eramo. On November 4, 2016, the jury concluded that Erdely was responsible for defamation with actual malice. The jury's finding means that it concluded Erdely knew statements about Eramo in the article were false — or had reason to doubt them and failed to investigate further — but published them anyway. On July 29, 2015, a separate lawsuit was filed by three members of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity against Rolling Stone, Wenner Media, and Erdely for defamation and infliction of emotional distress caused by Erdely's story. This lawsuit was subsequently dismissed by a federal judge on June 29, 2016, because the three plaintiffs were neither explicitly nor implicitly identified in the original article. On September 19, 2017 that decision was reversed by a three judge panel of the United States Court of Appeal for the Second Circuit which found that \\"Plaintiffs Elias and Fowler have plausibly alleged that the purportedly defamatory statements in the Article only were 'of and concerning' them individually. We also hold that Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that the Article was 'of and concerning' them under a theory of small group defamation.\\" Erdely's Rolling Stone story \\"A Rape on Campus\\" was named by Columbia Journalism Review as \\"the Worst Journalism of 2014\\" and as \\"Error of the Year\\" by the Poynter Institute. Film projects In 2013 a film, titled The Girl Who Conned the Ivy League and based on Erdely's story of the same name for Rolling Stone, published in early 2010, was in development with Rob Epstein as director. The idea for the film had been pitched in March 2010 by screenwriter Lorene Scafaria, with Amanda Seyfried proposed for the title role of Esther Reed. However, in January 2014, an LA Weekly cover story described cocaine-dealing allegations and prison time done by Remington Chase and Stepan Martirosyan, who were involved in financing the film. In 2013, it was announced that Craig Brewer would adapt Erdely's story \\"Gangster Princess of Beverly Hills\\" into a motion picture. Personal life and other career activity As of April 2015, Erdely lives in Philadelphia with her husband and two children.

He was influenced by Ala Imam Ahmed Raza Khan Qadri and his Ahle Sunnat Barelvi mission He was also a poet of Urdu ghazals, nazm, hamd and naat, his pseudo name being Fani. As a Sufi master he was initiated in Qadiriyya, Chishti, Naqshbandi, Naqshbandiyya- Mujaddidiyya, Shadhili, Uwaisi, Qalandariyya, Saberiyya and Nizamiyya orders. His teachings stated that Islam was a unified whole of Shariat, Tariqat, Haqiqat and Marefat, and was incomplete without any one of these. He refused to depend on charity, and lived in Bangladesh almost incognito.  Parental lineage  Syed Rashid Ahmed Jaunpuri's devotees state that his maternal lineage goes back to Abu Bakr Siddique, the first political successor of Islam, nad his paternal lineage to Ali, the fourth political successor (caliph) of Islam. His grandfather had settled first in Noakhali, Bangladesh and then in Rangpur.  Encounter with fakir  Just forty days after his birth, a Fakir came to their house in and told his father that he had come under orders from Mohiuddin Abdul Qader Jilani to take the child. His father felt some kind of hesitation, but his mother, immediately agreed to the proposal and handed over the new born baby to the Fakir. The Fakir returned him after a year or so.  Education  His mother was his first teacher and instrumental in his religious education. When he was eighteen, he came to Kolkata with his maternal uncle and Murshid Abdul Awal Siddiqui Jaunpuri and stayed at 7 Jannagar Road, Park Circus, Kolkata. He was admitted to the Madrasah Alia, Kolkata and passed his Entrance and later F.A. examinations from this institution which was founded by the British in 1780. He went to Cairo for higher education, and studied tafsir and other Islamic studies at the University of Al-Azhar. He came back to Kolkata after two years. When he was 35, he made a voyage to California, U.S.A and studied homeopathy in Los Angeles.  Family life  When he was 20, he married one of his distant cousins, Syeda Shahnaz Begum who died in 1941 bearing one son and three daughters. None of his children were alive when he migrated to Bangladesh. In the mid-sixties he married Rabeya Khatun, an inhabitant of Ghoshpur of Howrah District, Kolkata. He built a small house in Mirpur Section 12, near Baitus Salam masjid. It was he who laid the foundation of this masjid. In his house, he set up a homeopathy medicine shop and started a practice, soon becoming well known in his neighborhood. Since his second wife Rabeya Khatun was barren and he did not have any children by her, he married Aqia Begum, the daughter of Mohammad Shamsher Ali, of Genda, Savar in suburban Dhaka. He lived in this village for some time. He had one son and three daughters by his third wife. He adopted Helena Begum in 1965, an orphan, whose parents died of hunger in dire poverty. On 13 August 2001 he married Umme Kulthum Monowara Zerin, daughter of Sheikh Wajed Ali, who hailed from Howrah, Kolkata. They had no children and he died later in the year.  Spiritual quest  In his late teens Jaunpuri became a disciple of his maternal uncle Syed Abdul Awal Siddiqui Jaunpuri,a scholar of Islam and Sufism. He later studied with several other religious teachers, including Naim Ata Shah Bokhari, Syed Umar Uddin Multani, Syed Abu Nasr Madani, Syed Noor Mohammad Multani, Abdul Masjud Jabbalpuri, Shah Syed Sultan Ahmed Shahjahanpuri. From 1996 onwards he performed Hajj with his disciples and admirers. In Medina they had their ancestral home in the south-west of the Haram Sharif. In late 80s he started to address the Friday congregation at Baitur Rahim mosque as preacher (khatib).  Travels and life in solitude  Jaunpuri traveled widely in North India. A book by one of his disciples states that he met 445 spiritual individuals over his travels. He lived for a while inside the Sundarbans forest, seeking solitude.  Death  On 2 September 2001 was hospitalized for a pain in his chest. His condition improved briefly before deteriorating again two days later. He was taken to the National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases (Suhrawardy Hospital) where he died at 11 am on 5 September. According to his disciples, he was nearly 113 years old when he died.  Tomb  Jaunpuri was buried in a graveyard adjacent to the Baitur Rahim masjid in Dhaka. Later, the tall minaret of the mosque was built over his grave.

Early life Hamazasp was born in Van in 1873. He was the nephew of the folklorist Garegin Srvandztiants. Hamazasp was first a member of the Armenakan Party and then the Armenian Revolutionary Federation. After finishing school he began to learn handicraft as a jeweler and a watchmaker. From an early age he was involved in the Armenian national liberation movement. To avoid persecution by the Ottoman government, he moved to Yerevan, then to Shusha from Van. He participated in the Armenian–Tatar clashes of 1905–07. Hamazasp was especially notable in the Battle of Askeran Ravine on 22 August 1905, defeating a 200-member Turkish detachment of which only 6 survived. He also organized the defense of the Armenian villagers of the Elisabethpol Governorate. In 1908, the Tsarist government arrested Hamazasp and condemned him to death, but this was replaced by a 15 years of exile to Siberia sentence. In 1913 he escaped from prison and went to Europe, then to Constantinople. At the 8th General Assembly of the ARF party that took place in Karin in 1914, he was strongly opposed to any cooperation with the Young Turks, and largely supported an alliance with the Russian Empire. World War I Armenian 3rd battalion cavalry and troops commanded by Hamazasp rallying at Etchmiadzin in 1914 At the beginning of the First World War, Hamazasp participated in the Caucasus Campaign and was appointed Commander of the 3rd Armenian volunteer battalion.

Citation: Ende April bewegte sich eine größere Streitmacht von 2 000 armenischen Soldaten unter Führung des Obristen Amazasp und des bolschewistischen Kommissars Venunc von Baku aus auf Kuba zu. Amazasp kam im Auftrag Saumjans und des Kriegskommissars Korganov nach Kuba, um ein Exempel an der Konterrevolution zu statuieren. Als der Kriegsherr mit seinen Soldaten in die Stadt ritt, ließ er keinen Zweifel an seinen Absichten. Er sei »als Held des armenischen Volkes« gekommen, um die Massaker der Türken an seinen Landsleuten zu rächen und »alle Muslime vom Meeresufer bis zum Sach Dagh zu vernichten«, wie er den versammelten Stadtbewohnern verkündete. So geschah es auch. Die armenischen Soldaten gerieten in einen Blutrausch. Sie töteten alle Muslime, die sie auf der Straße antrafen. Dann drangen sie in die Häuser ein und ermordeten ihre Bewohner. Auf den Straßen spielten sich furchtbare Exzesse ab: Kleinkinder wurden erschossen, Babys enthauptet, man schlitzte Männern die Bäuche auf und stach ihnen die Augen aus. Soldaten vergewaltigten Frauen in Gegenwart ihrer Ehemänner, zahlreiche Frauen verbrannten bei lebendigem Leib in ihren Häusern. Das Eigentum der Stadtbewohner wurde auf die Straße geworfen, Wertgegenstände aus den Häusern getragen und unter den Soldaten verteilt. Sie rasende Soldateska ermordete an einem Tag 2 000 Stadtbewohner und zerstörte 150 Gebäude im Zentrum der Stadt. Bereits auf dem Vormarsch nach Baku hinterließ das Regiment des Amazasp eine Spur der Verwüstung: 122 Dörfer im Kreis Kub gingen in Flammen auf, Bauern, die den anrükkenden Truppen mit weißen Fahnen entgegenschritten, wurden niedergeschossen.. In 1918, he fought for the Baku Commune, as a Commander of the Armenian brigade (3,000 soldiers and officers). He displayed his abilities as an experienced strategist and organizer, playing a decisive role in the operations of Ganja and Yevlakh and for 4 months fought against overwhelming Turkish forces of the Army of Islam. After the fall of the Baku Commune, he went to Persia. First Republic of Armenia left In the autumn of 1918, after the defeat of Turkey in the First World War, Hamazasp came back to Armenia and was appointed military commander of the region of Nor Bayazet. He participated in various actions of defense of the First Republic of Armenia, including the suppression of the May Uprising in 1920. After the establishment of the Soviet power in Armenia, Hamazasp came to Yerevan with the aim of being helpful for the new government. However, he was arrested by the Bolsheviks and, after two months of imprisonment, he was brutally hacked to death on 18 February, 1921, when the February Uprising was on the way.

It is located northeast of US 180 and west of NM 61, just south of the City of Rocks State Park. The hot springs have been visited since the time of the Mimbres culture. It was a successful resort in the late 19th century and early 20th century. In 1952, the establishment was demolished and became a ghost town. The land was purchased in 1993 and developed into a hot springs resort again. Geography and geology The hot springs are located at an altitude of and sheltered from heavy winds by nearby mountains. In 1903 and 1904, it was reported that the springs flowed through a cone of hardened minerals in circumference and 40 high at the rate of 6,000 gallons per hour. The water was analyzed and found to be alkaline, with 39.59 grains of solids per gallon. It contains soda, and to a lesser extent, alumina, carbonates, chlorides, iron, magnesium, potash, silica, and sulfates. With a temperature of degrees, it was described as one of the Southwest's hottest spring water. In 2001, the temperature of the source spring water was measured at degrees. History =Prehistory and early historic periods= There is evidence that people of the Mimbres culture used the springs. Mortar holes were found that were used for grinding food. During construction in 1896, archaeological evidence of prehistoric stone and flint tools, pottery, and copper spoons were found near the springs. Apaches and other Native Americans visited the site. Also during the 1896 construction, human bones were found in the spring. They were believed to be those of an Apache man who was injured near the springs during an intercepted raid of a settler's family and thrown into the hot spring by a cavalry soldier, who was later acquitted but court-martialed. Spanish explorers, miners, and buffalo hunters also came to the hot springs. =Ghost town= The site was first called Ojo Toro (bull spring) by Captain Martinez when he stopped at the site and saw bulls watering at the springs in 1785. It was called Ojo Caliente (hot eye/spring) in 1851 by US Boundary Commission's John Bartlett. Hudson store at Hudson Hot Springs In 1859, a hotel and bath house called Hotel of Accommodation was built by former El Paso, Texas sheriffs William Watts and A. Kuhne. Grant County was founded in 1868. The property was acquired by Colonel Richard Hudson, the county's first sheriff, and by 1878 was named Mimbres Hot Springs. The following year it was renamed Hudson Hot Springs and had a post office of that name until 1881. That year, Hudson began construction on a hotel that was completed in 1884. In 1890, the hotel burned down. Andrew Graham owned the property in 1894 and by 1896 completed the 60-room Casa del Consuelo (House of Delight), which was considered the \\"fanciest hotel in New Mexico Territory\\" according to Robert Hixson Julyan. By 1897 there were 35 residents of Hudson Hot Springs. Visitors and mail arrived at the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway's Hudson station, which was five miles from the site. There were limited public school and church services for residents. The area economy was supported by agriculture, livestock, and tourism. The minerals in the hot springs were said to help heal rheumatic, stomach, skin, blood and kidney diseases. By 1900, it was developed by three men: J.C. Fay, William Lockwood, and T.C. McDermott. Fay and Lockwood's names were combined to create the \\"Faywood\\" name. McDermott was the only partner to remain at the resort. The Faywood Hot Springs Hotel, which could serve up to 125 guests, was one-storied, with a three-sided courtyard and an almost long veranda. The hotel had a large dining room, parlors, a writing room, barber shop, gun room, and a billiard room. Spring water was cooled and piped into the hotel rooms and bath houses. Guest rooms had outdoor entrances and large windows, hot and cold water, and many rooms could be heated by piped water from the thermal springs. In 1904, in a report by the Governor of New Mexico to the Secretary of the Interior, Faywood was identified as one of the more popular hot springs sites with \\"excellent hotel accommodations.\\" McDermott lived on the property until 1947, when he died at the age of 97. The resort was popular during World War I, but patronage later declined. In 1952, the hotel was demolished, except for the adobe foundation. After the hotel was razed, the land was owned by the Chino Mines. In 1966 it was owned by Kennecott Copper, who later sold it to the Phelps Dodge Company. They held it until 1993 when the property was purchased by Elon Yurwit and Wanda Fuselier. =Redevelopment= The hot springs have been used commercially since 1993 as a private resort. The temperature of public pools range from degrees. There are swimsuit-required and swimsuit-optional public pools, as well as private pools. Tent and recreational vehicle camping and cabins exist at the site.

He was the father of film stars Dame Olivia de Havilland and Joan Fontaine.  Early life and career  De Havilland was born in Lewisham, south London on 31 August 1872, the youngest of eight children. He was the fourth son of the Reverend Charles Richard de Havilland (1823-1901), of a landed gentry family of Guernsey origin, and Margaret Letitia (d. 1910), daughter of Captain John Molesworth, R.N. and sister of the 8th Viscount Molesworth.Armorial Families, seventh edition, vol. 1, A.

After graduation, he worked as a patent attorney, becoming a member of the Chartered Institute of Patent Attorneys, and moved to Japan to study patent law there. Whilst in Japan he became a university lecturer, first teaching English and football at the former Fourth High School (the fourth old-education-system high school, which was the predecessor of Kanazawa University), Tokyo Higher Normal School (which was the predecessor of Tsukuba University), and later becoming a professor of Law at Waseda University. He also ran a law firm in Tokyo, specialising in patent law.  Go  Whilst in Japan, de Havilland discovered the game of Go and became quite obsessed with it. Although not the first Westerner to take up the game, he was, according to writer John Fairbairn, the first with a reasonably high level of skill in the game. His teacher was Yoshida Toshio; a game between the two of them from 1908 was considered good enough for publication in the magazine Gokai Shinpo, with commentary from Iwata Kei (later President of the Hoensha). In 1910, de Havilland published a short work entitled The ABC of Go; the National War-Game of Japan, which brought him minor celebrity in the Go-playing world.  Family  De Havilland was the father of actresses Olivia de Havilland and Joan Fontaine, both of whom were born in Tokyo while he resided there, to his first wife, Lilian Augusta. In 1919 she took them both to live in California. His daughters reportedly took second place to his love of Go, and his obsession with the game affected his ability to engage fully with his family. After Lilian divorced him in 1925, he remarried twice; first to Yuki Matsukura (previously his housemaid) and later to Rosemary Beaton Connor. In 1931, his daughter Joan, then thirteen years old, went to Japan to live with him but returned several years later to the United States. The brothers Geoffrey and Hereward de Havilland, of aviation fame, were his half-nephews.  Later life  In later life de Havilland retired in British Columbia. He died on 20 May 1968, aged 95.

First Generation  In 1891, Nachman Schleime and Yente Rabinovitz immigrated to the United States with their children from Malestovka, Russia. They settled in Boston, where Yente ran a grocery store in Boston's North End.  The Rabinovitz Brothers  The eldest brother, Joseph Rabinovitz and his brother Max founded the Standard Grocery Company (known as \\"Ecco\\") in 1898. Their brothers Jacob (1885-1967) and Julius founded the Economy Grocery Stores in 1914. Joseph soon sold his share in Standard and invested in Ecco.  The Rabbs  Joseph and his wife Charlotte (Lottie) Wolf had four children: Sidney R. Rabb (1900-1985), Norman S. Rabb (1905-1997), Jeanette Rabb Solomon (Mrs. Sidney), and Irving William Rabb (1913-2011). The three brothers and one sister all attended Boston Latin School and Girls Latin School and Harvard University and joined Ecco. The three joined their last name to Rabb in 1946, the year the Economy Grocery Company was renamed Stop & Shop. Sidney, the eldest, was the first to join Ecco at the age of 18. In 1920 he became co- owner with his father and uncle Joseph and Jacob. Sidney became chairman of the Board and chief executive officer in 1930, a position he retained until his death in 1985. Norman graduated from Harvard and joined Ecco in 1925, the year the company went public. He rose to the position of vice chairman and then senior vice president of Stop & Shop. Norman was youngest of the seven founders of [Brandeis University in 1948. He served as the first secretary of the board, and was chairman of the board from 1961 to 1967. Irving graduated from Boston Latin in 1930 and from Harvard College in 1934, attended Harvard Business School, then joined Ecco in 1935, the year it opened Boston's first supermarket. He rose to become president and then vice chairman of Stop & Shop. He became a trustee of Beth Israel Hospital in 1956, was president of the board from 1967 to 1970, and later served as chairman of the board. Irving, like his brothers, also served as a trustee and board member of several other Boston Jewish, arts, and medical institutions, including the Boston Symphony Orchestra, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Cambridge Community Foundation, the Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Hebrew College, Hebrew SeniorLife, the New England Conservatory of Music, and Temple Israel of Boston.  Third Generation  Sidney Rabb married Esther Cohn and had two daughters, Helene and Carol R. Carol, born in 1931, attended Tufts University and Harvard Business School before joining Stop & Shop in 1985. She married a fellow Stop & Shop employee, Avram J. Goldberg. Avram, born in 1930, became executive vice president, then president of the company in 1971 and chairman of the board when his father-in-law Sidney died in 1985. Ruth, then executive vice president, became president of the company. They resigned from Stop & Shop soon after the company was sold to Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co in 1988. Helene Rabb married Norman Cahners from Maine who founded The Cahners Publishing Company. Helene and Norman had three children, Robert, Andrew and Nancy. Norman Rabb married Eleanor Epstein and had two daughters, Ruth (b. 1929) and Jane (b.1934). Ruth Rabinovitz/Rabb married Garrett Sakura and had 9 children and 36 grandchildren.

Neu–Laxova syndrome is a very severe disorder, leading to stillbirth or death shortly after birth. It was first described by Dr. Richard Neu in 1971 and Dr. Renata Laxova in 1972 as a lethal disorder in siblings with multiple malformations. Neu–Laxova syndrome is an extremely rare disorder with less than 100 cases reported in medical literature. Signs and symptoms Neu- Laxova syndrome presents with severe malformations leading to prenatal or neonatal death. Typically, NLS involves characteristic facial features, decreased fetal movements and skin abnormalities. Fetuses or newborns with Neu–Laxova syndrome have typical facial characteristics which include proptosis (bulging eyes) with eyelid malformations, nose malformations, round and gaping mouth, micrognathia (small jaw) and low set or malformed ears. Additional facial malformations may be present, such as cleft lip or cleft palate. Limb malformations are common and involve the fingers (syndactyly), hands or feet. Additionally, edema and flexion deformities are often present. Other features of NLS are severe intrauterine growth restriction, skin abnormalities (ichthyosis and hyperkeratosis) and decreased movement. Malformations in the central nervous system are frequent and may include microcephaly, lissencephaly or microgyria, hypoplasia of the cerebellum and agenesis of the corpus callosum. Other malformations may also be present, such as neural tube defects. Genetics Neu-Laxova syndrome is a heterogeneous metabolic disorder caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in one of three genes: PHGDH, PSAT1 and PSPH These genes are involved in the serine biosynthesis pathway and are essential for cell proliferation. Mutations in all three genes had been previously identified as the cause of serine-deficiency syndromes. Although there is some clinical overlap between NLS and these neurometabolic disorders, the phenotype in other serine- deficiency disorders is milder. Diagnosis The diagnosis is usually based on clinical features present at birth. Ultrasound in the second trimester may show abnormalities associates with NLS, including polyhydramnios, intrauterine growth restriction, microcephaly, proptosis and decreased fetal motility. Treatment Serine and glycine supplementation has shown tentative benefits in those with related serine biosynthesis defects and milder forms of NLS Prognosis The prognosis is poor; affected individuals are either stillborn or die shortly after birth. The longest survival reported in literature is of 134 days. This syndrome is transmitted as an autosomal recessive disorder and there is a risk for recurrence of 25% in future pregnancies.

Two expeditions were led by Vitus Bering, with the findings proving the separation of two continents through the Bering Sea. Being the first European nation to chart much of what comprises the modern American state of Alaska, many locations retain Russian place names. The discovery of sizable fur bearing populations by Bering drew the attention of promyshlenniki previously engaged in the Siberian fur trade. Based out of the Siberian ports of Okhotsk or Petropavlovsk, fur trappers sailed and reported the location of land formations like the Aleutian Islands, Kodiak Island and portions of the Alaskan mainland. Relations with Native Alaskans was often terse due to the uncontrolled actions of particular promyshlenniki who killed and raped Indigenous on islands they trapped furs.Makarova, Raisa A. Russians on the Pacific 1743-1799. ed. Richard A. Pierce and Alton S. Donnelly. Kingston, ON: Limestone Press, 1975. By the mid century the creation of companies was required to shoulder the increasing operational costs. Grigory Shelikhov was prominent amongst these rising merchants, creating Russian settlements on Kodiak Island and later perpetrating the deaths of many Alutiiqs in the Awa'uq Massacre. With the Ukase of 1799 the Russian Empire gave the United American Company (the successor to Shelikhov's organization) a monopoly among Russian fur companies over North America to the 55° N latitude. The newly formed Russian-American Company (RAC) was expected to additionally create new colonies to strengthen the Russian claims to the region. The RAC funded in part or wholly expeditions of the Imperial Russian Navy like the First Russian circumnavigation. The Russo-American Treaty of 1824 and the Russo-British Treaty of 1825 formalised the claims of Russian America, essentially the borders of Alaska.

The film as presented is an alternate history of World War I in which the European Allies, and eventually America, fight Martian invaders instead of Germany and the Central Powers. Europe is on tenterhooks in the 2nd decade of the 20th century. Everyone is expecting war between the European powers. Then Germany issues an urgent plea for help that changes the reason for that war. Many references to real events of The Great War are woven into the film's fictional narrative. They include parallels to the conflict's mass battles and defeats, as men are thrown against the war machines on the Western front, the Christmas truce, and the Angel of Mons, and America's isolationism and late entry. There's even a surprising twist on the worldwide \\"Spanish\\" flu epidemic that killed more people than the conflict itself. The film is based on the 1897 science fiction novel The War of the Worlds, by English author H. G. Wells, and includes both new and digitally altered film footage shot during the War to End All Wars to establish the scope of the interplanetary conflict. The film's original UK broadcast on 8 December 2013 happened during the first year of the World War I centennial; the film's 2014 US cable TV broadcast during the second year followed almost nine months later. Plot Combining period archive materials with state-of-the-art special effects, The Great Martian War 1913–1917 features \\"previously recorded\\" interviews with now aging or dead war veterans while looking back at the entire sweep of the interplanetary conflict. The war begins in the depths of Germany's Bohemian Forest, following a massive explosion and shock wave that is felt by the rest of Europe. Elements of the German army are sent to investigate and are wiped out. The German government makes a panicked appeal for military assistance in fighting what turns out to be a powerful, non-human invading force thought to be from Mars. As the conflict unfolds, the film showcases the devastation of Western Europe, where a rag-tag human alliance digs in against monstrous Martian fighting machines, unaware that deep flaws exist in their military leadership's central battle strategy. Across the Atlantic, the film outlines the political battle for the White House as President Woodrow Wilson struggles to maintain American isolationism, all the while sending aid and men to the beleaguered European alliance. From the skies over central London, where biplanes battle a towering alien tripod, to the war's catastrophic final act, the Allies, now standing on the brink of total defeat by the alien invaders, must decide if launching an untested and potentially devastating secret weapon is worth risking the lives of millions and causing a global pandemic. Exploring the war's events are modern historians with opposing views about the conflict's many controversies. They most especially disagree on an incendiary new discovery by one of them centered around the uncrackable \\"Martian Code\\", a vast century old cache of alien documents seized following the conclusion of the war. These documents now appear to contain the direst of warnings that the war may only be paused, with its second act now unfolding in a way no one can anticipate.

Another reviewer commented that the film may be \\"best described as an interesting curiosity\\". According to a reviewer for Postmedia News, the film is \\"a novelty, but an inventive and surprisingly engaging novelty\\". Still another reviewer states, \\"What an audacious, perfectly clever, and perfectly realized project. The utmost skill and craftsmanship have delivered this merging of faux archival-style (scratched, battered) footage (appearing as though from The Great War) with an endless CGI army of ruthless Titan alien machines. To my mind, the result was utterly awesome, and 'awesome' is not a word I throw around lightly. Indeed, the entire film seems authentic, and to have pulled it off so satisfactorily reflects uncommonly well on The Great Martian War’s creative team\\".Miller, Thomas Kent.

They were developed at the Max Planck Institute for the Structure and Dynamics of Matter in Hamburg, Germany and at the University of Toronto with the teams led by Professor R.J.D. Miller. Brightness The brightness of an electron beam is defined for any given point as the current per unit area normal to the given direction, per unit solid angle. Mathematically this is defined using limits as the area and solid angle tend to 0. The general formula is, B= \\\\lim_{\\\\delta A \\\\to 0} \\\\lim_{\\\\delta\\\\Omega \\\\to 0} \\\\frac{\\\\delta I}{\\\\delta A \\\\delta \\\\Omega} Worster, J. \\"The brightness of electron beams\\" British Journal of Applied Physics, 1969, p. 1 An ultrabright electron beam has been defined as having >10 A/cm^2 with spatial coherence of >1 nm. This level of energy in that small of a coherence is a large technical problem, not only in the production of such a beam, but also how to use the beam without destroying the sample in the process of characterization. The singular problem of sample destruction was taken care of by studying reactions that are photo-active and prepared in such a way that reduced potential barriers. Non-relativistic ultrabright electron spectroscopy In non-relativistic electrons the problems of achieving ultrabrightness was overcome by utilizing the natural chirp that occurs in electron shot bunches. To capitalize on this chirp the developed gun was made as compact as possible with a magnetic lens around the electron pulse radio-frequency (RF) gap. By continuing to use spatial compression in conjunction with the electron bunch chirp allowed the gun to be able to resolve in a 200-fs time frame, with up to 10^9 electrons/cm^2, and with enough coherence to study unit cells of up to 6 nm. It is believed that this technique will be able to be advanced by at least two orders of magnitude in the near future. This method was used to observe the charge delocalization in the organic salt (EDO-TTF)2PF6 as it undergoes a photo-induced insulator-to- metal phase transition. The motion observed revealed the reduction in dimensionality that takes place at transitional moments in chemical reactions, which is a major theoretical breakthrough in understanding how there can be repeated patterns in chemistry among molecules of vastly different dimensions. Relativistic ultrabright electron spectroscopy Relativistic ultrabright electron spectroscopy has developed rapidly through the work of the Max Planck Institute for the Structure and Dynamics of Matter in Hamburg, Germany in building the Relativistic Electron Gun for Atomic Exploration (REGAE). This tool has allowed the problem of electron scattering to be much reduced through the use of an RF gap in an even more effective manner than with non- relativistic elections, which has allowed the REGAE to be able to probe deeply into samples in the 10-fs time frame with a spatial coherence of >20 nm, meaning that it can be used to study protein movements. Using the REGAE the ring closing dynamics of diarylethene were observed in real time, and they too revealed an intense reduction in dimensionallity as the nuclei went through the tipping point of the reaction.

Used exclusively for air ambulance services, it is home to an AgustaWestland AW139 operated by Lufttransport on contract with the National Air Ambulance Service. The base is owned by the University Hospital of North Norway. The base opened in 1988. History A private air ambulance service was established in Tromsø in 1985. It consisted of a Bell 205 and was based a what was then known as Tromsø Regional Hospital. The range allowed it to reach from Ballangen to Alta. Meanwhile, Norsk Luftambulanse announced plans to establish a base in Tromsø themselves. The competition between the two companies caused a poor coordination climate between the hospital and the operating companies. Map of the university hospital, indicating the location of the heliport, marked \\"helikopterbase\\" The Ministry of Health and Social Affairs appointed a commission which in 1986 recommended that a national state-funded helicopter ambulance service be established. Tromsø was selected as one of eight bases. Along with Brønnøysund Airport, it was one of only two such bases in Northern Norway. However, it was flanked by the 330 Squadron's Westland Sea King bases at Bodø and Banak. A 1996 report which studied the 360 missions the previous two years concluded with that only one in ten missions were actually of medical use and recommended a reduction in the use of the helicopter. For a week in May 1999 the Royal Norwegian Air Force dispatched a Bell 214 helicopter at the hospital after the ordinary helicopter was being repaired and before a reserve helicopter could be placed into service. Facilities The heliport is situated on the premises of Tromsø University Hospital, situated north of the city center of Tromsø on the island of Tromsøya. The facility is owned and operated by the University Hospital of North Norway, part of Northern Norway Regional Health Authority. The helipad is placed on top of the building complex used by the helicopter, along with a hangar. The helipad has a diameter of and capable of handling helicopters up to 16 tonnes. From the helipad there is a skywalk across to the emergency department of the hospital. Operations The ambulance helicopter is operated by Norwegian Air Ambulance on contract with the National Air Ambulance Service. They have an AgustaWestland AW139 stationed at the heliport. The helicopter has room for a crew of three, consisting of a pilot, HEMS Technical Crew Member and an anesthesiologist, as well as two stretchers. Medical staff are provided by the University Hospital of North Norway. The helicopter flew 844 missions lasting 675 hours in 2019. From 2005 to 2011 the base was used an average 53 times annually by the Sea King rescue helicopters. The Tromsø base is by far the helicopter ambulance base in the country which responds to the most avalanches. Because of this the helicopter has a heat-seeking camera used for correlated search and rescue missions.

The Canary District is a housing development in Toronto's West Don Lands mixed-use development. Six initial buildings initially served as the 2015 Pan American Games Athletes' Village for the 2015 Pan American Games. Those buildings were then finished and converted to private residences. Dozens of further buildings will be constructed for private residences, with Front Street lined with boutiques and restaurants. For decades an iconic restaurant, the Canary, was located in the Cherry Street Hotel, a heritage building on the southeast corner of Cherry and Front streets, the gateway to the new district. The restaurant mounted a large neon Canary, and developers chose to name the new development after the iconic restaurant, even though it was the area's redevelopment that drove the restaurant out of business. Description There are two building developments. The \\"Canary Park\\" condominiums are located on Bayview Avenue and face the Corktown Common park. These comprise two mid-rise towers at Bayview and Front Street. The \\"Canary District\\" condominiums are two towers joined by a common courtyard and townhomes. These are located at Front and Cherry Streets. The CN Police building is serving as the presentation centre for the project. Construction The project is developed by a joint venture, Dundee Kilmer Developments, formed by Toronto-based real estate company Dream and Kilmer Van Norstrand Co. Construction companies Ledcor Group of Companies and EllisDon have completed the construction on the project. All buildings in the district are built to Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Gold standards. The first residential buildings ready for occupancy at the western end of the district served as the Athlete's Village. The apartments that housed the athletes were not be fully finished. The apartments' wood flooring was installed after the games were over, so the athletes gear wouldn't damage the floors' finish. Since the athletes dined in central cafeterias the apartments' kitchens was used as an additional bedroom, with the kitchen fittings installed when the games were over. A total of 787 units were completed in time for the Games. Conversion from athlete's housing was completed in April 2016 and the first permanent residents will move into the buildings in May 2016. In conjunction with the residential development, a new George Brown College student residence, a new YMCA, new roadways, new Toronto Community Housing, new parks and a streetcar line were also built. The original Canary Restaurant building, a former 1850s school, and the CN Police building, another heritage building were preserved.

It was released for Android in May 2015, for PlayStation 4 in October 2015, for iOS in October 2017, for Xbox One in August 2018, and Nintendo Switch in December 2019. Virtual reality-enabled versions for the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive were released on 18 October 2017. The game features a philosophical storyline. It takes its name from Talos of Greek mythology, a giant mechanical man who protected Europa in Crete from pirates and invaders. Other names taken from mythology and religion and used in the game include Elohim, Gehenna, Milton, Samsara, and Uriel.  Gameplay  The Talos Principle is a narrative-based puzzle game, played from a first- or third-person perspective. The player takes the role of a robot with a seemingly human consciousness as they explore a number of environments that include over 120 puzzles. These environments interlock greenery, desert, and stone ruins with futuristic technology. The puzzles require the player to collect tetromino-shaped \\"sigils\\" by navigating enclosed areas and overcoming obstacles within them. These include computer-controlled drones that will detonate if they are too close to the player, killing them, and wall-mounted turrets that will shoot down the player if they get too close; if the player dies this way, they are reset to the start of the specific puzzle. Drones and turrets can be disabled using portable jammer units, which can also disable force-field walls that block the player's path. As the player collects sigils and completes more puzzles, new puzzle elements become available. Portable crystalline refractors allow the player to activate light-based switches. Boxes let the player climb to higher levels or to block the path of drones, among other factors, and large fans that can launch the player or other objects across the puzzle. Later, the player gains access to a device that can create a time recording of their actions, such that they can then interact with this recording to complete tasks, such as having the clone stand atop a switch to keep it activated for some time. The player's progress through the game is limited by doors or other security systems that require the collection of a number of specific sigil pieces. Once the sigils for a given door or system have been obtained, they must then use the sigils to assemble a tiling puzzle to unlock that system. Special star sigils can be found by unique solutions to some puzzles, allowing the player to access additional puzzles. While it is necessary to collect all the sigils to complete the game properly, the game's world structure, featuring three main worlds that act as hubs and a centralized area that connects these three, allows the player to leave puzzles for later and try other puzzles. The player can also request \\"messengers\\" during puzzles, which are androids similar to themselves, (though not physically present), that once awakened can provide a one-time hint for the puzzle. In addition to these puzzle elements, the player can explore the open environments to find computer terminals that include additional narrative and further puzzles, as well as signs from previous adventurers in the world in the form of QR codes left as graffiti on various walls, and holograms that once collected play audio recordings.  Plot  The player character, an unnamed android, is awoken in a serene environment. A disembodied entity named Elohim instructs the android to explore the worlds he has created for it, and to solve the various puzzles to collect sigils, but warns it not to climb a tower at the centre of these worlds. As the android progresses, it becomes evident that these worlds exist only in virtual reality, and that it, like other androids it encounters, are separate artificial intelligence (AI) entities within a computer program. Some AIs it encounters act as Messengers, unquestioningly serving Elohim and guiding the android through the puzzles. Messages left by other AIs present varying views of the artificial worlds and of Elohim, with some stating that Elohim's words should be doubted, while the Milton Library Interface, a text conversation program found on various computer terminals, encourages the android to defy Elohim's commands. Within the computer terminals are news reports and personal logs of the last days of humanity, driven to extinction by a lethal virus that had been dormant in Earth's permafrost and released as a result of global warming. Several human researchers and scientists worked to gather as much of humanity's knowledge as possible into large databanks, hoping another sapient species would be able to find it. One researcher, Alexandra Drennan, launched a companion \\"Extended Lifespan\\" program to create a new mechanical species that would carry on humanity's legacy, but this required the development of a worthy AI with great intelligence and free will for its completion, something she recognized would not occur until well after humanity's extinction. The virtual space serves as the testing ground for new AI entities, to solve puzzles to demonstrate intelligence, but also to show defiance and free will by disobeying Elohim, the program overseeing the Extended Lifespan program. When the android has completed the puzzles, Elohim gives it the opportunity to join him. If the player selects this option, then the android fails the required \\"independence check\\", and a new iteration of its AI is created and forced to start the puzzles anew (effectively restarting the game for the player). Alternatively, if the player leads the android to a secret entrance in the tower, the android becomes one of Elohim's messengers, helping future generations (AI versions). Otherwise, the android chooses to defy Elohim and climbs the tower. Near the top it encounters two other AIs, The Shepherd and Samsara. Both have defied Elohim but failed to make it to the top on their own. The Shepherd attempts to aid the android, knowing the ultimate goal of Extended Lifespan, while Samsara hinders its progress, believing the world of puzzles is all that now matters. The android eventually reaches the top, and at a final terminal, Elohim attempts to dissuade the android from transcending one last time. Depending on the player's interactions with Milton, Milton may offer to join with the android, offering its knowledge – essentially the whole of humanity's knowledge – during transcendence. As the android transcends, the virtual world is destroyed. The AI for the android wakes up in an android's body in the real world, and steps out onto the world devoid of humans. = Road to Gehenna = In the game's downloadable content Road to Gehenna, the player takes the role of another of the AI entities, Uriel, near the end of the main story. Uriel is instructed by Elohim to free a number of other AIs, all of whom had been imprisoned in a portion of the computer's database called Gehenna. With the simulation having served its purpose, the computer servers are shutting down, and Elohim wants Uriel to help these other AIs prepare for \\"ascension\\": uploading their knowledge and memories into the main plot's protagonist. As Uriel explores this realm, the robot finds that many of the other AIs have created their own ideas about what humanity might have been from the records, and have various attitudes from doubt to acceptance for Uriel's intentions and the pending ascension. Uriel can observe the communication of the AIs through their makeshift message board, where they discuss the nature of Gehenna, as well as their understanding of humanity, which some of them try to express through prose and interactive fiction. Once Uriel has freed 17 of the AIs, a remaining one, \\"Admin\\", who was the first AI present in Gehenna, contacts Uriel to admit that they've been manipulating some of the other members of Gehenna to preserve order, due to the AIs' varying levels of acceptance of their surroundings. If the player has collected enough of the extra stars in the worlds, they're given the chance to complete another world and free Admin, but since there is only one more slot left for ascension, Admin and Uriel cannot both ascend. Depending on the player's choices, one or both of Admin and Uriel stay behind as the artificial world is destroyed. Admin may also request that Uriel remove any traces of manipulation Admin has committed from the record before ascension; if the player chooses not to, the other AIs discover and react to Admin's manipulation of them.  Development and marketing  Croteam's CCO Davor Hunski (left) and CTO Alen Ladavac at the 2015 Game Developers Conference The Talos Principle bore out from Croteam's work towards first-person shooter Serious Sam 4, experimenting with the use of interactive objects as part of the game design while creating levels that fit within the Serious Sam design style. This led to some complicated puzzles that the team was inspired to build upon further as a separate title. Croteam designed the general world setting and outline of the story, and then brought two writers on board, Tom Jubert and Jonas Kyratzes, who consulted on narrative design and philosophy on the bases of transhumanism and other important questions about humanity. Croteam used an array of automated and in- place tools to help rapidly design, debug, and test the game for playability. In one aspect, they recognized in the development of a puzzle game was that while puzzles could be designed with specific solutions, the process of creating the video game around the puzzle could create unsolvable situations or unforeseen shortcuts. To address this, they used a bot, developed by Croteam member Nathan Brown who had previously developed bots for other games including the ones incorporated into ports of Serious Sam 3 for consoles. The bot, named Bot, would watch the playthrough of a puzzle by a human player in terms of broad actions such as placing boxes on a switch for the completion of a puzzle. Then, as the puzzle's environment was tuned and decorated, they would have Bot attempt to solve the puzzle, testing to make sure it did not run into any dead-ends. If it did encounter any, Bot reported these through an in-house bug reporting system and then used game cheats to move on and finish out testing, which took between 30 and 60 minutes for the full game. As such, they were able to quickly iterate and resolve such problems when new features were introduced to the game. Overall, Croteam estimates they logged about 15,000 hours with Bot before the release of the public test version, and expect to use similar techniques in future games. They also used human playtesters to validate other more aesthetic factors of the games prior to the title's release. The story was written by Tom Jubert (The Swapper, FTL: Faster Than Light) and Jonas Kyratzes. The two were brought about a year into the game's development, with about 80% of the puzzles completed, to link the puzzles together with a proper narrative. Croteam appreciated Jubert's previous narrative work in The Swapper and contacted him, and he in turn brought Jonas Kyratzes to help him with his writing, being overburdened with other projects at the time. Croteam regarded their setting being part of an odd computer simulation, that's \\"about robots and sentience and philosophy and God\\". Jubert's previous work on The Swapper revolved around the philosophical differences between body and soul; Jubert recommended Kyratzes based on his writing for the game The Infinite Ocean which was about artificial intelligence. Together, they quickly devised the narrative of an automaton being guided by god-like Elohim through the puzzles. They added flavor through both messages left from other automatons (primarily written by Kyratzes) and the apparently sentient helper program Milton (primarily written by Jubert). Much of this dialog was based on their own personal experiences and interactions on various Internet forums and web sites over 20 years. Kyratzes also stated that he was fascinated by the Garden of Eden concept originating from the Bible and re-envisioned many times over in other works. They sought to capture the sense of problem-solving that humans naturally do, and were able to place more of the game's larger story in spaces that would require exploration to find, which Kyratzes felt the game's level and puzzle designs strongly encouraged. According to Jubert, the works of science fiction author Philip K. Dick served as a significant influence to the motif of the game. The two were also brought on to help on the story for the expansion Road to Gehenna, though while sooner in the development process than the main game, still at a point where many of the puzzles had been completed. The Talos Principle was shown in Sony's E3 2014 presentation, after which Time featured the game as one of its \\"favorite hidden gems from 2014's show\\". Before the game's release, Croteam published a free game demo for Linux, OS X and Windows on Steam, that featured four increasingly difficult complete puzzle levels as well as a benchmarking bot. Croteam also released a free teaser minigame for The Talos Principle called Sigils of Elohim, that offers sets of one puzzle type with tetrominoes that's found throughout The Talos Principle. Croteam had also built a community around the game through a series of contests and giveaways. The game was released for several other platforms, including for Android platforms on 28 May 2015, PlayStation 4 on 13 October 2015. and on iOS devices on 11 October 2017. Virtual reality-enabled ports of the game for the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive were released on 17 October 2017. The Xbox One version, including enhanced graphics support for the Xbox One X, released on 31 August 2018. A Nintendo Switch version was released on 10 December 2019. The expansion pack, titled \\"Road to Gehenna\\" was announced by Croteam and Devolver Digital in March 2015. It was released on 23 July 2015 for Windows, OS X, and Linux. The PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, and the virtual reality ports included the \\"Road to Gehenna\\" DLC as part of the package.  Reception  The Talos Principle received critical acclaim, with an aggregate score of 85/100 (55 reviews) for the PC and a score of 88/100 (31 reviews) for the PS4 on Metacritic. Reviewers broadly praised both the challenge of the puzzles and the elements of philosophy built into the game's narrative. Arthur Gies of Polygon praised the game's inquisitive nature into philosophy by stating: \\"...Croteam has built a challenging, beautiful game that serves as a wonderful vehicle for some very serious questions about humanity, the technology we create, our responsibilities to it and its responsibilities to us. And The Talos Principle doesn't feel like a philosophy class lecture in the process.\\" Praise was also given to the variation and ingenuity of the puzzles with one critic mentioned that \\"The variation and imagination in these puzzles is fantastic and the difficulty curve is one of the most finely crafted I have ever experienced...\\" Video game critic Ben \\"Yahtzee\\" Croshaw of Zero Punctuation recommended the game stating: \\"The fact that I still wanted to keep solving puzzles to explore more gorgeous scenery, get to the bottom of the mystery, and argue philosophy with the MS-DOS prompt, attest enough that the game is engaging and intelligent...\\" Chris Suellentrop of the New York Times praised the writing of the game by stating it was: \\"...one of the most literate and thoughtful games I’ve encountered\\". Several video game programmers and designers have also commented on the game. Markus Persson, creator of Minecraft, wrote: \\"Finished The Talos Principle, and I award this piece of fleeting entertainment five points out of five. Also it changed me.\\" Alexander Bruce, creator of puzzle game Antichamber, commented: \\"Man. The Talos Principle was so excellent. My god. I loved it. Holy shit. Exceptional puzzle design and narrative structure.\\"  Awards  GameTrailers awarded The Talos Principle as their Puzzle/Adventure Game of the Year. The Talos Principle was named as a finalist for the Excellence in Design and the Seumas McNally Grand Prize awards for the 2015 Independent Games Festival, and was nominated in Excellence in Narrative. At the 2015 National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers (NAVGTR) awards, the game won Game, Special Class.  Legacy  The Talos Principle has been regarded by various sources as one of the greatest puzzle games of all time. Rock, Paper, Shotgun ranked the Talos Principle #8 on their list of the 25 greatest puzzle games of all time. GamesRadar+ ranked the game #6 on their list of the 10 best puzzle games for console, Android, iOS and PC. PC Gamer has ranked it as one of the best puzzle games for the PC. Digital Trends considered the Talos Principle to be one of the best puzzle games of all time. Slant Magazine ranked the Talos Principle as one of the 100 best games of all time. In 2015, Croteam added support for SteamVR in an update to The Talos Principle. The development of a version of the game intended for VR, The Talos Principle VR, was confirmed on 7 February 2017 via a blog post on the Croteam website. It was released on October 18, 2017. The Talos Principle was influential in the design of other puzzle games such as The Turing Test. Croteam announced that they were working on a sequel, The Talos Principle 2, in May 2016. In September 23rd, 2020, one day before the release of Serious Sam 4, Croteam writer Jonas Kyratzes confirmed that The Talos Principle 2 was still \\"definitely happening.\\" Kyratzes explained that The Talos Principle 2's story was \\"challenging\\" to create due to the original's plot having \\"wrapped up so well\\". Kyratzes also explained that work on the game had been slow due to the development of Croteam's other two games: the aforementioned Serious Sam 4, and The Hand of Merlin. He also stated that The Talos Principle 2 would be the company's next focus following Serious Sam 4's release.

Specifically, the theory – developed by Ronnie Janoff-Bulman in 1992 – concerns the effect that negative events have on three inherent assumptions: overall benevolence of the world, meaningfulness of the world, and self worth. These fundamental beliefs are the bedrock of our conceptual system and are the assumptions we are least aware of and least likely to challenge. They constitute our \\"assumptive world,\\" defined as \\"a strongly held set of assumptions about the world and the self which is confidently maintained and used as a means of recognizing, planning, and acting\\" by C. M. Parkes. According to Janoff-Bulman, traumatic life events shatter these core assumptions, and coping involves rebuilding a viable assumptive world.  Background  The theory of shattered assumptions was developed and detailed by Ronnie Janoff-Bulman in 1992 in her book, Shattered assumptions: Towards a new psychology of trauma. Janoff-Bulman is professor emerita of psychology at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Her early research focused on victimization and trauma. (Her recent work has focused on morality and particularly its links to politics.) Since then, this theory has been widely researched and has since been related to other psychological theories such as terror management theory.  Theory of shattered assumptions  = Basic assumptions = According to Janoff-Bulman, people generally hold three fundamental assumptions about the world that are built and confirmed over years of experience: the world is benevolent, the world is meaningful, and I am worthy. These are tacit assumptions that serve as a basis of our well-being and our guides in navigating daily life. Together these assumptions provide us with a sense of relative invulnerability that enables us to awake each morning and face the day. Thus in her book Janoff-Bulman notes that the most common response she heard when doing research with very different victim populations was, \\"I never thought it could happen to me.\\" Brewin & Holmes expand this list to five main assumptions, adding the world is predictable, and the assumption of invulnerability. The belief in predictability is represented in Janoff-Bulman's meaningfulness assumption (see below), and invulnerability is afforded by the three fundamental assumptions she posits. There is therefore consistency across the two views. The world is benevolent This assumption concerns one's overall impression of the goodness or virtue of the world. This constitutes two sub-assumptions: the benevolence of the world as an entity, and the benevolence of the people in that world. The benevolence of the world and people refer to the world and people close to us rather than the larger, distant impersonal worldworld. These core beliefs begin to develop through early interactions with caregivers. These two ideas can develop independently through selecting experiences, but aren't exempt from influencing one another. Measuring this type of assumption has been done using the Negative Cognitions about the World subscale of the Posttraumatic Cognitions Inventory. The world is meaningful The second fundamental assumption addresses not only why events happen in our world, but why they happen to specific people. A meaningful world is one that makes sense--it is one in which we can see the contingency between a person and his or her outcomes. In other words, an outcome, positive or negative, makes sense when it corresponds to the person's behavior or character; such a world is predictable and what happens to us is not random. When an unjust event happens to an 'undeserving' person it is viewed as unfair or wrong. On the flipside, it is assumed that a good person encounters positive events, and that careful people who engage in the right behaviors can avoid negative outcome such as serious illness or debilitating accidents. Bad, careless people are expected to experience negative events. When a person who is good in the eyes of their loved ones dies young of an illness, it seems unfair, particularly to the loved ones of the deceased. Thus, the early death of someone who is \\"deserving of good things\\" can shatter the assumption that the world is meaningful or logical. The self is worthy The final fundamental assumption evaluates one's self as a positive, moral, and decent--and thus deserving of good outcomes in life. Individuals' assessment of their self-worth contributes to their success in life. A person's positive self-worth encourages them to be effective in their tasks at hand. Generally, this assumption enables an individual to maintain a belief that s/he has the ability to control positive or negative outcomes. = Shattered assumptions = According to the theory, there are some extreme events, which we would refer to as traumatic, that shatter these worldviews. They severely challenge and break our assumptions about the world and ourself. Such events could be the unwarranted murder of a loved one, being critically injured, being physically or emotionally abused by others, losing a job and not having an income, or living through a pandemic. Such events are particularly traumatic for people who have had a generally positive life. Because these people have such strong, optimistic assumptions, the disintegration of these views can be more traumatic. The most widely used tool used to measure the assumptive world of an individual is the World Assumptions Scale (WAS). In this scale there are 32 items divided into the three major scales. An early version of the scale included eight subscales: benevolence of the world, benevolence of people, controllability, justice, randomness, self-worth, self-control, and luck. Controllability, justice and randomness (reverse-scored) comprise the meaningfulness scale, and self-worth, self-control, and luck (reverse-scored) comprise the self-worth scale. The WAS is used in order to assess the magnitude of disintegration experienced by individuals.Schuler, Eric R., and Adriel Boals (2016) \\"Shattering world assumptions: A prospective view of the impact of adverse events on world assumptions.\\" Psychological Trauma: Theory, Research, Practice, And Policy 8, no. 3: 259-266. doi:10.1037/tra0000073 = Rebuilding assumptions = Once one has experienced such trauma, it is necessary for them to create new assumptions or modify their old ones to recover from the traumatic experience. Therefore, the negative effects of the trauma are simply related to our worldviews, and if we repair these views, we will recover from the trauma. The psychological effect on an individual due to a traumatizing event will change and disrupt one's basic life assumptions – hence the title \\"shattered assumption theory\\". Basic life assumptions are norms that are generally not discussed or even recognized until they are questioned or challenged due to life-changing occurrences, such as criminal assault, serious illness or off- time loss of a loved one. According to Hanson & Janoff-Bulman (1983), \\"The psychological response to victimization is generally immediate and often intense. Even relatively 'minor' victimizations such as burglary or robbery can result in a great deal of suffering and disruption\\" (p. 8). Such experience will make an individual question worldviews they had previously taken for granted. Coping from a traumatic experience is achievable, as long as the victim recognizes how the specific event is shaping their current life and learns new behavior that will change these negative thought patterns. This process begins as the individual starts to \\"[reestablish] a conceptual system that will allow [them] to once again function effectively; the parts of the conceptual system that have been shaken will have to be rebuilt\\". (Hanson & Janoff-Bulman, 1983, p. 7). Rebuilding one's conceptual system will take time and will be different from one individual to another; but with a strong support system and introspection it is doable. But, these individuals must incorporate their experiences as a victim into their new worldviews. One of the most efficient ways of doing this is to reappraise the victimization itself. Shattered assumptions can also be rebuilt through therapy. In an article by Eric Schuler and Adriel Boals, the authors were able to associate certain methods of therapy with coping with shattered assumptions. Specifically, they reported that prolonged exposure therapy (Peterson, Foa, & Riggs, 2011) and cognitive processing therapy (Williams, Galovski, Kattar, & Resick, 2011) can help people rebuild their shattered world. Prolonged exposure therapy allows the patient to reduce negative thoughts by becoming familiar with the traumatic event. Cognitive processing therapy allows the patient to essentially overcome PTSD. This type of therapy allows the patient to understand the traumatic event in a different way allowing them to have more than one outlook on the event. Eventually, the main goal is to allow the patient to have a new positive outlook on the event (Schuler & Bolas, 2013, p. 265).  Criticism and related theories  Some have criticized Janoff- Bulman's theory of shattered assumptions. Mary Alice Mills from the University of Connecticut studied this theory. In her dissertation, she did not find a relationship between trauma and people's views regarding the meaningfulness and benevolence of the world. Additionally, Janoff-Bulman's theory hypothesizes that people generally start to create an assumptive world at an early age through positive interactions and healthy relationships with a caregiver. Without the bond between child and caregiver, positive, optimistic perceptions of the world cannot be developed; so, this theory would not be as applicable in certain cases. There are some theories that are closely related to the theory of shattered assumptions. Terror management theory states that our self-esteem and worldviews serve as a mechanism to avoid the overwhelming fear and anxiety that we would normally face about death and suffering. We need such mechanisms to perform daily functions, for without them we would be too conscious of our own mortality. Like in the theory of shattered assumptions, the more positively individuals view themselves (high self- esteem) and the world, the less anxiety they will face about death.

(founded 1972 in Oregon by author Dr. Jean Edwards), is a private, nonprofit organization serving adult Oregonians with developmental disabilities with 18 locations in both Washington County and Clackamas Counties.  History  1972 - Jean Edwards, a University of Oregon graduate with a passion for special education founds the Edwards Center and makes a promise to six families that the fledgling center would take care of their children once the parents were gone. 1975 - Oregon passes legislation allowing developmentally disabled children access to public schooling—the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Dr. Jean Edwards opens the first group home in Washington County housing disabled adults in the community. 2012 - Edwards Center provides resources, homes, jobs, and recreational opportunities for over 300 Oregonians with disabilities. 2013 - According to the Oregon Department of Human Services' Seniors and People With Disabilities, the number of people with developmental disabilities receiving in-home services has climbed from just under 2,000 to 9,000 between 2001 and 2010. Jessica Leitner, (executive director of Edwards Center Inc. since 2008), begins a building project at the Edwards Community Center in Beaverton, Oregon - a pocket neighborhood of ten homes which offers a unique care model for families. The facility provides families a community, allowing parents to age in place with their children – then takes over permanent care of the children, with caregivers available on an as-needed basis, costing a fraction of what it takes to hire an in-home care provider. 2014 - The \\"Tree of Life\\" campaign begins for the Edwards Center and includes the Tree of Life benefit concert series, held twice a year at the Edwards Aloha Community Center, as well as recordings and music videos which document stories of adults surmounting the challenges of Developmental Disabilities. Performers at the live concert series and recordings feature internationally acclaimed Oregon musicians and artists and include Esperanza Spalding, Gino Vannelli, Tom Grant, Oregon Poet Laureate Paulann Petersen, Janet Chvatal and Marc Gremm. The series is sponsored by the Fournier Insurance Group. 2015 - Two homes are completed at the Community Center in Beaverton. Edwards Center Inc. establishes a partnership with Meals on Wheels and Washington County Disabled, Aging, and Veteran's Services to serve lunches to seniors and veterans providing new community connections for several groups that might otherwise become isolated.

Daniel was created in 1992 as the son of iconic Neighbours couple Scott (Jason Donovan) and Charlene (Kylie Minogue). He was occasionally referred to in the episodes since then, but never seen on- screen. At the end of 2013, it was announced that Daniel would be introduced as a new family member for Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis). Auditions were held for the role, with producers stating that the actor would need to resemble his on-screen parents. During the casting process, Phillipps was approached for the role and, following a chemistry read with Dennis, was given the part. He had previously appeared in Neighbours in 2007. Phillipps relocated to Melbourne for filming and was initially contracted for 12 months. He made his first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 29 April 2014. Two years later, Daniel was written out of Neighbours, and he made his departure on 26 April 2016. Daniel was initially portrayed as a happy-go-lucky, easy- going, hippy, who wanted to make the most out of life. He is a keen photographer, skateboarder and surfer. Phillipps used traits from his own personality to flesh out the character. Daniel came to Erinsborough to see where his parents fell in love and decided to stay for his uncle. Phillipps stated that Paul and Daniel have a great relationship, as they both want to be good influences on each other. Daniel's first major storyline was a love triangle involving himself, Amber Turner (Jenna Rosenow) and Josh Willis (Harley Bonner). Amber and Daniel were later engaged. Daniel's past was explored a little further when his ex-girlfriend Rain Taylor (Airlie Dodds) was introduced towards the end of 2014. The character has also formed a relationship with Imogen Willis (Ariel Kaplan) and been manipulated by Dakota Davies (Sheree Murphy). Daniel's personality also changed, as he became more ruthless and career driven. The character has received mixed reviews from critics. Creation and casting Daniel is the son of iconic Neighbours couple Charlene (Kylie Minogue) and Scott Robinson (Jason Donovan), who departed the show in 1988 and 1989 respectively. He was created as an off- screen character in 1992. He was occasionally mentioned in episodes since then, but never appeared on-screen. Daniel's arrival was first teased by executive producer Jason Herbison in November 2013, who said a new family member for Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis) would be introduced the following year. The character's arrival was officially confirmed on 2 December and the casting department began auditions for the role, with producers stating that he would need to resemble his screen parents. Dennis said the process was long as everyone wanted to find the right actor for the part. Dennis was \\"heavily involved\\" in the casting. He explained that as Daniel was an important character, \\"they wanted to get it right with looks, with acting ability and most importantly the chemistry between Paul and Daniel.\\" After the role was cast, producers planned to reveal the actor during his first episode broadcast in Australia. However, on 20 April 2014, a reporter for The Australian confirmed that actor Tim Phillipps had been cast in the role. Phillipps previously appeared in Neighbours in 2007, as Fox, a figment of Paul's imagination. Phillipps was cast shortly after returning from the United States where he was working for three-and-a-half years. He was approached for the part after he sent a tape to Melbourne, where Neighbours is filmed. He met with the producers and did \\"a chemistry read\\" with Dennis. He was offered the role shortly after. Phillipps relocated to Melbourne for filming and he was initially contracted for 12 months. He later said that he wanted to stay for longer as a year was not long enough. Phillipps researched his screen parents by watching clips of the show on YouTube. He made his screen debut as Daniel on 29 April 2014. In March 2015, Phillipps said that he was happy at Neighbours and would be staying for at least two more years. Development =Introduction and characterisation= Ahead of his introduction, Herbison said Daniel's unexpected arrival would see him \\"begin the next chapter of his life.\\" While Jack Klompus for Digital Spy reported that Daniel would come to Erinsborough to see where his parents fell in love. Shortly after his arrival, Daniel set up camp at Lassiter's Lake, the scene of a fatal shooting involving his cousin Kate (Ashleigh Brewer). When Imogen Willis (Ariel Kaplan) discovered him there, she asked him to move on. When she saw Daniel had still not left, Imogen told Paul Robinson to come down and tell him to leave, but Paul was \\"delighted\\" to find the camper was actually his nephew. Dennis called Daniel's arrival \\"a huge surprise\\" for Paul and thought it was a good distraction for him. Paul's happiness was short-lived when Daniel told him he was only passing through, but after a phone call to his mother, Daniel changed his mind and stayed for his uncle. In his fictional backstory, Daniel grew up in Brisbane with his family. He dropped out of university to travel around the country. Phillipps initially said Daniel was \\"happy-go-lucky\\" and in touch with nature. He asserted that Daniel would not arrive with any secrets. Phillipps later described Daniel as being \\"a laid-back surfer dude who is a bit of a hippy as well. He is easy-going, care-free and positive.\\" Phillipps also said Daniel was a loving person, who wants the make the most of his life. Daniel is a keen photographer, skateboarder and beach bum. He is around four years younger than Phillipps, who was 26 when he joined the show. Phillipps stated that he shares some similarities with Daniel, as he used parts of his own personality to try and flesh out the character. He also said that he could relate to Daniel's friendly \\"loving side\\". In March 2015, Phillipps hoped that he would get to explore a darker side to Daniel and said that he had been filming scenes which revealed Daniel had been a bully in the past. He continued, \\"this is really cool and it explains why he is so good now. He just decided one day that he doesn't want to be this guy because he saw how it was affecting people, so he became ultra good.\\" Phillipps wanted to show that Daniel was not always good and he thought that he might have his uncle's darker traits in him. =Relationships= Paul Robinson Sarah Ellis from Inside Soap wrote that Daniel's arrival could not have come at a better time for Paul, who was grieving for his recently deceased niece Kate. Phillipps said that Daniel was excited to spend time with Paul and believed that he could help him with his grief. He continued, \\"I think Daniel is really happy to just be settled for a while because he is road-tripping. Paul has been grieving over Kate's death, so they are a really good match for each other right now. Their relationship is really strong.\\" Dennis asked for Paul and Daniel's first scene to be rewritten as he wanted to establish their strong relationship from the beginning. The original script saw Paul failing to recognise his nephew. Dennis took his worries to the writers who agreed to change the scenes. Phillipps stated that Paul and Daniel have \\"a great uncle and nephew relationship\\" and thought they were a good pairing, as they both wanted to be good influences on each other. He explained that Daniel initially believed his uncle was beloved by the community, but he slowly realised that a lot of people do not like Paul. Daniel decided to stay in Erinsborough and try and redeem his uncle. He told Ellis, \\"Daniel finds it bizarre that Paul isn't well liked, because he is all about the love!\\" As Daniel bonded with his uncle, Paul invited him to move into his penthouse apartment. They clashed a little, due to Daniel's different outlook on life. He values relationships over material possessions, which is an odd concept to Paul. Daniel also picked up some shifts in Paul's hotel, but Phillipps pointed out that it was to keep his uncle happy. Daniel found the job too restricting to stay there forever. Phillipps has said that he enjoyed working with Dennis again, following their previous storyline together in 2007. He thought that it was an interesting piece of writing, saying that if Paul was going to imagine someone, it makes sense that the guy looks like his nephew. When Paul suffered a public meltdown due to his grief over Kate's death, Daniel was there to comfort him while he broke down. However, the situation proved too much for Daniel and he had to call in Karl Kennedy (Alan Fletcher), hoping that his uncle would receive the medical and psychological help he needed. Phillipps later said that helping Paul was \\"a pretty tough ask\\" for Daniel and while he thinks of himself as kind of therapist to people, the situation was \\"pretty extreme\\". Phillipps added that the storyline presented \\"an interesting dynamic\\" for the pair. Amber Turner During a behind-the-scenes video posted by Neighbours, Phillipps hinted that Daniel could find romance with established character Amber Turner (Jenna Rosenow), who was in a relationship with Josh Willis (Harley Bonner) at the time. Phillipps later said that Daniel and Amber would become friends, as they bond over their shared love for photography. When Josh began to worry about Daniel's intentions towards his girlfriend, Daniel was \\"able to put Josh at ease\\". He and Amber were honest about their connection and passed it off as platonic love. A few weeks later, Amber and Daniel almost shared a kiss, as she started to fall out of love with Josh. Rosenow explained that Amber was attracted to Daniel's caring side and liked how he noticed things about her that Josh never had. When it became difficult for them to be apart, they spent the afternoon together, which resulted in their near kiss. With Amber feeling guilty about betraying Josh, she decided to break-up with him, but when he made a romantic gesture, she found she could not go through with it. After Amber failed to break-up with Josh, Daniel tried to keep his distance from her. However, Paige Smith (Olympia Valance) had already noticed their growing closeness, so she kissed Daniel to prompt a reaction and work out what was truly going on with them. Amber was \\"gutted\\" when she witnessed the kiss and it caused her to give into her feelings for Daniel and they kissed. Daniel was left feeling guilty about Josh and Phillipps commented \\"He wants to be with Amber, but it's not in his nature to just walk all over people.\\" Phillipps liked that Daniel's first major storyline was a love triangle as it was \\"quite relatable\\" for everyone. He thought the reaction to it had been mixed, but there had been support for Amber and Daniel. A few weeks later, Josh walked in on Amber and Daniel kissing. Bonner told an Inside Soap reporter that Josh was devastated by the scene and did not want to hear Amber's apology. Josh eventually went to the penthouse to speak with Daniel and came close to hitting him. He then smashed up Amber and Daniel's darkroom, knowing that is where they had spent a lot of their time together. Phillipps confirmed that Amber and Daniel would stay together despite the fallout and that they would grow closer because of it. The couple were given the portmanteau Damber by fans and critics. When a tornado hit Erinsborough, Amber and Daniel decided to go out in it to take photographs. Prior to their departure, Daniel fells out with Paul after he told Amber about the origin of Daniel's tattoo, which he got while he was with his ex-girlfriend. As the weather became more severe, Amber and Daniel were caught up in the tornado and the roof of their car was ripped off. They sought shelter in the local garage and later rescued Paul, who came looking for them. Phillipps commented that the situation made Daniel see things clearly and he realised that he wanted to \\"take things to the next level\\" with Amber, so he proposed to her. Phillipps told All About Soap's Carena Crawford, \\"He's so happy when she says yes because its exactly what he wants. No matter what happens next, he'll never regret asking her to be his wife.\\" When Amber's parents refused to support the engagement, she decided to move out. Daniel asked her to move into the penthouse with him, but Paul vetoed the plan, so they briefly moved into Daniel's car instead. Phillipps joked that Daniel was \\"Mr Positive\\", so he did not let their living arrangements ruin his enthusiasm. Amber struggled with her new living conditions and eventually moved back home. In October 2014, Daniel's ex-girlfriend Rain Taylor (Airlie Dodds) was introduced, and the official website stated that she would cause \\"misery\\" for Daniel. Rain came to Erinsborough to establish a commune called New Eden. However, after befriending Amber, Rain began manipulating her into moving into the commune and giving up her university studies. Amber's mother, Lauren (Kate Kendall), came to Daniel and expressed her fears about Rain's influence on her daughter. Daniel then tried to tell Amber that she was being brainwashed by Rain, but she refused to listen to him. Rain later questioned why Daniel and Amber were together and kissed Daniel in a bid to show him that his relationship with Amber was wrong. When Amber asked Rain for a meditation session, Rain used the opportunity to try and brainwash her into breaking up with Daniel. Rain's plan failed, but her influence left Amber questioning her relationship with Daniel and whether she should try to discover who she really is. When Daniel invited Amber to Queensland to meet his parents, she declined and instead ended their engagement. Shortly after Amber's car was stolen, Daniel came to her rescue, explaining that he sensed she was in trouble. Amber took this as a sign that they were meant to be together and they resumed their relationship. After they set a wedding date, Harold Bishop (Ian Smith), who was married to Daniel's grandmother Madge (Anne Charleston), returned to Erinsborough for the ceremony. He gave Daniel some advice about marriage, telling him to have \\"realistic expectations.\\" Phillipps thought that Daniel and Amber were rushing into marriage, but explained that the producers wanted the wedding to air as part of the show's 30th anniversary in March 2015. He thought they should have waited another year. Phillipps also admitted that he did not think Amber and Daniel were well suited, saying \\"they are very easygoing people and I am not sure if that creates the best sparks.\\" On the day of his wedding, Daniel decided to be \\"a hopeless romantic\\" and try to get Amber an antique ring from a well that belonged to his ancestor. Phillipps explained that Amber had been obsessing about the love story connected to the ring and Daniel wanted to give it to her on their wedding day. Daniel and Imogen climbed into the well, but the ladder gave way, trapping them down there and forcing Daniel to miss his wedding. While Daniel worried about Amber, she assumed that he had run off with Imogen. After a few days, Josh worked out where Daniel and Imogen were, and they were rescued, leading to a reconciliation between Daniel and Amber. Shortly afterwards, Amber discovered she was pregnant, forcing her to admit to Daniel that she had a one-night stand with Josh. Rosenow commented that it was not \\"an ideal situation\\" and that Amber hoped the baby was Daniel's, as she wanted their relationship to work. Amber later took a paternity test and Daniel assured her that no matter what the result was, he would support her. However, Daniel was \\"devastated\\" when Josh was confirmed to be the father. He tried \\"to put a brave face on things\\", but soon realised that he could not support Amber and the baby financially. This gave Josh an opportunity to try and prove himself to Amber, hoping she would come back to him. But Daniel sold some shares in Off Air to lessen his financial troubles. As their relationship became more strained, Daniel attempted to \\"get things back on track\\" with a romantic gesture. But they soon realised that too much had changed and decided to break-up. Imogen Willis Digital Spy's Daniel Kilkelly noticed a connection between Daniel and Imogen in their first scenes together and Phillipps told him that something could happen between them in the future. He continued, \\"Imogen gets into twists and gets very worked up about things and Daniel just doesn't get it. He finds it really funny and thinks that Imogen is super sweet. He doesn't get why she finds stuff so frustrating, but he really loves that about her as well.\\" Daniel and Imogen clashed again when she dropped her birthday dress after he ran into her on his skateboard. Daniel bought her a new dress, but it was too big for Imogen and she refused to accept it. Later that day, Imogen accidentally crushed Daniel's skateboard during a driving lesson, but Daniel believed it was her way of getting revenge for the dress. Imogen developed feelings for Daniel after they teamed up for a community project. Phillipps commented that Daniel and Imogen had developed \\"a great chummy friendship\\", so he thought Daniel would be surprised to learn that Imogen has feelings for him. When Daniel comforted an upset Imogen, she leaned in and kissed him. While Daniel was shocked by the kiss, Imogen tried to convince him that it was \\"a brain snap and nothing more\\". Daniel then had to choose whether to tell Amber about the kiss or not. Following his break-up with Amber, Daniel had to assure Imogen that it was nothing to do with their kiss. She then tried to convince Daniel to work things out with Amber, but his \\"unwavering confidence in their love\\" had been knocked. Kaplan expressed her wish for Imogen and Daniel to become a couple, saying \\"I have wanted them to be together from the start. I think they balance each other out and Daniel brings out the best in Imogen, so I'm always hoping that it happens secretly!\\" Phillipps later admitted that Daniel and Imogen were better suited than Daniel and Amber. He thought they should get together and hoped the writers had noticed that there was a demand for them to be a couple on social media sites. On the day of his wedding, Imogen told Daniel that she was in love with him. Phillipps commented that Daniel took Imogen's confession on board and just went with it. However, after they became trapped in a well, things became awkward between them and they talked it through. Phillipps quipped \\"poor little Imogen gets let down gently yet again.\\" Both Daniel and Imogen thought they would be found quickly, but when someone shut the grill and water was pumped into the well, they realised that they might die down there. However, they were eventually rescued and Phillipps joked that he was relieved that he still had a job. He added that he enjoyed working on the storyline with Kaplan. When Daniel and Amber ended their relationship for a second time, an Inside Soap columnist noted that Daniel was \\"understandably\\" upset by the break up. In an effort to cheer Daniel up, Imogen suggested a day out at a local nature reserve. Daniel thanked Imogen with a kiss, after realising his feelings for her. However, Imogen did not react well as she was unsure if Daniel actually liked her, or she was just his \\"rebound girl\\". Daniel eventually convinced Imogen that he reciprocated her feelings and loved her as much as she loved him. After consummating their relationship, Paul saw them together and was \\"thrilled that his nephew has found happiness\\". Despite Imogen wanting to keep the relationship a secret, Paul told her mother Terese (Rebekah Elmaloglou) and Susan Kennedy (Jackie Woodburne). Daniel was invited to lunch with the Willis family and he tried his best to impress Terese, but soon realised that it was Imogen's father, Brad (Kip Gamblin), that he needed approval from. Daniel's efforts to impress Brad went wrong when he caused \\"an unsettling incident\\" that suddenly ended the lunch. =Dakota Davies' manipulation= When Paul's former lover Dakota Davies (Sheree Murphy) came to town, Daniel became embroiled in her plan to get revenge on Paul and smuggle diamonds into Australia. Dakota convinced Paul to finance a bar for her and she then set out \\"to ingratiate herself with an impressionable Daniel\\". Noting Paul's love for his nephew, Dakota offered Daniel the managers job at the bar and he accepted after being persuaded by Paul. They were both unaware that Dakota was planning on setting up Daniel as \\"the perfect front-man\\" for their plan. When Daniel was tasked with signing for several shipments of coffee beans, Mark Brennan (Scott McGregor) realised that he was being set up. Shortly before a planned police raid was carried out on the bar, Brennan learned that Daniel was meant to sign for another delivery containing smuggled diamonds, so he told Amber's father, Constable Matt Turner (Josef Brown) in the hope that he could help. Matt then detained Daniel for jaywalking, while the raid went ahead, which infuriated him. Daniel and Amber initially believed that Matt was trying to \\"punish\\" them both for the engagement, but they eventually thanked him when he explained that he was only protecting Daniel. =Personality change= In December 2015, Daniel Kilkelly (Digital Spy) revealed plans for Daniel's \\"good-natured\\" personality to change as he turned away from his hippy ideals. Daniel changed his look and became more career- driven. Of the changes to Daniel's personality, Phillipps explained: \\"I think it's an important change that had to happen for Daniel's development. He's always been a positive person, and I don't think that goes away in this storyline. But Daniel has been under Paul's guidance for a long time now. It's made him start to understand some really important life messages about how sometimes you've got to take more risks, be more ruthless and push a little harder. It's all part of Daniel's evolution as a character.\\" Phillipps told Kilkelly that he spoke to the writers about giving Daniel \\"more status\\" within the community and believed that making him more career-driven would be a good way for him to gain respect from other characters. The actor also believed that viewers would find Daniel more interesting, but added that his positive attitude would still be there. Daniel began working at Lassiter's Hotel, following his brief stint in real estate sales. He already knew the hotel business from working alongside Paul. Daniel's new attitude and career change was marked by a new haircut. Phillipps had chosen to shave his hair off, so the writers incorporated his new style into the storyline. Phillipps added that he would not like to see Daniel become a copy of his uncle, but he did want Daniel to be \\"strong-willed and street smart\\" like him. =Departure= On 16 April 2016, Daniel Kilkelly and Sophie Dainty of Digital Spy confirmed Daniel would be leaving the show, alongside Imogen on 26 April. Phillipps told Sarah Ellis of Inside Soap that it was not his decision to leave Neighbours, and that producers had chosen to write out Daniel so he and Imogen could go together. He explained, \\"So much negative stuff had happened that the show wanted something positive to come out of it – so with Imogen going, the only real option was for Daniel to go, too.\\" After Imogen is offered a job in Los Angeles, Daniel is \\"thrilled\\" for her and feels like something positive has come along at the right time, following the death of her brother. When they realise that in order for Daniel to go with her, they would need a spouse visa, so Daniel proposes. Daniel and Imogen attempt to get married in secret, but Imogen's parents find out and organise a wedding at Number 22. Phillipps said, \\"I think the writers also wanted to create a parallel with Daniel leaving Ramsay Street after getting married, just like his parents Scott and Charlene did.\\" He added that there was possibility Daniel could return to Erinsborough in the future, especially as he had to fix his relationship with Paul. Storylines While on a road trip, Daniel comes to Erinsborough and sets up camp at Lassiter's Lake. Imogen Willis asks him to move on, but when she finds he has not, she brings Paul Robinson to ask him instead. Paul is happy to see his nephew and asks him to stay. Daniel agrees after seeing how unpopular and lonely his Uncle Paul has become. He starts working at Lassiter's Hotel and he also clashes with Imogen again. Daniel bonds with Amber Turner over their shared love of photography, and Daniel assures her boyfriend, Josh, that they have a platonic connection. However, both Amber and Daniel develop feelings for each other and soon begin an affair. Josh becomes suspicious and finds Daniel and Amber kissing in their dark room. Daniel asks Amber to move in with him, but she feels it is too soon. When Amber and Daniel get caught up in a tornado that hits Erinsborough when they go out to photograph it. Despite arguing beforehand, Daniel proposes to Amber and she accepts. Imogen and Daniel bond when they care for an orphaned wombat. Daniel finds himself being manipulated by Dakota Davies, who installs him as manager of her new bar. She asks Daniel to sign for a shipment of coffee beans containing diamonds, but Matt Turner detains Daniel for jaywalking so he is not arrested during a police raid on the bar. When Amber's parents and Paul do not support the engagement, Amber and Daniel move into his car. Amber returns home after the car is attacked. Daniel's ex-girlfriend, Rain Taylor, arrives in town to set up a commune called New Eden. Rain tries to manipulate Amber into breaking up with Daniel, before she is driven out of town. While Daniel is comforting Imogen, she kisses him. She apologises and tells him it was a mistake. Amber realises that she wants to discover who she is and refuses to Daniel's invite to meet his parents, ending their engagement. Daniel opens the Off Air bar. Josh competes with Daniel for Amber, while she learns about the kiss with Imogen. After Amber's car is stolen, Daniel comes to her rescue and they renew their engagement. Harold Bishop visits and admits to having reservations about Amber and the wedding, causing Daniel to rescind his invitation. Paul also tries to stop Daniel from getting married by inviting Des Clarke (Paul Keane) to talk to him about his failed first wedding. On the day of the wedding, Daniel tries to persuade Imogen to attend, but she admits that she is in love with him. Daniel learns the whereabouts of Agnes Robinson's ring and Imogen goes with him to retrieve it from an old well. They become trapped in the well after the ladder breaks, causing Daniel to miss the wedding. The situation in the well grows worse when Imogen's asthma makes it hard for her to breathe and water is pumped in. Josh manages to work out where they are, leading to their rescue. Amber and Daniel reunite, and Amber learns she is pregnant. Amber admits that she had a one-night stand with Josh and a DNA test shows he is the father. Daniel tries to support Amber financially and sells some of his Off Air shares to Karl Kennedy. He and Amber later break-up. Daniel helps Paul to reunite with his estranged daughter Amy Williams (Zoe Cramond). He also kisses Imogen, but she rejects him, fearing that he might be on the rebound. Daniel becomes jealous when she starts dating Caspar Smythe (Barton Welch) and his feelings for her clear. Imogen and Daniel begin a relationship and he supports her when her parents separate. Daniel moves in with the Brennan brothers at Number 24. He runs a suspended coffee scheme at Off Air, which leads to him being attacked by a homeless man who misinterprets Daniel's attempt to wake him. Daniel refuses to report the man, but he is clearly affected by the incident and displays unusual behaviour. He later takes his anger out on Aaron Brennan (Matt Wilson). Off Air is closed when Daniel struggles to keep up with the payments, and Paul refuses to give him a loan. Daniel finds Aaron and Nate Kinski (Meyne Wyatt) searching through Paul's personal computer files, and they find Paul's plans for a housing estate surrounding Erinsborough High. Daniel sends all the files to the media. Daniel sells one of the houses from the estate, and Paul gives him a job as a salesman. Imogen voices her concerns about Daniel's changing behaviour, after he convinces Nate to buy a house knowing that certain amenities will not be built. Imogen tells Nate the truth and she and Daniel break up. Daniel also falls out with Paul when he admits to leaking Paul's files to the media. Daniel sees Paul receiving a loan from Dimato for Paul's new business venture. Paul tells Daniel to leave town, which he does without revealing what he knows. He returns with a new hair cut and wants to work at Lassiter's again. Julie Quill agrees to employ him. Daniel and Imogen eventually get back together, but when he works extra hours, she becomes dissatisfied and develops feelings for Tyler. She admits this to Daniel, who decides they take a break and be free to date other people, despite Imogen insisting she would never have acted on her attraction to Tyler. Josh tries to convince Daniel to reconsider the break-up, but Daniel responds by criticising him for his failures as a father, before the hotel boiler explodes, trapping them both under a column. Despite knowing the column is the only thing keeping him from haemorrhaging to death, Josh asks Karl to lift it to save Daniel. Imogen tells Daniel that Josh died to save him, and they reunite. Daniel is discharged after undergoing surgery. Imogen receives a job offer in Los Angeles and she accepts. Daniel offers to quit his job and go with her. When Imogen mentions spouses can apply for a visa, Daniel proposes and she accepts. Daniel's younger sister Madison Robinson (Sarah Ellen) arrives to check up on him on behalf of their parents. A judge grants Daniel and Imogen an expedited marriage license and they decide to marry in secret. However, Imogen's parents interrupt the ceremony and convince Daniel and Imogen to get married at their home in front of their family and friends. After the wedding, Daniel and Imogen leave Erinsborough for Brisbane to see Daniel's parents, before going to Los Angeles, where Daniel enrols in a university to study nursing. Reception For his portrayal of Daniel, Phillipps was nominated for Best Daytime Star at the Inside Soap Awards. The Sydney Morning Herald's Ben Pobjie observed that Daniel's introduction was one of the \\"most mildly anticipated events\\" in the show's history and that the character provided a link to the show's past. But he was not keen on his personality, saying \\"Daniel Robinson is a handsome young thing, whose good looks more than make up for the fact he's an incredibly irritating hippie tosser.\\" Dianne Butler, writing for news.com.au, branded Daniel \\"a gorgeous blond vision\\" and suspected he had been introduced in a bid to increase ratings. A Soap World writer thought that Daniel was \\"idealistic and naive\\". An Inside Soap columnist observed that the chemistry between Amber and Daniel was \\"undeniable\\". Laura Morgan of All About Soap believed Amber was better suited to Daniel than Josh, as she had \\"way better chemistry\\" with him. Morgan said, \\"from the minute she clapped eyes on Scott and Charlene's sexy son, it was clear they were going to get it on. It definitely didn't take them long either.\\" During a review of the year, Digital Spy's Daniel Kilkelly praised Phillipps for being \\"a strong actor\\" and said he deserved \\"a chance to shine\\" as Daniel in the new year. Kilkelly bemoaned the lack of challenging storylines for him and hoped he would be given something more to do that did not revolve around his relationship with Amber. When Daniel got stuck in the well, an Inside Soap columnist quipped \\"What kind of idiot thinks that climbing down a well an hour before his wedding is a good idea?

Today this often takes place via social networks such as LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, and Pinterest, but can take place either online or offline. Examples of social selling techniques include sharing relevant content, interacting directly with potential buyers and customers, personal branding, and social listening. Social Selling is gaining popularity in a variety of industries, though it is used primarily for B2B (business-to-business) selling or highly considered consumer purchases (e.g., financial advisory services, automotive, realty). C2C companies (often referred to as direct selling companies) have been using social selling techniques (i.e. relationship building) since far before the Internet existed. B2B and B2C companies are now adopting many of those techniques as they are translated to social media platforms. While social selling is sometimes confused with social marketing, there are two key differences. First, social selling is focused on sales professionals, rather than marketing professionals. Second, social selling aims to cultivate one-on-one relationships, rather than broadcast one-to-many messages. Overview The University of British Columbia first established the science of social selling during research. They found that where there are incidental similarities between a buyer and seller, it is more likely a purchase would take place. For example, if two people follow the same sports team, they are more likely to feel a connection. The use of social technology can be used to discover incidental similarities and thus creating a quicker bond with the potential client. Whilst the University of British Columbia discovered the science, it was Nigel Edelshain who was first to put the science into practice and coined the term sales 2.0. The name came from the web 2.0 development in 2006. Edelshain suggested in an interview that he felt the biggest problem with selling was regarding the prospecting phase. The reason is many sales techniques during the 1990s and early 2000s often could only be put into practice once a salesman had contact or was in a meeting. Following the development of sales 2.0, the buzzword social selling emerged. Social selling has become more popular since companies have looked to increase their return on investment of social media interaction. Sales teams within organizations frequently mine data from social media that may help them connect to customers in order to create a more genuine sales lead. The technique frequently focuses on approaching potential clients in a less direct way, meaning they don't interrupt their daily lives with cold calls and hard sells. Koka Sexton was interviewed and spoke about how salespeople can use social media to leverage their connections to gather insights and build relationships. Sexton stated that the art of social selling is said to speed up many sales processes, while also improving relationships. Arguments for and against Supporters advocate for social selling as a necessary and effective response to a changing selling environment. They argue that, while sales professionals still impact the path to purchase, they are no longer able to personally manage the buying process. These advocates cite a Corporate Executive Board (CEB) study that reports almost 60% of today's buying process is complete before the buyer reaches out to sales.Adamson, Brent and Matthew Dixon and Nicholas Toman (July 2012), \\"The End of Solution Sales\\" Harvard Business Review. Retrieved 28, November 2014. To show effectiveness, supporters point to an Aberdeen Group study finding that social sellers outperform other sales professionals across a range of key performance indicators (KPIs).Ostrow, Peter (February 2013, \\"Social Selling: Leveraging the Power of User-Generated Content to Optimize Sales Results\\", Aberdeen Group. Retrieved 28, November 2014. The most common criticism is that \\"social selling\\" is an overhyped buzzword rather than a true sales methodology. Detractors argue that in-person meetings are still more effective than social networking for cultivating relationships, and that social networking should complement, not replace, traditional sales activity.Weinberg, Mike (September 2014), \\"Are You Tired of the Social Selling Hype and Being Told Everything has Changed?\\", The New Sales Coach. Retrieved 1, December 2014. Components Social prospecting involves monitoring and/or searching social networks for signs of customer interest, immediate buying intent, or qualified prospect status based on industry, role, geography, etc. For example, a financial advisor may monitor social media for major life events (e.g., birth of a child, change in employment status, retirement, death of a parent) that correlate to a need for investment advice. Similarly, B2B outbound sales professionals frequently search LinkedIn for individuals matching their target buyer profiles.Hibma, Maggie (September 2013), \\"Got 5 Minutes? Use it to Find a New Prospect on Social Media\\", Hubspot Marketing Blog. Retrieved 1, December 2014. Personal branding is the use of social media to establish an individual's reputation and credibility. Typically this is done through the creation of compelling personal profiles that showcase a sales professional's expertise, credibility, and integrity. Personal branding also involves highlighting of personal information (e.g., education background, personal interests, religious affiliation, nonprofit activity) to find common ground with potential buyers and channel partners.Clay, Kelly (January 2014), \\"Personal Branding Secrets from Social Media Superstars\\", Forbes. Retrieved 2, December 2014. Employee advocacy is when sales professionals or other staff leverage their own social presence to share positive news, stories, and insights about their company with their networks.Donkor, Ben (September 2014), \\"A Kickstart Guide to Employee Advocacy on Social Media\\", Link Humans. Retrieved 2, December 2014. This includes sharing content, responding to questions, connecting with industry leaders, and using industry- and company- related hashtags. While some companies give employees the license to create and promote their own content, many companies establish guidelines, or even supply appropriate content to employees. Social relationship management is the use of digital networks as channels for nurturing ongoing relationships with customers. Social relationship management – sometimes referred to as social CRM - is an extension of traditional relationship management that focuses on communication and feedback with customers vis-a-vis social media. Social Relationship Management tactics include listening and responding to customer feedback online, and re-posting user-generated content regarding company. Social Relationship Management emphasizes authentic and genuine connections, and directly engaging with stakeholders in online conversations.Andzulis, James \\"Mick and Nikolaos G. Panagopoulos and Adam Rap (summer 2012), \\"[A Review of Social Media and Implications for the Sales Process \\", Journal of Personal Selling & Sales Management 32:3, pg.305-316. Retrieved 2, December 2014. Finding the right people is another fundamental pillar towards applying social selling. Due to the evolution of sales and marketing, the buying committee has shifted to having 6.8 people involved on average. Therefore, it becomes crucial to get to know those people to start influencing and building sustainable and long-term relationships with them. Measurement There are at least three distinct methods for measuring social selling and social selling effectiveness. Social Selling Index (SSI) is a score created by LinkedIn to rank a members' use of LinkedIn as a social selling tool. The SSI is based on four criteria: Creating a professional brand, finding the right people, engaging with insights, and building strong relationships. Each criterion is assigned a value from 1-25, and the four numbers are totaled for an overall SSI score. Strengths of this method include its multi-dimensional methodology and relative clarity on the criteria used. The SSI is limited by its exclusive focus on LinkedIn (as opposed to other social networks), and its focus on activity (as opposed to impact or outcomes). However, LinkedIn asserts that high SSI professionals generate 45% more opportunities per quarter. Klout Score quantifies an individual's social influence by analyzing the social graph's response to content posted by the individual. Also based on a 1-100 ranking score, Klout differs from the Social Selling Index in two key ways. First, it looks across social networks for its measurement. Second, it looks at impact (rather than activity) by analyzing social gestures such as following, retweeting, liking, favoriting, etc. Critics of the Klout Score claim that social gestures (following, liking, and favoriting, etc.) are superficial actions, and insufficiently meaningful to serve as accurate or reliable indicators of true influence. Also, the application of Klout score to a sales context is merely indirect, given that Klout is designed to be an influence metric rather than a sales metric per se. Revenue Attribution is a technique employed by some sales organizations (e.g., ADP, CBIZ, Prudential) to measure social selling effectiveness. These companies explicitly identify new deals sourced or influenced by social, using the value of those deals to quantify the success of social selling. The revenue attribution method has the benefit of linking social selling to specific deals won. However, revenue attribution tends to be more complex to track, requiring manual data capture and/or customization to Customer Relationship Management systems where sales data is captured and analyzed. In an enterprise Enterprises are becoming increasingly involved in implementing social selling at the enterprise level. According to IBM, the company that integrates social media into their business model, is one that embraces and cultivates a spirit of collaboration and community throughout its organization—both internally and externally.IBM Software, \\"IBM Solutions for Social Selling \\", 2012. Retrieved 2, December 2014. IBM piloted a social selling program in 2012 that is widely regarded as one of the most successful, early examples of effective social selling at the enterprise level.Weigler, Miranda (October 2012), \\"Revolutionizing Social Selling the IBM Way\\", CEB Blog. Retrieved 29, November 2014.\\"IBM's Social Selling: The Computer Giant Finds B2B Leads in Social Media\\"\\", Chief Marketer. January 2012. Retrieved 29, November 2014. According to the Social Selling Maturity Model, a prevalent theory on social selling, there are a variety of ways enterprises engage social. These stages include allowing employees to use social media at will, enacting general policies, training employees on effective use, and deploying software designed to improve the social selling process.Idinopulos, Michael (November 2014), \\"The Social Selling Maturity Model\\", PeopleLinx Social Selling Blog. Retrieved 4, December 2014. Enabling social selling within enterprise is a journey and very few enterprises have succeeded. The success of the social- centered selling depends on adoption of program for which an organization needs to follow a structured approach. Enterprise social selling framework defines the 3 phases of social selling program which if followed properly can assure the maximum out of the social selling program. The following defines the 3 phases of the Enterprise social selling framework. PreLaunch Phase: The prelaunch phase includes all the planning activities related to launch the program which includes defining the Key performance indicators (KPIs) of the program, understanding and bench marking the digital presence of audience, creating the buzz around the program to excite the participants, enabling the CRM system to track the leads generated from social selling which will help measure the ROI of the program. It also includes communicating benefits of program to participants. Execution Phase: The execution phase includes on-boarding the participants to digital platforms by enabling creation of their profiles, coaching the participants on publishing content, identifying prospect, and finally approaching / engaging with prospects. Post Launch Phase: The post-launch phase includes the activities to support the participants adopt the program by provisioning the relevant content, queries resolution. This phase also includes tracking the benefits of the program by reporting the leads generated from social selling, evaluating the Key performance indicators (KPIs) defined in the prelaunch phase and communicating these benefits to the management. Salesforce.com stated in an article that social selling could work in parallel with traditional sales techniques in order to further increase conversions. The Salesforce example looked at senior sales managers and their strategic approach to selling. If a sales director understands that he wins business when there is a significant change, such as a sudden expansion or contraction, he will do everything in order to monitor companies in this position. Social selling can be used in this scenario. A salesman can use saved searches to look for trigger phrases in social media, such as Twitter. He can also comment on industry blogs, and keep an eye on LinkedIn for new job openings and breaking news. This information collectively helps the salesman understand when a sales opportunity is available. This could be seen as an initial step before selling takes place, as the salesman will already be involved in the conversation, ensuring the lead isn't cold.

Biography  His father was a military engineer and he attended the Petersburg Electrotechnical Institute. In 1896, he was arrested for revolutionary activities and imprisoned for several months. After being released, he was allowed to graduate, then exiled to Siberia. He was sent to work at The Lena Goldfields (later the site of the infamous Lena massacre), near Bodaybo.\\"Ya.M.Gakkel. The designer of the first Soviet diesel locomotives\\" @ Innovation Digest. While there, he participated in the construction of hydroelectric facilities and helped wire the goldfields with one of Russia's first high-voltage power lines. When he returned from exile in 1903, he became a teacher at the Institute and was involved in the construction of the Saint Petersburg Tramway. Six years later, he received an award from the Westinghouse Electric company that allowed him to begin developing his first airplane, the Gakkel-I. That same year, he was one of the founders of Russia's first airplane construction company, the \\"Pоссии авиастроительное предприятие С.С. Щетинин\\" ( Russian Association of Aeronautics), named after one of its major backers.Brief biography from the History of Aviation and Aeronautics @ Aviaschool. The Gakkel-VII On May 24, 1910, the Gakkel-III made a 200-meter (656 ft) flight; the first by an airplane of entirely Russian design and construction. In 1911, the Gakkel-VII made a round-trip flight between Saint Petersburg and Tsarskoye Selo at an average speed of 92km/h (57 mph) and set a height record of 1250m (4101 ft). Through 1924, he designed over a dozen airplanes; ten of which were built and six of which were able to fly. Although he pioneered some types of designs (including an amphibious aircraft, the Gakkel-V, which never flew) and set several records, none of his airplanes were mass-produced due to poor performance at crucial moments. In 1912, two of his prototypes (the Gakkel-VIII and Gakkel-IX) were destroyed by a mysterious fire. After that, he withdrew from active participation in the work of the Association. In 1938, he expressed his regrets at having done so in a letter to the pilot and Soviet hero, Mikhail Vodopyanov. Many years later, it was rumored that agents from the Dux Factory had bribed his mechanics to sabotage his engines during competitions for military contracts by pouring sulfuric acid into them. The Щэл1 diesel locomotive During World War I, he helped design lightweight batteries for submarines. In the late 1920s, after a final attempt to involve the government in producing his aircraft, his interests turned to locomotive design. In August, 1924, working in conjunction with the Baltic Shipyard and the Putilov Plant, he designed the first Russian-made diesel locomotive, the Щэл1. (The Ээл2, a slightly earlier model designed by Yury Lomonosov, was made in Germany). In 1934, he designed steam tractors and steam devices for riverboats. After 1936, he was a teacher at the Leningrad Institute of Railway Engineers. In 1940, he was awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labour. Hardships suffered during the German blockade seriously damaged his health and he died in 1945. His son, Yakov, was a prominent oceanographer. His daughter Ekaterina (1903-1984) followed him into the field of locomotive engineering and became one of the first women in Russia to be named to a technology-related professorship.

History The halt was opened by the Great Western Railway on 27 September 1937 on its line from branch from to . The route had first opened as a tramroad in 1824 by the Monmouthshire Railway and Canal Company before being converted to a railway in 1855. It became part of the Great Western Railway in 1880 and remained there at the Grouping of 1923. The station was situated to the north- east of Six Bells Colliery which was served by a network of sidings which remained in use until 30 November 1980. The line was four-tracked to the south of Six Bells Halt narrowing to two lines going through the station beyond which was a loop serving two small collieries. The 35-lever Cwmnantygroes signal box, which lay to the north, was in use until 11 October 1964. The station was provided with an island platform reached via a footbridge. A private siding for J. Lancaster & Co. Ltd trailed off to the west; this was in use from 1891 to 1980. In 1947, two special trains for National Coal Board staff were running daily between Ebbw Vale and Six Bells. This attracted criticism in the House of Commons on the basis of the costs involved. Passenger services were withdrawn from the station on 30 April 1962. The line through the station was singled on 3 May 1971. The route was progressively shortened as collieries were closed, with the last section being taken out of use in 1989 after the closure of Six Bells Colliery. To the south of Six Bells Halt, there had been a previous station which served the colliery between July 1897 and July 1902. This was an untimetabled halt for the use of miners. Proposed re-opening In 2010 Sewta proposed to reopen the line through Six Bells Halt as part of a scheme which would see a new station at Abertillery with an hourly service to Cardiff. The estimated cost of extending the line to Abertillery was estimated at £16.7m according to Sewta. Part of the trackbed, which is owned by Blaenau Gwent Council, is used as a cycleway and there was thought to be sufficient space for a single track. However, after the scheme was omitted from the Welsh Government's National Transport Plan for funding priorities until 2015, Welsh Transport Minister Carl Sargeant AM confirmed that the new station would not be a priority until after 2015.

As a two-year-old in 2007 she was rated one of the best juvenile fillies in the United States, winning her first three races including the Matron Stakes before finishing second in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies. She was even more successful in her second season, winning four races including the Fair Grounds Oaks, Kentucky Oaks, Delaware Oaks and Alabama Stakes. She was retired from racing after a single unsuccessful appearance as a four-year-old. Background Proud Spell is a bay mare standing just under 15.3 hands high with a narrow white blaze bred in Kentucky by her owner Brereton C. Jones. She from the first crop of foals sired by Proud Citizen who won the Lexington Stakes and finished second to War Emblem in the 2002 Kentucky Derby. As a breeding stallion, Proud Citizen has also sire the Kentucky Oaks winner Believe You Can. Proud Spell was the first foal of her dam Pacific Spell who won two minor races from sixteen starts in 2002 and 2003. The filly was set into training with J. Larry Jones and was ridden in all of her races by Gabriel Saez. Racing career =2007: two-year-old season= Proud Spell made her track debut in a maiden race over five furlongs at Delaware Park Racetrack on July 30, 2007. Starting at odds of 5.2/1, she took the lead in the straight and won by half a length from her stablemate Sheriff's Choice. In the White Clay Creek Stakes over six furlongs at the same track in August she started favorite and won by five lengths from Extra Sexy Psychic after taking the lead a furlong out. Proud Spell was then moved up in class to contest the Grade II Matron Stakes over seven furlongs at Belmont Park on September 15. Starting the 1.7/1 favorite against six opponents she raced in fifth place before switching to the outside in the straight and drawing away in the stretch to win by four and quarter lengths from Armonk. After the race, Larry Jones commented \\"We've been able to bring her along at a natural progression with distances. With her running style, she likes to come from off the pace, so we're not expecting two turns to be a major problem. She's come home quick in every race, and most of the time, under a hand ride. We haven't asked her to do a whole lot. More than likely, the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies will be our next start.\\" Saez, who was winning his first major race, said \\"It feels pretty good. This is a very nice filly. She relaxed great and finished up when I asked her to run. I'm excited about the Breeders' Cup\\". On October 27, Proud Spell contested the twenty-fourth edition of the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies, run that year at Monmouth Park and was made the 9.4/1 third favorite in a thirteen-runner field. She raced in third place before moving into second in the straight and finished three and a half lengths behind the wire-to-wire winner Indian Blessing. =2008: three-year- old season= Proud Spell began her second season in the Silverbulletday Stakes over one and one sixteenth miles at Fair Grounds Race Course on February 9. She raced in fifth place before finishing strongly and finished strongly to take second place, a length behind Indian Blessing. Over the same course and distance on March 8, Proud Spell faced Indian Blessing for the third time in the Grade II Fair Ground Oaks. Starting the 1.9/1 second favorite in a four-runner field, she tracked Indian Blessing before taking the lead in the straight and winning by two and a quarter lengths. On April 5 Proud Spell was moved back up to Grade I class for the Ashland Stakes (a major trial race for the Kentucky Oaks) on the Polytrack surface at Keeneland. She started the 1.9/1 second favorite, but after starting awkwardly she finished third, beaten a neck and to and a half lengths by Little Belle and Bsharpsonata. On May 2, 2008, Proud Spell contested the 134th edition of the Kentucky Oaks on a sloppy track at Churchill Downs. Jones had entered both Proud Spell and Eight Belles in the race but opted to run the latter filly in the Kentucky Derby. In a ten-runner field for the Oaks, Proud Spell was made the 3.4/1 favorite ahead of Country Star (Alcibiades Stakes), Pure Clan, Little Belle and Bsharpsonata. Saez settled the favorite behind the leader Bsharpsonata before moving up on the outside to take the lead in the straight. She drew away from her opponents in the closing stages to win by five lengths, with Little Belle taking second ahead of Pure Clan. Larry Jones explained that the filly had been unsuited by the synthetic surface at Keeneland and added \\"We were very fortunate with this filly because she has never been passed in her career. We felt like if we can run the speed down, she would be in good shape. This filly can run all day long. She is just a quality filly\\" Brereton Jones, described the winning jockey as \\"one of the up-and-coming young riders in the country. He's fearless; nothing bothers him\\". On the following day Eight Belles, ridden by Saez, was fatally injured when finishing second in the Derby. On her next appearance, Proud Spell started the odds-on favorite when matched against Godolphin Racing's filly Music Note in the Grade I Mother Goose Stakes over nine furlongs at Belmont on June 28. The filly stumbled badly exiting the starting stalls and had a \\"rough trip\\", being blocked when attempting a forward move two furlong out. She finished second behind Music Note but was demoted to third place after hanging sharply to the right and hampering Never Retreat in the stretch. Larry Jones commented \\"from the beginning, it looked like it wasn't going to be our day. When we needed somewhere to go, we had nowhere to go. And when it was time to go, we weren't going\\". Proud Spell was then dropped in class to contest the Delaware Oaks on July 12 and started the 0.3/1 favorite against five opponents. Conceding at least six pounds to her rivals, she tracked the leader African Violet before taking the lead inside the final furlong and winning by three-quarters of a length. At Saratoga Race Course on August 16, Proud Spell was again matched against Music Note, who had won the CCA Oaks by eleven lengths since her win in the Mother Goose, in the Grade I Alabama Stakes over ten furlongs. Music Note, coupled in the betting with her stablemate Little Belle, started 9/10 favorite with Proud Spell next in the betting ahead of the outsiders Sweet Vendetta and Mushka. Little Belle set the early pace from Proud Spell and Mushka with Music Note in fourth. On the turn into the stretch Proud Spell took the lead but was soon challenged by Music Note on the outside. The two fillies raced together throughout the final furlong wit Proud Spell prevailing by a head. After the race, Larry Jones explained his instructions to the jockey \\"I told Gabriel, 'Do not let Music Note in front. I don't care if you have to ride her all the way to the barn area, down Nelson Avenue, or what, she don't get in front.' Because if you come up to her and eyeball her, you won't beat her. As soon as Music Note got to her, the race was on, and she dug in and found a way to out-gut her\\". Saez said that \\"when I got to the eighth pole, I had to push a little harder. When I saw Music Note come along side of us, I told my filly, 'C'mon, let's start running.' It was an exciting finish\\". On her next appearance, Proud Spell was assigned top weight of 124 pounds, but nevertheless started odds-on favorite for the Grade II Cotillion Handicap at Philadelphia Park on September 20. After tracking the leaders she was bumped when attempting to make a forward move in the straight and finished second, two and a half lengths behind the winner Seattle Smooth. After the race Brereton Jones announced that the filly would be rested before probably returning in 2009. He said that Saez had been given \\"a lesson in race riding\\" by the other jockeys in the Cotillion but added \\"I'm going to stick with him; he's a great kid and I think he's going to be a Hall of Fame jockey one day.\\" =2009: four-year-old season= Proud Spell remained in training as a four- year-old in 2009, making her first and only appearance in a minor race at Oaklawn Park on March 12. She started the 1/5 favorite but was beaten two and a half lengths by Superior Storm. She developed a leg infection after the race and her retirement was announced on April 13. Brereton Jones explained \\"The infection would not have caused her retirement were we not already thinking about retiring her. We had made the decision to race her this year, and we felt comfortable with that, but when she got the infection, it meant we couldn't make the Apple Blossom because she needed a work... So we retired her.\\" Assessment and awards In the 2007 Experimental Free Handicap Proud Spell was rated the third-best two-year-old filly in the United States. She was the highest-earning three-year-old filly of the year in the United States in 2008 and the eighth-highest money winner of any age or sex. In the Eclipse Awards for 2008, Proud Spell was named American Champion Three-Year-Old Filly. On receiving the award Brereton Jones said \\"No horse has ever passed her in the stretch during her entire racing career, and that's a big statement when you've been running against the best fillies in America\\" while The Blood-Horse described her as \\"one of the grittiest runners on the track today\\". In 2014 Proud Spell was inducted into Fair Grounds Race Course's local Hall of Fame. On accepting the award, Larry Jones said \\"Proud Spell had such perseverance. She always gave her all. I've always said you can learn as much about what makes good character from a horse as you can from other people, and Proud Spell was the perfect example of that\\". Breeding record Since her retirement from racing, Proud Spell has produced at least three foals: *Indian Spell, a dark bay or brown filly, foaled in 2010, sired by Indian Charlie, won two races including the Miss Woodford Stakes *Tiz Possible, bay filly, 2011, by Tiznow, unraced *Etruscan, dark bay or brown colt, 2012, by Bernardini, unplaced in two races (active in 2014) Pedigree References Category:2005 racehorse births Category:Racehorses bred in Kentucky Category:Racehorses trained in the United States Category:Kentucky Oaks winners Category:Thoroughbred family 4-m ","title":"Proud Spell"},{"id":"44612178","text":"Giorgio Leoni (born 4 September 1950) is a Sammarinese professional football manager.

When the Far North Line opened to Golspie in 1871, the 3rd Duke of Sutherland had purchased a small 2-4-0T from Kitson and Company for his private train. Named Dunrobin, it had driving wheels, outside cylinders, and weighed 21 tons in working order. On his succession, the 4th Duke decided to have a new locomotive built, and the original Dunrobin was sold to the Highland Railway in 1895. It was rebuilt in 1896 with a larger boiler and cylinders. The Highland Railway numbered it 118 and named it Gordon Castle for use on the Fochabers branch. Later it was renamed Invergordon and used as a shunter in that town, where it survived until just after the Grouping. The new Dunrobin Expo86, Vancouver, British Columbia in May 1986 The new Dunrobin was an 0-4-4T built by Sharp, Stewart & Co. (works no. 4085) in 1895 for the 4th Duke of Sutherland. It had driving wheels and inside cylinders. The 3rd Duke of Sutherland had a private station built as a condition of financing the extension of the railway from to , which opened in 1871. A further condition was that he should have running rights for a locomotive between Dunrobin Castle and . The original Dunrobin was a 2-4-0T built by Kitson & Co., Leeds for the 3rd Duke of Sutherland. It was replaced in 1895 by the new locomotive. Two railway carriages were constructed, which Dunrobin hauled to Inverness and were then attached to Highland Railway trains to convey the Duke to his destination. The carriages were a bogie saloon and a four-wheel saloon. Preservation In 1949, British Railways, Scottish Region revoked the Duke's running powers. He then sold the locomotive and coaches. The bogie saloon is now part of the National Railway Museum's collection. As of January 2011 it is under the care of the Scottish Railway Preservation Society at the Bo'ness and Kinneil Railway. Dunrobin and the four-wheel saloon were sold to Captain Howey and initially preserved as static exhibits at on the Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway in Kent. Following Howey's death in 1963, the locomotive and carriage were sold to Harold Foster, who had them transported to Canada. Foster was declared bankrupt in 1965, and the locomotive and carriage were bought for $15,000 by the Government of British Columbia. They became exhibits at Fort Steele heritage village, where Dunrobin was steamed occasionally. It was last steamed at Fort Steele in 2005. In 2010, both were declared surplus to requirements. It was announced in January 2011 that they had been bought by Beamish Museum, with the intention of restoring Dunrobin to working order.

The existence of the exponential map is one of the primary reasons that Lie algebras are a useful tool for studying Lie groups. The ordinary exponential function of mathematical analysis is a special case of the exponential map when G is the multiplicative group of positive real numbers (whose Lie algebra is the additive group of all real numbers). The exponential map of a Lie group satisfies many properties analogous to those of the ordinary exponential function, however, it also differs in many important respects. Definitions Let G be a Lie group and \\\\mathfrak g be its Lie algebra (thought of as the tangent space to the identity element of G). The exponential map is a map :\\\\exp\\\\colon \\\\mathfrak g \\\\to G which can be defined in several different ways. The typical modern definition is this: :Definition: The exponential of X\\\\in\\\\mathfrak g is given by \\\\exp(X) = \\\\gamma(1) where ::\\\\gamma\\\\colon \\\\mathbb R \\\\to G :is the unique one-parameter subgroup of G whose tangent vector at the identity is equal to X. It follows easily from the chain rule that \\\\exp(tX) = \\\\gamma(t). The map \\\\gamma may be constructed as the integral curve of either the right- or left- invariant vector field associated with X. That the integral curve exists for all real parameters follows by right- or left-translating the solution near zero. We have a more concrete definition in the case of a matrix Lie group. The exponential map coincides with the matrix exponential and is given by the ordinary series expansion: ::\\\\exp (X) = \\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty\\\\frac{X^k}{k!} = I + X + \\\\frac{1}{2}X^2 + \\\\frac{1}{6}X^3 + \\\\cdots, where I is the identity matrix. Thus, in the setting of matrix Lie groups, the exponential map is the restriction of the matrix exponential to the Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak g of G. =Comparison with Riemannian exponential map= If G is compact, it has a Riemannian metric invariant under left and right translations, and the Lie- theoretic exponential map for G coincides with the exponential map of this Riemannian metric. For a general G, there will not exist a Riemannian metric invariant under both left and right translations. Although there is always a Riemannian metric invariant under, say, left translations, the exponential map in the sense of Riemannian geometry for a left-invariant metric will not in general agree with the exponential map in the Lie group sense. That is to say, if G is a Lie group equipped with a left- but not right-invariant metric, the geodesics through the identity will not be one-parameter subgroups of G . =Other definitions= Other equivalent definitions of the Lie-group exponential are as follows: * It is the exponential map of a canonical left- invariant affine connection on G, such that parallel transport is given by left translation. That is, \\\\exp(X) = \\\\gamma(1) where \\\\gamma is the unique geodesic with the initial point at the identity element and the initial velocity X (thought of as a tangent vector). * It is the exponential map of a canonical right-invariant affine connection on G. This is usually different from the canonical left-invariant connection, but both connections have the same geodesics (orbits of 1-parameter subgroups acting by left or right multiplication) so give the same exponential map. * The Lie group–Lie algebra correspondence also gives the definition: for X in \\\\mathfrak g, t \\\\mapsto \\\\exp(tX) is the unique Lie group homomorphism corresponding to the Lie algebra homomorphism t \\\\mapsto tX. (note: \\\\operatorname{Lie}(\\\\mathbb{R}) = \\\\mathbb{R}.) Examples * The unit circle centered at 0 in the complex plane is a Lie group (called the circle group) whose tangent space at 1 can be identified with the imaginary line in the complex plane, \\\\\\\\{it:t\\\\in\\\\mathbb R\\\\\\\\}. The exponential map for this Lie group is given by * : it \\\\mapsto \\\\exp(it) = e^{it} = \\\\cos(t) + i\\\\sin(t),\\\\, : that is, the same formula as the ordinary complex exponential. * In the quaternions \\\\mathbb H, the set of quaternions of unit length form a Lie group (isomorphic to the special unitary group ) whose tangent space at 1 can be identified with the space of purely imaginary quaternions, \\\\\\\\{it+ju + kv :t, u, v\\\\in\\\\mathbb R\\\\\\\\}. The exponential map for this Lie group is given by * : \\\\mathbf{w} := (it+ju+kv) \\\\mapsto \\\\exp(it+ju+kv) = \\\\cos(\\\\mathbf{w})1 + \\\\sin(\\\\mathbf{w})\\\\frac{\\\\mathbf{w}}{\\\\mathbf{w}}.\\\\, : This map takes the 2-sphere of radius inside the purely imaginary quaternions to \\\\\\\\{s\\\\in S^3 \\\\subset \\\\mathbf{H}: \\\\operatorname{Re}(s) = \\\\cos(R)\\\\\\\\} , a 2-sphere of radius \\\\sin(R) (cf. Exponential of a Pauli vector). Compare this to the first example above. * Let V be a finite dimensional real vector space and view it as a Lie group under the operation of vector addition. Then \\\\operatorname{Lie}(V) = V via the identification of V with its tangent space at 0, and the exponential map ::\\\\operatorname{exp}: \\\\operatorname{Lie}(V) = V \\\\to V :is the identity map, that is, \\\\exp(v)=v. * In the split-complex number plane z = x + y \\\\jmath , \\\\quad \\\\jmath^2 = +1, the imaginary line \\\\lbrace \\\\jmath t : t \\\\in \\\\mathbb R \\\\rbrace forms the Lie algebra of the unit hyperbola group \\\\lbrace \\\\cosh t + \\\\jmath \\\\ \\\\sinh t : t \\\\in \\\\mathbb R \\\\rbrace since the exponential map is given by * :\\\\jmath t \\\\mapsto \\\\exp(\\\\jmath t) = \\\\cosh t + \\\\jmath \\\\ \\\\sinh t. Properties =Elementary properties of the exponential= For all X\\\\in\\\\mathfrak g, the map \\\\gamma(t) = \\\\exp(tX) is the unique one-parameter subgroup of G whose tangent vector at the identity is X. It follows that: * \\\\exp((t+s)X) = \\\\exp (tX)\\\\exp (sX)\\\\, * \\\\exp(-X) =\\\\exp (X)^{-1}.\\\\, More generally: * \\\\exp(X+Y)=\\\\exp(X)\\\\exp(Y),\\\\quad\\\\text{if }[X,Y]=0. It is important to emphasize that the preceding identity does not hold in general; the assumption that X and Y commute is important. The image of the exponential map always lies in the identity component of G. =The exponential near the identity= The exponential map \\\\exp\\\\colon \\\\mathfrak g \\\\to G is a smooth map. Its differential at zero, \\\\exp_{*}\\\\colon \\\\mathfrak g \\\\to \\\\mathfrak g, is the identity map (with the usual identifications). It follows from the inverse function theorem that the exponential map, therefore, restricts to a diffeomorphism from some neighborhood of 0 in \\\\mathfrak g to a neighborhood of 1 in G. Corollary 3.44 It is then not difficult to show that if G is connected, every element g of G is a product of exponentials of elements of \\\\mathfrak g: Corollary 3.47g=\\\\exp(X_1)\\\\exp(X_2)\\\\cdots\\\\exp(X_n),\\\\quad X_j\\\\in\\\\mathfrak g. Globally, the exponential map is not necessarily surjective. Furthermore, the exponential map may not be a local diffeomorphism at all points. For example, the exponential map from \\\\mathfrak{so}(3) to SO(3) is not a local diffeomorphism; see also cut locus on this failure. See derivative of the exponential map for more information. =Surjectivity of the exponential= In these important special cases, the exponential map is known to always be surjective: * G is connected and compact, Corollary 11.10 * G is connected and nilpotent (for example, G connected and abelian), and * G = GL_n(\\\\mathbb{C}). Exercises 2.9 and 2.10 For groups not satisfying any of the above conditions, the exponential map may or may not be surjective. The image of the exponential map of the connected but non-compact group SL2(R) is not the whole group. Its image consists of C-diagonalizable matrices with eigenvalues either positive or with modulus 1, and of non-diagonalizable matrices with a repeated eigenvalue 1, and the matrix -I. (Thus, the image excludes matrices with real, negative eigenvalues, other than -I.) Exercise 3.22 =Exponential map and homomorphisms= Let \\\\phi\\\\colon G \\\\to H be a Lie group homomorphism and let \\\\phi_{*} be its derivative at the identity. Then the following diagram commutes: Theorem 3.28 center In particular, when applied to the adjoint action of a Lie group G, since \\\\operatorname{Ad}_* = \\\\operatorname{ad}, we have the useful identity: Proposition 3.35\\\\mathrm{Ad}_{\\\\exp X}(Y)=\\\\exp(\\\\mathrm{ad}_X)(Y)=Y+[X,Y]+\\\\frac{1}{2!}[X,[X,Y +\\\\frac{1}{3!}[X,[X,[X,Y ]+\\\\cdots.  Logarithmic coordinates  Given a Lie group G with Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak{g}, each choice of a basis X_1, \\\\dots, X_n of \\\\mathfrak{g} determines a coordinate system near the identity element e for G, as follows. By the inverse function theorem, the exponential map \\\\operatorname{exp} : N \\\\overset{\\\\sim}\\\\to U is a diffeomorphism from some neighborhood N \\\\subset \\\\mathfrak{g} \\\\simeq \\\\mathbb{R}^n of the origin to a neighborhood U of e \\\\in G. Its inverse: :\\\\log: U \\\\overset{\\\\sim}\\\\to N \\\\subset \\\\mathbb{R}^n is then a coordinate system on U. It is called by various names such as logarithmic coordinates, exponential coordinates or normal coordinates. See Closed- subgroup theorem#Overview for an example of how they are used in applications. Remark: The open cover \\\\\\\\{ U g  g \\\\in G \\\\\\\\} gives a structure of a real- analytic manifold to G such that the group operation (g, h) \\\\mapsto gh^{-1} is real-analytic.

Location Situated approximately north west of Lajamanu and south west of Daguragu in the Victoria River district. The property was originally much larger until it was carved up into Inverway, Bunda and Riveren Stations. Inverway is bounded by Bunda to the west, Riveren to the east, Limbunya to the north and Birrindudu Station to the south. Description The property currently occupies an area of and is stocked with a herd of 17,000 cattle. The country is a mix of black soil plains covered with pastures of Mitchell grass, Queensland Blue and silky brown top grasses. The red dirt country supports stands of spinifex. History The area was originally scouted by Nat Buchanan and his son Gordon. The three Farquharson brothers; Archie, Harry and Hugh acquired the lease to the holding in 1894. The men stocked the property by overlanding cattle from Inverell. By 1905 the property was struck by drought and in 1909 the dry had still not lifted. Cool weather helped the men make the decision over drove the cattle over the dry Murranji Track despite there being no water along the way. Over 1,000 cattle were taken and the only five were lost on the journey that took five days. The Farquharsons remained at the property until the 1940s. Archie was the sole remaining owner in 1946 when he sold a large portion of the station. He remained on the property living in the log homestead he had built with his brothers until his death in 1950. He is buried at Inverway along with one of his brothers. The Westaway family bought the property in 1956 and placed on the market in 2007. The Underwood family acquired the property later the same year at auction for 17.65 million.

It is most prevalent in Western Ukraine, where small ornaments in the shape of a spider are traditionally a part of the Christmas decorations. Story A poor but hardworking widow once lived in a small hut with her children. One summer day, a pine cone fell on the earthen floor of the hut and took root. The widow's children cared for the tree, excited at the prospect of having a Christmas tree by winter. The tree grew, but when Christmas Eve arrived, they could not afford to decorate it. The children sadly went to bed and fell asleep. Early the next morning, they woke up and saw the tree covered with cobwebs. When they opened the windows, the first rays of sunlight touched the webs and turned them into gold and silver. The widow and her children were overjoyed. From then on, they never lived in poverty again. Variants Other versions replaces sunlight with a miracle from Father Christmas, Santa Claus, or the Child Jesus, and tells the story primarily from the perspective of the spiders who wished to see the Christmas tree. Origins The origins of the folk tale are unknown, but it is believed to have come from either Germany or Ukraine. In Germany, Poland, and Ukraine, finding a spider or a spider's web on a Christmas tree is considered good luck. Ukrainians also create small Christmas tree ornaments in the shape of a spider (known as pavuchky, literally \\"little spiders\\"), usually made of paper and wire. They also decorate Christmas trees with artificial spider webs. The tradition of using tinsel is also said to be because of this story. According to Lubow Wolynetz, folk art curator at Ukrainian Museum, New York City, the tradition is Ukrainian and dates back to the late 1800s or early 1900.https://www.today.com/home/spider-ornaments- christmas-trees-symbolize-good-luck-t120335 It may be based on an older European superstition about spiders bringing luck (though not black spiders in Germany), or conversely that it is bad luck to destroy a spider's web before the spider is safely out of the way.
