Produced by Ray Haboush, the film stars Corey Landis, Victoria Summer, Krash Miller, Stuart Rigby and Keith Reay. It is a modernized, loosely based take on Bram Stoker's 1897 novel Dracula, taking place in Los Angeles, California, where a wealthy Count Dracula looks to purchase an abandoned building and pursue the wife of his realtor, Jonathan Harker. Plot In Los Angeles, California, realtor Jonathan Harker (Corey Landis) proposes the sale of an abandoned building in a gang-dominated neighborhood for $12.5 million to his wealthy client Vladimir Sarkany - who is actually the vampire Count Dracula (Stuart Rigby). The sale make Jonathan enough money to start a family with his wife, Lina (Victoria Summer). The night that Jonathan visits Dracula at his home to have the property deed signed, he notices a painted picture reminiscent of Lina. Later, Quincy Morris (Krash Miller) warns him about Dracula, who murdered his girlfriend, Lucy Spencer (Linda Bella). Police detectives, Holmwood (Preston James Hillier) and Varna (Charlie Garcia) investigate Lucy's disappearance. Dracula's associate, Renfield (Ian Pfister), frames Quincy for her murder. Jonathan takes Lina to see the painting at Dracula's home, where Dracula begins to hypnotically seduce Lina, who reminds him of woman on the painting. Jonathan and Lina head back home, but their car breaks down on the way, causing them to camp in the woods. During the night, Dracula seduces the detectives and goes to bite Lina, sparking her illness. At dawn, the car is able to start back up and Jonathan takes Lina to get blood work done by Dr. Joan Seward (Dani Lennon). The following day, the detectives discover Lucy's corpse in a trunk. Jonathan finds out Lina is infected with an anonymous organism that is multiplying inside her system. While on the run, Quincy pleas to Jonathan for help to kill Dracula, although Jonathan refuses to believe Dracula is a vampire. Shortly after, Renfield runs Quincy over with a truck, killing him. When Lina begins feasting on their dog's corpse, Jonathan gets in contact with vampire hunter, Van Helsing (Keith Reay) for help and learns Quincy was killed. After Dracula seduces Lina and takes her away, Jonathan learns from Van Helsing and a mythical book that they have one day to rescue Lina and kill Dracula, or Lina will turn into a vampire. Jonathan confronts Dracula at his house, but Dracula wards him off. Jonathan hallucinates that he sees Lina on the road and crashes his car, but survives. The next day, the detectives come to arrest Jonathan for his wife‚Äôs murder, and Helsing kills them. Jonathan and Helsing confront Dracula at his new house, which is about to go into closure. They find Dracula resting inside a coffin, and Helsing tries to kill him while Jonathan takes Lina upstairs. Dracula escapes and kills Helsing. He suddenly appears in front of Jonathan and attacks him; however, Jonathan and Lina kill him by driving a stake through his heart. Afterwards, Lina bites and presumably kills Jonathan, revealing she has become a vampire. Lina takes over Dracula's home, with Renfield as her assistant.

Reception Dracula Reborn was greeted with mixed to negative reviews. Dave Gammon of HorrorNews.net credited Patrick McManus for being \\"brash\\" to have created a new vampire tale in an over-saturated genre. He praises the cinematography and performances, particularly Ian Pfister‚Äôs portrayal of Renfield, but ultimately criticized the film for leaving ‚Äúlittle to the imagination‚Äù and claimed it ‚Äúarguably never should have been conceived‚Äù. Gammon gave the film a 2 out of 5.

The ship's cargo, loaded at Bar, Montenegro, included 14 transport containers of chemical pellets, declared as activated carbon and water filters, which was in fact of explosives, consisting of nitrocellulose and nitroglycerin. The captain and chief officer of Boka Star were acquitted, but Baliƒá was found guilty in absentia of smuggling arms and issuing forged documents, and sentenced to six years in prison. Following his arrest in Greece and appeal to the Croatian Supreme Court in 2014, he was released from prison and his previous sentence was dismissed as the original judgement was ruled to be invalid. The charges were reduced to those of a customs violation and he is awaiting retrial. =Sale= The ship was sold by Baliƒá in 2003 to the Esprite Shipping Corporation, based in the Marshall Islands, but the continuing legal proceedings resulted in the ship being kept under control of the court and being towed to Pula military port.

Origin It was created by then Chief of Police Clemence B. Horrall in 1946, and it was an eight-man intelligence detail that would become known as the \\"Gangster Squad\\". Along with fighting organized crime, they were given the task of spying on corrupt cops. Criminals that were targeted included Mickey Cohen, Jack Dragna, Bugsy Siegel, Jack Whalen, and Jimmy Fratianno. History  Much like what the 2013 film Gangster Squad notes about the real Gangster Squad, they waged war on crime and did things that would be considered illegal by today's standards. Also, as the real life Sgt. Jack O'Mara stated in the Los Angeles Times for the online article \\"Crusaders in the underworld: The LAPD takes on organized crime\\", \\"We did a lot of things that we'd get indicted for today\\". William Worton headed up the LAPD in 1949 and increased the size of the team, as well as renaming it the Intelligence Division. William Parker became Chief of Police in 1950, and expanded the team even more, including adding a female field team. In the media * The 2013 film Gangster Squad‚Äîthough taking considerable creative liberty‚Äîwas based on the LAPD's Gangster Squad. * Jack Webb's 1954 film Dragnet is based on the Intelligence Division, also known as the Gangster Squad. * Author James Ellroy used a different, fictionalized version of the Gangster Squad called the \\"Mobster Squad\\", in his L.A. Quartet novels. The team is introduced in L.A. Confidential and is headed up by corrupt LAPD captain Dudley Smith. Their duties included beating confessions out of suspects, scaring criminals out of town, and controlling and containing crime. * Similar units are depicted in the 1996 film Mulholland Falls, and in the 2013 miniseries Mob City the squad is referenced as \\"Horrall's gang of thugs\\". * In the book L.A's Secret Police: Inside the Elite Spy Network former OCID detective Mike Rothmiller discusses how, during the 1970s and '80s, the OCID was more interested in celebrities and politicians than actual mobsters. He was denied permission to meet a major mob informant in Las Vegas but resources were spent having six officers staking out a politician's beach house because of possible homosexual activity.https://www.amazon.com/dp/B008LW7DQ8/ * The 1950 film 711 Ocean Drive depicts the Gangster Squad investigating a horse racing betting syndicate.

His most notable creations were the 'Virgil Girls' and his comic books Silver Flash and The Invisible Avenger. Biography Virgil Gavan Reilly was born on 29 November 1892 in Creswick, Victoria. His father was the local postmaster. In the 1910s he worked as a commercial artist for a motion picture advertising firm, as well as drawing propaganda and recruitment posters during the First World War. In 1920 Virgil joined Smith's Weekly as a staff artist in Sydney where he remained until 1950. 'Virgil Girls' in Smith's were the sex symbols of Australia, the equivalent in the 1920s and early 1930s of the USA Gibson or Petty Girls, where he became one of Australia's best-known and highly paid newspaper artists. For a time Virgil also drew the political cartoons at Smith's Weekly. Reilly was an accomplished book illustrator, providing artwork for two collections of poetry by Kenneth Slessor: Darlinghurst Nights in 1933, and Backless Betty from Bondi in 1983. Reilly was a prominent cover artist for The Australian Women's Weekly during the Second World War. One of his cover paintings was used for a wartime stamp issued in July 1940 ‚Äì and was the third official 'First Day Cover' stamp issued by Australia's postal service. Reilly's first published comic books were two one-shot titles, Texas Cody and the Treasure Hunters and Texas Cody and the Phantom of the Sand Dunes published in 1947 by Joseph Swanson Wilkinson. In June 1950 Reilly created his best-known comic book, Silver Flash and his Frogmen for Invincible Press. It ran for 54 issues until 1955 when it transferred to Calvert Publishing appearing as Captain Silver Flash. Reilly's fluid art style was well-suited to this underwater adventure series, as Captain Flash and his crew (Guns, Frogface and Tadpole) patrolled the oceans in their submarine, fighting strange marine creatures and world-conquering villains in the depths. In the same year he created two new monthly comics for rival publisher Ayers & James: The Invisible Avenger, about a cold war-era science fiction series featuring a malevolent Chinese scientist, who used his power of invisibility to carry out his genocidal mission of exterminating the \\"white races\\" of the world; and \\"Punch\\" Perkins of the Fighting Fleet, later renamed Fighting Fleet Comics, which featured two major characters, \\"Punch\\" Perkins, a two-fisted Aussie Naval officer, and a top-secret RAF unit called Rocket Squadron. Reilly wrote and drew the first six issues of The Invisible Avenger before passing the title to Peter Chapman due to workload pressures, where it was renamed Invisible Avenger Comics and included a number of other Chapman-created strips including The Blue Ghost and Cometman. The Invisible Avenger/Invisible Avenger Comics ran for 26 issues until 1952, and Fighting Fleet Comics ran for 22 issues also until 1952. Smith's Weekly closed in October 1950, upon which Reilly became the political cartoonist for Sydney's Daily Mirror and Melbourne's The Truth, as well as freelancing.

The county charterAbout the Office - Office of the Cuyahoga County Executive stipulates that the executive is responsible for the appointment and removal of county personnel, working with other local governments, introducing legislation to the county council, submitting budgets and capital improvements plans to the council, and many other duties.  Formation  After a widespread corruption scandal was revealed, the voters of Cuyahoga County, which includes the City of Cleveland and 58 surrounding suburbs, voted to authorize a new form of county government on November 3, 2009. The charter replaced three county commissioners with an executive and 11-member council. Under the charter, other previously elected posts, such as sheriff, treasurer, and clerk of courts became appointed positions under the executive. Summit County is the only other Ohio county with an executive. Democrat Ed FitzGerald, the then-Mayor of Lakewood, Ohio, defeated Matt Dolan in the initial election in November 2010 and was sworn in as the first Cuyahoga County executive on January 9, 2011.  Political implications  After FitzGerald was elected, The Plain Dealer political reporter Henry J. Gomez wrote that many observers believed the county executive job would \\"be second only to the governor in terms of power and constituency.\\" This prediction seemed to foreshadow FitzGerald's decision to challenge John Kasich's re-election bid for Governor of Ohio in 2014.

Coming out of the house is Krazy's spaniel girlfriend. They would then walk around and sing the song together. Krazy and the spaniel enter the house, which turns out to be a tavern, where they do the Cossack dance. It is a pleasant experience for them. Meanwhile, a hefty hog drinks an entire bottle of vodka, thus becoming intoxicated and psychologically corrupted. The hog nabs Krazy and tells him to blow up \\"the palace\\" with a round black bomb. Krazy, at first resists, but is compelled by the hog who is heavily armed. Krazy jigs out of the tavern while holding the bomb. He tries to hurl it at a distance but animals in the vicinity, such as dogs and birds, keep throwing it back. Not liking what the cat is doing, the hog engages with Krazy in volleying the bomb back and forth. The bomb finally detonates at the hog who then runs off in a barrel.

The initial plant was two 2.5MW BTH/English Electric turbo alternators that were no longer needed at Ultimo power station. A third 2.5MW turbo alternator from Zarra Street, Newcastle was added in 1931. A fourth 2.5MWBTH machine was installed in 1936 (ex Zarra St). In 1943 a 2.5MW Willans & Robinson generator from Zarra St became No5 at Lithgow. Steam was supplied from four 160,000 lb/Hr boilers at 200PSI and a temp of 450degF. Coal came from the nearby State Mine. Due to a severe lack of water, these turbines only exhausted into individual jet condensers. The second stage of Lithgow power station development started in 1948 with the removal of No5 which had been damaged and the installation of a 7.5MW Metro-Vickers alternator from Zarra St and became No4A. Similar 7.5MW Metro Vickers generators replaced the 2.5MW machines in 1950, 1953 and 1956 to become No. 3A, No. 5, No. 2 and No. 1. Steam was supplied from five 70,000 lb/hr boilers that were ex White Bay \\"A\\" station. A series of wooden cooling towers were constructed and allowed the use of surface condensers for these larger sets. Make-up for the cooling towers came from a new dam built at the adjacent State Mine. Total output was 38MW. Lithgow remained in operation until 1964 and was demolished during the 1970s.

The restaurant chain was known for its scantily-clad waitresses, called \\"Bikini Babes\\", whose uniforms consist of its eponymous bikini tops, cowboy boots, and tight denim shorts. The chain was also known for trademarking the term \\"breastaurant\\" (a common term for this and similar restaurants) and purchasing a ghost town that was temporarily renamed \\"Bikinis, Texas\\". The chain ceased operations on December 23, 2018. History Bikinis waitress with standard uniform of bikini top and jeans shorts Exterior view of Austin, Texas Bikinis location Restaurant founder Doug Guller reports having gotten the idea for Bikinis Sports Bar & Grill in 2001 on an Australian vacation after being offered a beer by an attractive waitress while watching rugby. Guller theorized that a combination of sports, beer and sex appeal would be particularly recession-proof. The first restaurant was opened in Austin in 2006, and a total of 14 locations have subsequently opened, all of which are now closed. Most of the locations were in the Interstate 35 corridor in Texas (San Antonio). The CBS TV show Undercover Boss featured Bikinis Sports Bar and Grill, airing on December 28, 2014. The show featured Guller posing undercover. He interacted with a bartender who said she normally wears a bikini top but felt uncomfortable wearing that on camera, so she opted to wear a T-shirt. He felt she was overserving an intoxicated patron. Not knowing that Guller was the CEO, she was candid about not being interested in the job as a career. The lack of enthusiasm ultimately led Guller to firing her on camera. A waitress with a good attitude was rewarded with breast augmentation surgery. These scenes provoked controversy on social media, especially on the Bikinis Facebook pages and on Twitter. Since May 2015, the Bikinis located in the DFW Metroplex, which have been featured on Undercover Boss, are in the process of being rebranded by ATX Brands as Gino's East Pizzerias. This will make DFW the second populated MSA in Texas (besides Houston and San Antonio) to lose their existing Bikinis restaurants. ATX Brands will continue to retain the first two Bikinis located in Austin. DFW locations (Arlington, Richardson) have been shuttered since February 11, 2015, with the Mesquite location following suit after April 15, 2015. As of December 2015, just one Bikinis located in Austin, TX (located in Downtown Austin on Sixth Street) was still in operation. The Austin, TX location ceased operations on December 23, 2018. Marketing Bikinis Sports Bar & Grill utilized a marketing campaign which has included several high-profile publicity stunts. The restaurant chain had a loyalty program formerly known as the Bikinis Black Card where patrons earned points for rewards. Patrons who had over 1000 points on their black card account would judge one of their in- store bikini contests. During the opening of Bikinis, Texas in July 2013, Black Card account holders also got a chance to meet Carmen Electra in person. The restaurant chain hosted a monthly bikini contest. Some of the contests were seasonal until February 2014 when the company began phasing out the contests based on the ratio of active waitstaff who would sign up and enter in lieu of the newly established Miss Bikinis USA Pageant. =Bikinis, Texas= In 2012, Guller purchased the ghost town of Bankersmith saying that he would rename the town to \\"Bikinis, Texas\\" after his restaurant chain. Guller said he would turn the town into a tourist destination with the creation of a bikini hall of fame which described the swimwear's history. No plans were made to open a Bikinis Sports Bar & Grill restaurant at the location, but Guller suggested that a bar inside an abandoned bus could be possible. A \\"grand opening\\" of Bikinis, Texas was scheduled for July 13, 2013. Country musician Jerry Jeff Walker was to perform and Carmen Electra was present to be inducted to the bikini hall of fame. Other events which have been planned to be associated with the town include a \\"Miss Bikinis USA\\" pageant and a possible reality show. Bikinis, Texas was reverted to its previous name of Bankersmith in 2015, reportedly in an effort from Guller to mend fences with residents of nearby Fredericksburg, who were reportedly upset with the name change. As of January 2017, Bankersmith is up for sale. =\\"Breastaurant\\" trademark= In September 2011, Bikinis Sports Bar & Grill filed a request with a United States Patent and Trademark Office to register the term \\"breastaurant\\". The term was successfully registered in October 2012 and was marked by the trademark office as \\"Un-Revivable\\" on May 24, 2019. The Huffington Post suggested that the trademarking of \\"breastaurant\\" was a consequence of the boom in breastaurant sales figures in the early 2010s.

Star-Telegram, Apr 30 2016. Mayfest has free admission for senior citizens on Thursday and for members of the armed forces on Sunday. History After a serious flood of the Trinity River within Fort Worth in 1949, levees were built to prevent a recurrence of the flooding. In 1968 Phyllis Tilley and the Junior League of Fort Worth undertook the beautification of the Trinity River area. By 1973 the area around the river was improved enough that a celebration was held in Fort Worth's Trinity Park. This inaugural two-day festival celebration was called the Trinity River Festival-Mayfest and included music, food, art booths, and family entertainment. The festival was put together by four organizations: the Junior League of Fort Worth, Inc., Fort Worth Parks and Community Services Department, Streams and Valleys, Inc., and the Tarrant Regional Water District. Mayfest became an annual event, and in 1987 it was incorporated as a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization. In 1995, the festival was interrupted by a severe storm, which included softball-sized hail and a flash flood.\\"20 years after Mayfest hailstorm, grand weather greets festival\\".

Current operation As of 2016, Mayfest, Inc.'s board of directors and staff manage the day-to-day operations, raising funds and celebrating the parks and river. A central volunteer committee consisting of about 75 members largely organizes the Mayfest festival. This group begins work on the festival a year in advance. The festival is staffed with volunteers from the Junior League of Fort Worth, Inc. and the Fort Worth community; about 2,000 volunteers help to operate the four-day festival event. The Art & Gift Market Area showcases about 60 booths of local arts, crafts and gifts as well as a School Art Competition awarding cash prizes. There is a children's area with about 20 booths of free activities for children ages 3 to 12. The Range Area has entertainment and carnival rides; the Zone Area includes the giant human maze, Texas Parks and Wildlife booths about the outdoors of Texas, and the Humane Society of North Texas pet adoption.

The episode is written by Coleman Herbert and is directed by Dan Attias. In the episode, Detective Holder (Joel Kinnaman) and Sarah Linden (Mireille Enos) learn a potential victim has escaped the killer. Bullet (Bex Taylor-Klaus) assists them to retrace the victim's steps, while also hoping to find Kallie, her missing friend. Kallie's mother, Danette (Amy Seimetz), grows worried and discovers something about her boyfriend Joe (Ryan Robbins). Seward (Peter Sarsgaard) gets a visit from his son's adoptive mother. Plot A badly injured and bleeding girl (Laine MacNeil) runs into the middle of a road and gets struck by a car. She flees before the driver (Harrison MacDonald) gets out to help her. The driver then sees a man's silhouette standing in front of his headlights. The next morning, Danette Leeds (Amy Seimetz) awakens to find that she has missed a call from daughter Kallie. Danette's boyfriend Joe Mills (Ryan Robbins) returns to the trailer after having been gone for much of the night. Danette voices her concern about Kallie. He dismisses himself and gets ready for work. Holder and Linden visit Danette after Mama Dips (Grace Zabriskie) reveals Mills is her son, and she called him at Danette's trailer from jail. Linden tells Danette that Mills made the porn video of Kallie. Danette insists Mills never looked at Kallie in a sexual way. She also mentions Kallie tried to call her the previous night. Skinner calls Holder with news that someone may have spotted Mills. At the scene of the car accident, Skinner tells Linden and Holder the girl had red hair and was badly injured. The driver says a man pursued the girl through the forest. Linden traces the girl's original path to find a red biohazard bag hanging on a tree. Back in the car, Linden and Holder interpret the empty biohazard bag as a sign the girl is still alive. They begin to canvas the area and the city looking for her. In prison, Alton rehearses the speech he plans to give to the family of his victims. When inmate Dale (Nicholas Lea) says God has already forgiven them all, Seward says he's not asking for forgiveness. Elsewhere, Becker (Hugh Dillon) requests six volunteer guards to assist with Seward's execution. Henderson (Aaron Douglas) does not sign up. Linden and Holder visit Beacon Home. Pastor Mike (Ben Cotton) suggests they check one of the city's three remaining 24-hour clinics. Outside, Bullet arrives and asks what the gameplan is. Holder says they're going to look for Kallie at the clinics. Bullet says she has a better idea and gets into their car. She directs them to an overpass where Kallie sometimes sleeps when she can't find a bed elsewhere. Holder swaps his suit for a hoodie and talks to a gang of punks loitering nearby. One punk (Nelson Leis) heard crying near the river the previous night. Across the river, Holder notices some large drainage pipes. He, Linden, and Bullet drive to the pipes and find blood stains inside one of them. Holder hints Kallie may be dead and Bullet gut-punches him for giving up. He invites Linden to his apartment for food, but she declines. Dale asks Seward if he loved his wife. Seward says he liked her wild side but she was neither mother nor wife material. Seward gets a visitor. Tess Clarke (Ingrid Torrence), Adrian's foster mother, tells him she'd like to adopt Adrian and Adrian wants to visit. When she adds that Adrian has forgiven him, Seward laughs and calls for the guard. Linden misses the ferry home and goes to Holder's apartment. His girlfriend, Caroline Swift (Jewel Staite), introduces herself. Caroline serves her food and gives Holder a cupcake, wishing him a Happy Valentine's Day. Holder makes up an unconvincing excuse for not having anything for her, then gets a work call and looks at Caroline for permission to go. She cautions them to be safe. In the car, Bullet tells them that a friend saw a man carry a bleeding girl into an alleyway by a nearby veterinarian's office. Linden and Holder bust into that office. A man (Jeff Gladstone) emerges from a room with his hands raised, insisting he doesn't know who dropped off the girl. Linden finds a girl on an operating table‚Äîher throat covered with sutured cuts and her hand wrapped in gauze. Linden knows it's not Kallie. Outside, Bullet cries as she slowly accepts the fact that Kallie might be dead. Holder comforts her. Alton returns to his cell after meeting the family of his victims. He reveals to Seward that the visitors were his brother and sister and that his victims were his parents. He says his siblings told him they've forgiven him. Danette slowly drives down the city streets looking for Kallie. She calls her daughter and leaves a voicemail. She later meets Mills in a motel room. As he showers, she calls Kallie again. Drawn by the sound of ringing close by, she discovers Kallie's phone inside Mills' bag. He exits the bathroom and stares at her.

Potential effects on the central nervous system (CNS) are particularly important. A vigorous ground-based cellular and animal model research program will help quantify the risk to the CNS from space radiation exposure on future long distance space missions and promote the development of optimized countermeasures. Possible acute and late risks to the CNS from galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) and solar proton events (SPEs) are a documented concern for human exploration of our solar system. In the past, the risks to the CNS of adults who were exposed to low to moderate doses of ionizing radiation (0 to 2 Gy (Gray) (Gy = 100 rad)) have not been a major consideration. However, the heavy ion component of space radiation presents distinct biophysical challenges to cells and tissues as compared to the physical challenges that are presented by terrestrial forms of radiation. Soon after the discovery of cosmic rays, the concern for CNS risks originated with the prediction of the light flash phenomenon from single HZE nuclei traversals of the retina; this phenomenon was confirmed by the Apollo astronauts in 1970 and 1973. HZE nuclei are capable of producing a column of heavily damaged cells, or a microlesion, along their path through tissues, thereby raising concern over serious impacts on the CNS. In recent years, other concerns have arisen with the discovery of neurogenesis and its impact by HZE nuclei, which have been observed in experimental models of the CNS. Human epidemiology is used as a basis for risk estimation for cancer, acute radiation risks, and cataracts. This approach is not viable for estimating CNS risks from space radiation, however. At doses above a few Gy, detrimental CNS changes occur in humans who are treated with radiation (e.g., gamma rays and protons) for cancer. Treatment doses of 50 Gy are typical, which is well above the exposures in space even if a large SPE were to occur. Thus, of the four categories of space radiation risks (cancer, CNS, degenerative, and acute radiation syndromes), the CNS risk relies most extensively on experimental data with animals for its evidence base. Understanding and mitigating CNS risks requires a vigorous research program that will draw on the basic understanding that is gained from cellular and animal models, and on the development of approaches to extrapolate risks and the potential benefits of countermeasures for astronauts. Several experimental studies, which use heavy ion beams simulating space radiation, provide constructive evidence of the CNS risks from space radiation. First, exposure to HZE nuclei at low doses (<50 cGy) significantly induces neurocognitive deficits, such as learning and behavioral changes as well as operant reactions in the mouse and rat. Exposures to equal or higher doses of low-LET radiation (e.g., gamma or X rays) do not show similar effects. The threshold of performance deficit following exposure to HZE nuclei depends on both the physical characteristics of the particles, such as linear energy transfer (LET), and the animal age at exposure. A performance deficit has been shown to occur at doses that are similar to the ones that will occur on a Mars mission (<0.5 Gy). The neurocognitive deficits with the dopaminergic nervous system are similar to aging and appear to be unique to space radiation. Second, exposure to HZE disrupts neurogenesis in mice at low doses (<1 Gy), showing a significant dose-related reduction of new neurons and oligodendrocytes in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the hippocampal dentate gyrus. Third, reactive oxygen species (ROS) in neuronal precursor cells arise following exposure to HZE nuclei and protons at low dose, and can persist for several months. Antioxidants and anti-inflammatory agents can possibly reduce these changes. Fourth, neuroinflammation arises from the CNS following exposure to HZE nuclei and protons. In addition, age-related genetic changes increase the sensitivity of the CNS to radiation. Research with animal models that are irradiated with HZE nuclei has shown that important changes to the CNS occur with the dose levels that are of concern to NASA. However, the significance of these results on the morbidity to astronauts has not been elucidated. One model of late tissue effects suggests that significant effects will occur at lower doses, but with increased latency. It is to be noted that the studies that have been conducted to date have been carried out with relatively small numbers of animals (<10 per dose group); therefore, testing of dose threshold effects at lower doses (< 0.5 Gy) has not been carried out sufficiently at this time. As the problem of extrapolating space radiation effects in animals to humans will be a challenge for space radiation research, such research could become limited by the population size that is used in animal studies. Furthermore, the role of dose protraction has not been studied to date. An approach to extrapolate existing observations to possible cognitive changes, performance degradation, or late CNS effects in astronauts has not been discovered. New approaches in systems biology offer an exciting tool to tackle this challenge. Recently, eight gaps were identified for projecting CNS risks. Research on new approaches to risk assessment may be needed to provide the necessary data and knowledge to develop risk projection models of the CNS from space radiation. Introduction Both GCRs and SPEs are of concern for CNS risks. The major GCRs are composed of protons, Œ±-particles, and particles of HZE nuclei with a broad energy spectra ranging from a few tens to above 10,000 MeV/u. In interplanetary space, GCR organ dose and dose-equivalent of more than 0.2 Gy or 0.6 Sv per year, respectively, are expected. The high energies of GCRs allow them to penetrate to hundreds of centimeters of any material, thus precluding radiation shielding as a plausible mitigation measure to GCR risks on the CNS. For SPEs, the possibility exists for an absorbed dose of over 1 Gy from an SPE if crew members are in a thinly shielded spacecraft or performing a spacewalk. The energies of SPEs, although substantial (tens to hundreds of MeV), do not preclude radiation shielding as a potential countermeasure. However, the costs of shielding may be high to protect against the largest events. The fluence of charged particles hitting the brain of an astronaut has been estimated several times in the past. One estimate is that during a 3-year mission to Mars at solar minimum (assuming the 1972 spectrum of GCR), 20 million out of 43 million hippocampus cells and 230 thousand out of 1.3 million thalamus cell nuclei will be directly hit by one or more particles with charge Z> 15. These numbers do not include the additional cell hits by energetic electrons (delta rays) that are produced along the track of HZE nuclei or correlated cellular damage. The contributions of delta rays from GCR and correlated cellular damage increase the number of damaged cells two- to three-fold from estimates of the primary track alone and present the possibility of heterogeneously damaged regions, respectively. The importance of such additional damage is poorly understood. At this time, the possible detrimental effects to an astronaut's CNS from the HZE component of GCR have yet to be identified. This is largely due to the lack of a human epidemiological basis with which to estimate risks and the relatively small number of published experimental studies with animals. RBE factors are combined with human data to estimate cancer risks for low-LET radiation exposure. Since this approach is not possible for CNS risks, new approaches to risk estimation will be needed. Thus, biological research is required to establish risk levels and risk projection models and, if the risk levels are found to be significant, to design countermeasures. =Description of central nervous system risks of concern to NASA= Acute and late CNS risks from space radiation are of concern for Exploration missions to the moon or Mars. Acute CNS risks include: altered cognitive function, reduced motor function, and behavioral changes, all of which may affect performance and human health. Late CNS risks are possible neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, dementia, or premature aging. The effect of the protracted exposure of the CNS to the low dose-rate (< 50 mGy h‚Äì1) of proton, HZE particles, and neutrons of the relevant energies for doses up to 2 Gy is of concern. =Current NASA permissible exposure limits= PELs for short-term and career astronaut exposure to space radiation have been approved by the NASA Chief Health and Medical Officer. The PELs set requirements and standards for mission design and crew selection as recommended in NASA-STD-3001, Volume 1. NASA has used dose limits for cancer risks and the non-cancer risks to the BFOs, skin, and lens since 1970. For Exploration mission planning, preliminary dose limits for the CNS risks are based largely on experimental results with animal models. Further research is needed to validate and quantify these risks, however, and to refine the values for dose limits. The CNS PELs, which correspond to the doses at the region of the brain called the hippocampus, are set for time periods of 30 days or 1 year, or for a career with values of 500, 1,000, and 1,500 mGy-Eq, respectively. Although the unit mGy-Eq is used, the RBE for CNS effects is largely unknown; therefore, the use of the quality factor function for cancer risk estimates is advocated. For particles with charge Z>10, an addition PEL requirement limits the physical dose (mGy) for 1 year and the career to 100 and 250 mGy, respectively. NASA uses computerized anatomical geometry models to estimate the body self-shielding at the hippocampus. Evidence =Review of human data= Evidence of the effects of terrestrial forms of ionizing radiation on the CNS has been documented from radiotherapy patients, although the dose is higher for these patients than would be experienced by astronauts in the space environment. CNS behavioral changes such as chronic fatigue and depression occur in patients who are undergoing irradiation for cancer therapy. Neurocognitive effects, especially in children, are observed at lower radiation doses. A recent review on intelligence and the academic achievement of children after treatment for brain tumors indicates that radiation exposure is related to a decline in intelligence and academic achievement, including low intelligence quotient (IQ) scores, verbal abilities, and performance IQ; academic achievement in reading, spelling, and mathematics; and attention functioning. Mental retardation was observed in the children of the atomic-bomb survivors in Japan who were exposed to radiation prenatally at moderate doses (<2 Gy) at 8 to 15 weeks post-conception, but not at earlier or later prenatal times. Radiotherapy for the treatment of several tumors with protons and other charged particle beams provides ancillary data for considering radiation effects for the CNS. NCRP Report No. 153 notes charge particle usage ‚Äúfor treatment of pituitary tumors, hormone-responsive metastatic mammary carcinoma, brain tumors, and intracranial arteriovenous malformations and other cerebrovascular diseases.‚Äù In these studies are found associations with neurological complications such as impairments in cognitive functioning, language acquisition, visual spatial ability, and memory and executive functioning, as well as changes in social behaviors. Similar effects did not appear in patients who were treated with chemotherapy. In all of these examples, the patients were treated with extremely high doses that were below the threshold for necrosis. Since cognitive functioning and memory are closely associated with the cerebral white volume of the prefrontal/frontal lobe and cingulate gyrus, defects in neurogenesis may play a critical role in neurocognitive problems in irradiated patients. =Review of space flight issues= The first proposal concerning the effect of space radiation on the CNS was made by Cornelius Tobias in his 1952 description of light flash phenomenon caused by single HZE nuclei traversals of the retina. Light flashes, such as those described by Tobias, were observed by the astronauts during the early Apollo missions as well as in dedicated experiments that were subsequently performed on Apollo and Skylab missions. More recently, studies of light flashes were made on the Russian Mir space station and the ISS. A 1973 report by the NAS considered these effects in detail. This phenomenon, which is known as a Phosphene, is the visual perception of flickering light. It is considered a subjective sensation of light since it can be caused by simply applying pressure on the eyeball. The traversal of a single, highly charged particle through the occipital cortex or the retina was estimated to be able to cause a light flash. Possible mechanisms for HZE-induced light flashes include direction ionization and Cerenkov radiation within the retina. The observation of light flashes by the astronauts brought attention to the possible effects of HZE nuclei on brain function. The microlesion concept, which considered the effects of the column of damaged cells surrounding the path of an HZE nucleus traversing critical regions of the brain, originated at this time. An important task that still remains is to determine whether and to what extent such particle traversals contribute to functional degradation within the CNS. The possible observation of CNS effects in astronauts who were participating in past NASA missions is highly unlikely for several reasons. First, the lengths of past missions are relatively short and the population sizes of astronauts are small. Second, when astronauts are traveling in LEO, they are partially protected by the magnetic field and the solid body of the Earth, which together reduce the GCR dose-rate by about two-thirds from its free space values. Furthermore, the GCR in LEO has lower LET components compared to the GCR that will be encountered in transit to Mars or on the lunar surface because the magnetic field of the Earth repels nuclei with energies that are below about 1,000 MeV/u, which are of higher LET. For these reasons, the CNS risks are a greater concern for long-duration lunar missions or for a Mars mission than for missions on the ISS. =Radiobiology studies of central nervous system risks for protons, neutrons, and high-Z high-energy nuclei= Both GCR and SPE could possibly contribute to acute and late CNS risks to astronaut health and performance. This section presents a description of the studies that have been performed on the effects of space radiation in cell, tissue, and animal models. Effects in neuronal cells and the central nervous system =Neurogenesis= The CNS consists of neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes that are generated from multipotent stem cells. NCRP Report No. 153 provides the following excellent and short introduction to the composition and cell types of interest for radiation studies of the CNS: ‚ÄúThe CNS consists of neurons differing markedly in size and number per unit area. There are several nuclei or centers that consist of closely packed neuron cell bodies (e.g., the respiratory and cardiac centers in the floor of the fourth ventricle). In the cerebral cortex the large neuron cell bodies, such as Betz cells, are separated by a considerable distance. Of additional importance are the neuroglia which are the supporting cells and consist of astrocytes, oligodendroglia, and microglia. These cells permeate and support the nervous tissue of the CNS, binding it together like a scaffold that also supports the vasculature. The most numerous of the neuroglia are Type I astrocytes, which make up about half the brain, greatly outnumbering the neurons. Neuroglia retain the capability of cell division in contrast to neurons and, therefore, the responses to radiation differ between the cell types. A third type of tissue in the brain is the vasculature which exhibits a comparable vulnerability for radiation damage to that found elsewhere in the body. Radiation-induced damage to oligodendrocytes and endothelial cells of the vasculature accounts for major aspects of the pathogenesis of brain damage that can occur after high doses of low-LET radiation.‚Äù Based on studies with low-LET radiation, the CNS is considered a radioresistant tissue. For example: in radiotherapy, early brain complications in adults usually do not develop if daily fractions of 2 Gy or less are administered with a total dose of up to 50 Gy. The tolerance dose in the CNS, as with other tissues, depends on the volume and the specific anatomical location in the human brain that is irradiated. In recent years, studies with stem cells uncovered that neurogenesis still occurs in the adult hippocampus, where cognitive actions such as memory and learning are determined. This discovery provides an approach to understand mechanistically the CNS risk of space radiation. Accumulating data indicate that radiation not only affects differentiated neural cells, but also the proliferation and differentiation of neuronal precursor cells and even adult stem cells. Recent evidence points out that neuronal progenitor cells are sensitive to radiation. Studies on low-LET radiation show that radiation stops not only the generation of neuronal progenitor cells, but also their differentiation into neurons and other neural cells. NCRP Report No. 153 notes that cells in the SGZ of the dentate gyrus undergo dose-dependent apoptosis above 2 Gy of X-ray irradiation, and the production of new neurons in young adult male mice is significantly reduced by relatively low (>2 Gy) doses of X rays. NCRP Report No. 153 also notes that: ‚ÄúThese changes are observed to be dose dependent. In contrast there were no apparent effects on the production of new astrocytes or oligodendrocytes. Measurements of activated microglia indicated that changes in neurogenesis were associated with a significant dose-dependent inflammatory response even 2 months after irradiation. This suggests that the pathogenesis of long- recognized radiation-induced cognitive injury may involve loss of neural precursor cells from the SGZ of the hippocampal dentate gyrus and alterations in neurogenesis.‚Äù Recent studies provide evidence of the pathogenesis of HZE nuclei in the CNS. The authors of one of these studies were the first to suggest neurodegeneration with HZE nuclei, as shown in figure 6-1(a). These studies demonstrate that HZE radiation led to the progressive loss of neuronal progenitor cells in the SGZ at doses of 1 to 3 Gy in a dosedependent manner. NCRP Report No. 153 notes that ‚ÄúMice were irradiated with 1 to 3 Gy of 12C or 56Fe-ions and 9 months later proliferating cells and immature neurons in the dentate SGZ were quantified. The results showed that reductions in these cells were dependent on the dose and LET. Loss of precursor cells was also associated with altered neurogenesis and a robust inflammatory response, as shown in figures 6-1(a) and 6-1(b). These results indicate that high-LET radiation has a significant and long-lasting effect on the neurogenic population in the hippocampus that involves cell loss and changes in the microenvironment. The work has been confirmed by other studies. These investigators noted that these changes are consistent with those found in aged subjects, indicating that heavy-particle irradiation is a possible model for the study of aging.‚Äù Figure 6-1(a). (Panel A) Expression of polysialic acid form of neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM) in the hippocampus of rats that were irradiated (IR) with 2.5 Gy of 56Fe high-energy radiation and control subjects as measured by % density/field area measured. (Panel B) PSA- NCAM staining in the dentate gyrus of representative irradiated (IR) and control (C) subjects at 5x magnification. Figure 6-1(b). Numbers of proliferating cells (left panel) and immature neurons (right panel) in the dentate SGZ are significantly decreased 48 hours after irradiation. Antibodies against Ki-67 and doublecortin (Dcx) were used to detect proliferating cells and immature neurons, respectively. Doses from 2 to 10 Gy significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the numbers of proliferating cells. Immature neurons were also reduced in a dose-dependent fashion (p<0.001). Each bar represents an average of four animals; error bars, and standard error. =Oxidative damage= Recent studies indicate that adult rat neural precursor cells from the hippocampus show an acute, dose-dependent apoptotic response that was accompanied by an increase in ROS. Low-LET protons are also used in clinical proton beam radiation therapy, at an RBE of 1.1 relative to megavoltage X rays at a high dose. NCRP Report No. 153 notes that: ‚ÄúRelative ROS levels were increased at nearly all doses (1 to 10 Gy) of Bragg-peak 250 MeV protons at post-irradiation times (6 to 24 hours) compared to unirradiated controls. The increase in ROS after proton irradiation was more rapid than that observed with X rays and showed a well-defined dose response at 6 and 24 hours, increasing about 10-fold over controls at a rate of 3% per Gy. However, by 48 hours post-irradiation, ROS levels fell below controls and coincided with minor reductions in mitochondrial content. Use of the antioxidant alpha-lipoic acid (before or after irradiation) was shown to eliminate the radiation- induced rise in ROS levels. These results corroborate the earlier studies using X rays and provide further evidence that elevated ROS are integral to the radioresponse of neural precursor cells.‚Äù Furthermore, high-LET radiation led to significantly higher levels of oxidative stress in hippocampal precursor cells as compared to lower-LET radiations (X rays, protons) at lower doses (‚â§1 Gy) (figure 6-2). The use of the antioxidant lipoic acid was able to reduce ROS levels below background levels when added before or after 56Fe-ion irradiation. These results conclusively show that low doses of 56Fe-ions can elicit significant levels of oxidative stress in neural precursor cells at a low dose. Figure 6-2. Dose response for oxidative stress after 56Fe-ion irradiation. Hippocampal precursors that are subjected to 56Fe-ion irradiation were analyzed for oxidative stress 6 hours after exposure. At doses ‚â§1 Gy a linear dose response for the induction of oxidative stress was observed. At higher 56Fe doses, oxidative stress fell to values that were found using lower-LET irradiations (X rays, protons). Experiments, which represent a minimum of three independent measurements (¬±SE), were normalized against unirradiated controls set to unity. ROS levels induced after 56Fe irradiation were significantly (P < 0.05) higher than controls. =Neuroinflammation= Neuroinflammation, which is a fundamental reaction to brain injury, is characterized by the activation of resident microglia and astrocytes and local expression of a wide range of inflammatory mediators. Acute and chronic neuroinflammation has been studied in the mouse brain following exposure to HZE. The acute effect of HZE is detectable at 6 and 9 Gy; no studies are available at lower doses. Myeloid cell recruitment appears by 6 months following exposure. The estimated RBE value of HZE irradiation for induction of an acute neuroinflammatory response is three compared to that of gamma irradiation. COX-2 pathways are implicated in neuroinflammatory processes that are caused by low-LET radiation. COX-2 up-regulation in irradiated microglia cells leads to prostaglandin E2 production, which appears to be responsible for radiation-induced gliosis (overproliferation of astrocytes in damaged areas of the CNS). Behavioral effects As behavioral effects are difficult to quantitate, they consequently are one of the most uncertain of the space radiation risks. NCRP Report No. 153 notes that: ‚ÄúThe behavioral neurosciences literature is replete with examples of major differences in behavioral outcome depending on the animal species, strain, or measurement method used. For example, compared to unirradiated controls, X-irradiated mice show hippocampal-dependent spatial learning and memory impairments in the Barnes maze, but not in the Morris water maze which, however, can be used to demonstrate deficits in rats. Particle radiation studies of behavior have been accomplished with rats and mice, but with some differences in the outcome depending on the endpoint measured.‚Äù The following studies provide evidence that space radiation affects the CNS behavior of animals in a somewhat dose- and LET-dependent manner. =Sensorimotor effects= Sensorimotor deficits and neurochemical changes were observed in rats that were exposed to low doses of 56Fe-ions. Doses that are below 1 Gy reduce performance, as tested by the wire suspension test. Behavioral changes were observed as early as 3 days after radiation exposure and lasted up to 8 months. Biochemical studies showed that the K+-evoked release of dopamine was significantly reduced in the irradiated group, together with an alteration of the nerve signaling pathways. A negative result was reported by Pecaut et al., in which no behavioral effects were seen in female C57/BL6 mice in a 2- to 8-week period following their exposure to 0, 0.1, 0.5 or 2 Gy accelerated 56Fe-ions (1 GeV/u56Fe) as measured by open- field, rotorod, or acoustic startle habituation. =Radiation-induced changes in conditioned taste aversion= There is evidence that deficits in conditioned taste aversion (CTA) are induced by low doses of heavy ions. The CTA test is a classical conditioning paradigm that assesses the avoidance behavior that occurs when the ingestion of a normally acceptable food item is associated with illness. This is considered a standard behavioral test of drug toxicity. NCRP Report No. 153 notes that: ‚ÄúThe role of the dopaminergic system in radiation-induced changes in CTA is suggested by the fact that amphetamine-induced CTA, which depends on the dopaminergic system, is affected by radiation, whereas lithium chloride-induced CTA, which does not involve the dopaminergic system, is not affected by radiation. It was established that the degree of CTA due to radiation is LET-dependent ([figure 6-3]) and that 56Fe- ions are the most effective of the various low and high LET radiation types that have been tested. Doses as low as ~0.2 Gy of 56Fe-ions appear to have an effect on CTA.‚Äù The RBE of different types of heavy particles on CNS function and cognitive/behavioral performance was studied in Sprague-Dawley rats. The relationship between the thresholds for the HZE particle-induced disruption of amphetamine-induced CTA learning is shown in figure 6-4; and for the disruption of operant responding is shown in figure 6-5. These figures show a similar pattern of responsiveness to the disruptive effects of exposure to either 56Fe or 28Si particles on both CTA learning and operant responding. These results suggest that the RBE of different particles for neurobehavioral dysfunction cannot be predicted solely on the basis of the LET of the specific particle. Figure 6-3. ED50 for CTA as a function of LET for the following radiation sources: 40Ar = argon ions, 60Co = Cobalt-60 gamma rays, e‚àí = electrons, 56FE = iron ions, 4He = helium ions, n0 = neutrons, 20Ne = neon ions. Figure 6-4. Radiation-induced disruption in CTA. This figure shows the relationship between exposure to different energies of 56FE and 28Si particles and the threshold dose for the disruption of amphetamine-induced CTA learning. Only a single energy of 48Ti particles was tested. The threshold dose (cGy) for the disruption of the response is plotted against particle LET (keV/Œºm). Figure 6-5.jpg High-LET radiation effects on operant response. This figure shows the relationship between the exposure to different energies of 56Fe and 28Si particles and the threshold dose for the disruption of performance on a food-reinforced operant response. Only a single energy of 48Ti particles was tested. The threshold dose (cGy) for the disruption of the response is plotted against particle LET (keV/Œºm). =Radiation effect on operant conditioning= Operant conditioning uses several consequences to modify a voluntary behavior. Recent studies by Rabin et al. have examined the ability of rats to perform an operant order to obtain food reinforcement using an ascending fixed ratio (FR) schedule. They found that 56Fe-ion doses that are above 2 Gy affect the appropriate responses of rats to increasing work requirements. NCRP Report No. 153 notes that \\"The disruption of operant response in rats was tested 5 and 8 months after exposure, but maintaining the rats on a diet containing strawberry, but not blueberry, extract were shown to prevent the disruption. When tested 13 and 18 months after irradiation, there were no differences in performance between the irradiated rats maintained on control, strawberry or blueberry diets. These observations suggest that the beneficial effects of antioxidant diets may be age dependent.\\" =Spatial learning and memory= The effects of exposure to HZE nuclei on spatial learning, memory behavior, and neuronal signaling have been tested, and threshold doses have also been considered for such effects. It will be important to understand the mechanisms that are involved in these deficits to extrapolate the results to other dose regimes, particle types, and, eventually, astronauts. Studies on rats were performed using the Morris water maze test 1 month after whole-body irradiation with 1.5 Gy of 1 GeV/u 56Fe- ions. Irradiated rats demonstrated cognitive impairment that was similar to that seen in aged rats. This leads to the possibility that an increase in the amount of ROS may be responsible for the induction of both radiation- and age- related cognitive deficits. NCRP Report No. 153 notes that: ‚ÄúDenisova et al. exposed rats to 1.5 Gy of 1 GeV/u56Feions and tested their spatial memory in an eight-arm radial maze. Radiation exposure impaired the rats‚Äô cognitive behavior, since they committed more errors than control rats in the radial maze and were unable to adopt a spatial strategy to solve the maze. To determine whether these findings related to brain-region specific alterations in sensitivity to oxidative stress, inflammation or neuronal plasticity, three regions of the brain, the striatum, hippocampus and frontal cortex that are linked to behavior, were isolated and compared to controls. Those that were irradiated were adversely affected as reflected through the levels of dichlorofluorescein, heat shock, and synaptic proteins (for example, synaptobrevin and synaptophysin). Changes in these factors consequently altered cellular signaling (for example, calciumdependent protein kinase C and protein kinase A). These changes in brain responses significantly correlated with working memory errors in the radial maze. The results show differential brain-region-specific sensitivity induced by 56Fe irradiation ([figure 6-6]). These findings are similar to those seen in aged rats, suggesting that increased oxidative stress and inflammation may be responsible for the induction of both radiation and age-related cognitive deficits.‚Äù Figure 6-6. Brain-region-specific calcium-dependent protein kinase C expression was assessed in control and irradiated rats using standard Western blotting procedures. Values are means ¬± SEM (standard error of mean). =Acute central nervous system risks= In addition to the possible in-flight performance and motor skill changes that were described above, the immediate CNS effects (i.e., within 24 hours following exposure to low-LET radiation) are anorexia and nausea. These prodromal risks are dose-dependent and, as such, can provide an indicator of the exposure dose. Estimates are ED50 = 1.08 Gy for anorexia, ED50 = 1.58 Gy for nausea, and ED50=2.40 Gy for emesis. The relative effectiveness of different radiation types in producing emesis was studied in ferrets and is illustrated in figure 6-7. High-LET radiation at doses that are below 0.5 Gy show greater relative biological effectiveness compared to low- LET radiation. The acute effects on the CNS, which are associated with increases in cytokines and chemokines, may lead to disruption in the proliferation of stem cells or memory loss that may contribute to other degenerative diseases. Figure 6-7. LET dependence of RBE of radiation in producing emesis or retching in a ferret. B = bremsstrahlung; e‚àí = electrons; P = protons; 60Co = cobalt gamma rays; n0 = neutrons; and 56Fe = iron. Computer models and systems biology analysis of central nervous system risks Since human epidemiology and experimental data for CNS risks from space radiation are limited, mammalian models are essential tools for understanding the uncertainties of human risks. Cellular, tissue, and genetic animal models have been used in biological studies on the CNS using simulated space radiation. New technologies, such as three-dimensional cell cultures, microarrays, proteomics, and brain imaging, are used in systematic studies on CNS risks from different radiation types. According to biological data, mathematical models can be used to estimate the risks from space radiation. Systems biology approaches to Alzheimer's disease that consider the biochemical pathways that are important in CNS disease evolution have been developed by research that was funded outside NASA. Figure 6-8 shows a schematic of the biochemical pathways that are important in the development of Alzheimer's disease. The description of the interaction of space radiation within these pathways would be one approach to developing predictive models of space radiation risks. For example, if the pathways that were studied in animal models could be correlated with studies in humans who are suffering from Alzheimer's disease, an approach to describe risk that uses biochemical degrees-of-freedom could be pursued. Edelstein-Keshet and Spiros have developed an in silico model of senile plaques that are related to Alzheimer's disease. In this model, the biochemical interactions among TNF, IL-1B, and IL-6 are described within several important cell populations, including astrocytes, microglia, and neurons. Further, in this model soluble amyloid causes microglial chemotaxis and activates IL-1B secretion. Figure 6-9 shows the results of the Edelstein-Keshet and Spiros model simulating plaque formation and neuronal death. Establishing links between space radiation- induced changes to the changes that are described in this approach can be pursued to develop an in silico model of Alzheimer's disease that results from space radiation. Figure 6-8.Molecular pathways important in Alzheimer's disease. From Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes. Copyrighted image located at http://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway/hsa/hsa05010.html Figure 6-9. Model of plaque formation and neuronal death in Alzheimer's disease. From Edelstein-Keshet and Spiros, 2002 : Top row: Formation of a plaque and death of neurons in the absence of glial cells, when fibrous amyloid is the only injurious influence. The simulation was run with no astrocytes or microglia, and the health of neurons was determined solely by the local fibrous amyloid. Shown above is a time sequence (left to right) of three stages in plaque development, at early, intermediate, and advanced stages. Density of fibrous deposit is represented by small dots and neuronal health by shading from white (healthy) to black (dead). Note radial symmetry due to simple diffusion. Bottom row: Effect of microglial removal of amyloid on plaque morphology. Note that microglia (small star-like shapes) are seen approaching the plaque (via chemotaxis to soluble amyloid, not shown). At a later stage, they have congregated at the plaque center, where they adhere to fibers. As a result of the removal of soluble and fibrous amyloid, the microglia lead to irregular plaque morphology. Size scale: In this figure, the distance between the small single dots (representing low-fiber deposits) is 10 mm. Similar results were obtained for a 10-fold scaling in the time scale of neuronal health dynamics. Other interesting candidate pathways that may be important in the regulation of radiation-induced degenerative CNS changes are signal transduction pathways that are regulated by Cdk5. Cdk5 is a kinase that plays a key role in neural development; its aberrant expression and activation are associated with neurodegenerative processes, including Alzheimer's disease. This kinase is up- regulated in neural cells following ionizing radiation exposure. Risks in context of exploration mission operational scenarios =Projections for space missions= Reliable projections of CNS risks for space missions cannot be made from the available data. Animal behavior studies indicate that high- HZE radiation has a high RBE, but the data are not consistent. Other uncertainties include: age at exposure, radiation quality, and dose-rate effects, as well as issues regarding genetic susceptibility to CNS risk from space radiation exposure. More research is required before CNS risk can be estimated. =Potential for biological countermeasures= The goal of space radiation research is to estimate and reduce uncertainties in risk projection models and, if necessary, develop countermeasures and technologies to monitor and treat adverse outcomes to human health and performance that are relevant to space radiation for short-term and career exposures, including acute or late CNS effects from radiation exposure. The need for the development of countermeasures to CNS risks is dependent on further understanding of CNS risks, especially issues that are related to a possible dose threshold, and if so, which NASA missions would likely exceed threshold doses. As a result of animal experimental studies, antioxidant and anti-inflammation are expected to be effective countermeasures for CNS risks from space radiation. Diets of blueberries and strawberries were shown to reduce CNS risks after heavy-ion exposure. Estimating the effects of diet and nutritional supplementation will be a primary goal of CNS research on countermeasures. A diet that is rich in fruit and vegetables significantly reduces the risk of several diseases. Retinoids and vitamins A, C, and E are probably the most well-known and studied natural radioprotectors, but hormones (e.g., melatonin), glutathione, superoxide dismutase, and phytochemicals from plant extracts (including green tea and cruciferous vegetables), as well as metals (especially selenium, zinc, and copper salts) are also under study as dietary supplements for individuals, including astronauts, who have been overexposed to radiation. Antioxidants should provide reduced or no protection against the initial damage from densely ionizing radiation such as HZE nuclei, because the direct effect is more important than the free-radical-mediated indirect radiation damage at high LET. However, there is an expectation that some benefits should occur for persistent oxidative damage that is related to inflammation and immune responses. Some recent experiments suggest that, at least for acute high-dose irradiation, an efficient radioprotection by dietary supplements can be achieved, even in the case of exposure to high-LET radiation. Although there is evidence that dietary antioxidants (especially strawberries) can protect the CNS from the deleterious effects of high doses of HZE particles, because the mechanisms of biological effects are different at low dose-rates compared to those of acute irradiation, new studies for protracted exposures will be needed to understand the potential benefits of biological countermeasures. Concern about the potential detrimental effects of antioxidants was raised by a recent meta-study of the effects of antioxidant supplements in the diet of normal subjects. The authors of this study did not find statistically significant evidence that antioxidant supplements have beneficial effects on mortality. On the contrary, they concluded that Œ≤-carotene, vitamin A, and vitamin E seem to increase the risk of death. Concerns are that the antioxidants may allow rescue of cells that still sustain DNA mutations or altered genomic methylation patterns following radiation damage to DNA, which can result in genomic instability. An approach to target damaged cells for apoptosis may be advantageous for chronic exposures to GCR. =Individual risk factors= Individual factors of potential importance are genetic factors, prior radiation exposure, and previous head injury, such as concussion. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) has been shown to be an important and common factor in CNS responses. ApoE controls the redistribution of lipids among cells and is expressed at high levels in the brain. New studies are considering the effects of space radiation for the major isoforms of ApoE, which are encoded by distinct alleles (Œµ2, Œµ3, and Œµ4). The isoform ApoE Œµ4 has been shown to increase the risk of cognitive impairments and to lower the age for Alzheimer's disease. It is not known whether the interaction of radiation sensitivity or other individual risks factors is the same for high- and low- LET radiation. Other isoforms of ApoE confer a higher risk for other diseases. People who carry at least one copy of the ApoE Œµ4 allele are at increased risk for atherosclerosis, which is also suspected to be a risk increased by radiation. People who carry two copies of the ApoE Œµ2 allele are at risk for a condition that is known as hyperlipoproteinemia type III. It will therefore be extremely challenging to consider genetic factors in a multipleradiation-risk paradigm. Conclusion Reliable projections for CNS risks from space radiation exposure cannot be made at this time due to a paucity of data on the subject. Existing animal and cellular data do suggest that space radiation can produce neurological and behavioral effects; therefore, it is possible that mission operations will be impacted. The significance of these results on the morbidity to astronauts has not been elucidated, however. It is to be noted that studies, to date, have been carried out with relatively small numbers of animals (<10 per dose group); this means that testing of dose threshold effects at lower doses (<0.5 Gy) has not yet been carried out to a sufficient extent. As the problem of extrapolating space radiation effects in animals to humans will be a challenge for space radiation research, such research could become limited by the population size that is typically used in animal studies. Furthermore, the role of dose protraction has not been studied to date. An approach has not been discovered to extrapolate existing observations to possible cognitive changes, performance degradation, or late CNS effects in astronauts. Research on new approaches to risk assessment may be needed to provide the data and knowledge that will be necessary to develop risk projection models of the CNS from space radiation. A vigorous research program, which will be required to solve these problems, must rely on new approaches to risk assessment and countermeasure validation because of the absence of useful human radio-epidemiology data in this area.

History Originally opened as the Eltinge 42nd Street Theatre, in 1912, it was designed by noted theatre architect Thomas W. Lamb, and named for Julian Eltinge, an American stage and film actor best known as a female impersonator. Its first production was Bayard Veiller's Within the Law, a hit that ran for more than a year. Originally specializing in light comedies, it suffered during the Great Depression and in 1931 became a burlesque theatre, then a movie theater in 1942. It was renamed the Empire Theatre in 1954, after the demolition of the previous theatre of the same name. In 1998, as part of the renewal of 42nd Street led by the New 42nd Street coalition and real estate developer Bruce Ratner, the entire theatre was lifted off its foundation and moved westward approximately . Two large balloons representing Abbott and Costello were rigged to appear as if they were dragging the theater westward. The comedy team first performed together at the Eltinge in 1935. In its new location, the shell of the theatre auditorium was converted into a lobby and lounge for a 25-screen AMC Theatres multiplex, the AMC Empire 25. Escalators pass through the former proscenium arch of the stage to the newly built auditoriums above. The theater opened in April 2000.

Fans affirm their membership in the subculture or scene by attending metal concerts (an activity seen as central to the subculture), buying albums, growing their hair long in some to most cases, wearing jackets or vests often made of denim and adorned with band patches and often studs, and since the early 1980s, by contributing to metal publications.Heavy Metal: The Music And Its Culture, Revised Edition by Deena Weinstein Da Capo Press; Revised edition (April 4, 2000) . Page 294. Some critics and musicians have suggested that the subculture is largely intolerant to other musical genres. The metal scene, like the rock scene in general, is associated with alcohol, tobacco, and drug use as well as riding motorcycles and having many tattoos. While there are songs that celebrate drinking, smoking/dipping, drug use, gambling, having tattoos, and partying, there are also many songs that warn about the dangers of alcohol, tobacco, gambling, tattoo, and drug addictions. The metal fan base was traditionally white and male in the 1970s, and since the 1980s, more female fans have developed an interest in the style. Also, its popularity and interest in it has grown among African Americans and other groups recently. Nomenclature Heavy metal fans go by a number of different names, including metalhead, headbanger, hesher, mosher, and heavy, with the term thrasher being used only for fans of thrash metal music, which began to differentiate itself from other varieties of metal in the late 80s. While the aforementioned labels vary in time and regional divisions, headbanger and metalhead are universally accepted to mean fans or the subculture itself. Subculture Heavy metal fans have created a \\"subculture of alienation\\" with its own standards for achieving authenticity within the group.\\"Three profiles of heavy metal fans: A taste for sensation and a subculture of alienation.\\" In Journal Qualitative Sociology. Publisher Springer Netherlands. ISSN 0162-0436 (Print) 1573-7837 (Online). Issue Volume 16, Number 4 / December, 1993. Pages 423-443 Deena Weinstein‚Äôs book Heavy Metal: The Music And Its Culture argues that heavy metal \\"has persisted far longer than most genres of rock music\\" due to the growth of an intense \\"subculture which identified with the music.\\" Metal fans formed an \\"exclusionary youth community\\" that was \\"distinctive and marginalized from the mainstream\\" society.Heavy Metal: The Music And Its Culture, Revised Edition by Deena Weinstein Da Capo Press; Revised edition (April 4, 2000) The heavy metal scene developed a strongly masculine \\"community with shared values, norms, and behaviors.\\" A \\"code of authenticity\\" is central to the heavy metal subculture; this code requires bands to have a \\"disinterest in commercial appeal\\" and radio hits as well as a refusal to \\"sell out.\\" The metal code also includes \\"opposition to established authority, and separateness from the rest of society.\\" Fans expect that the metal \\"vocation [for performers] includes total devotion to the music and deep loyalty to the youth subculture that grew up around it;\\" a metal performer must be an \\"idealized representative of the subculture.\\" While the audience for metal is mainly \\"white, male, lower/middle class youth,\\" this group is \\"tolerant of those outside its core demographic base who follow its codes of dress, appearance, and behavior.\\" The activities in the metal subculture include the ritual of attending concerts, buying albums, and most recently, contributing to metal websites. Attending concerts affirms the solidarity of the subculture, as it is one of the ritual activities by which fans celebrate their music.Heavy Metal: The Music And Its Culture, Revised Edition by Deena Weinstein Da Capo Press; Revised edition (April 4, 2000) Metal magazines help the members of the subculture to connect, find information and evaluations of bands and albums, and \\"express their solidarity.\\" The long hair, leather jackets, and band patches of heavy metal fashion help encourage a sense of identification within the subculture. However, Weinstein notes that not all metal fans are \\"visible members\\" of the heavy metal subculture. Some metal fans may have short hair and dress in regular clothes. =Authenticity= In the musical subcultures of heavy metal and punk, authenticity is a core value. The term poseur (or poser) is used to describe \\"a person who habitually pretends to be something he/she is not,\\" as in adopting the appearance and clothing style of the metal scene without truly understanding the culture and its music. In a 1993 profile of heavy metal fans' \\"subculture of alienation,\\" the author noted that the scene classified some members as \\"poseurs,\\" that is, heavy metal performers or fans who pretended to be part of the subculture, but who were deemed to lack authenticity and sincerity.\\"Three profiles of heavy metal fans: A taste for sensation and a subculture of alienation.\\" In Journal Qualitative Sociology. Publisher Springer Netherlands. ISSN 0162-0436 (Print) 1573-7837 (Online). Issue Volume 16, Number 4 / December, 1993. Pages 423-443. Jeffrey Arnett's 1996 book Metalheads: Heavy Metal Music and Adolescent Alienation argues that the heavy metal subculture classifies members into two categories by giving \\"acceptance as an authentic metalhead or rejection as a fake, a poseur.\\"Metalheads: Heavy Metal Music and Adolescent Alienation - by Jeffrey Jensen Arnett - 1996 - Music - 196 pages. Heavy metal fans began using the term sell out in the 1980s to refer to bands who turned their heavy metal sound into radio-friendly rock music (e.g., glam metal). In metal, a sell out is \\"someone dishonest who adopted the most rigorous pose, or identity- affirming lifestyle and opinions.\\" The metal bands that earned this epithet are those \\"who adopt the visible aspects of the orthodoxy (sound, images) without contributing to the underlying belief system.\\" Ron Quintana's article on \\"Metallica['s] Early History\\" argues that when Metallica was trying to find a place in the L.A. metal scene in the early 1980s, \\"American hard-rock scene was dominated by highly coiffed, smoothly-polished bands such as Styx, Journey, and REO Speedwagon.\\" He claims that this made it hard for Metallica to \\"play their [heavy] music and win over a crowd in a land where poseurs ruled and anything fast and heavy was ignored.\\" In David Rocher's 1999 interview with Damian Montgomery, the frontman of Ritual Carnage, he praised Montgomery as \\"an authentic, no-frills, poseur-bashing, nun-devouring kind of gentleman, an enthusiastic metalhead truly in love with the lifestyle he preaches . . . and unquestionably practises.\\" In 2002, \\"[m]etal guru Josh Wood\\" claimed that the \\"credibility of heavy metal\\" in North America is being destroyed by the genre's demotion to \\"horror movie soundtracks, wrestling events and, worst of all, the so-called 'Mall Core' groups like Limp Bizkit.\\" Wood claims that the \\"true [metal] devotee‚Äôs path to metaldom is perilous and fraught with poseurs.\\" In an article on metal/hard rock frontman Axl Rose entitled \\"Ex‚Äì‚ÄòWhite-Boy Poseur,\\" Rose admitted that he has had \\"time to reflect on heavy-metal posturing\\" of the last few decades. He notes, ‚ÄúWe thought we were so badass . . . [until] N.W.A came out rapping about this world where you walk out of your house and you get shot.\\" At this point, Rose argues, \\"It was just so clear what stupid little white-boy poseurs we were.\\" Christian metal bands are sometimes criticized within metal circles in a similar light. Some extreme metal adherents argue that Christian bands' adherence to the Christian church is an indicator of membership in an established authority, which renders Christian bands as \\"posers\\" and a contradiction to heavy metal's purpose.Khan-Harris, Keith. Extreme Metal: Music and Culture on the Edge. Oxford: Berg, 2006. Some proponents argue personal faith in right hand path beliefs should not be tolerated within metal.Norsk Black Metal (2003). Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation. A small number of Norwegian black metal bands have threatened violence (and, in extremely rare instances, exhibited it) towards Christian artists or believers, as demonstrated in the early 1990s through occasional church arsons throughout Scandinavia.Grude, Torstein (1998). Satan Rides The Media. Social aspects =Gestures and movements= Death metal band Asphyx headbanging during a performance. At concerts, in place of typical dancing, metal fans are more likely to mosh and headbang ‚Å†(a movement in which the head is shaken up and down in time with the music). Fans in the heavy metal subculture often make the corna hand gesture formed by a fist with the index and little fingers extended. Also known as the \\"devil‚Äôs horns,\\" the \\"metal fist,\\" and other similar descriptors, this gesture was popularized by Black Sabbath and Dio's vocalist Ronnie James Dio, who died in 2010. =Alcohol and drug use= The heavy metal scene is associated with alcohol and drug use.http://arrow.dit.ie/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1054&context;=buschmarcon While there are heavy metal songs which celebrate alcohol or drug use (e.g., \\"Sweet Leaf\\" by Black Sabbath, which is about marijuana), there are many songs which warn about the dangers of alcohol and drug abuse and addiction. \\"Master of Puppets\\" by Metallica (which is about how drug abusers can end up being controlled by the drugs they use) and \\"Beyond the Realms of Death\\" by Judas Priest are two examples of songs that warn about such dangers. Intolerance to other music On a 1985 edition of Australian music television show Countdown, music critic Molly Meldrum spoke about intolerance to other music within the subculture, observing \\"sections who just love heavy metal, and they actually don't like anything else.\\" Queen frontman Freddie Mercury, a guest on the program, readily concurred with Meldrum's view, and opined that his comments were \\"very true\\". Directly addressing the resistance to alternate genres seen among certain heavy metal fans, Mercury asserted: \\"that's their problem\\". Interviewed in 2011, Sepultura frontman Derrick Green said: \\"I find that a lot of people can be very closed minded ‚Äì they want to listen to metal and nothing else, but I'm not like that. I like doing metal music and having a heavy style, but I don't like to put myself in such a box and be trapped in it.\\" Also that year, Anthrax drummer Charlie Benante admitted that hardened members of the heavy metal subculture \\"are not the most open-minded people when it comes to music.\\" Ultimate Guitar reported in 2013 that thrash metal fans had directed \\"hate\\" towards Megadeth for venturing into more rock- oriented musical territory on that year's Super Collider album. Singer Dave Mustaine stated that their hostility was informed by an unwillingness to accept other genres and had \\"nothing to do with Megadeth or the greatness of the band and its music\\"; he also argued that the labelling of music fans contributed to their inability to appreciate other types of music. That same year Opeth frontman Mikael √Ökerfeldt also alleged that most members of the subculture are resistant to the musical evolution of artists within the metal genre, stating that it \\"doesn't seem to be that important\\" to those listeners. He added: \\"I think most metal fans just want their Happy Meals served to them. They don't really want to know about what they're getting. For a while, I thought metal was a more open-minded thing but I was wrong.\\" Journalists have written about the dismissive attitude of many metal fans. MetalReviews.com published a 2004 article entitled \\"The True, Real Metalhead: A Selective Intellect Or A Narrow-Minded Bastard?\\", wherein the writer confessed to being \\"truly bothered by the narrow-mindedness of a lot of [his] metal brothers and sisters\\". Critic Ryan Howe, in a 2013 piece for Sound and Motion magazine, penned an open letter to British metal fans, many of whom had expressed disgust about Avenged Sevenfold ‚Äì whose music they deemed too light to qualify as metal ‚Äì being booked to headline the 2014 instalment of popular metal event the Download Festival. Howe described the detractors as \\"narrow minded\\" and challenged them to attend the Avenged Sevenfold set and \\"be prepared to have [their] opinions changed.\\" Despite widespread lack of appreciation of other music genres, some fans and musicians can profess a deep devotion to genres that often have nothing to do with metal music. For instance, Fenriz of Darkthrone is also known to be a techno DJ, and Metallica's Kirk Hammett is seen wearing a t-shirt of post-punk band The Sisters of Mercy in the music video for \\"Wherever I May Roam\\". Tourniquet band leader Ted Kirkpatrick is a \\"great admirer of the classical masters\\". Some metal fans are also fond of punk rock, most notably the hardcore punk scene which helped inspired the extreme metal subgenres and even fusion genres such as, crossover thrash, grindcore and the New York hardcore scene. Though it has been rumored that punks and metalheads had a bitter rivalry and feud in the past. The term metal elitist is sometimes used by heavy metal fans and musicians to differentiate members of the subculture who display insulated, exclusionary or rigidly conservative attitudes from ostensibly more open-minded ones. Elitist attitudes are particularly associated with fans and musicians of the black metal subgenre. Characteristics described as distinguishing metal elitists or \\"nerds\\" from other fans of metal music include \\"constant one-upping,\\" \\"endless pedantry\\" and hesitancy to \\"go against the metal orthodoxy.\\" While the term \\"metal elitism\\" is usually used pejoratively, elitism is occasionally defended by members of the subculture as a means of keeping the metal genre insulated, in order to prevent it from selling out. Attire Rob Halford of Judas Priest wearing studded leather jacket A man wearing a denim jacket with band patches and artwork of heavy metal bands including Metallica, Guns N' Roses, Iron Maiden, Slipknot and Led Zeppelin Another aspect of heavy metal culture is its fashion. Like the metal music, these fashions have changed over the decades, while keeping some core elements. Typically, the heavy metal fashions of the late 1970s ‚Äì 1980s comprised tight blue jeans or drill pants, motorcycle boots or hi-top sneakers and black t-shirts, worn with a sleeveless kutte of denim or leather emblazoned with woven patches and button pins from heavy metal bands. Sometimes, a denim vest, emblazoned with album art \\"knits\\" (cloth patches) would be worn over a long-sleeved leather jacket. As with other musical subcultures of the era, such as punks, this jacket and its emblems and logos helped the wearer to announce their interests. Metal fans often wear t-shirts with the emblem of bands. Around the mid-2000s, a renaissance of younger audiences became interested in 1980s metal, and the rise of newer bands embracing older fashion ideals led to a more 1980s-esque style of dress. Some of the new audience are young, urban hipsters who had \\"previously fetishized metal from a distance\\". International variations Heavy metal fans can be found in virtually every country in the world. Even in some of the more orthodox Muslim countries of the Arab World a tiny metal culture exists, though judicial and religious authorities do not always tolerate it. In 2003, more than a dozen members and fans of Moroccan heavy metal bands were imprisoned for \\"undermining the Muslim faith.\\" Heavy metal fans in many Arab countries have formed metal cultures, with movements such as Taqwacore. Examples in fiction Heavy metal subculture appears in works of fiction, mostly adult cartoons, and 1980s and 1990s live action movies. *The titular characters of Mike Judge's animated show Beavis and Butt-Head are among the most notorious examples of heavy metal subculture in fiction, being fond of bands representative of, or marginally associated to, the style (such as Metallica and AC/DC, whose logos emblazon the T-shirts of the protagonists respectively). They also exhibit stereotypical metalhead behavior such as headbanging to songs they like, singing guitar riffs in response to good things happening to them, and deeming glam metal bands as \\"wussy\\". However, in a subversion of the stereotype that members of the heavy metal subculture are intolerant towards other styles of music, the duo are very responsive to hip hop music due to them finding it to be just as authentic. *The film and Saturday Night Live program, Wayne's World is another good example of the heavy metal subculture in fiction. *Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure is also a well-known example of heavy metal subculture in fiction, in which the titular characters are time travelers driven by the desire of keeping their band together. *In the Happy Tree Friends episode entitled \\"In a Jam\\", the characters Cuddles, Lumpy, Russell, Handy, and Sniffles are in a rock and roll/heavy metal band. In that episode, they also have a stereotypical metalhead/rocker attitude such as being rude to people auditioning to be in the band, being careless, and even having some hand gestures that belong to the subculture. *In an episode of Family Guy entitled \\"Saving Private Brian\\", Chris Griffin gets inspired by Marilyn Manson to become part of the heavy metal subculture and is mouthy to Lois and Peter, while they, of course, don't like it. *In one episode of SpongeBob SquarePants entitled \\"Krabby Road\\", Plankton makes a rock and roll/heavy metal band called \\"Plankton and the Patty Stealers\\" and gets SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward to be a part of it. *The Disney XD sitcom I'm in the Band featured a teenaged boy named Trip who was the lead guitarist of a heavy metal/rock and roll band called \\"Iron Weasel\\"; the show also focused on heavy metal subculture in high school. *The French- Canadian cartoon My Dad the Rock Star, created by Gene Simmons, featured the father, Rock Zilla, having a family belonging to the rocker/metalhead subculture. His son, William (aka Willy) is the main protagonist as well, but has trouble fitting in with his peers and family since he wants to live a more normal lifestyle. *The Death Metal Epic is a series of comic novels by the writer Dean Swinford. The books tell the story of a death metal guitarist from Florida and is set in the early 1990s, a timeframe in which the genre thrived in the location. *Metalocalypse, TV show that aired from August 6, 2006 to October 27, 2013, features fictional death metal band Dethklok. *The 2009 video game Br√ºtal Legend is set in a world inspired by heavy metal music, and features characters voiced, and visually inspired, by Jack Black, Rob Halford, Lemmy Kilmister, Lita Ford, and Ozzy Osbourne. *The characters, Johnny Klebitz, Jim Fitzgerald, Clay Simons, Terry Thorpe, Patrick McReary, and Brucie Kibbutz, from Grand Theft Auto IV and its episodes are all metalheads.

With Peters√©n was the Norwegian major Dahl, then chief of the Norwegian intelligence office in Stockholm. At the visit there were stated a wish for T√∂rneman to travel to Lillehammer and there take contact with Sala and from him receive certain content. More was not said of that part, and to Stockholm transfer this content and also as much content as T√∂rneman could get his hands on from the German staff at Lillehammer. T√∂rneman were promised assistance from available Norwegian personnel and he selected a Lieutenant Sjetne and Hans Peter Eggen.\\", statement by T√∂rneman in 1948, from the radio program Den mystiska kofferten fr√•n Lillehammer, from 21:05 in the recording that was carried out at Lillehammer shortly after the German capitulation by the end of World War II. Thirty-five German intelligence specialists were transferred along with various equipment first to Sweden and then to U.S. camps in occupied Germany through an agreement between the Americans and the German High Command of the Wehrmacht in Norway. The intelligence material from Operation Claw, among it a Soviet codebook, became very useful for the Americans during the Cold War. Operation Claw was controversial both when it happened and afterwards. In 1945, it was controversial that the Americans operated in what was seen as a British controlled country, and that they secured information about its ally the Soviet Union, in cooperation with neutral Sweden. In later years, a hypothesis that the Norwegian resistance fighter Kai Holst's sudden death in June 1945 was related to his involvement in the Operation Claw has been put forward by among others the historian Tore Pryser.  Background  Even before the war in Europe ended the various allied states had begun the search for German scientists and other German expertise. Signals intelligence had been vital during World War II and especially the British work with breaking the German codes, from the Enigma had been of huge importance. The Yalta Conference in February 1945 had revealed conflicts of interest between the western allied nations on one side and the Soviet Union and the relation was severely strained. American intelligence organisations were very interested in German intelligence experts knowledge of the Soviet Union and immediately after the war in Europe ended they began to cooperate with the German Major General Reinhard Gehlen and his organisation Fremde Heere Ost (FHO) which had led German intelligence on the Eastern Front. It was part of an organized effort to obtain as much German intelligence information and personnel as possible; the operation had the name Target Intelligence Committee (TICOM). The war was however still fought in East-Asia, the US and the Soviet Union were still allies and the Americans were counting on Soviet assistance in the war against Japan. The allies had designated Norway as part of the British sphere of influence. \\"The so-called \\"Lillehammer-kuppet\\" (Norwegian name, translators remark) or Operation Claw as OSS called it, was executed behind the back of both the British and the Norwegians. British military authorities were in charge of the German capitulation in Norway. Thus Sala's men and archives were British war bounty. But the British was (sic) cheated by the Swedes which again cooperated with the americans.\\", Svik og gr√•soner, 162 Both for the US and the neutral Sweden the operation was thus very sensitive and was conducted in great secrecy.\\"Donovan himself flew from Washington to London for a conference regarding the transfer. It happened in great secrecy. Especially the Swedish high command feared that the transfer would be discovered and would be a problem for Sweden's official policy of neutrality. In a memorandum dated June 7, 1945 from J. T. Kloman to brigadier Kessler, the US military attach√© in Stockholm it is revealed that the transfer had to be fast In order to avoid all complications with the Norwegians and the Russians (Tore Prysers utheving).¬ª, Svik og gr√•soner, 186 Swedish‚ÄìAmerican cooperation Kai Holst, assisting the British‚ÄìNorwegian razzia at Lillehammer, was reported dead by suicide in Stockholm the day after. In the Wehrmacht camp at Lillehammer a group of 35 German experts on signals intelligence were gathered. They had been working on the Eastern Front against Soviet forces and had an archive and extensive knowledge about Soviet affairs. This was knowledge the Western Allies, and especially the Americans, wanted and that probably also were of use during the Cold War. In cooperation with the American intelligence organisation Office of Strategic Services (OSS) and with knowledge and support from the Norwegian legation\\"On the day of capitulation Algot T√∂rneman, with Norwegian knowledge and with good contacts with the Norwegians, got the task of going to Lillehammer to collect Sallas' archive.

The transfer to Sweden of the German experts at Lillehammer, that OSS called Operation Claw, was directed from the highest level. From the U.S. side the leader of OSS, Major General William J. Donovan was involved, from the Swedish side the chief of the Defense Staff, Major General Carl August Ehrensv√§rd. The famous Swedish police director Harry S√∂derman was also involved from the Swedish side.Svik og gr√•soner, 165 British‚ÄìNorwegian raid of June 1945 More than a month after the German capitulation, a British led search supported by Norwegian personnel \\"The razzia was initiated and led by the British major W.

The next day he was found shot at the top of the staircase in an apartment building at Rind√∂gatan 42 on G√§rdet. The official cause of death was stated as suicide, but neither Holst's family nor many of his colleagues from the resistance movement have accepted this and are of the opinion that he was liquidated.\\"Also a lot of other friends and colleagues of Holst from the war reject the suicide theory. They argue that the Swedish police showed little ability or will in solving the case\\", Fra varm til kald krig, 105 The historian Tore Pryser has put forward the hypothesis that Holst brought with him information from Lillehammer that could damage Operation Claw and thus was killed.Fra varm til kald krig, 127‚Äì129 To be able to damage the operation Kai Holst can not have been trusted as others were. He must have been considered a threat due to his contact with Alexandra Kollontaj who was ambassador in Stockholm representing Soviet Union. A possible reason for a murder of Kai Holst was thus not his knowledge as such but his connections.

It is native to western North America, including the western United States and northern Mexico. It has been found in many other parts of the United States, all the way to the East Coast. It has been reported from Toronto.Cabrera, B. J. and R.H. Scheffrahn. Western drywood termite (Incisitermes minor). Publication Number EENY-248. University of Florida IFAS Extension and Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. 2001. Revised 2005. It has been introduced to Hawaii. It has been noted in China and it is not uncommon in Japan. This is an economically important pest of wooden structures, including houses. In California and Arizona alone its economic impact is estimated to be about $250 million per year. Within a single colony there are three types of termites, the alates, soldier, and worker. This eusocial species is a dark brown color and has an orange head. The colonies are most active during the spring and summer, preferring to be active in higher temperatures. Morphology There are three types of termites within the colony: the alate (swarmer), the soldier and the worker. Alates have an orange-brown head and pronotum, an 11-12.5 mm long, dark brown abdomen. This is the only caste that leaves the colony, which happens when they seek a mate. If they are successful, they will form the new kings and queens. There are also soldiers, which are large, reddish-brown, and have two teeth visible on the left mandible. They are noted for having a larger third antennal segment. They are 8‚Äì12 mm long, and can weigh from 20‚Äì25 mg. This eusocial species does not have a normal worker caste. There are ‚Äúpseudergates‚Äù which are false workers characterized by their lack of wing pads, as well as \\"nymphs\\" which do possess wing pads. These wing pads allow the nymphs to molt into a soldier or an alate, because they are not sterile. These workers are not the bottom class, meaning they are capable of becoming soldiers and alates. The pseudergates group is also able to change into male or female alates just by molting, which is very different from other insect species. They are dark brown and have an orange head. The soldiers are larger than the alates, and they reach an average length of 0.4 inches, and have a broad red head with black mandibles. They have a larger third segment as well. Distribution In the United States the termite is found in northern California, Oregon, and Washington. In California it is found mainly in the central valley. It is also found in central Arizona and into Baja California and Sonora. Due to travel there has also been isolated groups of this termite found in other states, particularly Florida. Infestations have been found in Arkansas, Iowa, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Oklahoma, Ohio, Georgia, South Carolina, and Louisiana. There have also infestations in China and Japan. Habitat This is the California Oak Woodland, one of the places where this termite makes its nests. This termite is adapted to the Mediterranean climate of its native range in California and the surrounding regions. It is a relatively dry climate with hot summers and little rainfall in many areas. It lives in California oak woodland and other local ecosystems, where it inhabits trees. It builds its nests in dead parts of California bay laurel, willows, cottonwoods, oaks, and sycamores, and in stumps, fallen branches, and logs. Nearer to human-inhabited areas it lives in many types of native, introduced, and cultivated plants, such as roses, pyracantha, oleander, alder, ash, avocado, carob, citrus, elderberry, mulberry, walnut, and many kinds of Prunus. It is able to persist in other climate types, as evidenced by its isolated occurrences across North America, including many in Florida, and its establishment in Japan. It also does not require plants. It just as easily builds its colonies in wooden structures. It is a household pest. It has been introduced to new areas in shipments of wooden furniture and lumber. It has been observed colonizing a wooden bench. In structures it infests wood flooring, window frames, door frames, fascia boards, and soffits. It occupies utility poles.Baker, P. B. and R. J. Marchosky. Arizona Termites of Economic Importance. AZ1369. Cooperative Extension, University of Arizona. Tucson. 2005. In Japan it infests tatami.Indrayani, Y. and T. Yoshimura. (2006). Feeding ecology of the invasive dry-wood termite Incisitermes minor (Hagen) in Japan. Sustainable Humanosphere: The Bulletin of the Research Institute for Sustainable Humanosphere. Kyoto University. 2 11. Life cycle and reproduction Termites swarm in order to reproduce. This is when large groups of the termite gather in a specific location to mate, before going separate ways to establish colonies. The alate group engages in the swarming behavior. The alate group swarms in late September through November in Southern California. On warmer days, the termites will swarm earlier in the day. Swarming occurs on days with temperatures between 26.7‚Äì37.8 ¬∞C (80 to 100 ¬∞F). The alates emerge from inside the wood nest, and as they reach the outside they will take off. The alates are not able to fly well, and therefore do not move far from their emergence point. When they land, they remove their wings and crawl around (wingless) to find a mate. Once a mate is found they engage in courtship activity. In finding a mate, the females crawl with the male behind. Once the female accepts the male they are now mated for life, and are now the king and the queen. In order to begin a colony, the male and female have to find a piece of wood with a hole in it, which they will enter and create a royal cell. This whole process can take three to four days. When they are done excavating they have to plug the hole with gut contents. Afterwards they enter a long period of inactivity, for approximately nine months; during this period the queen will begin to lay eggs. After nine months the eggs are hatched and the queen and king feed them until they can begin to excavate the wood. Eventually the new termites will be able to consume wood on their own. At this point they will be a wingless worker caste that will forage and begin to feed the next generation of new termites. They are the ones that damage the wood as they eat and digest it to feed and take care of the nest. In the next two years as more eggs hatch, the king and queen have a small colony, including a soldier and probably a dozen or so nymphs. Each termite has seven instars, which are different developmental stages after which they shed their skin and assumed different body forms. It can take about a year for the termite to go from egg to maturity. With time the females undergo physogastry ‚Äì where the ovaries enlarge and the abdomen swells. The kings look the same as when he dropped his wings. As the colony matures and workers mature, they will become either soldiers or reproductives. The reproductives will be the new swarmers will exit the wood to form new colonies. Those alates will then go on to mate and form their own nests. The colonies are slow growing. It can take five to seven years before there is visible damage in the wood from feeding. There are also secondary reproductive pairs that can appear, but it is very rare. There are only multiple pairs if it is a mixture of two different colonies. Behavior Like other termites, this species is eusocial, living in a colony with a caste system. There are different types of adult insect: the alate, or swarmer, the soldier, and the pseudergate. The alates are the swarmers, and they can be male or female. The eusocial groups are important because it allows them to have multiple generations that can take care of the young. It also allows for specialization, so that there is a specific class that can be best suited to defending the nest and other which are better at foraging. =Food gathering= The termites feed on wood and excavate very similarly to other termites. Their feeding behavior results in larger, more cavernous, irregular evacuations. I. minor also excavates toward the outer edge of the food, but it does not break the wood. They accomplish this by leaving a thin, outer layer, which is protective. This often gives the wood the appearance of being strong, but it is still weakened from the eating on the inside. The termites are also known to feed on dead tree branches, and not just feeding on live trees. There is also a feeding hierarchy within the colony. In an experiment, filter paper was marked with Rb (Rubidium) to show that not all the termites in the colonies feed. The analysis of the Rb levels indicated that in the hierarchy the nymphs are the primary donors, the primary eaters, and the larvae are the primary recipients. This experiment is able to show this because those that directly eat the Rb labeled filter paper have a higher concentration of Rb in their body than those termite that are eating the food second hand after being fed. The alates might also require more care before swarming. As the termites eat, they leave very little signs that they are present in the wood. However, they do have a small hole on the surface of the wood through which they eject their fecal pellets. The fecal pellets are hard, and evenly shaped, and found in conical piles or scattered on horizontal surfaces. The fecal pellets have the same hydrocarbons as the species of termite, and each termite has unique cuticular hydrocarbons. Many other species of termites have bacterial and fungal loads that exist with the colonies, but I. minor prefer drier forms of wood have very small bacterial and fungal microbial loads. The termites do have a preference to the type of wood that they like to consume. The termites are most likely to eat wood that is not tainted with repellent chemicals in the wood. The termites are also more likely to consume wood from which the colony has developed. The Douglas fir is the most popular wood that the termites like to consume. Termites that were exposed to extracts of least-preferred wood have a slight increase in mortality, indicating that the type of wood is important for survival. The strain of wood that was least preferred was a strain of commercial timber called Karamatsu wood. This strain experienced the lowest loss in mass and is therefore considered the most resistant. =Activity levels= The termite's activity is associated with the temperature. Termite activity is highest during the spring and summer. However, an increase in temperature, even in the winter months, can cause an increase in activity. Activity is also lowest during the morning, peaking in the later afternoon. There is a very strong correlation between the temperature and the activity of the termites. As there is an increase in temperature there is an increase in activity. As the termites are more activity, they have an increase in the release of CO2. Impacts This species is probably the most destructive of the dryland termite species in the western United States, while rhinotermitidae subterranean termite damage is more costly. The western subterranean termite (Reticulitermes hesperus) is considered to be the worst termite pest in California, with I. minor in second place.Lewis, V. R. Pest Notes: Drywood Termites. Publication 7440. Statewide IPM Program, Agriculture and Natural Resources, University of California. 2002. This is a picture of what wood looks like after it has been eaten by termites. The inside is full of holes, so the strength is compromised. In Southern California, it is estimated that this species represents about half of all reports of wood-destroying organisms, and much more closer to the coastline. Urban sprawl will likely increase populations. It will also probably continue to spread to new areas. It was discovered in the historic New Orleans building Perseverance Hall in 1999, where it was probably introduced in furniture shipped from the west. One common vector of introduction is the boat, such as the yachts and other craft that launch from Southern California. The termite was noted in Australia after having been inadvertently delivered by boat. Management As a pest of human habitation, this termite has been the target of many pest control methods. In severe infestations a structure may be tented and fumigated with sulfuryl fluoride. This generally kills all the termites in the structure. Less extreme spot treatments can be made by drilling into the gallery and injecting pesticide, such as pyrethroids or imidacloprid. A gel bait containing hydramethylnon has been effective in experiments. In the movement away from pesticides other treatments have been developed, such as the blasting of hot air into the colonies, or the application of liquid nitrogen. A microwave- emitting device can be used to \\"cook\\" the colony, or a low-current, high- voltage \\"gun\\" device can deliver an electric shock. If possible, infested wood can simply be removed from the structure and replaced, and infested trees or dead wood piles can be removed.

At the end of the Edo period, Kuwana Castle was home to a branch the Matsudaira clan, daimy≈ç of Kuwana Domain. The castle was also known as or .  History  During the late Heian period and Muromachi period, the area of modern Kuwana was known as and was a major seaport on the east coast of Japan, controlled by a guild of merchants. The poet Socho described it in 1515 as a major city with over a thousand houses, temples and inns. The port was protected by three fortifications, (Higashi Castle, Nishi Castle, Misaki Castle) which made up what was known as the ‚ÄúThree Castles of Kuwana‚Äù. During the Sengoku period, the area came under the control of the warlord Oda Nobunaga, followed by Toyotomi Hideyoshi, who initially installed Nobunaga‚Äôs younger son Oda Nobukatsu as ruler as all of Ise Province until the Battle of Odawara, In 1595, Hideyoshi assigned Ujiie Yukihiro a 22,000 koku domain, but he was dispossessed by Tokugawa Ieyasu after the Battle of Sekigahara. Kuwana then came under the control of Honda Tadakatsu, who built a new castle on the riverbank on what was roughly the site of the old Higashi Castle. Under the Honda, Kuwana-juku developed as a prosperous post town on the vital T≈çkaid≈ç highway connecting Edo with Kyoto. Kuwana Castle at this point was protected on three sides by a river. It had a six-story donjon 3 three-story yagura, 24 two-story yagura, 12 one-story yagura and 46 gates. In 1616, the Honda were transferred to Himeji Domain, and Kuwana domain came under the control of a branch of the Matsudaira clan, who would rule Kuwana throughout the remainder of the Edo period. The castle burned down in a fire of 1701, which also destroyed most of the surrounding castle town. The Tokugawa shogunate did not grant permission for the donjon to be rebuilt, and the rest of the castle was restored on a much smaller scale. During the Bakumatsu period, Kuwana was ruled by Matsudaira Sadaaki, key supporter of the Tokugawa clan in the Boshin War. However, in his absence while fighting the Satch≈ç Alliance in northern Japan, the castle was surrendered to without a battle. It was set on fire by troops of the Meiji government and after the Meiji Restoration, its stone walls were demolished to form part of the breakwater at Yokkaichi Port. In 1928, the inner bailey and a portion of the second bailey were made into a public part, the and the castle site became a Mie Prefectural Historical Landmark in 1942. The current structures include two reconstructed yagura.

A fortnight later, the two begin dating and eventually enter into a live-in relationship.

Mr. Gupta (Tarun Vyas), a neighbour of Gayatri, catches Raghu with Gayatri and tries to create distrust between them, but the couple are able to reconcile and decide to get married. However, on the day of the wedding, Gayatri runs out on him, and Raghu is left inconsolable.

Overseas Dawn's film critic Mohammad Kamran Jawaid said that \\"Shuddh Desi Romance has an innovative twist on the love triangle, spiffy songs, a mix of adequate to engaging performances (Mr. Rajput is adequate, Ms. Chopra is engaging, Ms. Kapoor is somewhere in between) and just about apt technical intelligence that doesn‚Äôt overpower the story Mr. Sharma has in mind.

Both, East and West German foreign policy was tilted towards India as the largest country with the largest economy and maybe also because of the mentioned historical traditions idealizing India. In addition, East Germany had a preference for India because of India's attachment to the Soviet Union through the treaty of friendship and mutual cooperation concluded in 1972. Although, East Germany retained neutrality policy during the 1971 war of India and Pakistan; East Germany became the third country in the world, and the first country in Europe, to officially recognized Bangladesh in 1972 after its succeeded independence in 1971. In addition, East Germany supported the USSR and Afghanistan during the Soviet-Afghan War in the 1980s, whereas Pakistan supported the opposing mujahideen rebels. Furthermore, East Germany viewed Pakistan as a United States ally by and, therefore, had a low priority in its foreign relations.

Biography He was born in Amsterdam. According to Johan van Gool who devoted six pages to his biography in his Nieuwe Schouburg, Melder's father Cornelis Melder died when he was six, and he was named after his grandfather, the Utrecht fortifications master Gerard Melder, who published an instructional booklet in 1658 on the Utrecht fortifications. Gerard Melder Biography, Part 2, page 226 in Nieuwe Schouburg (with painter index), (1750) by Jan van Gool, in the Institute of Dutch History This younger Gerard Melder made copies on ivory after Rosalba Carriera whose miniatures he collected. He became acquainted with the works of Rosalba after Theodoor Wilkens returned from Italy with a few of them. Melder became, through practise, quite good at making Rosalba-like miniature copies of Dutch masters for snuffboxes, and later tried his hand at larger works. Van Gool mentioned copies by his hand of works by Gerard Dou, Adriaen van der Werff, and Hans Rottenhammer. In 1728 he married Margareta Schalkwijk a Velden, and in 1735 they moved to Utrecht. Van Gool used a portrait of Margaretha Wulfraet that was in Melder's possession for his engraved portrait of her. According to the RKD he was also a follower of Herman Saftleven, and is known for etchings and watercolors as well as his copied miniatures on ivory after old masters.Gerard Melder in the RKD He died in Utrecht.

The technique is thought to have its origins in Sumer about 5,000 years ago. This technique then spread to southern Europe during the orientalizing period, also through the role of Phoenicians, who had founded colonies in Sardinia, Sicily and Spain, or Near Eastern craftsmen. In the first millennium B.C. the technique was used by Etruscans living in present-day Italy. Greek craftsmen also employed the technique, but it was the work coming from Etruria which became famous, in part due to the mysteries surrounding the process. http://www.langantiques.com/university/index.php/Granulation_and_its_Techniques Decorative granulation Granulation may be employed in three elaborate ways. The outline style, in which lines of grains are used as an adjunct to embossed forms. The silhouette style, in which figures are rendered with solid masses of grains and the reserved silhouette style, a very rare technique in which the background is filled in with grains, while the main features are embossed but are otherwise left undecorated. There are three basic techniques that may be used to attach granules to a metal surface: hard soldering, fusing and colloidal soldering. The metals used in granulation are usually gold and/or silver alloys of high purity - alloys below 18 kt. gold and sterling silver being unsuitable. With each technique the process begins with the making of the granules themselves. The granules are usually made from the same material as the base to which they will be affixed. Very narrow fringes may be cut along the edge of a thin sheet of metal, a further cut producing small squares or rectangles of metal. After being melted into globules, these may be sorted into various sizes by the use of appropriate meshes. Another option is to use thin wire coiled around a mandrel, the coil then being cut into small rings - this creates even-sized granules when melted. Hard soldering metal items together exploits the capillary action of solder with a lower melting point flowing between the items to be bonded. Soldering is routinely used by bench jewellers and is an ancient technique, but is applied with great difficulty to small metal grains. Extremely small pieces of solder are positioned close to the point of contact between the granule and the metal, and then heated to melting point. The necessity of repeating this process many hundreds of times renders the technique impractical and expensive, complicated by the possibility of dislodging granules already attached. An improvement to this method is filing the solder to powder size and mixing it with the flux. The work area is painted with tragacanth and the granules are bedded on this using a fine brush. Having dried, the work is sprinkled with the flux-solder powder and heated to melting point. Surplus solder will lodge in the gaps between the granules, an effect which cannot be avoided. Fusing joins metals composed of the same alloy by the use of heat alone. A sheet of metal of thickness near the diameter of the granules ensures an even heat distribution. The granules are positioned using a diluted flux and fine brush, after which the sheet is fired in a reducing oven. At melting temperature the granules and sheet metal fuse, leaving no flux or solder. This technique was used by the Etruscans in the first millennium B.C. Modern techniques achieve fusing by using electric current and the process is known as fusion welding. The electric current passes through each granule, generating sufficient heat to weld the granules to the base. This method may be used on finished items, even those with set stones. Colloidal or eutectic soldering was used by the Etruscans, and employs a colloidal mixture of tragacanth gum and copper salts. The mixture lowers the melting points of both granules and base, and causes the copper to diffuse into both at the point of contact, creating a strong metallic bond. The colloidal solder is painted onto the surface of the base, and the granules arranged on the wet solder using a fine brush, after which the piece is left to dry. It is then fired in a reducing kiln causing the tragacanth to burn off and release the copper salt. At the eutectic temperature (890 ¬∞C) the copper diffuses into the granules and base, joining them together.

History  The Barony of Geraki was established ca. 1209, after the conquest of the Peloponnese by the Crusaders, and was one of the original twelve secular baronies within the Principality of Achaea. The barony, with six knight's fiefs attached to it, was given to Guy of Nivelet, who built the fortress of Geraki near ancient Geronthrae.Miller (1921), pp. 71‚Äì72Bon (1969), pp. 112, 510 Like the Barony of Passavant in western Laconia, Geraki was built as a stronghold in an unruly border region. It was not until ca. 1248, with the fall of the last Byzantine fortress, Monemvasia, that Laconia was fully pacified, and Geraki's purpose was to keep watch over the rebellious Tsakones who inhabited the northern Parnon.Miller (1921), p. 72Bon (1969), pp. 73, 112, 113 Guy of Nivelet, who is securely attested ca. 1228/30, was succeeded as baron by John of Nivelet, perhaps his son.Bon (1969), pp. 112‚Äì113 In the 1260s, Geraki fell to the resurgent Byzantines, but it is unclear exactly when. George Pachymeres mentions it as one of the fortresses (along with Grand Maigne, Mystras and Monemvasia) that Prince William II of Villehardouin agreed to hand over as ransom for his release from captivity. In reality, although Geraki was most probably not immediately surrendered, its exposed position made it vulnerable and it likely fell, if not in the first Byzantine offensives of 1263‚Äì64, then certainly by ca. 1268/70.Bon (1969), pp. 113, 123, 125‚Äì126, 135 Following the loss of Geraki, the Nivelet family was compensated with new lands in Messenia.

In 1950, aged 22, he moved to the Bah√≠a State capital Salvador where he founded the weekly \\"Critica\\", the only opposition paper to the then governor R√©gis Pacheco. In 1951 he moved to Recife where, while studying law at the Federal University of Pernambuco, he worked as Associated Press reporter on several local dailies such as the Jornal do ComercioJornal do Comercio and for Radio Clube and Radio Olinda. Together with Francisco Juli√£o, who became their president, he was co- founder of the Nordeste Peasant LeagueWhen the Pernambuco Agricultural and Cattle Raising Society of Planters, SAPP, located on the Galil√©ia Plantation, in Vit√≥ria de Santo Ant√£o, Pernambuco, was formed. Re: Peasant Leagues /Ligas Campon√™sas movement in Pernambuco. The insights which gave rise to what was eventually to become the Organization Workshop were the unanticipated outcome of a clandestine meeting held by a large group of Peasant League middle managers in an ordinary townhouse, in Recife in 1954, to study Brazilian Agrarian Law, and which Clodomir de Morais attended. An evaluation conducted six months after that meeting found that participants had made remarkable contributions to their home communities, in some cases in marked contrast to previous behavior. Rather than improved knowledge of agrarian law (most of which had been forgotten), they had developed strong organizational skills. de Morais attributed this unexpected outcome to the fact that \\"the cramped conditions of the house, combined with the need for secrecy so as not to arouse the suspicion of the police, ... had imposed on the group a strict organizational discipline in terms of division and synchronization of all the tasks needed for such an event\\". This insight led Moraes to think about practical exercises where a shared resource base, activity, and the need for analytical thought would stimulate organizational consciousness.Correia in From the early 1960s onwards de Morais staged workshops of an experimental characterknown originally as 'Experimental Workshop on Theory of Organization' (EWTO) see: and 5.6: for the nature and reason for the artificial aspect of the 'Experimental' Workshop. among the Pernambuco Peasant Leagues. In 1955 de Morais was elected delegate to the Pernambuco Federal Assembly where he was instrumental in getting approval for the creation of the Pernambucan Development Bank.In 1998 taken over by ABN/AMRO and in 2008 by Santander. about which he quipped \\"I am hopeless with money, yet am responsible for one of the big banks in the country\\". The military coup d'√©tat of 1 April 1964 overthrew the Jo√£o Goulart government. Left-wing politicians and activists were arrested. Paulo Freire recounts that de Morais had already been imprisoned and tortured ‚Äì he, and his then wife ‚Äì well before the coup (1962), \\"by the Police of Carlos Lacerda, in Rio de Janeiro\\", \\"because of his political activities\\" which meant that, including 1964 post-Coup, he spent \\"a total of two years in prison\\". Paulo Freire himself was arrested at the time of the coup and spent some time with his friend de Morais in the same tiny cell in the Olinda prison.Paulo Freire and Clodomir Morais in 1997 at the University of Rond√¥nia (Amazonia) See also Correia in Among the many incriminating counts the Military held against de Morais (he ranked an honorary 12th on the Junta's list of the 100 troublemakers who had their civil rights suspended for 10 years)Ato No1 were his and the Peasant League's Cuban sympathies, e.g. the hospitality he gave in his house, in 1961, to a visiting Cuban Central Committee member.To be understood in the context of President J√¢nio Quadros' visit, the year before, to Cuba, accompanied by two League Officers re: Moraes, 1970 p.478 and the Left‚Äôs armed struggle in Brazil During his captivity Clodomir, always a raconteur, wrote a series of stories from \\"deep Brazil\\". At a much later stage in life, de Morais would reminisce about those days of liberating struggle. de Morais was forced into exile for 15 years and was granted asylum at the Chilean Embassy in Rio de Janeiro.  1964‚Äì1988: Years of Exile and spread of the Organization Workshop  While in Chile, Clodomir specialized in cultural anthropology at University of Chile, and in Agrarian Reform at the Agrarian Reform Capacitation and Research Institute (ICIRA),ICIRA after which he was appointed ILO Regional Advisor on Agrarian Reform for Central America. In 1968, as consultant for the National Agrarian Institute (INA)INA of Honduras, he set up a \\"Centre\\" OW at the Guanchias CooperativeRojas in in the course of which the construction of the Centre itself became an integral part of that OW. The \\"Centre\\" OW ‚Äì (and, later on, the \\"Course\\" and \\"Enterprise\\" OW) ‚Äì was a variation on the main \\"Field\\" OW theme. The latter is always open to local large group participation, \\"regardless of age, sex, color, religion or whatever\\",Correia in and lasts one month. The former, which may last three months or more, has participants, OW fashion, entirely in charge of internal organization and management, and is structured around the formation of cadres and (future) OW Directors and Assistants (known as APIs). The inspiration for these \\"boarding\\" type OWs came from a CEPAL-led course for international economic development experts which Clodomir attended during his studies in Santiago (Chile) in 1965.Correia in It was to Guanchias that development and agrarian reform agencies would send their recruits for initiation into the OW.see 1980's period: OW spread by former Guanchias recruits and notes 67‚Äì69 below In 1969 he directed a large \\"Centre\\" OW in Panam√° in the context of Omar Torrijos' Mil Jovenes (Thousand Youths) Operation which sent out 1,000 young Panamanians to reproduce the OW in support of the government's agrarian reform. 280 new enterprises resulted, grouped under the Panamanian CONAC (National Confederation of Campesino Land Settlements) which subsequently organized other OW learning events nationally.Sobrado in In 1970 (until 1973) de Morais, on account of the ILO, moved to Costa Rica where a new Land Settlement Policy had just come in operation. His conferences at the University of Costa Rica and the Universidad Nacional aroused a keen interest. At the behest of T. Quir√≥s, president of the Institute for Lands and Colonization (ITCO), an ILO- funded Centre OW was arranged in Bata√°n.Bata√°nre: The new cadres and OW directors formed there were responsible, in 1973 alone, for 80 new pre- cooperative groups and 15 new enterprises.Sobrado in Barrantes' 1998 book Coopesilencio: 25 years on traces the story of one of the many long-term surviving cooperative enterprises hailing back to those groundbreaking years.see Organization Workshop 'Long term survival'see also 'External Links' After having spent some time as visiting scholar at the University of Wisconsin, US, de Morais was again in Honduras from 1973 until 1976 as FAO consultant in charge of the PROCCARAPROCCARA Program (Campesino Capacitation Program for Agrarian Reform), which was to become the blueprint for the \\"Honduran Model\\", the application of the OW on a countrywide basis.Later on, in Brazil, known as PROGER (Employment and Income Generation Program), PRONAGER (National Program for Employment and Income Generation) and SIPGER/SIPGEI (Employment and Income Generation ‚Äì Identification ‚Äì System): and in which 27,000 Hondurans and other nationals, mainly campesinos but also students and public sector workers, participated in more than 200 OWs. This led to the creation of 1,053 new enterprises, some of the bigger ones, such as the palm oil growing and processing plants Hondupalma,Hondupalma celebrated its 30th year of operation in 2012 SalamaPalm Oil Producers in Honduras Salama p3 and Coapalma still operating today. When his Honduras contract came to an end in 1976, de Morais, at the invitation of the Centre for Ecology and Sustainable Development (CECODES) took charge of the FAO/UNDP-funded (Mex74/006) Integrated Rural Development Program for Humid Tropics (PRODERITH) project in Mexico in 1977‚Äì78. PRODERITH ran various OWs in San Luis Potos√≠, Chiapas and Tabasco. See Rojas in for a full-length description of Tampa√≥n (San Luis Potos√≠) OW experience. In 1985 de Morais, then visiting professor in East Germany, returned to Mexico for the official signing of a new tranche of World Bank funding for PRODERITH projects.Rojas in This was the start of a long OW presence in Mexico, from the \\"Enterprise\\" OW with the Huatusco, Veracruz coffee growers in the 90s, the Tabasco OWs in the noughties up to the recent Mexico City OW-based large scale \\"¬°Que Buena Puntada!\\" sewing cooperatives led by Ver√≥nica ViloriaVer√≥nica Viloria is one of the group of OW Directors formed by de Morais personally when he was visiting professor in Chapingo in 2000-2 in 2007‚Äì2012 Mexico City. In Portugal, the Carnation Revolution and the subsequent 1976 free elections had brought the Salazar/Caetano corporatist regime in Portugal to an end. The new Soares government set up INSCOOP,INSCOOP or the 'Antonio Sergio Institute for the Cooperative Sector', tasked with instilling organizational and management skills in the profileration of 3,800-plus post-revolution cooperative enterprises.Correia in de Morais, then in Mexico, was asked to take charge, as ILO consultant, of the ILO/SIDA/UNDP-funded Cooperative Development POR/ILO/UNDP/007 Project. In 1979 de Morais ran a \\"Course\\" OW lasting 5 months for a group 50 Portuguese TDE (Economic Development Expert) candidates with higher levels of education, with an additional ten candidates from Africa, Guatemala and Brazil (de Morais was still banned in his home country). These TDEs were to become the backbone of the first European national SIPGEI (Social Participation System for the Identification of Job and Income Generation Projects). Eventually a \\"6,000-strong army of experts at grassroots, middle and higher-ranking levels, who had graduated from the massive capacitation programs realized by INSCOOP\\", would be formed.I.&I.Labra; in Correia notes that it was by means of this capacitation program that the ground was prepared for Portugal's imminent entry into the European Community. Shortly after the Portugal assignment came Clodomir's transfer to Nicaragua at the behest of the new Sandinista government, which had requested him to set up a 'SIPGER' (Job Creation System), identical to the national PROCCARA project he previously had run in Honduras, in this case on account of the Nicaraguan ILO/INRA-sponsored COPERA (Capacitation Project for the Organization of Producers and Job Creation) Program.I.&I.; Labra in de Morais ran some initial pilot OWs in Nicaragua until, in December 1980, the Sandinista government caught cold feet about going national.For the reasons, see: Organization Workshop 'Controversy' section and The further spread of the OW in the 1980s was due partly to de Morais visiting other Latin American countries where he gave talks and lectures and attended seminars at a number of universities,In his 1987 doctoral thesis de Morais cites a number of international meetings on the OW which he either chaired or attended: the 1975 Tegucigalpa (Hond.) Seminar with delegates from 6 countries in the Central American isthmus, plus Mexico and Venezuela; the two San Jos√© (Costa Rica) Symposia of 1977 and 1981 in which most previous countries took part, 'plus delegates from Colombia, Peru, the Dominican Republic and Haiti' and the Caracas conference (Venezuela) of 1982 with participation from Central America and Venezuela. Sobrado in In later years, under the auspices of the EU ALFA network, an international conference with Clodomir as guest speaker was organized in 1998 in Manchester, UK (). A number of Masters and PhD theses were written on the OW in Spanish, English, Portuguese and Italian. but mainly due to the fact that Honduras in general and the Honduran Guanchias centerRojas in in particular had become a magnet for field and middle management personnel and members of the campesino membership enterprises from other Latin American countries as well as from the Caribbean. They were sponsored to participate in the Honduran workshops by the Inter American Institute for Cooperation in Agriculture (IICA) and by the Foundation for Applied Capacitation and Research in Agrarian Reform (CIARA).Sobrado in Those participants \\"reproduced the same type of experiments in Panama, Costa Rica, Venezuela, Mexico, Brazil, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Colombia, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Dominica and Belize. In several of them, the Netherlands' Hivos and the Honduran Institute for Rural Development (IDHER) played a very important role\\".Sobrado in Thus, for example, from 1979 onwards, one hundred OWs were organized in Colombia, resulting in 400 job-generating enterprises. Sobrado points out that \\"the example, the Honduran Oscar Leiva and the Chilean Iv√°n Labra\\", together with de Morais himself, pioneered the OW in Venezuela. Subsequent to the 1980 CIARA-sponsored Conference on the OW in Caracas, 96 new OW Directors organized 286 workshops in which 11,440 Venezuelans participated. In 1984 and 1985 de Morais was active in Geneva (Switzerland), Africa and Germany: The ILO had asked him to set up a Course series in Geneva for key African trade union and government personnel about to fill the many posts left vacant by the departed colonial powers. However, before the course could be started up, many had already been called back by their governments and given important positions. This left de Morais with no option but to go to Africa himself:delegates from Africa had already attended the 5-month OW he ran in Portugal in 1979 ‚Äì see 'Portugal' above. he ran 'in situ' course OWs successively in Guinea Bissau, Angola, Mozambique and S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe.I.&I.Labra; in In 1986, Ian Cherrett,Ian Cherrett then Hivos representative for southern Africa, and Cephas Muropa,New Internationalist 1983 with the support of Glen Forest Training Centre (Harare, Zim.)Labra & Labra in ran the very first OW in anglophone southern Africa at the Rujeko Cooperative Makoni Makoni District (Zim.). Not without considerable difficulties, however. That was the moment when Hivos, through Cherrett, invited the Social Psychologists Isabel and Iv√°n Labra, with long, hands-on experience of running workshops in Latin America, to come to Zimbabwe. The magazine \\"Workteam\\"Gaborone, Botswana spread further knowledge about the OW to a wider English-speaking public in Africa.Among others by means of a cartoon series on de Morais. reproduces four of those cartoons. Workteam subsequently reported on workshops which took place in Botswana (with the support of CORDE), Zimbabwe, South Africa, Namibia and the Caribbean. de Morais became visiting professor at the Humboldt University of Berlin in 1986, and at the University of Rostock (GDR) where he was awarded a doctorate in Sociology in 1987.Correia in  1988: Back in Brazil  Civilian rule was restored in Brazil with the coming to power of president Jos√© Sarney, but Brazil had to wait until 1989 for the first democratic elections since the 1964 coup. In 1988 Cristovam Buarque, then Vice Chancellor of the University of Brasilia, invited Clodomir, then still in Rostock, to Brasilia to set up the Institute for Technical Support to Third World Countries (IATTERMUND)Correia on IATTERMUND in website temporarily suspended to tackle one of the country's gravest problems, the 'hidden civil war of unemployment'.de Morais in \\"All we have to show [for the billions in rural development aid] is what we have referred to as 'the Hidden Civil war of Unemployment' and the continent turned into one big scrapyard of farm machinery.\\" The first request for OWs in Brazil came from the 30 self-managing Landless Workers' Movement (MST) cooperatives which subsequently changed their slogan from \\"Invade! Occupy!\\" to \\"Invade! Occupy! Produce!\\".Correia in Soon to follow the MST lead was the POLONOROESTE project, jointly funded by the Brazilian Ministry of National Integration, FAO and World Bank.part of the POLOBORAESTE BRA/87/037 program, administered by the EMATER-RO 'Technical and Rural Extension Assistance Service of Rond√¥nia' Service re: The Supervisory Development Authority for Amaz√¥nia (SUDAM) (1996‚Äì2002) reports that, with IATTERMUND's 'APRENDER-FAZENDO' (Learn by doing) methodology, the POLONOROESTE program in 1992‚Äì3 ran OWs in S√£o Paulo, Paraiba and Alagoas.see External Links It ran a pilot project in 1996 in Tocantins followed by a full program of 59 Field OWs, two Course OWs and one Course for future OW Directors in Par√°, Amap√°, Amazonia, Acre and in the Municipality of Bel√©m in which 20,059 persons participated, resulting in 696 new Enterprises yielding 5,596 new jobs.PRONAGER/PRODUCIR Results from 1996‚Äì2002. Correia estimates that, based on IATTERMUND and different state, municipality, as well as MST sources which she researched, in the decade from 1988 to 1998, \\"around 100,000 people participated in various OW events in Brazil\\". From 1996 to 1998 22,000 people participated in 'PAE' (Self Employment Program ‚Äì under the banner \\"More than a job: a Future\\")Correia in in the heavily urbanized state of S√£o Paulo resulting in 711 new enterprises, including People's Banks (\\"Bancos do Povo\\") The OW reached its apogee when, in 2000-2 alone, under the national 'PRONAGER', 110,946 people participated in 282 OWs.Correia in In many of these, especially Centre and Course OW-type of events, de Morais himself was always personally involved as coordinator and/or Course Director. He did not limit himself to Brazil and personally directed the 3-month (September‚ÄìDecember 2000) national PRONACAMPO Course OW for around 1,000 Guatemalan OW technicians, directors and assistants in Guatemala City. After the Workers' Party/PT electoral victory in 2003, large regional and national- scale OW 'PRONAGER' programs such as those that took place under the previous Fernando Henrique Cardoso's Brazilian Social Democracy Party dwindled both in size and in number. From then on, OWs in Brazil continue to be run on a more local(ized) basis, such as the Rondonia OWs in 2002.\\"Rondonoticias\\" 21 November 2002 From September 2012 to January 2013 de Morais directed the Guajar√° Mirim Course OW.Guajar√° Mirim In the meantime region-wide OW programs and government-sponsored OW events have taken on a life on their own, especially in the last decade, in Costa RicaGERMINADORA Program and South Africa.In South Africa, the OW was applied by, among others, the Seriti Institute, Soul City Institute and government departments such as South Africa's Department of Social Development. de Morais was visiting Professor at the University of Brasilia (1988), the Federal University of Rond√¥nia/UNIR (Amazonia)(2003‚Äì09), the Chapingo Autonomous University (Mexico) (2000‚Äì2002) and the Autonomous University of Honduras (2006‚Äì08).

Olsen financially supported Texas A&M;, his hometown of Clifton, Texas and Major League Baseball. He is the namesake for the baseball field at Texas A&M.; Olsen was named a Distinguished Alumnus of Texas A&M; and was inducted into the Texas Baseball Hall of Fame, the Texas A&M; Athletic Hall of Fame and the Texas High School Baseball Coaches Association Hall of Fame. After Olsen died, a legal battle ensued between his family and Texas A&M; over the rights to his multimillion dollar estate. Biography C. E. \\"Pat\\" Olsen was born to Norwegian immigrants in Clifton, Texas on August 3, 1902. He had nine siblings; an older brother attended Texas A&M; and was a baseball letterman between 1914 and 1916. Olsen was a member of the Ross Volunteers and lettered as a baseball pitcher between 1921 and 1923. Upon his graduation in 1923, Olsen entered professional baseball. He was signed to the New York Yankees organization and was a spring training roommate of Lou Gehrig, but he never made the Yankees major league roster. In October 1923, he married Elsie Duncan, the daughter of the Texas A&M; food services director. Olsen founded Gearench Manufacturing Company in Houston in 1927. The company's earliest product, the Gearench, was a tool for working with small-diameter pipe. Olsen sold the company, which included facilities in Houston and Clifton, in 1978. Pat Olsen donated the first Gearench building in Clifton, the former Clifton Lutheran College, to house the Bosque County Conservatory of Fine Arts (now called the Bosque Arts Center). Scoreboard at Olsen Field (2006) Olsen remained attached to baseball throughout his life and made significant financial contributions to various aspects of the game. In 1978, Olsen Field was dedicated as Texas A&M;'s baseball field. He was also a member of the New York Yankees Alumni Club and he donated to the Major League Baseball pension plan. By the 1980s, Olsen had attended more than fifty All-Star Games and more than half of the World Series in baseball history. He was asked to throw out the ceremonial first pitch in game one of the 1984 World Series; former Texas A&M; pitcher Mark Thurmond was one of the starting pitchers in the game. Olsen is a member of the Texas Baseball Hall of Fame and the Texas A&M; Athletic Hall of Fame. He was named a Texas A&M; Distinguished Alumnus in 1981. In 1991, he was a member of the second class inducted into the Texas High School Baseball Coaches Association Hall of Fame. Texas A&M; awards the C. E. \\"Pat\\" Olsen Outstanding Pitcher Award. Pat Olsen died in Kingwood, Texas on May 11, 2000. In 2002, Olsen's family sued the Texas A&M; Foundation in a dispute over the rights to Olsen's estate. The family said that a 1987 will would have left the $1.1 million estate to Olsen's son, but that he had been coerced to amend the will in 1994 and to leave his estate to the university. His son said that the elderly Olsen was mentally incapacitated by 1994. The university said that Olsen and his son were estranged and that Olsen grew more dependent on his friends at the university in his last years. A Harris County probate court ruled in favor of the family in 2002. In 2010, Blue Bell Creameries pledged $7 million to renovate Olsen Field and to rename it Olsen Field at Blue Bell Park.

With more than 50 locations, it was once the largest restaurant chain based in Oregon. It was a Denny's-style restaurant, a type that was commonly known at that time as a \\"coffee shop\\" but is now more commonly known as a casual dining restaurant. Most restaurants were located near freeways and were open 24 hours. At its peak, the chain had locations in five states: Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Nevada and northern California. History The first VIP's Restaurant was opened in 1968, in Tualatin, Oregon,Bella, Rick (June 7, 2004). \\"This little pig has pancakes and a history\\" (about the Tualatin Pig 'N Pancake restaurant, formerly the first VIP's restaurant). The Oregonian, Southwest Zoner edition, p. B1. next to an Interstate 5 freeway interchange. A second restaurant was opened the same year, in Salem, in a location not near a freeway. It was not as profitable as the Tualatin location, and consequently the company's owners decided that future restaurants should be placed along freeways. By 1969, the chain was expanding outside Oregon, with two VIP's under construction in Seattle,\\"Chain Opens New Outlet\\" (September 12, 1969). The Oregonian, p. 34. and by late 1971 it had grown to 15 restaurants.Pratt, Gerry (December 9, 1971). \\"Burnt Russian finds club pays\\" (\\"Making the dollar\\" column in Business section). The Oregonian, p. 37. The company, founded by Keith Andler and Robert Smith, was named VIP's Restaurants, Inc. By 1982, the company was operating 53 VIP's coffee-shop-style restaurants and had also opened four Mexican restaurants that had other names, including La Casa Real and Tortilla Machine. Together, the 57 restaurants had gross sales of more than $41 million in 1981. At its peak, VIP's was the largest restaurant chain based in Oregon. In 1982, the company sold 35 of its 53 VIP's Restaurants to Denny's Inc. for around $12 million.\\"Denny's acquiring 35 VIP's sites\\" (February 26, 1982). The Oregonian, p. C9. The offer from Denny's was \\"too good to pass up\\", VIPs' owners told The Oregonian newspaper, including a promise that all employees at the affected restaurants would keep their jobs and be absorbed by Denny's. The 1982 sale covered 19 locations in Washington and 16 in Oregon and Northern California. In 1984, VIP's sold 16 restaurants to JB's Restaurants, of Salt Lake City. This sale, of eight locations in Oregon (including the original Tualatin location) and eight in Washington,\\"The Northwest\\" (brief news round-up). (August 16, 1984). The Oregonian, p. E1. left the company with just nine restaurants. By 1989, the last VIP's Restaurants had been sold, and the company had branched out into the hotel business. Renamed VIP's Industries Inc., the company continued to own a few Tex-Mex restaurants, using the name La Casa Real and mostly located in the Portland‚ÄìVancouver metropolitan area but with ones also in Fife, Washington, and Salem.

The manuscript won the Adelaide Festival Biennial Award for Literature; the novel was short-listed for The Age Book of the Year. Its author was compared by critics with PG Wodehouse, Don DeLillo, Julian Barnes, Umberto Eco, and Australian Nobellist Patrick White. Despite its critical success, the collapse of the original publisher meant that Propinquity did not reach a wide audience, although in 2013 it was released on Amazon as a Kindle e-book and a CreateSpace print-on-demand paperback. 'Propinquity describes a group of Oxford medical undergraduates trying to bring a medieval English queen - buried deep under Westminster Abbey - back to life. In reviving her, the students intend to expose a 2,000-year-old conspiracy by the Church to repress gnosis - the experiential core of spiritual teaching - to maintain its political power. The attempt is led by a male Oxford medical student and the daughter of the Dean of Westminster, a medieval scholar, who had seen her father visit the secret tomb as a child, and later recalled the memories. Plot Propinquity begins in the 1970s at Geelong Grammar School, with central character and narrator Clive Lean and his friends surreptitiously smoking cigarettes, and contemplating their \\"maddening\\" girl-less existence, beside a small bay near the school. The friends end up together at Melbourne University, until Clive's wealthy father dies on the golf course - bequeathing him the family plastics business. Clive is not a success as a businessman, and within two years he is forced to sell Plas-E-Quip to a tramp in the Botanical Gardens, in a bid to evade back taxes. He flees the country. At Oxford University ‚Äì where he enrolls to complete his medical degree ‚Äì he falls in with a second group of friends, and on a trip to London meets Samantha \\"Sam\\" Goode, daughter of the Dean Of Westminster Abbey and a medieval scholar. As they draw closer to each other, Sam begins to drop hints about the Abbey's housing ancient secrets. She soon she reveals that beneath the floor in the Chapel of Henry VII lies the body of Berengaria of Navarre, widow of Richard Lionheart. An intrepid soul, Berengaria had been a follower of the Indian mystic Kabir, who had taught gnosis - the direct connection with the divine, which did away with religion, priests and even belief. On her return to London, Berengaria met the monks at Westminster, who had kept the flame of gnosis alive for twelve centuries. The Westminster monks had originally been initiated by Joseph of Arimathea, the provider of Jesus's tomb, who had travelled to Britain after the crucifixion. A reading of one of Berengaria's letters ‚Äì entombed underground with her ‚Äì leads Sam to the startling conclusion that the queen is not dead, but in a trance induced by a medieval herb. When they learn there is an herbal antidote, but that it no longer grows in Africa, Clive travels to Haiti, where he hopes the herb may have been brought by African slaves. Here he teams up with his old school and university friend Alistair - now a revolutionary fighting \\"Baby Doc\\" Duvalier's government ‚Äì in search of the elusive antidote. Clive eventually purloins it from a witchdoctor. Back in London, the visits by Clive and Sam to Berengaria's underground tomb have been discovered by the Dean, and the group's efforts face ruin. Now their task is to remove the body from the grasp of the Church, enabling them to revive Berengaria. Several of the group create loud distractions in other parts of the Abbey as Clive goes underground and grabs Berengaria's body. The queen is revived with the antidote herb at a secret workroom, and they spirit her out of the country. The group arrives in Mullumbimby in rural Australia, where Lake - Clive's best friend from school - now lives. They stay in his house. Despite Clive's reviving her from eight centuries of sleep, Berengeria does not appear to take to him. A protracted longueur ensues, as the two try, and fail, to communicate. On a shopping trip to nearby Byron Bay, Clive is spotted by a policeman and arrested. He is extradited to Melbourne, where he faces charges of tax evasion. In jail he meets the tramp to whom he had sold his company, and bribes him to give favorable evidence; he is acquitted. Meanwhile, the Church has been announcing that the kidnap of Berengaria never occurred. On the courtroom steps, Clive confirms the claim: saying that there had never been a body under Westminster Abbey, and that the \\"kidnap\\" had been a hoax arising from a student bet. After the trial, Sam reveals she has been given Berengaria's gnosis, and discusses its revelatory qualities with Clive. He shows an interest in learning it. He also tells Sam that he loves her, and wants to settle down with her and have children. She laughs, replying, \\"I don't think you could breed in captivity\\". Reception The \\"Propinquity\\" manuscript won Australia's most competitive literary award, the Adelaide Festival Award for Literature in 1986. After publication it was shortlisted for the 1987 Age Book of the Year.In The Age Once published, Propinquity drew praise mixed with criticism from reviewers. ::It is a novel close to unclassifiability‚Ä¶ Propinquity‚Ä¶might be mentioned in the same sentence as those masters of veridical clowning, Flann O'Brien and Joseph Hasek, he of Good Soldier Schweik immortality. Macgregor has a way to go to hit their position, but he has produced a first novel of great talent. :::(Stephen Knight, \\"Times on Sunday\\") ::Macgregor writes with plenty of wit, some verve, and lots of exuberance... The story makes you want to read on - and on. It's a bit of a mixture of PG Wodehouse and Patrick White. You have to be prepared for Wodehouse mysticism and White jokes, and that makes this a very individual novel indeed... :::(John Hanrahan, The Age) ::The over-the-top plot requires so much of the reader's attention and imagination that it is easy to forget that there is some very nice writing in Propinquity... [The author] won the Adelaide festival National Manuscript award ... there is plenty of evidence here is a talent worth watching. The novel does get bogged down near the halfway point ... but this seems a minor complaint... Escapism with intelligence. :::(Andrew Stokes, The Australian) ::In many ways this is a very amateurish book - though perhaps in a good sense. :::(Dr Barry Westburg, \\"Radio 5UV\\")Transcript of book review; Dr Barry Westburg (lecturer in English, Adelaide University); Radio 5UV. Background In 1977 John Macgregor received a $3,000 Young Writer's Grant from the Australian Government on the strength of Propinquity's first four chapters. (The novel had a working title of Our Resurrection.) In the early 1980s, Australian novelist Hal Porter - who part-read the manuscript - suggested Macgregor send it to veteran literary publisher John Ferguson in Sydney. Ferguson was enthusiastic about the novel, but later relinquished it due to financial difficulties. In 1986, Macgregor entered Propinquity in the manuscript section of the Adelaide Festival's Biennial Award for Literature, which it won. In addition to $15,000 in prize money, the award mandated publication by Wakefield Press - a publishing house then owned by the South Australian Government. As Propinquity was being released, the Wakefield Press was sold to The Adelaide Review, which had no book-publishing experience. Propinquity sat in the warehouse, missing the sales bandwagon. =Themes= The novel embodies propinquity ‚Äì \\"nearness in place or spirit\\". In Australia, the group of very close friends share an at times poignant love for each other. Clive forms a second such group in Oxford, England. The two groups eventually intersect. This aspect of the work was singled out by Australian academic Dr Barry Westburg: ::Macgregor is rediscovering, behind the centuries-old dogmas of romantic love, another kind of connection between human beings: the rather antique term 'propinquity'. A second theme is the novel's spirituality. When religion figured in Australian novels of the time, it was most often Catholicism. However throughout the story, the central characters moves steadily toward something more mystical - something \\"beyond the lyric imprecision of words\\". The novel gently promotes the idea that spirituality is rooted in experience, with belief and dogma meaning little - except to those who employ it to gain power over the gullible. Westburg said: ::Truth is simple in this philosophical novel - it is just hard to get at the simplicity of it in a world of such spatial and material dimensions. ::What seems to be a preposterous plot involving the resurrection of a female Christ figure thus contains a profound core. ::It is the depth of visionariness of this novel, its clinging to its perhaps unfashionable spiritual centre, that will reward many readers. Macgregor wrote about his novel: ::People my age did not take on a belief system simply because their parents had. The New Age groups (called cults by some) were the revolutionary vanguard of this thinking - and my belonging to one is what brought Propinquity into being. At bottom it represents the new dispensation I saw taking shape. ::I was wrong about my group, but the notion that the old monoliths were tottering and would collapse has proven right. Churches are empty now across Christendom. ::Propinquity is saying that nearly everything we have been taught about God is nonsense. That's now a mainstream belief. Propinquity also forges the theme ‚Äì later exploited in The Da Vinci Code ‚Äì of an historical secret suppressed by the Church for 2,000 years. In Da Vinci this secret is the feminine aspect of spirituality; in Propinquity it is both this and the gnosis or \\"inner essence\\" of spiritual experience. (Macgregor has not criticised The Da Vinci Code, saying, \\"To me this is a nicely-constructed novel. Often critics don't understand how hard good structure is.\\") A further motif is anarchism. Narrator Clive Lean seems unmoved by society's laws, and continually breaks them. He evades income tax by selling his company to a tramp, takes some of the world's first designer drugs, steals Berengaria's body and her documents from the Church of England, handcuffs a priest to a parking sign, drives a getaway car, knocks a policeman to the ground in resisting arrest, and bribes a witness to not testify against him. Author John Macgregor grew up in Melbourne, and attended the private school Geelong Grammar (featured in the story).Propinquity back cover, 1986 paperback edition After receiving the Young Writer's Grant in 1977, Macgregor moved between Melbourne, Mullumbimby and Adelaide as he completed the book.

In 2002 it was granted the Academy status. History The history of the Shchukin Institute (or Shchuka, The Pike, as it is informally known) goes back to November 1913, when a group of Moscow art students formed their own studio and invited actor and director Evgeny Vakhtangov to become their leader. October 23, 1914, when the latter held his first class with the group (then called the Mansurova School, after the street it was standing on), is celebrated as the Vakhtangov Academy's official birthday. In the spring of 1917 the Studio was named the Moscow Evgeny Vakhtangov Drama School, in 1920 it became the Moscow Art Theatre‚Äôs Third Studio and in 1926 (after the death of Vakhtangov in 1922) it became part of the newly formed Vakhtangov Theatre, with Boris Zakhava at the helm (1926-1948, 1962-1967). In 1932 the Studio got the status of a secondary school, then in 1939 it was given the name of Boris Shchukin, Vakhtangov's best-loved student. In 1945 it received the status of a higher education institution and has been known since as the Shchukin Theatre College of Higher education. In 1986 the College's director became Vladimir Etush (still its Arts director). In 2002 the institute was granted the Academy status. In 2003 professor Evgeny Knyazev became its head.

Wilson House, also known as the Wilson-Wahr House, is a private house located at 126 North Division Street in Ann Arbor, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. History Robert S. Wilson was an attorney who moved from Allegheny County, New York, to Ann Arbor in 1835. He was Judge of the Washtenaw County Probate court for a year, and served in the Michigan House of Representatives. In approximately 1839, Wilson had this house built on a lot in Ann Arbor. He lived there until 1850, when he moved to Chicago and sold the house to John H. Welles. Welles is thought to have constructed the rear addition to the house, and made other extensive alterations. It is likely that the middle section was built in 1835, the temple portion was added in 1843, and the kitchen and servants quarters were added in 1850. In 1855, Welles' son Henry moved into the house with his four daughters (Clarissa, Sarah, Mary Fiske, and Susan Holly), after the death of his wife. Henry Welles died in 1860, and the house passed to successive owners. In 1893, the house was sold in a tax sale to George Wahr, and his wife, Emma (Staebler) Wahr. The Wahr family constructed another house next door as their residence, and rented the house to sororities and fraternities. After 20 years, they moved back into the main Wilson-Wahr House. The house passed on to the Wahr's daughter, Natalie Wahr Sallade (who died in 1974), and the Sallades occupied the house at least through 1992. Greek Revival style facade with Ionic columns. Architecture The Robert S. Wilson House is a two-story Greek Revival structure constructed of brick with a stucco finish on a stone foundation. Nearly every survey of Michigan architecture has singled out the Wilson House as an outstanding specimen of Neoclassical architecture design. Architect Fiske Kimball attributed its \\"four study Ionic columns, rising through two stories, with graceful flutes and capitals\\" to the original Temple of the Wingless Victory at Athens. The front facade boasts a full-width portico with Ionic fluted shaft columns, and an entryway framed by matching pilasters. Windows have external shutters. A two- story addition on the rear was likely constructed more recently than the main portion of the house. ;Interior Inside, the main section of the house is two parlors deep with a hall containing a stairwell to the side. The rear addition has a side entrance into another stair hall. All the major rooms in the house have fireplaces.

It also stated that this figure remained the unchanged for 4 years and the quality of care was further decreased due to the housing of involuntary patients who are usually uncooperative. In 2013, Times of India journalist Tarun Vijay visited the hospital and wrote about the conditions in his blog. He reported that the hospital was in a dilapidated condition, under- staffed and most hospital equipments were non-functional. This institute has two psychiatrists nowadays and two medical officers.

The mall is directly connected to Jurong East MRT station and close to Jurong East Bus Interchange. Overview Jem is Singapore's third-largest suburban mall housing 241 shop units with over 818,000 square feet of retail space across six levels. Jem's name is an abbreviation of its original name, Jurong East Mall, and is a wordplay reference of the mall as the crown jewel of Jurong and Singapore's west. The mall is directly connected to the Jurong East MRT interchange station and located at the junction of Jurong Gateway Road and Boon Lay Way. Major retailers include Robinsons (Closed to make way for IKEA), FairPrice Xtra, Cathay Cineplexes, Cookhouse by Koufu, H&M;, Uniqlo, Muji, Courts and Don Quijote (Don Don Donki). History Jem's official opening was initially planned to be on 11 June 2013. Due to the tenancy issues, the opening of the mall was delayed. It was reported that none of the units at Jem applied for a Fire Safety Certificate or Temporary Permit (TFP) from the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF). To appease the disappointed customers who were affected by the delayed opening, Jem gave out discount vouchers worth S$10 between 10 am and 11 am that day. On 15 June 2013, Jem finally opened and attracted more than 10,000 shoppers at the time of the opening. Jem was affected by two fires in August 2013, neither of which were related. On 14 August 2013, three employees manning the Ready-to-Eat counter at the NTUC FairPrice Xtra store in Jem shopping centre suffered minor burns when a deep fryer caught fire at about 10.30 am. Customers and staff were evacuated from the FairPrice Xtra store. The fire was put out by the sprinklers in the store. Three days later, a car caught fire at the basement 2 carpark area of Jem at about 2.20pm, causing the evacuation of all staff and patrons from the mall. The fire was again put off by the sprinklers in the mall. Three people were injured after the first floor ceiling collapsed on the night of 18 September 2013. It was believed that the leaking water pipe had caused the incident. As a result, the shopping mall was closed. On 2 October 2013, the mall was reopened to the public. Throughout the closure, Jem had undergone inspections, rigorous testing and certification made by a team of more than 40 people including hydraulic engineers and safety specialists to investigate and resolve the issue. Slightly less than two months later, a glass door at Jem shattered on 29 November 2013, which is next to H&M;, a third of the glass partition shattered into pieces. No one was hurt in an accident. On March 21, 2014, retailers on Basement One and the third level of the shopping centre were affected by 11-hour power failure from 7am to 6pm. At least 36 of the 60 shops in Basement One were operating in darkness, with at least three shops putting up early closure notices due to the power shortage. On 17 June 2014, sprinklers started spraying water and flooding the mall. There was a malfunction of the water sprinkler. Water was sprayed from level 2 to the ground floor. On 3 April 2015, a fire broke out next to H&M.; On 16 April 2015, Saladworks, which was located on the second floor, was flooded when a blocked waste pipe caused a backflow of water into the store. In June 2015, there was a leak on the kitchen's water pipe that splashed waste water on diners at Din Tai Fung restaurant on the second floor. On 11 March 2016, there was a leak onto the mall‚Äôs third floor which smelled like ‚Äúkitchen waste‚Äù. In 2019, JEM underwent minor renovations at Basement 1. By August 2020, anchor tenant Robinsons will be closed down and replaced by IKEA in 2021.

Abraham Lincoln, who was postmaster of New Salem at the time, frequently visited the post office during the 1830s to fetch mail. Josiah Francis purchased the store on a mortgage from Rogers in 1837. In the same year, Athens held a banquet in the building to honor Lincoln and eight other Illinois legislators for moving the state capital to Springfield; the nine men were known as the \\"Long Nine\\", as they were all over tall. When Rogers sued Francis for failing to keep up with his mortgage payments in 1840, Lincoln again became involved with the store, as his firm represented Rogers in court; Rogers won the case by default.

It lies at a distance of 700 kilometers (437 miles) south to Khartoum the capital, and 186 kilometers (115.5 miles) from Kadugli, capital of the state, and about 100 kilometers (62 miles), from El Obeid, the largest city in the states of Kordofan. Etymology The word dubeibat in Arabic is a plural of dubeiba, which is a diminutive of dabba, meaning a hummock or a flat small hill. Thus, Dubaybat means the small hummocks. Topography The name of the town reflects its topographic feature where Dunes and small separated flat hills dominate the general appearance of the earth's surface. Transportation hub Owing to its geographical location Ed Dubeibat, is considered as an important transportation hub in the region connecting South Kordofan to the rest of Sudan with a network of roads and railway. =Paved roads= *Ad Dubeibat - Abu Zabad - Fula *Ad Dubeibat - Dalang - Kadugli *Ad Dubeibat - Khartoum (via Kosti) *Ad Dubeibat - Nyala (Sudan) *Ad Dubeibat ‚Äì Al-Ubayyid Economy A Dubeibat is known for its animal production.

It aired February 20, 2013. The episode was written by Elaine Ko and directed by Gail Mancuso. Plot Claire (Julie Bowen) has her college reunion and she is glad that Phil (Ty Burrell) can not go with her because there will be many things he does not know and to try to explain him everything all the time can be really annoying. Her ex-boyfriend, a professor (Maxwell Caulfield) she dated 20 years ago, will also be there, another reason she does not want Phil to be there. When Phil's plans for bowling get cancelled and he surprises her by showing up without telling her, things get awkward. Jay (Ed O'Neill) has a bowling tournament and he is determined to win. Having his plans for the day, he leaves Gloria (Sofia Vergara) alone with the baby and running around for errands. When Mitchell (Jesse Tyler Ferguson) comes to her house to ask her lend him a boa, she slips and hurts her ankle. Mitchell feels bad and offers to take little Joe for the day.

He is best known for ordering the May 24, 1993 PKK ambush. He has been imprisoned since his capture in Iraqi Kurdistan by Turkish forces in 1998, shortly after his defection to the Kurdistan Democratic Party. He was a key witness in the Ergenekon trials. Background In statements to the Ergenekon trials in 2012, he said that he became a PKK sympathizer in 1979, and joined after the 1980 Turkish coup d'√©tat as a way of leaving the countryToday's Zaman, 6 November 2012, Secret witness reveals identity, shady ties between PKK and Ergenekon after a dispute with his father in which he shot and wounded him.Hurriyet, 17 April 1998, Sakƒ±k, babasƒ±nƒ± bile vurmu≈ü His brother Sƒ±rrƒ± Sakƒ±k is a member of Parliament for the BDP. 1993 ambush Sakƒ±k later claimed that military commanders were aware of his planned May 24, 1993 PKK ambush, and deliberately left the soldiers unarmed and unguarded. He identified a group within the military called the East Study Group (Doƒüu √áalƒ±≈üma Grubu), saying it had used the ambush as part of its coup plans.Today's Zaman, 1 June 2012, Ex-PKK commander Sakƒ±k blames military junta for deaths of 33 soldiers Abdullah √ñcalan claims Sakƒ±k ordered the 1993 ambush as part of an Ergenekon attempt to sabotage the peace process then ongoing between the PKK and the Turkish government,Today's Zaman, 25 December 2009, Sakƒ±k questioned over killings of 33 soldiers saying that Sakƒ±k had been used by Ergenekon.Today's Zaman, 6 December 2008, ‚ÄòSakƒ±k plotted killings of 33 soldiers upon Ergenekon order' Defection and capture In the late 90s, he had an argument with the other commanders within the PKK, such as Duran Kalkan and Murat Karƒ±yilan in which he told them they were not experienced enough in warfare. He himself was known for his warfare skills, and there was not much what they could do about it except complaining about to √ñcalan.Marcus, Aliza (2009). 259‚Äì260 This led to a tense power struggle within the PKK. Then in 1998, he was ordered by √ñcalan to lead the PKK in the Hatay province, an area not suitable for PKK guerrilla warfare as it was in a leveled environment. He therefore refused to enter deeply into the province and stayed with his troops just at the border. √ñcalan then called him back to Damascus, and as he refused to obey his orders, later sent him into detention to the Gare camp in the Dohuk Governorate, Iraqi Kurdistan. From there he escaped and was received by Masoud Barzani who provided him protection. But the Turkish armed forces were made aware of his presence in the region, and captured him on 13 April 1998. Some sources said that the 1998 Operation Murat, launched shortly after Sakƒ±k's capture, was based in part on information obtained from Sakƒ±k.Hurriyet Daily News, 2 May 1998, Semdin Sakik interrogated by Jitem He was sentenced to death for the killing of 125 members of the security forces and 121 civilians, but the sentence was commuted to life imprisonment after Turkey abolished the death penalty.

History  The amateur Stamford Shakespeare Company was founded in 1968 by the late Jean Harley, then Artistic Director, with a performance of A Midsummer Night's Dream in the Monastery Garden of the historic George Hotel in Stamford, Lincolnshire. It was under the support of the Stamford Arts Centre Committee in aid of the proposed new Arts Centre and restoration of the town's Georgian Theatre. In 1971, the theatre group became independent and was named the \\"Stamford Shakespeare Company\\". Open-air Shakespeare plays continued at the George Hotel until 1976, when the hotel could no longer accommodate the summer open-air theatre because of building work. Tolethorpe Hall came on the market in a near derelict state early in 1977 and was acquired by the Stamford Shakespeare Company with a private loan later repaid. The main interest in the grounds was a natural amphitheatre which was converted into a concrete-stepped 600-seat auditorium covered by a canvas canopy. The first season opened in May 1977 with performances of Macbeth and The Taming of the Shrew. The hall itself stands on the middle of three terraces cut in sloping ground. The raked auditorium looks outward across the lower terrace which forms the stage behind which, is the open country of the Gwash valley.

The canal also has multiple branches throughout Kherson Oblast and the Crimean Peninsula. The construction preparation started in 1957 soon after the transfer of Crimea of 1954. The main project works took place between 1961 and 1971 and had three stages. The construction was conducted by the Komosomol members sent by the Komsomol travel ticket (Komsomolskaya putyovka) as part of shock construction projects and accounted for some 10,000 \\"volunteer\\" workers. Lenine, Kerch Peninsula in 2014 Overview The canal begins at the city of Tavriysk, where it draws from the Kakhovka Reservoir fed by the Dnieper river, and stretches out in a generally southeasterly direction, terminating at the small village of Zelnyi Yar (Lenine Raion); from there, a pipeline carries water to supply the city of Kerch at the eastern extreme of the Crimean Peninsula. Seven water reservoirs lie along the main canal, which is in length. Water flows by gravity from Tavriysk to Dzhankoy, where it is elevated by four pump stations to a height of over to energize its continued downstream flow. In Crimea, numerous smaller canals branch off the main channel, including the Razdolne rice canal, Azov rice canal, Krasnohvardiiske distribution canal, Uniting canal, and Saky canal; through these, water is also supplied to the city of Simferopol.Tymchenko, Z. North Crimean Canal. History of construction. Ukrayinska Pravda. May 13, 2014 (Krymskiye izvestiya. November 2012) The idea to construct the canal was raised in the 19th century, particularly by the Russian-Finnish botanist Christian von Steven. But it was not until after World War II when the decision was finally adopted on September 21, 1950 by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Government of the Soviet Union. The decision was to build the Kakhovka Hydro Electric Station, South Ukrainian and North Crimean canals. In 1951 the Soviet postal service released a commemorative post stamp where the North Crimean Canal was categorized as one of the Great Construction Projects of Communism. 2014 Crimean crisis and after After the Russian annexation of Crimea during the 2014 Crimean crisis, Ukrainian authorities greatly cut the volume of water flowing into Crimea via the canal, citing a huge outstanding debt on water supplies owed by the peninsula. When the Russian government offered to pay the debt, the Ukrainian government refused. This caused the peninsula's agricultural harvest which is heavily dependent on irrigation to fail in 2014. Crimean water sources are being connected to the North Crimean Canal to replace the former Ukrainian sources. The objective is to restore irrigation and urban supplies to the Kerch Peninsula and to smaller communities on the east coast of Crimea.http://en.voicesevas.ru/news/crimea/3976-new-pipelines-start-supplying- fresh-water-to-crimea.html In 2014, the reservoir was built to store water of the rivers of the Eastern Crimea near village Novoivanovka, Nyzhnohirskyi Raion. The North Crimean Canal is connected with the Novoivanovka reservoir.Dnepr is no longer needed (in Russian) According to official Russian statistics, the Crimean agricultural industry fully overcame the consequences of blocking the North Crimean Canal and crop yields grew by a factor of 1.5 from 2013 by 2016. The reported rapid growth in agricultural production in the Crimea is due to the fact that, with the help of subsidies of the order of 2‚Äì3 billion rubles a year from the budget of the Russian Federation, agricultural producers of Crimea were able to increase the fleet of agricultural machinery. The statistical view clashes with the statement of Pavlo Zhebrivsky, who asserts that the strategy of Russia in the conflict over Crimea is designed to pressure Ukraine into re-opening the water pipeline.

Access to Omai is by road from the capital of Georgetown on the coast, and from the town of Linden approximately 60 km away. There is an operational airstrip on site which can accommodate aircraft from Georgetown (40 min. flight). Gold mining at Omai is known from at least the 1880s, and when it was developed as a large scale mine in 1992 by Cambior, the mine was the largest gold mine in the Guiana Shield and a major source of income and employment in Guyana. During the period from 1992 ‚Äì 2005, Omai produced 3.7 Moz of gold at an average grade of 1.5 g/t Au from the Fennell and the Wenot open pits. Omai has been known for over 130 years. In the period 1886-1896 some 1890 kg (60,000 ozs.) of gold was extracted from the placer deposits of Gilt, Dunclain and L'Esperence creeks by small-scale miners ('pork-knockers\\") using primitive hand methods. The German Syndicate leased the concession in 1896 and carried out extensive investigation of bedrock quartz lodes by primitive drilling and tunneling and produced 1860 kg (59,800 oz) of gold. After limited success in dredging the alluvial flats, the Syndicate surrendered the property to the pork-knockers in 1907. By 1911 most of the workable ground was considered exhausted, based on the prevailing gold price and mining methods of the period. Anaconda (British Guiana Mines Ltd.) acquired rights to the area in 1946. I–ø order to define reserves, close spaced diamond drilling focused on the primary mineralization in the Omai Stock. Seventy-three AX-diameter boreholes were drilled for a total of 12,400 m. On the basis of surface drilling assay results, a 120 m shaft was sunk near Red Hill and 900 m of cross-cuts were made at the 62 meter level. By 1950, Anaconda had identified a primary ore body with reserves of 54.4 million tonnes grading 1.19 g/t Au. However, due to a combination of low gold prices and a favorable —Å–æ—Ä—Ä–µ–≥ market at the advent of the Korean War, the company decided to relinquish the property in 1951. The detailed mapping and sampling by Anaconda geologists (the best trained in the world at that time) is still of great value. ln May 1985, Golden Star Resources Ltd. (GSR), a junior mineral exploration company listed on the Alberta stock exchange, signed an Exclusive Exploration Permit (EEP) with the Guyana government over the Omai area, and retained Canadian engineering consultancy SNC Inc. to undertake an evaluation-feasibility study of the oxidized zone. They initiated a systematic alluvial and saprolite evaluation program, which included extensive augering and test-pitting to depths of about 4 m. Indicated alluvial reserves of 750,000 tons grading 3.2 g/t Au and indicated saprolite reserves of 1.2 million tonnes grading at 1.44 g/t Au were defined. On the basis of these encouraging surface results, GSR bored six deep diamond drill-holes, totalling 2125 m, to test mineralization in the Omai Intrusive Stock (later to become the Fennell pit). In March 1987, GSR optioned the property to Placer Dome Inc. of Vancouver, British Columbia, which became the senior joint-venture partner at Omai. Over a three-year period Placer conducted a comprehensive integrated exploration program of surface mapping, trenching, soil geochemistry and ground geophysics, and approximately 24,000 m of diamond drilling. The alluvial deposits in the vicinity of Gilt and Dunclain Creeks were tested using Banka and sonic drilling techniques. In February 1989, overlapping geochemical and radiometric anomalies drew attention to the Wenot Lake area some 800 m to the south of the Omai Stock. Subsequentlv, eight exploratory holes were drilled leading to the discovery of a second orebody overlain by a supergene-enriched saprolite blanket. In total, 130 \\"SAP\\" and \\"DDH\\" holes totalling 10,550 m were drilled in order to accurately define the Wenot Lake ore zone. Placer estimated the combined primary, saprolite and alluvial reserves of the Omai gold deposits. Using a 0.7 g/t and 0.5 g/t cutoff value for hard rock and saprolite respectively, geological (indicated) reserves were calculated at 52.8 million tonnes grading 1.35 g/t Au. However, Placer withdrew from the joint-venture for \\"economic reasons\\" and complete control of the Omai EEP reverted to GSR. GSR then entered into a joint-venture agreement with Cambior Inc in May, 1990. Cambior completed 8,500 m of deÔ¨Ånition drilling to confirm grade, continuity and geological boundaries in the mineralized zones. Following the completion of a successful feasibility study at the end of 1990, Cambior and GSR signed a deal with the government of Guyana to develop Omai by a subsidiary, Omai Gold Mines Ltd. Construction started and the first gold was poured at the end of 1992, a very rapid startup. The published mining reserves were 44.8 million tonnes grading 1.43 g/t Au, and planned gold production of 255,000 oz per year over the first three years (Mining Magazine, September, 1991). In 2019, Avalon Gold Exploration acquired a PL license from the Government of Guyana and will conduct exploration at Omai for new gold resources. Geology The geology of this whole region is considered to be part of the Mazaruni Group. The Wenot zone occurs along an approximately east-west regional shear dividing tuffaceous meta-sediments in the south from andesitic and basaltic meta- volcanics in the north. Small elongate vertical felsic intrusions with quartz veinlets within 100m of the shear contact host most of the gold. Much of this zone is hidden under later palaeo-alluvial sediments, and has been saprolitised to depths of up to 50m below the surface. The Fennell zone is located approximately 500m further north and is hosted in a carrot-shaped granitoid plug hosted in andesitic and mafic meta-volcanics. The free gold is contained within narrow low-angle quartz-scheelite veins which locally extend into the country rock.  Mineralisation  The orogenic Omai gold deposit is a slightly younger (Paleoproterozoic) analogue to similar Archean deposits found in other cratonic areas such as the Canadian Shield. The twin Wenot and Fennell deposits were mined concurrently from 1993 to 2005 from surface open pits T. Local prospectors, known as pork-knockers, continue to work saprolite in the mine area for gold nuggets. Additional gold ore is likely to remain beneath the Fennell pit and along strike from the Wenot zone. Environmental Incident On 19 August 1995 a tailings dam broke and leaked tailings into the Essequibo River. 4.2 million cubic metres of cyanide-containing slurry escaped. Eighty kilometres of the Essequibo River were declared an environmental disaster zone. Large numbers of fish were killed.Mineral Policy Institute, \\"Chronology of Major Tailings Dam Failures\\" mpi.org Accessed June 2018. Production at the mine was halted for several months while the spill was investigated. The principal mine owners were Cambior Inc., based in Canada; Golden Star Resources Inc, based in Colorado, USA; and the government of Guyana. Cambior owned 65%, and Golden Star 30%, of the mine. Attempts were made in Guyana and in Canada to sue the companies. The Guyana case sought $2 billion in damages.

Gradual typing allows software developers to choose either type paradigm as appropriate, from within a single language. In many cases gradual typing is added to an existing dynamic language, creating a derived language allowing but not requiring static typing to be used. In some cases a language uses gradual typing from the start. History The term was coined by Jeremy Siek. Jeremy Siek and Walid Taha began researching gradual typing in 2006. Implementation In particular, gradual typing uses a special type named dynamic to represent statically-unknown types, and gradual typing replaces the notion of type equality with a new relation called consistency that relates the dynamic type to every other type. The consistency relation is symmetric but not transitive. Prior attempts at integrating static and dynamic typing tried to make the dynamic type be both the top and bottom of the subtype hierarchy. However, because subtyping is transitive, that results in every type becoming related to every other type, and so subtyping would no longer rule out any static type errors. The addition of a second phase of plausibility checking to the type system did not completely solve this problem. Gradual typing can easily be integrated into the type system of an object-oriented language that already uses the subsumption rule to allow implicit upcasts with respect to subtyping. The main idea is that consistency and subtyping are orthogonal ideas that compose nicely. To add subtyping to a gradually-typed language, simply add the subsumption rule and add a subtyping rule that makes the dynamic type a subtype of itself, because subtyping is supposed to be reflexive. (But do not make the top of the subtyping order dynamic!) Examples Examples of gradually typed languages derived from existing dynamically typed languages include Closure Compiler, TypeScript (both for JavaScript), Hack (for PHP), PHP (since 7.0), Typed Racket (for Racket), Typed Clojure (for Clojure), Cython (a Python compiler), mypy (a static type checker for Python), pyre (alternative static type checker for Python), or cperl (a typed Perl 5). ActionScript is a gradually typed language that is now an implementation of ECMAScript, though it originally arose separately as a sibling, both influenced by Apple's HyperTalk. A system for the J programming language has been developed, adding coercion, error propagation and filtering to the normal validation properties of the type system as well as applying type functions outside of function definitions, thereby the increasing flexibility of type definitions. Conversely, C# started as a statically typed language, but as of version 4.0 is gradually typed, allowing variables to be explicitly marked as dynamic by using the \`dynamic\` type. Gradually typed languages not derived from a dynamically typed language include Dart, Dylan, and Raku. Raku (formerly Perl6) has gradual typing implemented from the start. Type checks occur at all locations where values are assigned or bound. An \\"untyped\\" variable or parameter is typed as \`Any\`, which will match (almost) all values. The compiler flags type-checking conflicts at compile time if it can determine at compile time that they will never succeed. Objective-C has gradual typing for object pointers with respect to method calls. Static typing is used when a variable is typed as pointer to a certain class of object: when a method call is made to the variable, the compiler statically checks that the class is declared to support such a method, or it generates a warning or error. However, if a variable of the type \`id\` is used, the compiler will allow any method to be called on it. The JS++ programming language, released in 2011, is a superset of JavaScript (dynamically typed) with a gradual type system that is sound for ECMAScript and DOM API corner cases.

It is within the localities of Carrandotta and Piturie in the Shire of Boulia.  Geography  It is situated about west of Dajarra and north of Birdsville. The property has frontage onto the Georgina River including a permanent water-hole over long. The land is a mix of floodplain and high pebbly downs that is well covered in Mitchell and Flinders Grasses and lightly timbered with bloodwood, gidyea and coolibah trees.  History  Waluwarra (also known as Warluwarra, Walugara, and Walukara) is an Australian Aboriginal language of Western Queensland. Its traditional language region is the local government area of Shire of Boulia, including Walgra Station and Wolga, from Roxborough Downs north to Carandotta Station and Urandangi on the Georgina River, on Moonah Creek to Rochedale, south-east of Pituri Creek. The property was established by a syndicate of pastoralists headed by Oscar De Satge who took up three million acres along the Georgina River in 1884. The syndicate had believed that a railway would be built through the area from Cloncurry to Normanton. By 1891 the railway had not eventuated but the property was stocked with 100,000 sheep, 800 horses and 20,000 head of cattle. Unfortunately no dams were built and in the drought of 1892 some 90,000 sheep and 15,000 head of cattle perished. Sidney Kidman acquired Carandotta in 1903 from Pitt, Son and Badgery, at the time the property was estimated as being in area for ¬£65,000 on a walk-in walk-out basis. Kidman took his time to settle and paid the property off by 1906. By 1907 Kidman surrendered the lease to the Crown, then released of the leasehold. Sidney Kidman sold Carandotta in 1910 to Messrs Cumming and Capper. At this time it occupied an area of and was divided into 20 sheep paddocks, it also had a good wool scouring plant, stone homestead and a carrying capacity estimated at 200,000 sheep. The property was sold again in 1932 by the trustees of the later Mr. T. A. Stirton to Mr. H. C. Taylor on behalf of the Carandotta Pastoral Company. The property was in size and was stocked with 50,000 sheep, 400 cattle and 200 horses. Carandotta was divided in 51 paddocks and watered by 43 wells. In 1938 the now station was sold once more for ¬£50,000. It was stocked with 10,000 sheep and was sold to the Western Pastoral company. The early 1950s the station was plagued by dingoes with 800 being killed from 1952 to 1953. Later the lease was taken up as part of Headingly Station which occupies an area of of Queensland's Gulf country and is able to carry a herd of approximately 40,000 Santa Gertrudis cattle. It is currently owned by the Australian Agricultural Company. Headingly Station consists of three leases that operate as one entity, the leases being Headingly, Wolgra and Carandotta.

It existed from 1818 to 1928 but its 48 bays long Neoclassical building predates it and was Originally a royal textile factory. It now contains residences for officers in the Royal Danish Army. History The Gold House A military hospital was first opened at the site from 1673 when it took over the so-called Gold House, an alchemist laboratory. In 1683, Christian V purchased the buildings and used them as a textile factory. They were destroyed by fire in 1759 and replaced by a new building (Det Kgl. Uldmanufaktur) built by Georg Vollmeister in 1760 and extended in 1777-79 to a similar design. From 1799 to 1800, court architect Andreas Kirkerup was responsible for another extension of the building Known as Monderingsdepotet (No. 11). It was used by the Garrison Hospital from 1809. The textile production moved to Usser√∏d in 1815 and the architect Peder Friis was put in charge of adapting the rest of the complex for use by the hospital. The Garrison Hospital remained at the site until 1928 when it was replaced by the new Military Hospital at Tagensvej. Architecture The simple Neoclassical building is 48 bays long. The 31 bays closest to S√∏lvgade form the original part of the building from 1760. The remaining 17 bays are from the 1779 extension.

He was born Lazar Herrmann to a Jewish family in Kharkov. Although born in Ukraine, then part of the Russian Empire, Lania emigrated to Vienna and served in the Austro-Hungarian Army during the First World War. After the war he became increasingly involved with far-left politics and political theatre. In Germany he worked for the Communist-affiliated Prometheus Film and wrote The Shadow of a Mine (1929) for the Volksfilmverband.Murray p.225 He also produced the screenplay for G. W. Pabst's The Threepenny Opera (1931). During the late Weimar era, Lania worked with the celebrated theatre directors Max Reinhardt and Alexis Granowsky.Barton p.21-22 Lania's play Konjunktur (Oil Boom) premiered in Berlin in 1928, directed by Erwin Piscator, with incidental music by Kurt Weill. Three oil companies fight over the rights to oil production in a primitive Balkan country, and in the process exploit the people and destroy the environment. Weill's songs from this play, like \\"Die Muschel von Margate\\" are still performed. Lania was forced to emigrate from Germany following the Nazi takeover in 1933. He eventually settled in France. He worked on several screenplays, including fellow emigre Robert Wiene's Ultimatum (1938). Following the outbreak of the Second World War, Lania was interned by the Daladier government. Lania subsequently made his way to the United States via Spain and Portugal. Following the United States' entry into the war, Lania was employed by the Office of War Information. He later returned to Germany and settled in Munich. Selected filmography * The Shadow of a Mine (1929) * The Threepenny Opera (1931) * The Trunks of Mr. O.F.

From 2004 to 2013, he held the post of Deputy Chairman of the Central Bank of Russia. He holds a Doctorate of Economic Sciences. He is currently serving an eight-year prison term in a penal colony on the outskirts of Tver. Arrest and investigation The Investigative Committee of Russia announced that Ulyukaev had been detained in November 2016 due to allegations that he received a $2 million bribe for an assessment that led to the Kremlin-controlled oil company Rosneft's acquisition of a 50% stake in Bashneft. This followed an apparent sting operation after months of surveillance. On the same day, Vladimir Putin dismissed him from the ministerial position. His trial commenced in August 2017. The organizer of this apparent sting was Rosneft chief and Putin confidante Igor Sechin. Sechin, a key witness in the trial, was summoned four times by the defence, but refused to be cross- examined.https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/alexei-ulyukayev- bribery-trial-russia-latest-prosecutor-request-death-sentence-putin- rosneft-a8096786.html Ulyukayev compared his prosecution to the show trials of the 1930s.

Military career Loftus-Tottenham passed out from the Cadet College, Wellington and was commission a second lieutenant in April 1914 and was attached to the 2nd King Edward VII's Own Gurkha Rifles (The Sirmoor Rifles). A year later he was promoted to lieutenant. He was promoted captain in April 1920 and in May 1934 he was promoted to major. In 1940 he was advanced to lieutenant-colonel to command the newly raised 3rd battalion of the 1st Gurkha Rifles, stationed in Waziristan on the North West Frontier of India. He was mentioned in despatches for his services there. Having taken a parachute training course, he was appointed in October 1941 to raise and command 153 Gurkha Parachute Battalion, part of 50th Parachute Brigade. In February 1943 he was further promoted to acting brigadier to command 33rd Indian Infantry Brigade, part of 7th Indian Infantry Division. In October 1943 the brigade moved to the Arakan and in January 1944 took part in the division's attack down the Kalapanzin Valley to capture the only lateral route across the Mayu peninsula. British plans were forestalled in February by the Japanese Ha-Go Offensive which infiltrated and compromised the division's lines of supply. However, new tactics dictated that instead of retreating to protect supply lines, the division should hold firm forming defensive boxes to await relief from formations in reserve. Supplies would come from the air. The main target of the Japanese was the division's Admin Box and for a short while Loftus-Tottenham was given the task of co-ordinating the division's three brigades while divisional commander Frank Messervy was out of touch, his HQ having been overrun. 33 Brigade saw heavy fighting but slowly, with their own supplies cut, the Japanese attack began to fade. By early March the division was once more on the attack and late in the month Loftus-Tottenham's brigade was withdrawn into reserve. In April 1944 the brigade was airlifted from the Arakan as part of the reinforcements sent to XXXIII Indian Corps at Kohima facing the Japanese U Go offensive and experienced heavy fighting throughout May until the end of the battle. After a pause the brigade took part in the pursuit and then was withdrawn to refit and rest. In June Loftus-Tottenham was awarded the DSO. In August 1944 Loftus-Tottenham was promoted to acting major- general to command the 81st West African Division which held the left hand flank of XV Corps' front in the Arakan. The division had virtually no transport, relying on auxiliary groups of porters to support each of its two brigades. In some respects this proved no disadvantage given the very poor going in the Kaladan Valley where the division was to operate and that access to the valley was via the \\"West African Way,\\" a temporary jeep track constructed in 1943. As a result, the division relied for much of its supply from the air and constructed light aircraft and Dakota strips as it advanced. He also found the unit seriously short of non-commissioned officers since no British reinforcements had arrived; he therefore resorted to promoting Africans, who proved to be entirely satisfactory. In mid January the division had reached Myohaung and with two brigades from 82nd West African Division under command launched an attack which saw the key town taken by the end of the month when the division was relieved and withdrawn to Southern India. In March 1945 Loftus-Tottenham was awarded his second DSO. In India the division trained for an amphibious landing on the Kra Isthmus but the operation was cancelled and the division did not see further action. After the war Loftus- Tottenham spent a time in command of Force 401, an expanded brigade group formed to protect British oil interests in south-west IranFor an explanation see Middle East Studies article via https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00263206.2015.1124417 and was based in southern Iraq,For a description see an Indian officer's account via: http://veekay-militaryhistory.blogspot.com/2012/10/biography-lieut-general-rn- batra-pvsm.html near Basra till its withdrawal in May‚ÄìJune 1947 (in connection with which he was appointed CBE), and then became GOC Iraq.The memoirs of Nigel Buxton, his ADC, describing a longstanding plan to launch such an action into Iran and more details.

His retirement from the British Army (with the substantive rank of full colonel) was formally dated February 1948 but he remained active on the specially employed list seconded to the Pakistan Army (to which his division, now the 7th Infantry Division was allocated).

Clashes between the followers of militant preacher Ahmed Al-Assir resulted in the deaths of 18 soldiers, 25‚Äì40 al-Assir gunmen, two civilians, and according to some sources, four Hezbollah fighters. The clashes were the deadliest since the Syria-related internal conflict in Lebanon began in 2011.  Background  The Syrian civil war has heightened sectarian tensions within Lebanon, particularly between Sunni and Shia Muslims, many of whom support opposing sides and have entered the conflict in large numbers. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah announced on May 25 that Hezbollah would openly support President Bashar al-Assad's forces in fighting the insurgency in Syria. Some Sunni leaders in Lebanon have likewise at various points in time called for Jihad against the Assad government in Syria, and urged Lebanese to join. In June 2013, clashes broke out in an eastern suburb of Sidon after several people attacked, threw stones at, and shattered the windows of a car belonging to Amjad al-Assir, the brother of Hezbollah critic and hard-line cleric Sheik Ahmad al-Assir. Al-Assir then gave Hezbollah a one-week ultimatum to vacate apartments occupied by the group's supporters in the mostly Sunni city. Clashes broke out between gunmen backing Hezbollah and Sheik Al-Assir, both sides wielding automatic rifles and rocket-propelled grenades. Officials stated that the gunmen fighting al-Assir's followers were believed to be Hezbollah sympathizers.https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/18/lebanon- clashes_n_3459054.html Huffington Post Lebanese army troops deployed in the area of the fighting, which subsided after several hours. The military called on gunmen to withdraw immediately from the streets.  Fighting  On 23 June 2013, heavy street fighting erupted between the Lebanese Army, with Hezbollah military backing,https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and- africa/21580162-sectarian-rivalry-reverberating-region-making-many-muslims Islam‚Äôs old schism: Sunnis v Shias, here and there and gunmen loyal to Al- Assir, with a clash at an Army checkpoint near the Abra complex that houses the Bilal bin Rabah Mosque. McClatchy News and the Times of London reported that Hezbollah forces backed the army. Roads were later blocked in other parts of the country, and the army came under fire in the Ain el-Hilweh camp. The next day, the Lebanese army launched a crackdown on the pro-Assair militia attacking houses near his Mosque in Sidon from which Assair operates. At least four tanks and several army vehicles were destroyed. Lebanese Army commandos seized a complex controlled by gunmen loyal to Sheikh Ahmad Assir. Assir reportedly fled the complex at around 10 a.m., shortly after the Army stormed the premises which the military gradually gained control over throughout the day. 22 bodies were pulled out of Assir's mosque after the Army captured it. Sources said soldiers were still trading gunfire with snipers located on the rooftops of nearby buildings. Ahmed al-Assir was still at large with the Army having orders to capture or kill him after he was accused of killing soldiers in \\"cold blood\\". 65‚Äì70 gunmen, including several non-Lebanese nationals, reportedly either surrendered or were captured by Army units during the raid on the complex. Lebanon‚Äôs military prosecutor issued arrest warrants against Assir and 123 of his followers. The warrants included the names of Assir's brother, and singer Fadl Shaker, who gave up his singing career to follow Al- Assir. The raid on the compound at noon came after an attempt by a group of Salafi preachers to mediate a truce reached a dead end, with the Army determined to continue its operations until Assir was captured and his followers crushed, the sources said.http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Local- News/2013/Jun-24/221395-fierce-clashes-rock-south-lebanon-city-for-second- day.ashx#ixzz2X9bBrhZD The Daily Star Some sources claimed Hezbollah fighters had backed the Lebanese Army, but this was strongly denied by Lebanese Defence Minister Fayez Ghosn, who insisted the army fought alone. Overall, at least 50 people died during the fighting. 17‚Äì18 soldiers, 25‚Äì40 militants and reportedly four Hezbollah fighters were killed. Two civilians were killed, including a bodyguard of a cleric, who tried to reach the fighting to negotiate a ceasefire. 100‚Äì128 Lebanese soldiers, 60 pro-Assir militants, over 50 civilians and reportedly 15 Hezbollah fighters were wounded. Aftermath Partly as a result of Assir‚Äôs calls for help while holed up in his mosque in Sidon, thousands of youths in the outskirts of a slum in Cairo, Egypt attacked a Shia gathering there and killed its leader and three of his followers. Assir denounced the army as Shia stooges and urged soldiers to defect from the Lebanese army and join him, but this was condemned by the grand mufti of Lebanon. After McClatchy News and the Times of London reported that the Lebanese Army had fought alongside Hezbollah in the battle, the Army threatened legal action against news institutions that made such reports. Shortly after those threats, video of Hezbollah fighting alongside the Army was broadcast on Lebanese television. The Army also came under fire from human rights activists for the videotaped beating of one detainee from the battle and the death during questioning of a second arrestee.

Today, more than 450 young musicians ages 5‚Äì18 gather every week to learn choral music and singing in a healthy, diverse, and inclusive environment. The organization runs eight core ensembles, one of which is in special collaboration with the Boys and Girls Clubs, as well as an extensive early- childhood music and movement program for babies and toddlers called Music Together. Through their specially crafted programming, CCSA continues to cultivate the arts and culture in San Antonio, while transforming the lives of young people through the power of music and friendship.  History  The CCSA was founded in 1983 by Marguerite McCormick. Originally known as the UTSA Children's Chorus, the chorus operated with only 33 singers. As the program grew, it eventually split off and the Children's Chorus of San Antonio was officially created as an independent musical non-profit organization in 1993. Marguerite McCormick served as the artistic director of the chorus until 2017. In April 2017, she was succeeded by Ryan Garrison, a choral arts teacher at the Arizona School for the Arts. In 2019, Dr. Gary Mabry stepped up as Interim Artistic Director, following Garrison. In 2014, CCSA became a resident affiliate of the Tobin Center for the Performing Arts, moving the majority of its performances into the Tobin Center.  Programs  CCSA‚Äôs programs are divided into three divisions: Beginning, Intermediate, and Advanced Ensembles Performing at the annual Spring Song concert in 2008. = Core Ensembles = CCSA's core ensembles provide a rigorous curriculum of performance-based instruction ranging from the basics of vocal technique through an extensive and diverse repertoire. These ensembles are divided into Beginning, Intermediate, and Advanced level ensembles- accommodating a wide range of ages and skill levels. Placement hearings are held annually for both returning and new singers. Preparatory and Prelude ensembles are Beginning Level ensembles, providing an introductory choral experience for ages 5‚Äì8. Both ensembles are directed by Mrs. Rebecca Juarez. Chorale and Choristers are Intermediate Level ensembles, providing choral experience for ages 9‚Äì13. Chorale is the primary ensemble for ages 9‚Äì13. This ensemble is for growing and beginner singers. Choristers offers more challenging repertoire for singers with previous choral experience, ages 11‚Äì13. Mrs. Alyssa Avenatti directs Chorale and Mrs. Rebecca Morgan directs Choristers. There are three ensembles at the Advanced Level for ages 14‚Äì18; Concert Choir, Chamber, and Encore. Concert Choir is a larger treble ensemble of singers with previous choral experience. Chamber ensemble is a full SATB-mixed choral experience, meeting one day/week for 90-minutes. Encore is CCSA's premiere advanced treble ensemble. Singers in Encore are also required to provide leadership within CCSA's Concert Choir. All three choral groups require placement by audition. Concert Choir, Chamber, and Encore are all directed by CCSA's Artistic Director, Dr. Ryan Garrison. = Neighborhood Choirs = In 2014, CCSA created the Neighborhood Choirs division as a community outreach program. Neighborhood Choirs are year-round programs for students in grades 3-8, guiding them to sing, work as a team and find their voice both musically and individually. Now in partnership with the Boys and Girls Clubs, Neighborhood Choirs are tuition-free. Students receive similar curriculum and instruction as comparable levels of core ensembles. Neighborhood Choirs meet once per week for one hour during the academic year. These choirs also offer summer camps for 2 hours, once per day for a three- week intensive camp during the summer. Neighborhood Choir students perform at the Tobin Center for the Performing Arts in the H-E-B Hall twice a year; summer students receive a similar experience with a concert in the Alvarez Theater. = Music Together = Music Together is a nationally recognized early childhood program that encourages natural enthusiasm for music and movement in infants, toddlers, and young children birth to age 4. Parents, grandparents, and caregivers are present at each class. Through this program, children and their accompanying adults share songs, rhymes, movement and instrument play in a non-performance-oriented environment. Music Together with CCSA offers Mixed Age classes for babies and toddlers 18 months old through age 4, and a Babies-only class. These classes occur throughout the week.

They live by the Cayapas River in the Centro El Encanto, a section of the Cotacachi Cayapas Ecological Reserve, as do Afro Ecuadorian people; the two groups have co- existed in the forest for about 400 years. There were approximately 5,000 Chachi in 2003. History According to Chachi oral tradition, they originated in Imbabura Province in the mountains near Ibarra, fleeing after the Castilian invasion and spent time in Chimborazo. They were forced to settle in the area after the Spanish conquest of Ibarra, which led them to move to Esmeraldas. They have traditionally been known as Cayapas (Cay, meaning \\"son\\"; Apa, meaning \\"father\\"). However, after rejecting the term \\"Father's Son\\", from 1978, the people have been called Chachi (\\"pure\\"). The Chachi speak a Barbacoan language named Cayapa. Linguistically, their closest living relatives are the Tsachila people of Ecuador. Today, they inhabit the river valleys of the Cayapas, Canand√©, and Muisne Rivers in Esmeraldas Province. Culture Chachi people are characterized as being marginalized and poor. Homes are built on stilts with sides and a roof of thatch. Women's clothing includes a loose skirt with a sash at the waist while men wear a long shirt with pants; both men and women have bare chests. Since colonization, Chachi have converted to Catholicism. The group's leader is known as \\"Uni\\" while the \\"Chaitalas\\" hold a lesser role. The canoe provides a means of transportation. Bark is used to form a kind of paper or fabric. Their economy is based on traditional subsistence agriculture and fishing. However, the Chachi are well noted for their basketwork, and they sell their craft items in stalls in Borb√≥n, Limones, Esmeraldas and Quito.

The production of chocolate was arduous work in 1815: a chocolatier could only produce only 5‚Äì6 kg of chocolate per day. In 1844, Crozier's son took over management of Croisier-Chaulmontet. In 1850, the company began mechanizing its production. By 1884, Croisier-Chaulmontet had ordered two water wheels that were driven by the River Rhone to power its production. In 1927, the company opened a chocolate powders plant in Lausanne. That same year, the company was incorporated as Charles Croisier SA.

The political upheavals were enough that Embergher had to shut down most of his business, including that which made this work of modern art. Photo by Jacques Henri Bayle Antonio Luigi Embergher (4 February 1856 Arpino - 12 May 1943 Rome) was an Italian Luthier known for his high quality bowlback mandolins.Alex Timmerman's Embergher websiteRalf Leenen's Embergher site Information on Embergher instruments at www.mandolincafe.com Life and work In the 1890s he collaborated with the Mandolin virtuoso G. B. Maldura, creating a series of concert mandolins for mandolin orchestras including two mandolin types, a mandoliola (also called Octave mandola) and a mandoloncello, all suited for playing string quartet pieces for mandolin. They were first displayed in Turin in 1898, and soon became came to set the standard measures for mandolin orchestras. Embergher made instruments from approximately 1880 through 1935. He is considered to have taken Rome's standard of building mandolins, exemplified by luthiers Giovanni De Santis and Giovanni Battista Maldura, and improved upon it. His instruments became known for their \\"strong, sonorous warm sound and a perfect intonation.\\" Among improvements he made was to change the way the instrument sounded making alterations to the sound board and sound chamber. He also added a zero-fret, an extension of the fingerboard under the 2nd string up to the g, and a highly pronounced 'V'-shape in the cross-section of the neck. Instruments from his atelier were considered \\"the finest instruments\\" and demand for them rose until he was employing 15 luthiers in his workshop and exporting to other countries. World-renowned mandolin virtuoso Silvio Ranieri did much to extend the fame of Embergher's instruments. Ranieri only performed using Embergher mandolins, and he compared them to the Stradivarius violin in perfection. After hearing one of his performances, Embergher gave Ranieri a superb instrument that had won the gold medal at a 1900 exhibition in Paris, and the two remained close friends. In 1904 a glowing review of one of Ranieri's concerts concluded by stating that \\"We are sure that Ranieri will not be offended if we attribute a part of his great triumphs to the excellence of his wonderful instrument. The instruments of Embergher are unequalled, not only the richness and fullness of tone are remarkable, but the intonation is also perfect\\" In 1913, for his successful career, Embergher was knighted as \\"Cavaliere della Corona d'Italia\\" (Knight of the Order of the Italian Crown). At the height of production, his shop produced between 80 and 100 mandolins a month, mainly mandolins, but also the terzino, mandola, mandoloncello, liuto cantabile and the mandobasso, all used in the mandolin orchestras of the day. Political upheavals in the 1930s made it difficult to export his instruments, and he closed his shop, continuing to make instruments for Italians in his atelier.Italian tourist portal, Antonio Luigi Embergher After his death in 1943, instruments were made with his standards by luthiers Domenico Cerrone (from 1938 to 1954) and his son Giannino Cerrone, and by Pasquale Pecoraro. Pecoraro was the last to build \\"in the exact Embergher-design and manner,\\" and died in 1987.

She is listed in the Michigan Women's Hall of Fame for her contributions to Social Work and Mission Work in the Detroit area. Early life and education Charleszetta Lena Campbell was born on October 7, 1912 in St. Louis, Missouri to Henry Campbell and Ella Brown. She was the eldest of seven children, only three of whom survived to adulthood. Her father Henry was a successful St. Louis barber who became financially ruined after he unknowingly gave a haircut to a customer with impetigo, a contagious skin disease, which subsequently caused the infection to spread to other clients who were members of his church congregation. Her father died when she was 12, and, despite being a successful student, she left school in eighth grade to get work as a housemaid and provide for her family. The following year, Waddles found work as a sorter in a rag factory and later that year became pregnant by her 23-year-old boyfriend, who ended up leaving her. In 1933, at age 21, she married LeRoy Wash, a 37-year-old truck driver, and the couple had six children together. The family moved together to Detroit in 1936. Waddles divorced Wash in 1945. She then lived in a common-law marriage with Roosevelt Sturkey and had three more children. In 1950 she married Payton Waddles, an employee of Ford Motor Company. Ministry and help to poor Portrait by Nicole Macdonald For over four decades, the Reverend Charleszetta Waddles, affectionately known as \\"Mother Waddles,\\" devoted her life to providing food, hope, and human dignity to the downtrodden and disadvantaged people of Detroit. Founder, director, and spiritual leader of the Mother Waddles Perpetual Mission, Inc., a nonprofit, nondenominational organization run by volunteers and dependent on private donations, Waddles believed that the church must move beyond religious dogma to focus on the real needs of real people. Following a period of diligent bible study, Charleszetta Waddles became an ordained as a minister in the First Pentecostal Church. She was later re-ordained, in the International Association of Universal Truth. In 1950, her religious teachings gave shape and inspiration to the founding of the Helping Hand Restaurant. In Detroit's skid row surrounded by flophouses she offered meals for as little as 35 cents. Unlike the ‚Äúsoup kitchens‚Äù of the Depression era, where the destitute lined up with a tin cup for a handout, Mother Waddles‚Äô establishment boasted of white tablecloths, a flower on every table and uniformed waitresses. Those who could not pay could eat for free, while those who could afford to often paid as much as three dollars for a cup of coffee. At first Mother Waddles did all the cooking, dishwashing and laundry herself, but as time went by, dozens of dedicated volunteers joined her. The restaurant remained open until 1984 when a fire forced its closure. In 1956 Waddles convinced an inner-city landlord to let her use a vacant storefront at no cost. It was at this property, located in a crime-ridden area of Detroit that she established Mother Waddles Perpetual Mission for Saving Souls of All Nations. Its name was later shortened to: Mother Waddles Perpetual Mission. Fires, financial setbacks and other problems forced the mission to move several times over the years, but its spirit and goals remained the same. Thousands of needy people walked through the doors of the mission. At times over 200 volunteers were available to help provide for and assist the needy. In addition to helping people, Mother Waddles, started innovative programs for the disadvantaged. Classes in typing, dressmaking, machine operation, upholstery and cooking were among those taught at the centers. A free medical clinic, job counseling and placement were available through the mission. \\"We're trying to show what the church could mean to the world if it lived by what it preached,\\" Mother Waddles told Newsweek. \\"I read the Bible. It didn't say just go to church. It said, 'Do something.'\\" In addition to operating a 35-cent dining room on Detroit's \\"skid row\\" that serves appetizing meals in cheerful, dignified surroundings, the mission offers health care, counseling, and job training to thousands of needy citizens. Still others benefit from an Emergency Services Program that provides food, clothing, shelter, and medicine. Well into her eighties, Waddles continued to work 12-hour days and to remain on call throughout the night. \\"We give a person the things he needs, when he needs them,\\" she told Lee Edson of Reader's Digest. \\"We take care of him whether he's an alcoholic or a junkie, black or white, employed or unemployed. We don't turn anyone away.\\" References External links * Detroit portrait series including Charleszetta Waddles * Black Women Oral History Project interview with Waddles Category:1912 births Category:2001 deaths Category:African-American activists Category:Clergy from Detroit ","title":"Charleszetta Waddles"},{"id":"39765617","text":"Marco Fuser (born 9 March 1991) is an Italian rugby union player who plays as a Lock.

In 2014, IHO received the single largest grant dedicated to the research of human origins. Origins After finding Lucy during the \\"surge of discoveries\\" in the 1970s, Donald Johanson returned to Berkeley, California and founded the Institute of Human Origins with the mission of bridging social, earth, and life science approaches to the most important questions concerning the course, causes, and timing of events in the human career over deep time. Research and discoveries =Fossil record of the earliest human evolution= Ledi-Geraru is one of IHO's fieldwork sites in the fossil-rich Afar Region of Ethiopia. In 2013, graduate student Chalachew Seyoum discovered the lower mandible known as LD 350-1, the oldest fossil from the human genus, Homo. The discovery pushed back evidence of the human genus, Homo, to 2.8 million years, ago, nearly a half-million years earlier than previously known. Ongoing IHO field work in Hadar, Ethiopia, where Lucy was found in 1974, addresses the evolution and ecology of Australopithecus (3.0‚Äì3.4 million years ago) and the origin of Homo and stone-tool making (2.3 million years ago). In 2007, the field project opened ASU‚Äôs Hadar Field School, which educates American study abroad students in field methods in human origins research. =Emergence of modern humans in Africa= Since joining IHO in 2001, Curtis Marean has directed the organization's Pinnacle Point fieldwork, which is working to produce and integrate a climate, environment, and paleoanthropological sequence for the final stage in human evolution. The focus of the Pinnacle Point excavations has been at Cave 13B (PP13B), where the fieldwork team has discovered early evidence of symbolic behavior. In 2009, the examination of worked silcrete stone from Pinnacle Point indicated that it was heat-treated, and is the oldest known example of such technology. Pinnacle Point also represents the oldest known occurrence of human consumption of shellfish, as well as an early use of ochre. These features indicate a sophisticated level of modern behaviors that had previously been associated with Upper Paleolithic of Europe. The discoveries here are key pieces of evidence supporting the early florescence of modern human behaviors in Africa. =Evolutionary foundations of human uniqueness= The IHO Templeton Research Program is a collaborative inquiry into the evolutionary foundations of human uniqueness. The $4.9 million, three-year grant from the John Templeton Foundation is the largest of its type for human origins research, and will support 11 linked investigations of where, when, and how unique human capacities for complex cognition, cumulative culture, and large-scale cooperation emerged.

Indonesia has an embassy in Warsaw, while Poland has an embassy in Jakarta. Other than similar red-and-white flags, Indonesia and Poland share a similar course of history through enduring revolutions, wars for independence and maintaining national unity. Both nations have agreed to expand bilateral relations in trade, culture and education sectors, through programs such as staging art exhibitions to proposing student exchange programs and provide scholarships. History Embassy of Indonesia in Warsaw The historical links between Poland and Indonesia dates back to the colonial era of Dutch East Indies. Circa 19th century Polish people began to migrate to East Indies. The former Medan's airport Polonia was named after Poland. The airport was built on a tobacco plantation once owned by Baron Michalsky in 1872, a Polish immigrant that named his estate \\"Polonia\\", a latin name for Poland. The bilateral diplomatic relations was officially established in 1955. High level visits The first high level visit from Indonesia was President Sukarno visit to Poland in 1959, followed 44 years later by his daughter President Megawati Sukarnoputri in 2003. President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono also made a state visit to Poland in 2013. Meanwhile, the first Polish president to visit Indonesia was President Aleksander Kwa≈õniewski in 2004 and then followed by PM Marek Belka in 2005. On January 2013 the Polish Parliament delegation led by Krzysztof Klosowski visited their counterparts Indonesian Parliament in Jakarta. Trade and investment In 2011 Polish exports to Indonesia is 1.1 trillion rupiah (US$121 million), while its imports reached 6.6 trillion rupiah (US$720 million), making the trade balance heavily in favor to Indonesia. Poland mainly sells machinery, military equipments and weapons, and chemicals to Indonesia, while buying coal, textiles, wooden furniture, crude palm oil, and agricultural products from Indonesia. Usually the Indonesian- origin furnitures are being finished in Poland and re-export to other European markets. Polish investment in Indonesia in 1st quarter of 2012 reached US$7 million in electronics and intermodal container. While the Polish investments in coal mining, furniture and agriculture shoe the figure US$155 million.

Ovatoryctocara can be recognised by the combination of the following characters: the central raised area of the cephalon (or glabella) is approximately cylindrical and has two rows of four triangular or round pits. The thorax only has 5 or 6 segments. The tailshield (or pygidium) has an axis (or rhachis) of 6 to 12 rings, the pleural furrows are well developed and the border is absent or narrow as a hair.  Etymology  The name of the genus is derived from its type Oryctocara ovata. Ovata refers to its oval overall shape, the Ancient Greek ·ΩÄœÅœçŒ∫œÑŒ∑œÇ (oryctos) means \\"digger\\", and the Latin cara is a word for \\"head\\" or \\"face\\".  Biostratographic significance  The species of the genus Ovatoryctocara occur near the lower limit of the Middle Cambrian in Siberia. The first appearance datum (FAD) of Ovatoryctocara granulata was proposed as the defining marker for the lower limit of the Wuliuan. O. granulata is moderately widespread (East Siberia, South China, Greenland, and Newfoundland).  Distribution  * O. ovata was found in the early Middle Cambrian of the Russian Federation (Ovatoryctocara granulata zone, Nekekit, Malaya Kuonamka, Olenek, Amyday, and Muna rivers, and into the lower Kounamkites zone, Molodo River, East Siberia). * O. angusta ssp. angusta is present in the early Middle Cambrian of the Russian Federation (lower part of the Ovatoryctocara granulata zone, Malaya Kuonamka, and Torkukuy rivers, East Siberia). * O. angusta ssp. snegirevae has been encountered in the early Middle Cambrian of the Russian Federation (Ovatoryctocara granulata zone, Molodo and Malaya Kuonamka Rivers; Amaday Horizon, Maya River, East Siberia). * O. doliiformis has been collected from the early Middle Cambrian of the Russian Federation (upper part of the Ovatoryctocara granulata zone, Molodo River, East Siberia) * O. granulata occurs in the early Middle Cambrian of the Russian Federation (Ovatoryctocara granulata zone, Nekekit, Malaya Kuonamka, Olenek, Amyday, and Muna rivers, and into the lower Kounamkites zone, Molodo River, East Siberia), China (O. granulata‚ÄìBathynotus holopyga zone, late Duyunian, Kaili Formation), latest Lower Cambrian of Greenland (upper Olenellus zone, Henson Glacier Formation) and of Canada (top of the Cephalopyge notabilis zone, Branche Cove Marl Member, Eastern Cove Branche, Newfoundland).  Description  Very small to small trilobite (maximum length approximately ) of more or less oval overall shape. The head shield (or cephalon) has natural fracture lines that end at the tip of the genal angle or the rear margin (or it has gonatoparian or proparian facial sutures). The central area of the cephalon (or glabella) is cylindrical or slightly expanded midlength and/or at the frontal lobe. The furrows that show the segmented origin, are most distinct in the form of four sets of rounded or triangular pits, sometimes with a shallow depression between them at the midline. The glabella is almost touching the front of the cephalon (or the pre-glabellar field is short). Narrow eye ridges emerge from the back of the frontal lobe outward and slightly backward (¬± 20¬∞). Thorax of 5 or 6 segments. Pygidium approximately the same size (isopygous) or larger (macropygous) than the cephalon, with an axis of 6 to 12 rings, and clear pleural furrows. The border is lacking or hair thin. The surface may be smooth or has granules.

This section includes Agra Chord and Etah link. The main line is part of Howrah-Delhi main line and Howrah-Gaya-Delhi line. The Agra-Delhi chord is part of Delhi-Mumbai line and Delhi-Chennai line. History The East Indian Railway Company initiated efforts to develop a railway line from Howrah to Delhi in the mid nineteenth century. Even when the line to Mughalsarai was being constructed and only the lines near Howrah were put in operation, the first train ran from Allahabad to Kanpur in 1859 and the Kanpur-Etawah section was opened to traffic in the 1860s. For the first through train from Howrah to Delhi in 1864, coaches were ferried on boats across the Yamuna at Allahabad. With the completion of the Old Naini Bridge across the Yamuna through trains started running in 1865-66. The wide metre gauge Delhi-Bandikui and Bandikui- Agra lines of Rajputana State Railway were opened in 1874. The lines were converted to broad gauge in early 2000s. The Hathras Road-Mathura Cantt broad gauge line was opened in 1875 and the Agra-Gwalior broad gauge line was opened in 1881. The broad gauge Agra-Delhi chord was opened in 1904. Some parts of it were relaid during the construction of New Delhi (inaugurated in 1927-28). The long wide broad gauge Barhan-Etah line was constructed in 1959. The long wide broad gauge Ghaziabad-Tughlakabad line, including bridge across Yamuna, was completed in 1966. Electrification The Kanpur-Panki sector was electrified in 1968-69, Panki-Tundla in 1971-72, Tundla-Aligarh-Ghaziabad in 1975-76, Ghaziabad-Nizamuddin-New Delhi-Delhi in 1976-77, Tilak Bridge-Fairdabad in 1982-83, Raja ki Mandi-Agra-Dhoulpur in 1984-85, Tundla-Yamuna Bridge in 1998-99 and Yamuna Bridge-Agra in 1990-91.

It is Grade II listed. History In the early 19th century the local board of health held its meetings in the old school in what is now Town Hall Square. Meanwhile the local Mechanics Institute used the lecture hall on the High Street for its meetings. After both the old school and the lecture hall became inadequate for meetings, the local board and the Mechanics Institute decides to join together in an initiative to commission a proper town hall. The site selected had previously be owned by a cloth merchant, William Starkey. Following a competition with more than 200 entries, and with a budget of ¬£5,000, William Hill was chosen to design the building in the French Gothic style. The foundation stone for the new building was laid on 10 May 1879. It was built by the local builder, Richard Hogg, with two storeys and a two-stage clock tower at the centre of the main frontage. Inside, the design featured offices on the ground floor and an assembly hall on the first floor. It was officially opened by the banker and politician, William Beckett-Denison, on 26 June 1880. The town hall was the headquarters of Yeadon Urban District Council but ceased to be the local seat of government when the enlarged Aireborough Urban District Council was formed, with its headquarters at Micklefield House in Rawdon, in 1937. After Aireborough Urban District Council was abolished in 1972, responsibility for the management of the building was transferred to Leeds City Council in 1974. In 1980 the television producer, Barney Colehan, led a week of festivities to celebrate the centenary of the original opening of the building. The building was used as a registrar's office in the Yorkshire Television programme The Beiderbecke Tapes in 1985. The main assembly hall, which seats up to 560 people, was renovated in 1999. On 1 April 2019, the management of the venue was taken over by local theatre producer, Jamie Hudson, who created a \\"Community Interest Company\\" in order to restore, refurbish and manage the building. Large portions of the building were refurbished and the theatre bar on the first floor was extensively restored. The town hall continues to host touring music and theatre shows although the highlight of the year is usually the Christmas Spectacular.

Her parentage is unclear, but her first marriage to Pain fitzJohn is well attested. Through her marriage, Sybil transferred lands in several shires to her husband, including lands around Ludlow Castle and the castle itself. After Pain's death in 1137, Sybil attempted to retain control of Ludlow and her lands but in 1139 King Stephen of England married her to Josce de Dinan, who died in 1166. Sybil had two daughters with Pain, and is probably the mother of Josce's two daughters also. Sybil's marriage to Josce, and his control of Ludlow in right of his wife forms the background to a medieval Welsh romance, Fouke le Fitz Waryn. Parentage Historians disagree about Sybil's parentage. One theory, given in the entry for her first husband in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography states that Sybil was the niece of Hugh de Lacy.Mason \\"Pain fitz John (d. 1137)\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Another theory, coming from the Complete Peerage, states that Sybil was the daughter of Geoffrey Talbot and Talbot's wife Agnes, who was probably the daughter of Walter de Lacy, Hugh's father.Cokayne Complete Peerage XII/2 pp. 270‚Äì271 Yet another theory, put forth by historian K. S. B. Keats-Rohan states Sybil was the daughter of Hugh de Lacy.Keats-Rohan Domesday Descendants p. 919 Marriage Sybil married first Pain fitzJohn,Keats-Rohan Domesday Descendants p. 538 a marriage that took place around 1115. Through Sybil, Pain acquired a number of holdings around Ludlow Castle, as well as control of the castle itself.Green Henry I p. 174 Ludlow was an important strategic stronghold which controlled part of the Welsh Borders.Crouch Reign of King Stephen p. 102 and footnote 55 Sybil also brought her husband lands in Gloucestershire, Herefordshire, and Worcestershire. Both King Henry I and King Stephen recognized Pain's right to his wife's lands. Sybil had inherited lands that originally had been held by her kinsman Roger de Lacy, who had been banished from England in 1095 and his English estates confiscated; he had though retained his properties in Normandy. Roger's English possessions were given to his brother Hugh de Lacy, from whom Sybil had inherited them. On Roger's death his son Gilbert inherited the lands in Normandy, and pressed his claim to the family's former English estates. Coplestone-Crow notes that there was uncertainty hanging over the inheritance, and accounted for one reason why Sybil's husband worked to secure more lands around Ludlow.Coplestone-Crow \\"Payn fitzJohn and Ludlow Castle\\" Shropshire History and Archaeology p. 178 Sybil was not the only recipient of Hugh de Lacy's lands; some went to Josce de Dinan and some to Miles of Gloucester. Widowhood Pain died on 10 July 1137 and was buried in Gloucester Abbey. Sybil retained control of Ludlow Castle until the middle of 1139, when she was forced to surrender it to King Stephen after a siege.Crouch Reign of King Stephen p. 102 Stephen then married Sybil to Josce de Dinan, probably because he felt that Josce trustworthy enough to control the castle. Dinan thus acquired control of Ludlow Castle in right of his wife, setting up the background to Gilbert de Lacy's attempts to seize Ludlow from Dinan on which the medieval Welsh romance work Fouke le Fitz Waryn is based.Coplestone- Crow \\"Payn fitzJohn and Ludlow Castle\\" Shropshire History and Archaeology p. 181 Josce, however, rebelled against Stephen and fortified Ludlow against the king.Chibnall Empress Matilda pp. 123‚Äì124 Josce died in 1166. Children Sybil had two daughters, Cecily and Agnes, with Pain. The two girls married five times in their lives; Cecily's three marriages failed to produce any direct heirs.Newman Anglo-Norman Nobility pp. 172‚Äì173 Cecily was first married to Roger, the son of Miles of Gloucester. This alliance had been arranged by Cecily's father and the marriage contract specified that Roger would inherit all of Pain's lands, but at Pain's death the marriage had still not been formally contracted. In December 1137 King Stephen confirmed the terms of the settlement. Stephen also settled the bulk of Pain's lands on Cecily, which led to disturbances and a minor war among disappointed claimants.Green Aristocracy of Norman England p. 381 Agnes first married Warin de Munchensy and then Haldenald de Bidun. She died sometime after 1185, when she was noted as a widow. Presumably Sybil is the mother of Josce's two daughters ‚Äì Sibil, who married Hugh de Pulgenet and died in 1212, and Hawise who married Fulk FitzWarin, who died in 1197.Keats-Rohan Domesday Descendants p. 434 In 1199 Sibil and Hawise petitioned the king regarding the ownership of the town and castle of Ludlow but were turned down.Coplestone-Crow \\"The End of the Anarchy to the de Genevilles\\" Ludlow Castle: Its History & Buildings pp. 36‚Äì37  Notes   Citations   References      * Category:12th-century English people Category:Anglo-Normans Category:Anglo- Norman women Category:De Lacy family Category:12th-century English women ","title":"Sybil (wife of Pain fitzJohn)"},{"id":"39765737","text":"About That Life is the fifth studio album by American nu metalcore band Attila.

Originally used as a jump-rope chant, it is now more often sung alone or as part of a clapping game. It has many variations, possibly originating from it, or from its predecessors.Henninger, Jessie. \\"Miss Susie Had a Steamboat: I. Structure\\" at The Raveled Sleeve. 29 Nov 2008\\\\. Accessed 16 Jan 2014.Henninger, Jessie. \\"Miss Susie Had a Steamboat: V. Versions of the Rhyme Used in This Essay\\" at The Raveled Sleeve. 29 Nov 2008\\\\. Accessed 12 Jan 2014. The song is often combined or confused with the similar but cruder \\"Miss Susie had a steamboat\\", which uses the same tune and was also used as a jump- rope game.  Structure  As in \\"Miss Susie\\", the rhyme is organized by its meter, an accentual verse, in trimeter. Accentual verse allows for set number of accents regardless of the number of syllables in the verse. It is a common form in English folk verse, especially in nursery rhymes and jump-rope rhymes. The song shares much of the same melody as the 1937 \\"The Merry-Go-Round Broke Down\\" used by Warner Bros. as the theme to their Looney Tunes cartoons.Smith, Ronald. Comedy on Record: the Complete Critical Discography, p. 634\\\\. Garland Publishing, 1988.  History  The history of the Miss Susie similar rhyme has been studied, tracing it back to the 1950s, in Josepha Sherman's article published by the American Folklore Society.On Children's rhymes and changing sexuality perception throughout time However, several other books and articles show similar versions used as far back as the end of the 19th century.Cray, Ed. The Erotic Muse: American Bawdy Songs 2nd ed., p. 173 ff. UIP (Champaign), 1999. Accessed 13 Jan 2014. \\"Miss Lucy\\" probably developed from verses of much older (and cruder) songs, although the opposite may also be true,The Erotic Muse, p. 174\\\\. Cray explicitly postulates his hypothesis of the sources for this theme, and states that in the case of many other crude songs, they were a parody on even earlier 'clean' songs. most commonly known as \\"Bang Bang Rosie\\" in Britain, \\"Bang Away Lulu\\" in Appalachia, and \\"My Lula Gal\\" in the West.Logsdon, Guy. The Whorehouse Bells Are Ringing and Other Songs Cowboys Sing, pp. 154 ff. 1995 reprint of UIP (Champaign), 1989. Accessed 13 Jan 2014\\\\. (NB: Logsdon's versions are set to the separate tune of the bluegrass traditional \\"Roll in My Sweet Baby's Arms\\".) These songs were sometimes political, usually openly crude, and occasionally infanticidal. In those songs, the baby, that was dropped in the chamber pot bathtub, was referencing an enormously popular mascot of Force cereal named Sunny Jim, introduced in the United States in 1902 and in Britain a few years later. Following his declining popularity, the baby is now usually encountered as Tiny Tim, once famous as a Depression-era comic strip and still well known as a character in Charles Dickens's A Christmas Carol. The verse was first recorded as a joke in the 1920s and as the modern children's song in New York in 1938. Although the song derives from lyrics about an unwed whore, few children consider that Miss Lucy might be unmarried; instead, the concern of the song has shifted to the appearance of new siblings.

He represented Senate District 21 from 1976 to 1988, which included the parishes of St. Mary, Assumption, Terrebonne, and St. Martin, two precincts only. Background Guarisco is an American/Italian dual citizen as well as a citizen of the European Union, whose father was Anthony J. Guarisco, Sr. (1910‚Äì2002); his mother, the former Nathalie Verret (1913-1991).\\"Miss Sherry Perdue and Anthony Joseph Guarisco Recently Married\\", Haskell Free Press, Haskell, Texas, March 21, 1968, accessdate=June 24, 2013 The Guariscos are a large extended Sicilian American family in Morgan City. One of their progenitors, Victor Guarisco (1879-1972) established a large shrimp company in Morgan City and later the Gulf Marine Drilling Company to build offshore oil supply boats. In 1960, Guarisco received his Bachelor of Science in business administration from Nicholls State University in Thibodaux, Louisiana. In 1966, after three years of study he received his law degree from Loyola University in New Orleans, where he was a member of Delta Theta Phi. While in law school, he was President of the Student Bar Association, Chief Justice of the Judicial Court of Honor and received Honorable Mention on the Moot Court team. He was admitted to the bar in 1966. He also studied political science in 1977 and 1978 at the University of New Orleans. Years later from 2008 to 2012, he studied at Louisiana State University and obtained a Master of Arts in liberal arts, while still practicing law and engaged in real estate. Well into his seventies, he served for five months as a student body senator in 2012 at LSU. On February 24, 1968, in the Sacred Heart Catholic Church in Morgan City, Guarisco married the former Sherry Perdue, the daughter of Theodore Paul Perdue, Jr., and the former Peggy Palmer, both of Morgan City. She too graduated from Nicholls State University and became a classroom teacher. At the time of his marriage, Guarisco was affiliated with the Morgan City law firm Levy, Burleigh, Russo and Bourg. In a 1974 murder case, Guarisco successfully obtained the first verdict of \\"Not guilty by reason of insanity\\" in Louisiana criminal law history.State of Louisiana v. Peter Paul Bousquet, Franklin Banner-Tribune, undated article, 1974 Political races In 1972, Guarisco was elected on a non-partisan ballot as a delegate to the 1973 Louisiana Constitutional Convention held in Baton Rouge. He first won his seat in the 1975 election, the first in Louisiana under the nonpartisan blanket primary format, and served three four-year terms. To win the seat, he defeated State Representative Elward Thomas Brady Jr., of Houma in Terrebonne Parish, who had worked to control the damage from the 1973 Mississippi River floods. In 1978, Guarisco successfully sponsored a bill to permit physicians in Louisiana to prescribe marijuana for those with glaucoma or in treatment by chemotherapy. Cases involving paralysis were later added. Governor Edwards signed Guarisco's bill into law. The Marijuana Control Board was created to monitor the law, but that panel never functioned and was abolished, along with many other inactive boards and commissions, in a 1989 law signed by Governor Buddy Roemer. In 1980, Guarisco ran in a special election for Louisiana's 3rd congressional district, a position vacated by incoming Republican Governor David C. Treen. The two major candidates were State Representative Billy Tauzin, then a Democrat but later a Republican from Thibodaux and newly turned Republican Jim Donelon of Jefferson Parish, the current state insurance commissioner who had run unsuccessfully for lieutenant governor in the 1979 general election, when he was defeated by fellow Democrat Robert \\"Bobby\\" Freeman of Plaquemine in Iberville Parish. Guarisco, considered a social liberal because of his earlier support of the failed Equal Rights Amendment to the United States Constitution, and Bob Namer, then a conservative Democrat, rounded out the four-candidate field.Alexandria Daily Town Talk, April 17, 1980, p. 10D Treen endorsed Donelon, who switched parties on February 20.Shreveport Journal, February 21, 1980, p. 13C; March 12, 1980, p. 3A. Treen's predecessor (and successor) as governor, Democrat Edwin Edwards, supported Tauzin, a former floor leader in the House. Edwards had first told Donelon, his former aide, that he would not become involved in the race, but Edwards changed his mind when Treen took an active stance for Donelon. Tauzin also had the support of Lieutenant Governor Freeman, U.S. Senator Russell B. Long, and Representative John Breaux from then Louisiana's 7th congressional district, who had succeeded Edwards in the U.S. House in 1972 and would follow Long in the Senate in 1987.Congressional Quarterly Weekly Report, April 12, 1980, p. 981 In the special congressional race, Guarisco carried the support of the New Orleans Times-PicayuneNew Orleans Times-Picayune, April 19, 1980, p. 1 and said that he did not want the support of either Treen or Edwards, adding that he was \\"independent of all that.\\" In the first round of balloting on April 19, Guarisco was eliminated; he polled 8,927 votes (10.7 percent). Donelon led Tauzin 2.2 percentage points; both ran up large margins in their home parishes, but Tauzin fared much better in Lafourche than had Donelon in Jefferson Parish.Louisiana Secretary of State, Special congressional election returns, April 19, 1980. In the runoff election on May 17, Tauzin prevailed, 53.1 to 46.9 percent.Louisiana Secretary of State, Special congressional runoff election, May 17, 1980. Guarisco served as the Senate parliamentarian, designed a process for confirming gubernatorial appointees and founded the Endowed Chairs for Eminent Scholars program in higher education. He authored the LSU Endowment for Excellence legislation, admission standards for LSU, and laws regarding open meetings and public records. He was the lead author on legislation to prevent punitive damages on the press. In 1981, he was the floor manager for the impeachment and removal of state Senator Gaston Gerald of Greenwell Springs, convicted of extortion. In 1983, Guarisco won his third term in the Senate, 59-41 percent over fellow Democrat John L. Hadel. Guarisco was unseated in 1987 by the businessman and future Governor Murphy J. \\"Mike\\" Foster Jr., then a Democrat but after 1995 a Republican. In that same election, Buddy Roemer was elected governor, and Foster won all four parishes in the district to unseat Guarisco, 24,183 (64 percent) to 13,599 (36 percent). Guarisco today Guarisco maintained a law practice at 266 Seyburn Drive in Baton Rouge, but it is unclear if he still has a law office at this address. He works primarily in personal injury, criminal defense, and mediation. Previously Guarisco served briefly on the boards of both the former Guaranty Bank and Trust Company and Citizen's Bank in Morgan City. Prior to 2011, Guarisco was the manager and minority owner of the former Guarisco-Evans Shopping Center located next to the Medicine Shoppe in Morgan City. Faced with condemnation and the expense of renovation, Guarisco sold the dilapidated structure to businessman Sidney Moffett, who declared the property structurally sound and pledged to restore it to use. Guarisco, the owner since 1996 of Guarisco Enterprises LLC, and his second wife, the former Sherry Lynelle Spivey (born c. 1951), the owner of SSG Consulting Services, live in Baton Rouge.

Hungarian historians believe that the original inhabitants were Hungarians and Slovaks, but by the modern period the population was largely Romanian in terms of ethnicity.Cre»õan, p.148 By the time of the 1717 census the place is recorded as Schipeth. Early in the nineteenth century »òipet came into the hands of the Duca family when it was awarded to Field Marshal Petre Duca (1755‚Äì1822) because of his success in the wars against Napoleon.

Born in Cameron Bridge in Fife he moved to nearby St Andrews to establish a carpentry, joinery and housepainting business. In 1812 he started to repair and then make golf clubs as a sideline. This sideline became a great success and he subsequently opened a shop and workshop adjacent to the St Andrews Links. In the 1860s, he was hired by Forgan of St. Andrews to make clubs for the company. Philp used thorn, apple and pear woods as materials for its clubs, which were highly appreciated as craft items and gained him widespread recognition.Hugh Philp biography on Club Makers Art (archived, 4 Mar 2016) His clubs were in great demand by the leading players of the day and in 1819 Philp was appointed as club-maker to the Society of Golfers at St. Andrews (later to become the Royal and Ancient Golf Club).

It is of Late Victorian architecture, designed by Charles Burggraf and built by Spokane contractor August Isle. It was identified as \\"one of several elaborate county courthouses constructed in Washington around the turn of the century\\" when it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. History The courthouse was built in 1901 after the citizens of Garfield County authorized a $20,000 bond for the construction of a new courthouse to replace the 1887 wood-frame courthouse lost in the 1900 fire that destroyed much of the Pomeroy's commercial center. Albany, Oregon, architect Charles H. Burggraf was hired to design the new courthouse. After bids for the project were taken in March 1901, August Ilse of Spokane won the contract with a bid of $18,783. The specification called for brick and stone construction; the stone was quarried locally from the Valentine Ridge area near the Snake River. The brick was from a local kiln; the shakes were from the Blue Mountains. The statue of Justice that caps the clock tower is only one of twenty statues nationwide where the justice figure is not blindfolded. According to the City Council minutes of August 2, 1904, authorization was given to install a clock in the clock tower. A Civil War statue, erected by the G.A.R., was placed in front of the courthouse in 1904 at the Fourth of July celebration. Due to deterioration, the statue was removed in the 1950s. In 2000, the VFW Post #2351 and the Garfield County Pioneer Society funded and dedicated the new bronze Civil War statue that rests on top of the original marble base that is engraved with the names of the county's veterans. After the statue of Justice lost its left arm to a windstorm in 2006, an emergency grant from the Valerie Sivinski Washington Preserves Fund helped defray the cost of repairs. ;Restoration A two-year, two-million dollar restoration project was completed in 2011. The work was supported through a one-million dollar matching grant from the Department of Archaeology & Historic Preservation's Historic County Courthouse Rehabilitation Grant Program. The project, which was designed to structurally stabilize the building while preserving key architectural elements, saw the restoration of existing windows and the addition of ADA-compliant features. The work also included the removal of earlier renovations deemed to be not in keeping with the building's historic character including the removal of drop ceilings in the courtroom and the re-opening of the courtroom gallery that had been closed off for use as a storage space. The facelift was one of two winners of the Valerie Sivinski Award for Outstanding Achievement in Historic Preservation Rehabilitation Projects in 2012.

Crescent City Schools is part of a movement in New Orleans to transform one of the worst school systems in the country. In the fall of 2010, Crescent City Schools received a Type 5 charter from the state of Louisiana to transform a failing school in New Orleans. In February 2011, Crescent City Schools was assigned to Harriet Tubman, a K-8 school in Orleans Parish, and assumed operations there on July 1, 2011. In 2012, the organization was awarded the expanded charter for Akili Academy of New Orleans and the charter for Paul B. Habans Elementary. Habans opened as Paul Habans Charter School in July 2013.  New Orleans  The Recovery School District (RSD) was established in 2003 by the Louisiana Legislature as a means for the state to take over low-performing public schools. Since the devastation of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the RSD has chartered out all of its schools, and approximately 92% of students in New Orleans attend charter schools. The schools that were not failing stayed under the control of the Orleans Parish School Board, which currently operates 18 schools, most of which are also charters. Once schools are turned around and deemed ‚Äúnot failing,‚Äù they have the option to return to the Orleans Parish School Board or stay in the RSD. Crescent City Schools operates under the Recovery School District.  Turnaround  Turnaround in public schools is defined as the comprehensive reorganization of low-performing schools. This can involve changes in leadership, curriculum, faculty and staff, and the overall identity and mission of the school. The initial goal of turnaround is to make significant achievement gains within two years. These gains are reflected in test score performances and recognized by rankings such as the School Performance Score (SPS) issued by the Louisiana Department of Education. The long-term goal for turnaround is to transform the schools into high-performance organizations.  Schools  Crescent City Schools currently serves more than 1,800 students in three schools across New Orleans: Harriet Tubman Charter School (PreK-8) in Algiers, Akili Academy (K-8) in the Upper Ninth Ward, and Paul Habans Charter School (PreK-8) in Algiers. Harriet Tubman Charter School was the first school to be managed by Crescent City Schools in 2011. Temporarily located at 2832 General Meyer Avenue in the Algiers neighborhood on the West Bank of New Orleans, Tubman's permanent home is a historical building that is undergoing renovations as of 2014. The school serves 1100 students in grades PreK-8. It is open enrollment and non-selective; students are accepted at any time as long as there is adequate physical space. Special education professionals and interventionists are provided for high need students. In its first year of operations, Tubman‚Äôs School Performance Score (SPS) increased by 11.1 points from its last reported score, moving from a 55.5 in 2010 to a 66.6 in 2012. In 2014, Harriet Tubman Charter School 8th graders outperformed the state average in all subject areas: English Language Arts, Math, Science, and Social Studies. In 2015, Tubman became the highest-ranking RSD school on the West Bank, and its SPS improved by more than 18 points, demonstrating the second strongest growth for any K-8 school in the RSD. Tubman also increased the number of students achieving mastery and proficiency on state testing across all testing grades. In addition, 85% of special needs students who qualified for the State's alternate assessment met or exceeded expectations in ELA and math. In 2016, the percentage of Tubman scholars performing at Basic or above in ELA increased to 63%, while the percentage of students performing Mastery or above in Math increased to 33%. Akili Academy of New Orleans came under Crescent City Schools management in 2012. Akili Academy relocated in July 2013 to the newly restored historic William Frantz school building at 3811 North Galvez Street in the Upper Ninth Ward. The William Frantz site is significant as it was the first site of desegregation in New Orleans where six-year-old Ruby Bridges attended the all-white school on November 14, 1960. Akili Academy is a Type 5 charter school that began operations in August 2008 with kindergarten and first grade. The school has grown by one grade each year and is now a K-8 school serving 550 students. In the school‚Äôs first year of operations, only 6% of students were at grade level at the start of the school year. At the end of the first year of instruction, 85% of kindergarteners were at or above grade level and 77% of first grade students were at or above grade level. This type of student achievement and academic growth is almost unprecedented for a school in its first year of operations. By the 2010-2011 school year Akili Academy had grown to a K-3 school and its first class of third graders took the State of Louisiana iLEAP exam, given annually to third and fifth-eighth graders. Over 88% of Akili students performed at or above grade level on the iLEAP, the highest percentage in the entire Recovery School District. Additionally, 45% of students achieved a level of Advanced or Mastery in ELA and Math. For two years in a row (2011 and 2012), Akili Academy had the highest-performing third graders in the Recovery School District on the iLEAP. In 2014, Akili Academy sixth graders were in the Top 10 in the city for scoring Mastery and Advanced in English Language Arts. Akili was the only school in the Recovery School District represented on this list. Between 2014 and 2016, Akili increased the percentage of students reading on or above grade level by 15 percentage points, from 44% of students reading on or above grade level to 59%. Akili Academy is well-known throughout the City of New Orleans for it's championship winning athletic programs. Akili offers competition sports such as baseball, basketball, cheerleading, football, soccer, softball, track and volleyball to 5-8 grade students. During the 2017-2018 athletic year, the Gators won 11 of 13 New Orleans Charter School Athletic Association City Championships. Scholar athletes, are heavily recruited by local public and private high school athletic programs. Paul Habans Charter School opened in July 2013 under Crescent City Schools. Formerly Paul B. Habans Elementary School, it is located at 3501 Seine Street in the Algiers neighborhood on the West Bank of New Orleans. Habans serves 630 scholars in grades Pre-K - 8. In 2014, Paul Habans Charter School 6th grade scholars grew 1.37 years in their reading level by the end of the year. In 2016, LEAP scores revealed that Habans improved more than the state average, both in the percent of students scoring Mastery or above, as well as the percent of students scoring Basic or above. Overall, the percentage of students scoring Mastery or above increased from 9.87% in 2015 to 14.67% in 2016. Management Crescent City Schools was founded by educators Kate Mehok and Julie Lause. Both were honored by the New Schools Venture Fund in 2013 as Entrepreneurs to Watch for their contributions to public education.

Meeting space is available free of charge to local nonprofit agencies. The Community Foundation of Northern Colorado is an independent philanthropic organization that serves the Northern Colorado community including Berthoud, Estes Park, Fort Collins, and Loveland. What is a Community Foundation? A community foundation is a reliable, permanent nonprofit organization working in a specific geographic area to manage a collection of charitable funds. Donations to the funds are tax-deductible and grants from the funds are distributed to nonprofits, schools, and churches. Community foundations offer a service that facilitates and encourages charitable giving. Donors can quickly and easily establish their own fund to support causes and organizations they care about‚Äîboth now and far into the future. Community foundations also serve a unique leadership role by bringing people and resources together around important local issues. About The Community Foundation operates by charging a modest annual fee on the funds it manages‚Äîtypically around one percent. By pooling funds, the Foundation creates efficiencies and keep overhead expenses low. This allows the staff to focus on helping donors do more with what they have to give. The Community Foundation is a convener of people and ideas, a clearinghouse for information, and a respected caretaker of community resources. No other organization in Northern Colorado has such a dynamic network of relationships with donors, nonprofits, and community leaders. The Community Foundation‚Äôs work to strengthen and sustain Northern Colorado keeps them connected with and accountable to Northern Colorado residents‚Äîpast, present, and future. Every resident of Northern Colorado benefits from the legacy and strategic planning of previous generations. Hundreds of individuals, families, businesses, and nonprofit organizations have established funds at the Community Foundation of Northern Colorado. They entrust their resources‚Äîin the form of cash, real estate, stock, estate gifts, and more‚Äîto the Community Foundation and depend on it to be the long-term steward of these assets. The Community Foundation's board of trustees and professional staff operate in compliance with National Standards for Community Foundations, the nation‚Äôs highest philanthropic standards for quality, integrity, and accountability. These standards serve as both a blueprint for internal organizational development and a tangible set of benchmarks for external demonstration of operational excellence in six key areas: mission, structure, and governance; resource development; stewardship and accountability; grantmaking and community leadership; donor relations; and communications. History In the fall of 1975, the City of Fort Collins, Colorado was a small college town of approximately 60,000 people on the verge of major growth. The mayor and other city leaders were making plans to turn the Lincoln Junior High School building into what is known today as the Lincoln Center. There was a need for a nonprofit organization to collect charitable contributions for the creation of the new Lincoln Center. During the same time, a local Fort Collins resident, Mrs. Olive Ludlow, left a $25,000 bequest for a purpose that was unclear ‚Äì a community foundation would be an appropriate vehicle to receive the gift as well. With a few phone calls from the mayor, the Community Foundation of Northern Colorado was born. Initially, the foundation was called the Fort Collins Community Foundation before expanding to serve a greater Northern Colorado region. The Community Foundation of Northern Colorado grants out millions of dollars each year and has grown to more than $70 million in assets. Community Foundation of Northern Colorado initiatives, funds, and projects Community leaders and donors have used the Community Foundation as a platform to launch and fund new initiatives such as UniverCity Connections, Homeward 2020, FortZED, the Veterans Plaza of Northern Colorado, and the Rialto Bridge Project. Memorial funds, large and small, have been established to carry on the memory of loved ones. The Community Foundation serves as the infrastructure for community projects like Inspiration Playground and as the platform for launching new nonprofits like Project Smile and CHAMP.

It was discovered 19 February 2009, by German amateur astronomer Erwin Schwab using a remote-controlled telescope at Tzec Maun Observatory in Mayhill, New Mexico, United States. The asteroid was named after the discoverer's son, Milian Leo Schwab.  Orbit and classification  Milianleo is an attributed member of the small Aeolia family (), a small asteroid family of less than 300 known members, named after its parent body and largest member, 396 Aeolia. It orbits the Sun in the central main-belt at a distance of 2.4‚Äì3.1 AU once every 4 years and 6 months (1,658 days; semi-major axis of 2.74 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.13 and an inclination of 3¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. It was first observed as at Lincoln Laboratory ETS in 2000, extending the body's observation arc by 9 years prior to its official discovery at Tzec Maun. On 25 December 2098, Milianleo is expected to pass 4,449,642 kilometers from the asteroid 704 Interamnia. It will pass it at a relative velocity of 7.12 kilometers per second.  Physical characteristics  Milianleo is likely an X-type asteroid, based on its membership to the Aeolia family. When using a generic magnitude-to-diameter conversion, this asteroid measures approximately 1.6 kilometers in diameter, for an absolute magnitude of 16.5, and an assumed visual geometric albedo of 0.17, taken from the Aeolia family's parent body. As of 2018, no rotational lightcurve of Milianleo has been obtained from photometric observations. The body's rotation period, pole and shape remain unknown.  Naming  This minor planet was named after Milian Leo Schwab, the first-born son of German amateur astronomer and discoverer Erwin Schwab.

The defining factor in the geography of Scotland is the distinction between the Highlands and Islands in the north and west and the Lowlands in the south and east. The Highlands were subdivided by the Great Glen and the Lowlands into the fertile Central Lowlands and the Southern Uplands. The Uplands and Highlands had a relatively short growing season, exacerbated by the Little Ice Age, which peaked towards the end of the seventeenth century. A network of roads developed in the Lowlands in this period. Drover's roads, between the Highlands and north-east England, had become established by the end of the seventeenth century and a series of military roads were built and maintained as a response to the Jacobite risings in the eighteenth century. At the beginning of the period, most farming was based on the Lowland fermtoun or Highland baile, but a system of land ownership based on large estates emerged. This was the beginning of a process that would create a landscape of rectangular fields and carefully located farm complexes with interconnecting roads. There was an attempt improve agriculture, resulting in new crops, techniques and enclosures began to displace the run rig system and free pasture. There are almost no reliable sources with which to track the population of Scotland before the late seventeenth century. It probably grew for most of the period, reaching 1,234,575 by 1691 and 1,265,380 by the first census in 1751. Compared with the situation after the redistribution of population as a result of the clearances and the industrial revolution that began in the eighteenth century, these numbers were more evenly spread over the kingdom, with roughly half north of the River Tay. Most were housed in small hamlets and isolated dwellings. The Little Ice Age saw the abandonment of marginal land, but new settlements were created as a result of the opening up of hunting reserves like Ettrick Forest and less desirable low-lying land was also settled. As the population expanded, some settlements were sub-divided to create new hamlets. Perhaps ten per cent of the population lived in one of the many burghs that had grown up in the later Medieval period, mainly in the east and south of the country. By 1750, with its suburbs, Edinburgh had reached a population of 57,000. By the early modern era Gaelic had been in geographical decline for three centuries and had begun to be a second class language, confined to the Highlands and Islands. It was gradually being replaced by Middle Scots. From the mid sixteenth century, written Scots was increasingly influenced by the developing Standard English of Southern England, which came to dominate elite discourse. After the Union in 1707 the use of Gaelic and Scots were discouraged by many in authority and education, as was the notion of Scottishness itself. The extent and borders of the kingdom had been fixed in their modern form by the beginning of the sixteenth century, with the exception of the debatable lands, settled by a French led commission in 1552. The accession of James VI to the English throne made the borders less significant in military terms, becoming, in his phrase the \\"middle shires\\" of Great Britain, but it remained a jurisdictional and tariff boundary until the Act of Union in 1707. Edinburgh had emerged as the capital in the fifteenth century and continued to be a major administrative centre. From the seventeenth century the responsibilities of shires expanded from judicial functions into wider local administration. The parish also became an important unit of local government. By the mid- seventeenth century this system had largely been rolled out across the Lowlands, but was limited in the Highlands. There was much greater awareness of geography and political boundaries in this period and Scotland was extensively mapped for the first time. Physical The topography of Scotland The defining factor in the geography of Scotland is the distinction between the Highlands and Islands in the north and west and the Lowlands in the south and east. The Highlands are further divided into the Northwest Highlands and the Grampian Mountains by the fault line of the Great Glen. The Lowlands are divided into the fertile belt of the Central Lowlands and the higher terrain of the Southern Uplands, which included the Cheviot hills, over which, as now, the border with England runs.R. Mitchison, A History of Scotland (London: Routledge, 3rd edn., 2002), , p. 2. The Central Lowland belt averages about 50 miles in widthWorld and Its Peoples (London: Marshall Cavendish), , p. 13. and, because it contains most of the good quality agricultural land and has easier communications, could support most of the urbanisation and elements of conventional government.Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community, pp. 39‚Äì40. However, the Southern Uplands, and particularly the Highlands, were economically less productive and much more difficult to govern.A. G. Ogilvie, Great Britain: Essays in Regional Geography (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1952), p. 421. The Uplands and Highlands had a relatively short growing season and, in the extreme case of the upper Grampians, this was an ice free season of four months or less and for much of the Highlands and Uplands of seven months or less. The early modern era also saw the impact of the Little Ice Age, of worldwide colder and wetter weather, which peaked towards the end of the seventeenth century.I. D. White, \\"Rural Settlement 1500‚Äì1770\\", in M. Lynch, ed., Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), , pp. 542‚Äì3. In 1564 there were thirty-three days of continual frost, and rivers and lochs froze.J. E. A. Dawson, Scotland Re-Formed, 1488‚Äì1587 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2007), , pp. 8‚Äì11. The 1690s marked its lowest point, leading to the Seven ill years of famine. Most roads in the Lowlands were maintained by justices from a monetary levy on landholders and work levy on tenants. The development of national grain prices indicates the network had improved considerably by the early eighteenth century. By the end of the seventeenth century, the drover's roads, stretching down from the Highlands through south-west Scotland to north-east England and used for the transport of Highland Cattle for the English meat market, had become firmly established.R. A. Houston, Scottish Literacy and the Scottish Identity: Illiteracy and Society in Scotland and Northern England, 1600‚Äì1800 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002), , p. 16. In the Highlands and Galloway in the early eighteenth century, a series of military roads were built and maintained by the central government, with the aim of facilitating the movement of troops in the event of rebellion.W. Taylor, The Military Roads in Scotland (1976, Dundurn, 1996), , p. 13. At the beginning of the period, most farming was based on the Lowland fermtoun or Highland baile, settlements of a handful of families that jointly farmed an area notionally suitable for two or three plough teams, allocated in run rigs, of \\"runs\\" (furrows) and \\"rigs\\" (ridges), to tenant farmers. They usually ran downhill so that they included both wet and dry land, helping to offset the problems of extreme weather conditions.Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community, pp. 41‚Äì55. In this era, a system of land ownership based on large estates emerged as the dominant form as Scottish society was largely divided between a few large estate holders and a large number of workers. This had a major impact on the landscape as feudal systems of ownership were abandoned and land holdings reorganised. This process also facilitated the Scottish Agricultural Revolution that further changed the Scottish landscape from the first half of the eighteenth century.I. White, \\"The emergence of the new estate structure\\" in M. L. Parry and T. R. Slater, eds, The Making of the Scottish Countryside (London: Taylor & Francis, 1980), , p. 117. This was the beginning of a process that would create a landscape of rectangular fields, carefully located farm complexes with interconnecting roads.J. B. Caird, \\"The reshaped agricultural landscape\\" in M. L. Parry and T. R. Slater, eds, The Making of the Scottish Countryside (London: Taylor & Francis, 1980), , p. 203. Wester Kittochside. Increasing contacts with England after the Union of 1707 led to a conscious attempt to improve agriculture among the gentry and nobility. The Society of Improvers was founded in 1723, including in its 300 members dukes, earls, lairds and landlords.J. D. Mackie, B. Lenman and G. Parker, A History of Scotland (London: Penguin, 1991), , pp. 288‚Äì91. Haymaking was introduced along with the English plough and foreign grasses, the sowing of rye grass and clover. Turnips and cabbages were introduced, lands enclosed and marshes drained, lime was put down, roads built and woods planted. Drilling and sowing and crop rotation were introduced. The introduction of the potato to Scotland in 1739 greatly improved the diet of the peasantry. Enclosures began to displace the run rig system and free pasture. New farm buildings, often based on designs in patterns books, replaced the fermtoun and regional diversity was replaced with a standardisation of building forms. Smaller farms retained the linear outline of the longhouse, with dwelling house, barn and byre in a row, but in larger farms a three- or four-sided layout became common, separating the dwelling house from barns and servants quarters.A. Fenton, \\"Housing: rural lowlands, before and after 1770s\\", in M. Lynch, ed., Oxford Companion to Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), , pp. 321‚Äì3. There was increasing regional specialisation. The Lothians became a major centre of grain, Ayrshire of cattle breading and the Borders of sheep. However, although some estate holders improved the quality of life of their displaced workers, enclosures led to unemployment and forced migrations to the burghs or abroad. Settlement and demography Highland sheiling on marginal land, south of Oban There are almost no reliable sources with which to track the population of Scotland before the late seventeenth century. Estimates based on English records suggest that by the end of the Middle Ages the Black Death and subsequent recurring outbreaks of the plague may have caused the population of Scotland to fall as low as half a million people.S. H. Rigby, ed., A Companion to Britain in the Later Middle Ages (Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell, 2003), , pp. 109‚Äì11. Price inflation, which generally reflects growing demand for food, suggests that this probably expanded in the first half of the sixteenth century, levelling off after the famine of 1595, as prices were relatively stable in the early seventeenth century.R. Mitchison, A History of Scotland (London: Routledge, 3rd edn., 2002), , p. 145. Calculations based on Hearth Tax returns for 1691 indicate a population of 1,234,575. This level may have been seriously effected by the famines of the 1690s. The first reliable information available on national population is from the census conducted by the Reverend Alexander Webster in 1755, which showed the inhabitants of Scotland as 1,265,380 persons.K. J. Cullen, Famine in Scotland: The 'Ill Years' of The 1690s (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2010), , pp. 123‚Äì4. Compared with the situation after the redistribution of population as a result of the clearances and the industrial revolution that began in the eighteenth century, the population was evenly spread over the kingdom, with roughly half living north of the Tay.Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community, p. 61. Most of the early modern population, in both the Lowlands and Highlands, was housed in small hamlets and isolated dwellings.I. D. Whyte and K. A. Whyte, The Changing Scottish Landscape: 1500‚Äì1800 (London: Taylor & Francis, 1991), , p. 5. One result of the Little Ice Age was the abandonment of marginal land in the early part of the period, as it became impossible to sustain agriculture in some regions, particularly in the uplands, but new settlements were created as a result of the opening up of hunting reserves like Ettrick Forest and less desirable low-lying land was also settled, often incorporating features into their names such as bog, marsh and muir. As the population expanded, some of these settlements were sub-divided to create new hamlets and more marginal land was again settled, with sheilings (clusters of huts occupied while summer pasture was being used for grazing) becoming permanent settlements.Whyte and Whyte, The Changing Scottish Landscape: 1500‚Äì1800, pp. 18‚Äì19. Perhaps ten per cent of the population lived in one of the burghs that had grown up in the later Medieval period, mainly in the east and south of the country. They may have had a mean population of about 2,000, and the largest, Edinburgh, probably had a population of over 10,000 at the beginning of the era, but many were much smaller than 1,000.E. Gemmill and N. J. Mayhew, Changing Values in Medieval Scotland: a Study of Prices, Money, and Weights and Measures (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1995), , pp. 8‚Äì10. During the seventeenth century, the number of people living in the capital grew rapidly. It also expanded beyond the city walls in suburbs at Cowgate, Bristo and WestportW. Makey, \\"Edinburgh in mid-seventeenth century\\", in M. Lynch, ed., The Early Modern Town in Scotland (London: Taylor & Francis, 1987), , pp. 195‚Äì6. and by 1750, with its suburbs, it had reached a population of 57,000. The only other towns above 10,000 by the end of the period were Glasgow with 32,000, Aberdeen with around 16,000 and Dundee with 12,000.F. M. L. Thompson, The Cambridge Social History of Britain 1750‚Äì1950: People and Their Environment (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1992), , p. 5. Language James VI's Basilikon Doron, translated into English from Scots in 1603, beginning an emphasis on Southern English.J. Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470‚Äì1625 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), , pp. 192‚Äì3. By the early modern era Gaelic had been in geographical decline for three centuries and had begun to be a second class language, confined to the Highlands and Islands. It was gradually being replaced by Middle Scots, which became the language of both the nobility and the majority population. Scots was derived substantially from Old English, with Gaelic and French influences. It was called Inglyshe in the fifteenth century and was very close to the language spoken in northern England,Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community, pp. 60‚Äì1. but by the sixteenth century, it had established orthographic and literary norms largely independent of those developing in England.J. Corbett, D. McClure and J. Stuart-Smith, \\"A Brief History of Scots\\" in J. Corbett, D. McClure and J. Stuart-Smith, eds, The Edinburgh Companion to Scots (Edinburgh, Edinburgh University Press, 2003), , p. 9ff. From the mid sixteenth century, written Scots was increasingly influenced by the developing Standard English of Southern England due to developments in royal and political interactions with England.Corbett, McClure and Stuart-Smith, \\"A Brief History of Scots\\", p. 10ff. With the increasing influence and availability of books printed in England, most writing in Scotland came to be done in the English fashion.Corbett, McClure and Stuart-Smith, \\"A Brief History of Scots\\", p. 11. Unlike many of his predecessors, James VI generally despised Gaelic culture.Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community, p. 40. Having extolled the virtues of Scots \\"poesie\\", after his accession to the English throne, he increasingly favoured the language of southern England. In 1611 the Kirk adopted the Authorized King James Version of the Bible. In 1617 interpreters were declared no longer necessary in the port of London because Scots and Englishmen were now \\"not so far different bot ane understandeth ane uther\\". Jenny Wormald, describes James as creating a \\"three-tier system, with Gaelic at the bottom and English at the top\\". After the Union in 1707 and the shift of political power to England, the use of Gaelic and Scots were discouraged by many in authority and education.C. Jones, A Language Suppressed: The Pronunciation of the Scots Language in the 18th Century (Edinburgh: John Donald, 1993), , p. vii. The Scottish Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge (SSPCK), established in 1709, aimed to teach English language and end the attachment to Roman Catholicism associated with rebellious Jacobitism. It was partly cultural, intending to \\"wear out\\" Gaelic and \\"learn the people the English tongue\\".M. Lynch, Scotland: A New History (London: Pimlico, 1992), , p. 364. Although SSPCK schools eventually taught in Gaelic, the overall effect contributed to the erosion of Highland culture.C. Kidd, British Identities Before Nationalism: Ethnicity and Nationhood in the Atlantic World, 1600‚Äì1800 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999), , p. 138. Many leading Scots of the period, such as David Hume, considered themselves Northern British rather than Scottish.C. Jones, A Language Suppressed: The Pronunciation of the Scots Language in the 18th Century (Edinburgh: John Donald, 1993), , p. 2. They attempted to rid themselves of their Scots in a bid to establish Standard English as the official language of the newly formed Union. Many well-off Scots took to learning English through the activities of those such as Thomas Sheridan, who in 1761 gave a series of lectures on English elocution. Charging a guinea at a time (about ¬£ in today's money) they were attended by over 300 men, and he was made a freeman of the City of Edinburgh. Following this, some of the city's intellectuals formed the Select Society for Promoting the Reading and Speaking of the English Language in Scotland.Corbett, McClure and Stuart-Smith, \\"A Brief History of Scots\\", p. 13. Nevertheless, Scots remained the vernacular of many rural communities and the growing number of urban working-class Scots.Corbett, McClure and Stuart- Smith, \\"A Brief History of Scots\\", p. 14. Political Lower Clydesdale from Blaeu's Atlas novus, 1654 The extent and borders of the kingdom had been fixed in their modern form by the beginning of the sixteenth century.Dawson, Scotland Re-Formed, 1488‚Äì1587, p. 172. The exception, the debatable lands at the western end of the border with England, were settled by a French led commission in 1552 and the Scots' Dike built to mark the boundary. The Scottish administration of the Borders was divided into three marches: East, West and Middle.A. Groundwater, The Scottish Middle March 1573‚Äì1625: Power, Kinship, Allegiance (Boydell & Brewer, 2010), , p. 5. The accession of James VI to the English throne made the border less significant in military terms, becoming, in his phrase, the \\"middle shires\\" of Great Britain. In 1605, he established a single commission of ten men drawn from equally Scotland and England to bring law and order to the region, but lawlessness continued and it remained a jurisdictional and tariff boundary until the Act of Union in 1707.R. Mitchison, A History of Scotland (London: Routledge, 3rd edn., 2002), , p. 130. Edinburgh had emerged as the capital in the fifteenth century.Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community, pp. 14‚Äì15. It was the wealthiest and largest city in the kingdom and held the central law courts, parliament and royal residence at Holyrood Palace. After James VI left for London at the Union of Crowns in 1603, it continued to be the centre of government. Even after the Acts of Union in 1707 removed the parliament, it retained the exchequer and law courts.A. R. MacDonald, The Burghs and Parliament in Scotland: c. 1550‚Äì1651 (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2007), , p. 110. From the seventeenth century the responsibilities of shires expanded from judicial functions into wider local administration. In 1667, Commissioners of Supply were appointed in each sheriffdom or shire to collect the cess land tax.R. A. Houston and I. D. Whyte, Scottish Society, 1500‚Äì1800 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005), , p. 202. The parish also became an important unit of local government after three major pieces of legislation, in 1574, 1579 and 1592, established what would become known as \\"the Old Poor Law\\".Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community, pp. 166‚Äì8. Pressured by Justices, the parish became responsible for taking care of the destitute in periods of famine, to prevent the impoverished from taking to the roads and causing general disorder.R. Mitchison, Lordship to Patronage, Scotland 1603‚Äì1745 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1983), , p. 144. By the mid-seventeenth century the system had largely been rolled out across the Lowlands, but was limited in the Highlands.O. P. Grell and A. Cunningham, Health Care and Poor Relief in Protestant Europe, 1500‚Äì1700 (London: Routledge, 1997), , p. 37. There was a growing awareness of geography and political boundaries in this period. Scotland was extensively mapped for the first time. In the last quarter of the sixteenth century, Timothy Pont created a series of sketch maps of Scotland and recorded the names and details of 20,000 places he visited or noted. His work became the basis for the set of maps of Scotland published the following century by Willem and Johannes Blaeu.Dawson, Scotland Re-Formed, 1488‚Äì1587, p. 236. In the eighteenth century, there was a \\"militarisation of cartography\\", by which the armed forces took over the business of mapping. One response to the Jacobite risings in 1715 and 1745 was the Ordnance Survey, from which over 800 military plans survive for Scotland. The new generation of cartographers were engineers and military surveyors.W. Bell, S. W. Brown, D. Finkelstein, W. McDougall and A.

When he was not a bishop yet, Anspert received by emperor Louis II the asset of Ansprand, who had killed the monarch's brother. He was appointed archbishop of Milan on 26 June 868 and under Louis II he was missus dominicus. An educated man, he asked Irish monks to found the archbishop's scriptorium in Milan, a center for production of illuminated manuscripts. On 12 August 875, he moved to Brescia, where the emperor had just died, and organized his sepulture in the basilica of Sant'Ambrogio in Milan. In the January of the following year he participated to the coronation of Charles the Bald in Pavia, and received by the new king further territories at Cavenago, Vimercate and Ornago. In July 877 he took part in a council at Ravenna in which he obtained several privileges for the Milanese archbishopric. After the Charles the Bald's death (877), Anspert entered in conflict with Pope John VIII, who favored Boso of Vienne as King of Italy, while the Milanese proposed Carloman of Bavaria. On 1 June 879 he was excommunicated and, in the following October, deposed; however, Anspert remained in charge as the Milanese clergymen supported him. Anspert and John reconciled when they met at the coronation of Charles the Fat as King of Italy (6 January 880) at Ravenna.

The company primarily specializes in interactive advertisements, which emphasize user engagement in exchange for access to premium content, such as video, games, and public internet access. The company claimed that its system was effective, with a 4.84% average click-through rate in 2008 (in comparison to traditional advertisements). The company was the subject of a patent infringement lawsuit against Hulu, YouTube and WildTangent;Ultramercial, Inc. v. Hulu, LLC (Fed. Cir. 2013) in the lawsuit, Ultramercial accused the two companies of infringing its patent (\\"the '545 Patent,\\" filed in 2001), covering the business model surrounding a \\"Method and system for payment of intellectual property royalties by interposed sponsor on behalf of consumer over a telecommunications network\\". In other words, the '545 Patent was directed to modeling the value of certain programming based on the number of advertisements consumers would continue to watch, a more direct valuation of consumers' time that previous models based directly on dollars spent in advertisement campaigns. While WildTangent challenged the validity of the patent in 2011 because they felt it was too abstract, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld Ultramercial's patent, stating that it \\"does not simply claim the age-old idea that advertising can serve as currency. Instead [it] discloses a practical application of this idea.\\" The court also asserted that the technical elements required to implement the system described were intricate enough to not be abstract. In 2012, the Supreme Court ordered the Federal Circuit to re-examine the case in the wake of several recent patent rulings on \\"abstract\\" concepts. This ruling came in the wake of the Supreme Court's ruling on patentable subject matter in Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Inc. This opinion was also issued shortly after the America Invents Act (\\"AIA\\") went into effect, drastically changing the statutory landscape of US Patent Law. On June 21, 2013, the Federal Circuit upheld its decision and ruled that Ultramercial's patents validly claimed methods of using advertising as a medium of exchange. On November 14, 2014, the Federal Circuit reversed its prior rulings and found that the \\"patent does not claim patent eligible subject matter and accordingly affirm the district court‚Äôs grant of WildTangent‚Äôs motion to dismiss.\\" This reversal came in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank International, a benchmark case for doctrine-disruptive precedent defining patent eligible subject matter.

Fay had been without a record label after being dropped by Deram Records following the release of his second album, Time of the Last Persecution in 1971, and could not secure a release for his third album Tomorrow, Tomorrow & Tomorrow. To support himself, Fay took various jobs outside of the music industry, while continuing to record music at home. In 1998, Fay's first two albums were reissued on compact disc by British record label See for Miles Records, prompting a revival of interest in his work, and Tomorrow, Tomorrow & Tomorrow was finally released in 2005. Fay was persuaded to return to the studio to record a new album by American record producer Joshua Henry, who was a fan of Fay's Deram albums after he had heard them played by his father. Fay and Henry assembled a group of musicians that included guitarist Ray Russell and drummer Alan Rushton, who had both played on Time of the Last Persecution. Recording took place across ten days at Snap Studios in North London with engineer Guy Massey. It was released to critical acclaim, featuring on several critic's year-end lists and reaching number 56 on the UK Albums Chart. Fay donated the proceeds from the album to the humanitarian aid organisation M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res. Background and recording Bill Fay released his first two albums, Bill Fay (1970) and Time of the Last Persecution (1971), on the Deram Records label. The recordings did not perform well and Fay was dropped from Deram soon after the release of his second album. After failing to secure another recording contract, Fay took various jobs including fruit picking, working in a factory and in a supermarket. Fay continued to write songs and entered the studio with a group of musicians in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Tapes of the resulting album, Tomorrow, Tomorrow & Tomorrow, were sent to twelve record companies but the album did not receive a release. In 1998, British record label See for Miles Records re-issued Bill Fay and Time of the Last Persecution on compact disc, reviving interest in Fay's work. Wilco singer Jeff Tweedy, who sang Fay's \\"Be Not So Fearful\\" during the 2002 Wilco documentary I Am Trying to Break Your Heart, Current 93s David Tibet, Okkervil Rivers Will Sheff, R.E.M. guitarist Peter Buck, Jim O'Rourke and Nick Cave declared themselves fans of Fay's music. In 2004, Wooden Hill Records released a collection of demos entitled From the Bottom of an Old Grandfather Clock, and Tomorrow, Tomorrow & Tomorrow was eventually released in 2005 on David Tibet's Durtro label. After Wilco began covering \\"Be Not So Fearful\\" during their live sets, Jeff Tweedy persuaded Fay to join the band onstage to sing a duet on the song at a concert at Shepherd's Bush Empire in 2007. Tweedy offered Fay an opportunity to record an album with Wilco in Chicago, but Fay declined. Another collection of demos, Still Some Light, was released in 2010 by Tibet's Coptic Cat label. In 2012, Fay was approached by American record producer Joshua Henry, who convinced Fay to record a new album. Henry, who was familiar with Fay's work through his father's record collection, originally planned to reproduce some of Fay's unused home recordings at London's Abbey Road Studios. Fay compiled a CD of his unreleased music and sent it to Henry, who played it to Dead Oceans founder Chris Swanson. Swanson liked the songs and Fay signed a contract with the label to record and release the album. A band of musicians including guitarist Ray Russell and drummer Alan Rushton, who had both played on Time of the Last Persecution, was assembled and recording eventually took place across ten days at Snap Studios in North London with engineer Guy Massey. The first song recorded for the album was \\"Be at Peace With Yourself\\", which had previously appeared in demo form on Still Some Light. Music and lyrics Life Is People is a singer-songwriter album that contains twelve tracks with a total running time of 58 minutes. Eleven tracks were written by Fay. The piano ballad \\"Jesus, Etc.\\" is a cover version of a Wilco song originally written by Jay Bennett and Jeff Tweedy, which first appeared on their 2002 album Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. \\"This World\\", which was described by Grayson Currin of Pitchfork Media as one of the album's key songs, features additional vocals from Tweedy that were recorded at the Loft studio in Chicago. Life Is Peoples lyrics were described by Thom Jurek as \\"bittersweet reflections on wasted life, loss, death, grief, environmental apocalypse, and human frailty ... balanced by themes that affirm tolerance, healing, love, and spiritual redemption.\\" Currin described the songs as \\"pleas for redemption in a world drunk on its promise, coupled with a reassuring contentment for simply having lived this life.\\" The song \\"City of Dreams\\", the lyrics of which refer to a street sweeper, was written by Fay 15 years before it was recorded. The album's title is derived from the song \\"Cosmic Concerto (Life Is People)\\", which refers to a comment made to Fay by his father while they were observing passers-by during a childhood visit to the seaside. \\"Be at Peace With Yourself\\", which begins with \\"liturgical\\" organ and piano, features a gospel choir and was described as the album's \\"centerpiece\\". Release News of a new Bill Fay album was announced on 31 May 2012 by Dead Oceans, and the first new song appeared when \\"Never Ending Happening\\" premiered on National Public Radio's All Songs Considered program on 26 June. A promotional video for \\"Be at Peace With Yourself\\", produced by Dan Huiting, was released on 9 July. Life Is People was made available for streaming in its entirety by Paste magazine on 20 August, and was released by Dead Oceans the following day on compact disc, double vinyl LP and digital download. A bonus track, \\"Home Was the Place\\", was included in the iTunes release. A promotional video for \\"This World\\", directed by Califone singer Tim Rutili, was premiered on 27 August. The video contained Super 8 film images projected onto people's faces, including that of Jesus Lizard frontman David Yow. Life Is People entered the UK Albums Chart during the week ending 1 September 2012 and peaked at number 56. In the United States, the album reached number 15 on the Heatseekers Albums chart. Fay donated the proceeds of the record to the humanitarian aid organisation M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res, known for its work in war-torn regions and developing countries. Reception At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, Life Is People received an average score of 86, based on 21 reviews, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". In his review for AllMusic, Thom Jurek stated that \\"Fay performs these songs as if they were living things, independent of his inner world. His reverence for them makes the listening experience one of great emotional depth. Life Is People brims with compassion, vulnerability, and tenderness. It is not a comeback record but a late continuation, a great work of art.\\" Drew Litowitz of Consequence of Sound wrote that \\"little has changed. Fay's songs sound as if they've simply been hanging out in the ether for all these years, just waiting to be put to tape...Life Is People makes a strong argument for why Fay deserves recognition, and not just by those in the know.\\" The Daily Telegraphs Neil McCormick called the album a \\"belated triumph\\" which \\"unfolds with the assurance of an old master still burning with the desire to tell his tales\\", saying that it was \\"so much stronger than the latter-day works of many of Fay's contemporaries.\\" Critic Tom Hughes of The Guardian was less complimentary, noting that the album was \\"not without a few syrupy moments, and it would be a push to recommend it over the old records\\" but concluded that \\"there are some fine songs here.\\" Andy Gill, writing for The Independent, said that \\"Fay has finally created the masterpiece that will secure his reputation\\" and added that Life is People was \\"truly, the album of a lifetime.\\" Daniel Paton of musicOMH said that \\"Life Is People may not quite be the masterpiece so many people dearly want it to be...that being said, there are moments here so sublime and moving that could only have come from Fay.\\" Pitchfork reviewer Grayson Currin remarked that \\"Life Is People and the tale that accompany it are strong enough...to at last make [Fay's] reputation among many match his legacy among few\\", saying that \\"at the risk of overstating the case, Life Is People‚Äîthe work of a 69-year-old family man, and the work of a lifetime‚Äîconfirms its maker's own thesis.\\" Critic Maria Schurr of PopMatters wrote that \\"one half of Fay's Life Is People proves worthy of such a long wait...those who Life Is People touches are unlikely to hear a more inspiring album this year.\\" Prefix magazine's Matthew Fiander stated that while it \\"does have its missteps...Life is People may not be the best Bill Fay, but hearing this there is no doubt about one thing: it's great to have him back. And hopefully this record is just the start of that return.\\" Life Is People was featured in several publications' end of year lists, ranking at number three on Mojos list of the best albums of 2012, number six on Uncuts list and number 19 on BBC Music. Nicky Wire of Manic Street Preachers named it one of his favourite records and as an influence on the band's album Rewind the Film (2013).

Forms of activism range from mandate building in the community (including writing letters to newspapers), petitioning elected officials, running or contributing to a political campaign, preferential patronage (or boycott) of businesses, and demonstrative forms of activism like rallies, street marches, strikes, sit-ins, or hunger strikes. Activism may be performed on a day-to-day basis in a wide variety of ways, including through the creation of art (artivism), computer hacking (hacktivism), or simply in how one chooses to spend their money (economic activism). For example, the refusal to buy clothes or other merchandise from a company as a protest against the exploitation of workers by that company could be considered an expression of activism. However, the most highly visible and impactful activism often comes in the form of collective action, in which numerous individuals coordinate an act of protest together in order to make a bigger impact. Collective action that is purposeful, organized, and sustained over a period of time becomes known as a social movement. Historically, activists have used literature, including pamphlets, tracts, and books to disseminate or propagate their messages and attempt to persuade their readers of the justice of their cause. Research has now begun to explore how contemporary activist groups use social media to facilitate civic engagement and collective action combining politics with technology. Definitions of activism The Online Etymology Dictionary records the English words \\"activism\\" and \\"activist\\" as in use in the political sense from the year 1920 or 1915 respectively. The history of the word activism traces back to earlier understandings of collective behavior and social action. As late as 1969 activism was defined as \\"the policy or practice of doing things with decision and energy\\", without regard to a political signification, whereas social action was defined as \\"organized action taken by a group to improve social conditions\\", without regard to normative status. Following the surge of so- called \\"new social movements\\" in the United States in the 1960s, a new understanding of activism emerged as a rational and acceptable democratic option of protest or appeal. However, the history of the existence of revolt through organized or unified protest in recorded history dates back to the slave revolts of the 1st century BC(E) in the Roman Empire, where under the leadership of former gladiator Spartacus 6,000 slaves rebelled and were crucified from Capua to Rome in what became known as the Third Servile War. In English history, the Peasants' Revolt erupted in response to the imposition of a poll tax, and has been paralleled by other rebellions and revolutions in Hungary, Russia, and more recently, for example, Hong Kong. In 1930 under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi thousands of protesting Indians participated in the Salt March, as a protest against the oppressive taxes of their government, resulting in the imprisonment of 60,000 people and eventually independence of their nation. In nations throughout Asia, Africa and South America, the prominence of activism organized by social movements and especially under the leadership of civil activists or social revolutionaries has pushed for increasing national self-reliance or, in some parts of the developing world, collectivist communist or socialist organization and affiliation. Activism has had major impacts on Western societies as well, particularly over the past century through social movements such as the Labour movement, the Women's Rights movement, and the civil rights movement. Types of activism Activists can function in a number of roles, including judicial, environmental, internet (technological) and design (art). Historically, most activism has focused on creating substantive changes in the policy or practice of a government or industry. Some activists try to persuade people to change their behavior directly (see also direct action), rather than to persuade governments to change laws. For example, the cooperative movement seeks to build new institutions which conform to cooperative principles, and generally does not lobby or protest politically. Other activists try to persuade people or government policy to remain the same, in an effort to counter change. Activism is not an activity always performed by those who profess activism as a profession. The term ‚Ä≥activist‚Ä≥ may apply broadly to anyone who engages in activism, or narrowly limited to those who choose political or social activism as a vocation or characteristic practice. = Judicial and citizen activism = Judicial activism involves the efforts of public officials. Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. - American historian, public intellectual, and social critic - introduced the term \\"judicial activism\\" in a January 1946 Fortune magazine article titled \\"The Supreme Court: 1947\\". Activists can also be public watchdogs and whistle blowers, attempting to understand all the actions of every form of government that acts in the name of the people and hold it accountable to oversight and transparency. Activism involves an engaged citizenry. = Environmental activism = Environmental activism takes quite a few forms: * the protection of nature or the natural environment driven by a utilitarian conservation ethic or a nature oriented preservationist ethic * the protection of the human environment (by pollution prevention or the protection of cultural heritage or quality of life) * the conservation of depletable natural resources * the protection of the function of critical earth system elements or processes such as the climate. =Internet activism= The power of Internet activism came into a global lens with the Arab Spring protests starting in late 2010. People living in the Middle East and North African countries that were experiencing revolutions used social networking to communicate information about protests, including videos recorded on smart phones, which put the issues in front of an international audience. This was the one of the first occasions in which social networking technology was used by citizen-activists to circumvent state-controlled media and communicate directly with the rest of the world. These types of practices of Internet activism were later picked up and used by other activists in subsequent mass mobilizations, such as the 15-M Movement in Spain in 2011, Occupy Gezi in Turkey in 2013, and more. Internet activism may also refer to activism which focuses on protecting or changing the Internet itself, also known as digital rights. The Digital Rights movement consists of activists and organizations, such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation, who work to protect the rights of people in relation to new technologies, particularly concerning the Internet and other information and communications technologies. = Activism in literature = Activism in literature (not to be confused with literary activism) includes the expression of intended or advocated reforms, realized or unachieved, through published, written or verbally promoted or communicated forms. = Economic activism = Economic activism involves using the economic power of government, consumers, and businesses for social and economic policy change.Lin, Tom C. W., Incorporating Social Activism (1 December 2018). 98 Boston University Law Review 1535 (2018) Both conservative and liberal groups use economic activism to as a form of pressure to influence companies and organizations to oppose or support particular political, religious, or social values and behaviors.White, Ben and Romm, Tony, Corporate America Tackles Trump, Politico, (6 February 2017) This is typically done either through preferential patronage to reinforce \\"good\\" behavior and support companies one would like to succeed, or through boycott or divestment to penalize \\"bad\\" behavior and pressure companies to change or go out of business. Brand activism is the type of activism in which business plays a leading role in the processes of social change. Applying brand activism, businesses show concern for the communities they serve, and their economic, social, and environmental problems, which allows businesses to build sustainable and long-term relationships with the customers and prospects. Kotler and Sarkar defined the phenomenon as an attempt by firms to solve the global problems its future customers and employees care about.http://www.activistbrands.com/what-is-brand-activism/ Consumer activism consists of activism carried out on behalf of consumers for consumer protection or by consumers themselves. For instance, activists in the free produce movement of the late 1700s protested against slavery by boycotting goods produced with slave labor. Today, vegetarianism, veganism, and freeganism are all forms of consumer activism which boycott certain types of products. Other examples of consumer activism include simple living, a minimalist lifestyle intended to reduce materialism and conspicuous consumption, and tax resistance, a form of direct action and civil disobedience in opposition to the government that is imposing the tax, to government policy, or as opposition to taxation in itself. Shareholder activism involves shareholders using an equity stake in a corporation to put pressure on its management. The goals of activist shareholders range from financial (increase of shareholder value through changes in corporate policy, financing structure, cost cutting, etc.) to non-financial (disinvestment from particular countries, adoption of environmentally friendly policies, etc.). = Visual Activism = Design Activism locates design at the center of promoting social change, raising awareness on social/political issues, or questioning problems associated with mass production and consumerism. Design Activism is not limited to one type of design. Art Activism or Artivism utilizes the medium of visual art as a method of social or political commentary. Fashion activism was coined by Celine Semaan. Fashion activism is a type of activism that ignites awareness by giving consumers tools to support change, specifically in the fashion industry. It has been used as an umbrella term for many social and political movements that have taken place in the industry. Fashion Activism uses a participatory approach to a political activity. Craft activism or Craftivism is a type of visual activism that allows people to bring awareness to political or social discourse. It is a creative approach to activism as it allows people to send short and clear messages to society. People who contribute to craftivism are called \\"craftivists\\". = Science activism = While scientists have been traditionally less likely to be politically active as scientists yet aware of the need to better communicate the benefits of science, perception of increased politicized discrediting of science has motivated some scientists and science advocates to embrace an activist approach, such as that demonstrated in the March for Science. Some see activism as a way to get \\"out of the lab\\" and enhance communication efforts. Approaches to science activism vary from more aggressive protests to suggestions that such activism should also include a more psychological, marketing-oriented component that takes into account such factors as individual sense of self, aversion to solutions to problems, and social perceptions. Methods peace vigil in U.S. history, started by activist Thomas in 1981. Activists employ many different methods, or tactics, in pursuit of their goals. Decisions over what tactics to use or not may be planned carefully in advance, result from negotiations with law enforcement such as when and where to hold a rally, or be made in the heat of the moment. The tactics chosen are significant because they can determine how activists are perceived and what they are capable of accomplishing. For example, nonviolent tactics generally tend to garner more public sympathy than violent ones and are more than twice as effective in achieving stated goals. Charles Tilly developed the concept of a ‚Äúrepertoire of contention,‚Äù which describes the full range of tactics available to activists at a given time and place. This repertoire consists of all of the tactics which have been proven to be successful by activists in the past, such as boycotts, petitions, marches, and sit-ins, and can be drawn upon by any new activists and social movements. Activists may also innovate new tactics of protest. These may be entirely novel, such as Douglas Schuler's idea of an \\"activist road trip\\", or may occur in response to police oppression or countermovement resistance. New tactics then spread to others through a social process known as diffusion, and if successful, may become new additions to the activist repertoire. Many contemporary activists now utilize new tactics through the Internet and other information and communication technologies (ICTs), also known as Internet activism or cyber-activism. Some scholars argue that many of these new tactics are digitally analogous to the traditional offline tools of contention. Other digital tactics may be entire new and unique, such as certain types of hacktivism. Together they form a new \\"digital repertoire of contention\\" alongside the existing offline one. The rising use of digital tools and platforms by activists has also increasingly led to the creation of decentralized networks of activists that are self-organized and leaderless, or what is known as franchise activism. Common methods used for activism include: * Community building ** Artivism ** Communities of practice ** Conflict transformation ** Cooperative ** Cooperative movement ** Craftivism ** Grassroots ** Guerrilla gardening ** Transition movement * Lobbying * Media activism ** Culture jamming ** Hacktivism ** Internet activism * Peace activism ** Non-violent resistance ** Peace camps ** Peace vigil ** Moral purchasing * Petition * Political campaigning * Propaganda ** Guerrilla communication * Protest ** Boycott ** Demonstration ** Direct action ** Performance Theater ** Protest songs ** Sit-in * Strike action ** Hunger strike Activism industry Some groups and organizations participate in activism to such an extent that it can be considered as an industry. In these cases, activism is often done full-time, as part of an organization's core business. Many organizations in the activism industry are either non-profit organizations or non-governmental organizations with specific aims and objectives in mind. Most activist organizations do not manufacture goods, but rather mobilize personnel to recruit funds and gain media coverage. The term activism industry has often been used to refer to outsourced fundraising operations. However, activist organizations engage in other activities as well. Lobbying, or the influencing of decisions made by government, is another activist tactic. Many groups, including law firms, have designated staff assigned specifically for lobbying purposes. In the United States, lobbying is regulated by the federal government.New Federal Lobbying Law Reporting Periods Begin Many government systems encourage public support of non-profit organizations by granting various forms of tax relief for donations to charitable organizations. Governments may attempt to deny these benefits to activists by restricting the political activity of tax-exempt organizations.

The term anti-war can also refer to pacifism, which is the opposition to all use of military force during conflicts, or to anti-war books, paintings, and other works of art. Many activists distinguish between anti-war movements and peace movements. Anti-war activists work through protest and other grassroots means to attempt to pressure a government (or governments) to put an end to a particular war or conflict or to prevent it in advance. Anti-war rally of schoolchildren in Pilathara, India History =American Revolutionary War= Substantial opposition to British war intervention in America led the British House of Commons on 27 February 1782 to vote against further war in America, paving the way for the Second Rockingham ministry and the Peace of Paris. =Antebellum United States= Substantial antiwar sentiment developed in the United States roughly between the end of the War of 1812 and the commencement of the Civil War in what is called the Antebellum era. A similar movement developed in England during the same period. The movement reflected both strict pacifist and more moderate non-interventionist positions. Many prominent intellectuals of the time, including Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau (see Civil Disobedience) and William Ellery Channing contributed literary works against war. Other names associated with the movement include William Ladd, Noah Worcester, Thomas Cogswell Upham, and Asa Mahan. Many peace societies were formed throughout the United States, the most prominent of which being the American Peace Society. Numerous periodicals (such as The Advocate of Peace) and books were also produced. The Book of Peace, an anthology produced by the American Peace Society in 1845, must surely rank as one of the most remarkable works of antiwar literature ever produced.Beckwith, George (ed), The Book of Peace. American Peace Society, 1845. A recurring theme in this movement was the call for the establishment of an international court to adjudicate disputes between nations. Another distinct feature of antebellum antiwar literature was the emphasis on how war contributed to a moral decline and brutalization of society in general. =American Civil War= Rioters attack federal troops. A key event in the early history of the modern anti-war stance in literature and society was the American Civil War, where it culminated in the candidacy of George B. McClellan for US president as a Peace Democrat against incumbent President Abraham Lincoln. The outlines of the antiwar stance are seen: the argument of the costs of maintaining the present conflict not being worth the gains that can be made, the appeal to end the horrors of war, and the argument of war being waged for the profit of particular interests. During the war, the New York Draft Riots were started as violent protests against Lincoln's Enrollment Act of Conscription to draft men to fight in the war. The outrage over conscription was augmented by the ability to \\"buy\\" one's way out, which could be afforded only by the wealthy. After the war, The Red Badge of Courage described the chaos and sense of death which resulted from the changing style of combat: away from the set engagement, and towards two armies engaging in continuous battle over a wide area. =Second Boer War= William Thomas Stead formed an organization against the Second Boer War, the Stop the War Committee. =World War I= The Deserter by Boardman Robinson, The Masses, 1916. In Britain, in 1914, the Public Schools Officers' Training Corps annual camp was held at Tidworth Camp, near Salisbury Plain. Head of the British Army Lord Kitchener was to review the cadets, but the immenence of the war prevented him. General Horace Smith-Dorrien was sent instead. He surprised the two-or-three thousand cadets by declaring (in the words of Donald Christopher Smith, a Bermudian cadet who was present) that war should be avoided at almost any cost, that war would solve nothing, that the whole of Europe and more besides would be reduced to ruin, and that the loss of life would be so large that whole populations would be decimated. In our ignorance I, and many of us, felt almost ashamed of a British General who uttered such depressing and unpatriotic sentiments, but during the next four years, those of us who survived the holocaust-probably not more than one-quarter of us ‚Äì learned how right the General's prognosis was and how courageous he had been to utter it.Merely For the Record: The Memoirs of Donald Christopher Smith 1894‚Äì1980. By Donald Christopher Smith. Edited by John William Cox, Jr. Bermuda. Having voiced these sentiments did not hinder Smith-Dorrien's career, or prevent him from carrying out his duty in the First World War to the best of his abilities. With the increasing mechanization of war, opposition to its horrors grew, particularly in the wake of the First World War. European avant-garde cultural movements such as Dada were explicitly anti-war. The Espionage Act of 1917 and the Sedition Act of 1918 gave the American authorities the right to close newspapers and jailed individuals for having anti-war views. On June 16, 1918, Eugene V. Debs made an anti-war speech and was arrested under the Espionage Act of 1917. He was convicted, sentenced to serve ten years in prison, but President Warren G. Harding commuted his sentence on December 25, 1921. =Between the World Wars= In 1924 Ernst Friedrich published Krieg dem Krieg! (War Against War!): an album of photographs drawn from German military and medical archives from the first world war. In Regarding the Pain of Others Sontag describes the book as 'photography as shock therapy' that was designed to 'horrify and demoralize'. It was in the 1930s that the Western anti-war movement took shape, to which the political and organizational roots of most of the existing movement can be traced. Characteristics of the anti-war movement included opposition to the corporate interests perceived as benefiting from war, to the status quo which was trading the lives of the young for the comforts of those who are older, the concept that those who were drafted were from poor families and would be fighting a war in place of privileged individuals who were able to avoid the draft and military service, and to the lack of input in decision making that those who would die in the conflict would have in deciding to engage in it. In 1933, the Oxford Union resolved in its Oxford Pledge, \\"That this House will in no circumstances fight for its King and Country.\\" Many war veterans, including US General Smedley Butler, spoke out against wars and war profiteering on their return to civilian life. Veterans were still extremely cynical about the motivations for entering World War I, but many were willing to fight later in the Spanish Civil War, indicating that pacifism was not always the motivation. These trends were depicted in novels such as All Quiet on the Western Front, For Whom the Bell Tolls and Johnny Got His Gun. =World War II= Protest at the White House by the American Peace Mobilization. Opposition to World War II was most vocal during its early period, and stronger still before it started while appeasement and isolationism were considered viable diplomatic options. Communist-led organizations, including veterans of the Spanish Civil War, Volunteer for Liberty , newsletter of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, February 1941, Volume III, No. 2 opposed the war during the period of the Hitler-Stalin pact but then turned into hawks after Germany invaded the Soviet Union. The war seemed, for a time, to set anti-war movements at a distinct social disadvantage; very few, mostly ardent pacifists, continued to argue against the war and its results at the time. However, the Cold War followed with the post-war realignment, and the opposition resumed. The grim realities of modern combat, and the nature of mechanized society ensured that the anti-war viewpoint found presentation in Catch-22, Slaughterhouse-Five and The Tin Drum. This sentiment grew in strength as the Cold War seemed to present the situation of an unending series of conflicts, which were fought at terrible cost to the younger generations. =Vietnam War= U.S. Marshals arresting a Vietnam War protester in Washington, D.C., 1967 Organized opposition to U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War began slowly and in small numbers in 1964 on various college campuses in the United States and quickly as the war grew deadlier. In 1967 a coalition of antiwar activists formed the National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam which organized several large anti-war demonstrations between the late-1960s and 1972. Counter-cultural songs, organizations, plays and other literary works encouraged a spirit of nonconformism, peace, and anti-establishmentarianism. This anti-war sentiment developed during a time of unprecedented student activism and right on the heels of the Civil Rights Movement, and was reinforced in numbers by the demographically significant baby boomers. It quickly grew to include a wide and varied cross-section of Americans from all walks of life. The anti-Vietnam war movement is often considered to have been a major factor affecting America's involvement in the war itself. Many Vietnam veterans, including the former Secretary of State and former U.S. Senator John Kerry and disabled veteran Ron Kovic, spoke out against the Vietnam War on their return to the United States. =South African Border War= Opposition to the South African Border War spread to a general resistance to the apartheid military. Organizations such as the End Conscription Campaign and Committee on South African War Resisters, were set up. Many opposed the war at this time. =Yugoslav Wars= Srƒëan Gojkoviƒá performing at the anti-war concert as part of Rimtutituki Following the rise of nationalism and political tensions after Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá came to power, as well as the outbreaks of the Yugoslav Wars, numerous anti-war movements developed in Serbia. The anti-war protests in Belgrade were held mostly because of opposition the Battle of Vukovar, Siege of Dubrovnik and Siege of Sarajevo, while protesters demanded the referendum on a declaration of war and disruption of military conscription. More than 50,000 people participated in many protests, and more than 150,000 people took part in the most massive protest called ‚ÄúThe Black Ribbon March‚Äù in solidarity with people in Sarajevo. It is estimated that between 50,000 and 200,000 people deserted from the Yugoslav People's Army, while between 100,000 and 150,000 people emigrated from Serbia refusing to participate in the war. According to professor Renaud De la Brosse, senior lecturer at the University of Reims and a witness called by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), it is surprising how great the resistance to Milo≈°eviƒá's propaganda was among Serbs, given that and the lack of access to alternative news. The most famous associations and NGOs who marked the anti-war ideas and movements in Serbia were the Center for Antiwar Action, Women in Black, Humanitarian Law Center and Belgrade Circle. The Rimtutituki was a rock supergroup featuring Ekatarina Velika, Elektriƒçni Orgazam and Partibrejkers members, which was formed at the petition signing against mobilization in Belgrade. NATO bombing of Yugoslavia during the Kosovo War triggered debates over the legitimacy of the intervention. About 2,000 Serbian Americans and anti-war activists protested in New York City against NATO airstrikes, while more than 7,000 people protested in Sydney. The most massive protests were held in Greece, and demonstrations were also held in Italian cities, London, Moscow, Toronto, Berlin, Stuttgart, Salzburg and Skopje. =2001 Afghanistan War= Demonstration in Qu√©bec City against the Canadian military involvement in Afghanistan, 22 June 2007 There was initially little opposition to the 2001 Afghanistan War in the United States and the United Kingdom, which was seen as a response to the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and was supported by a majority of the American public. Most vocal opposition came from pacifist groups and groups promoting a leftist political agenda; in the United States, the group A.N.S.W.E.R. was one of the most visible organizers of anti-war protests, although that group faced considerable controversy over allegations it was a front for the extremist Stalinist Workers World Party. Over time, opposition to the war in Afghanistan has grown more widespread, partly as a result of weariness with the length of the conflict, and partly as a result of a conflating of the conflict with the unpopular war in Iraq. =Iraq War= Anti-war rally in Washington, D.C., March 15, 2003 Thomas on the White House Peace Vigil The anti-war position gained renewed support and attention in the buildup to the 2003 invasion of Iraq by the U.S. and its allies. Millions of people staged mass protests across the world in the immediate prelude to the invasion, and demonstrations and other forms of anti-war activism have continued throughout the occupation. The primary opposition within the U.S. to the continued occupation of Iraq has come from the grassroots. Opposition to the conflict, how it had been fought, and complications during the aftermath period divided public sentiment in the U.S., resulting in majority public opinion turning against the war for the first time in the spring of 2004, a turn which has held since. Many American writers against the war, like Naomi Wolf, were labeled conspiratorial due to their opposition, with others choosing to post their anti-war writings anonymously, such as the anonymous conspiracy author Sorcha Faal. The financial website Zero Hedge offered its anti-war writers the protection of the anonymous pseudonym Tyler Durden for those exposing war profiteering. The American country music band Dixie Chicks opposition to the war caused many radio stations to stop playing their records, but who were supported in their anti-war stance by the equally anti-war country music legend Merle Haggard, who in the summer of 2003 released a song critical of US media coverage of the Iraq War. Anti-war groups protested during both the Democratic National Convention and 2008 Republican National Convention protests held in St. Paul, Minnesota in September 2008. =Possible war against Iran= Organised opposition to a possible future military attack against Iran by the United States is known to have started during 2005‚Äì2006. Beginning in early 2005, journalists, activists and academics such as Seymour Hersh, The Iran plans, Seymour Hersh, The New Yorker Mag., April 8, 2006 Scott Ritter, Joseph Cirincione and Jorge E. Hirsch began publishing claims that United States' concerns over the alleged threat posed by the possibility that Iran may have a nuclear weapons program might lead the US government to take military action against that country in the future. These reports, and the concurrent escalation of tensions between Iran and some Western governments, prompted the formation of grassroots organisations, including Campaign Against Sanctions and Military Intervention in Iran in the US and the United Kingdom, to advocate against potential military strikes on Iran. Additionally, several individuals, grassroots organisations and international governmental organisations, including the Director-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed ElBaradei, a former United Nations weapons inspector in Iraq, Scott Ritter, Nobel Prize winners including Shirin Ebadi, Mairead Corrigan-Maguire and Betty Williams, Harold Pinter and Jody Williams, Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Code Pink, the Non-Aligned Movement of 118 states, and the Arab League, have publicly stated their opposition to a would-be attack on Iran. =War in Donbass= Anti-war/Putin demonstration in Moscow, 21 September 2014 Anti-war/Putin demonstrations took place in Moscow \\"opposing the War in Donbass\\", i.e., in the Eastern Ukraine. =Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen= Protest against U.S. involvement in the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen, New York City, 2017 Arts and culture English poet Robert Southey's 1796 poem After Blenheim is an early modern example of anti-war literature ‚Äî it was written generations after the Battle of Blenheim, but at a time when England was again at war with France. World War I produced a generation of poets and writers influenced by their experiences in the war. The work of poets including Wilfred Owen and Siegfried Sassoon exposed the contrast between the realities of life in the trenches and how the war was seen by the British public at the time, as well as the earlier patriotic verse penned by Rupert Brooke. German writer Erich Maria Remarque penned All Quiet on the Western Front, which, having been adapted for several mediums, has become of the most often cited pieces of anti-war media. Pablo Picasso's 1937 painting Guernica, on the other hand, used abstraction rather than realism to generate an emotional response to the loss of life from the fascist bombing of Guernica during the Spanish Civil War. American author Kurt Vonnegut used science fiction themes in his 1969 novel Slaughterhouse-Five, depicting the bombing of Dresden in World War II (which Vonnegut witnessed). The second half of the 20th century also witnessed a strong anti-war presence in other art forms, including anti-war music such as \\"Eve of Destruction\\" and One Tin Soldier and films such as M*A*S*H and Die Br√ºcke, opposing the Cold War in general, or specific conflicts such as the Vietnam War. The current American war in Iraq has also generated significant artistic anti-war works, including filmmaker Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11, which holds the box- office record for documentary films, and Canadian musician Neil Young's 2006 album Living with War. Anti-war intellectual and scientist-activists and their work Various people have discussed the philosophical question of whether war is inevitable, and how it can be avoided; in other words, what are the necessities of peace. Various intellectuals and others have discussed it from an intellectual and philosophical point of view, not only in public, but participating or leading anti-war campaigns despite its differing from their main areas of expertise, leaving their professional comfort zones to warn against or fight against wars. =Philosophical possibility of avoiding war= * Immanuel Kant: In (1795) \\"Perpetual Peace\\"Immanuel Kant.

It was formed in the 1950s from the merger of the Singapore Progressive Party (SPP) and the Democratic Party (DP), the latter not to be confused with the Singapore Democratic Party (SDP). The merger occurred in order to consolidate their relatively compatible and similar aims, that of gradual and nonradical progressivism implementing liberal policies. The merger occurred because of the weak performance of both parties in the Singapore general election of 1955, but members started to merge with the Singapore People's Alliance (SPA) before the following general election of 1959. The LSP contested the general election of 1959 against the SPA, had a significant showing, gaining more than 8% of the popular vote and contesting 32 seats, but failed to win any of them. Following the election most of the LSP merged with the SPA and the rump of the LSP died out as the now ruling People's Action Party (PAP) gained dominance. The SPA faded away during the incidents of merger, ensuing heated PAP-UMNO relations, and a shifted political focus towards an additional struggle between the PAP and the Barisan Sosialis. The LSP ceased to exist by 1965, when Singapore became fully independent, and never stood candidates for election.

Those on the centre-left believe in working within the established systems to improve social justice.Oliver H. Woshinsky. Explaining Politics: Culture, Institutions, and Political Behavior. New York: Routledge, 2008, pp. 146. The centre-left promotes a degree of social equality that it believes is achievable through promoting equal opportunity.Oliver H. Woshinsky. Explaining Politics: Culture, Institutions, and Political Behavior. New York: Routledge, 2008, pp. 143. The centre-left emphasizes that the achievement of equality requires personal responsibility in areas in control by the individual person through their abilities and talents as well as social responsibility in areas outside control by the person in their abilities or talents.Chris Armstrong. Rethinking Equality: The Challenge of Equal Citizenship. Manchester University Press, 2006, p. 89. The centre-left opposes a wide gap between the rich and the poor and supports moderate measures to reduce the economic gap, such as a progressive income tax, laws prohibiting child labour, minimum wage laws, laws regulating working conditions, limits on working hours and laws to ensure the workers' right to organize. The centre-left typically claims that complete equality of outcome is not possible, but instead that equal opportunity improves a degree of equality of outcome in society. In Europe, the centre-left includes social democrats, progressives and also some democratic socialists, greens and the Christian left. Some social liberals are described as centre-left, but many social liberals are in the centre of the political spectrum as well.  Positions associated with the centre-left  The main ideologies of the centre-left are social democracy, social liberalism (sometimes, when paired with other ideologies; can also be considered centrist), progressivism, democratic socialism (moderate forms) and green politics (also can take place under a red‚Äìgreen alliance when cooperating with other parties on the left). Throughout the world, centre-left groups generally support: * A mixed economy consisting of both publicly owned or subsidized programmes of education, universal health care, child care and related social services for all citizens. * A system of social security, with the stated goal of counteracting the effects of poverty and insuring the general public against loss of income following illness, unemployment or retirement (national Insurance contributions) * Government bodies that regulate private enterprise in the interests of workers and consumers by ensuring labour rights (eg. supporting worker access to trade unions, workers participation, consumer protections and fair market competition). * A system of progressive taxation that includes tax breaks and subsidies for those under poverty extended from government. * A value-added tax (or occasionally a wealth tax) to fund government expenditures. * Government investments and spending, for example in public works, and Keynesian economics. The term may be used to imply positions on the environment, religion, public morality, etc., but these are usually not the defining characteristics, since centre-right parties may sometimes take similar positions on these issues. A centre-left party may or may not be more concerned with reducing industrial emissions than a centre-right party if not explicitly adhering to a green ideology.  History  The term \\"centre-left\\" appeared during the French \\"July Monarchy\\" in 1830s, a political-historical phase during the Kingdom of France when the House of Orl√©ans reigned under an almost parliamentary system. The centre-left was distinct from the left, composed of republicans, as well as the centre-right, composed of the Third Party and the liberal-conservative Doctrinaires. During this time, the centre- left was led by Adolphe Thiers (head of the liberal-nationalist Movement Party) and Odilon Barrot, who headed the populist \\"Dynastic Opposition\\". The centre-left was Orl√©anist, but supported a liberal interpretation of the Charter of 1830, more power to the Parliament, manhood suffrage and support to rising European nationalisms. Adolphe Thiers served as Prime Minister for King Louis Philippe I twice (in 1836 and 1840), but he then lost the King's favour, and the centre-left rapidly fell. In France, during the Second Republic and the Second Empire the centre-left was not strong or organised, but became commonly associated with the moderate republicans' group in Parliament. Finally, in 1871 the Second Empire fell as consequence of the French defeat in the Franco-Prussian War and Adolphe Thiers re-established the centre-left after the foundation of the Third Republic. This time the centre-left was constituted of moderate republicans, then called \\"Opportunists\\", anti-royalist liberals and radicals from the Republican Union. During the Third Republic, the centre-left was led by political and intellectual figures like Jules Dufaure, √âdouard Ren√© de Laboulaye, Charles de R√©musat, L√©on Say, William Waddington, Jean Casimir-Perier, Edmond Henri Adolphe Sch√©rer and Georges Picot. Elsewhere in Europe, centre-left movements appeared from the 1860s, mainly in Spain and Italy. In Italy, the centre-left was born as coalition between the liberal Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour and the progressive Urbano Rattazzi, the heads respectively of the Right and Left groupings in Parliament. This alliance was called \\"connubio\\" (\\"marriage\\") for its opportunist characteristics. In the 1900s, centre-left positions were expressed by people and parties who believed in social democracy and democratic socialism, but also some liberals or Christian-democrats were associated with the centre-left. Currently, the centre-left parties in Europe are united in the social democratic Party of European Socialists and ecologist European Green Party. Despite the rise of centre-left politics in continental Europe, Britain and its colonies, along with the United States, only saw the rise of the centre-left in the late 19th century to the early 20th century. The prevalence of the position occurred mainly due to the rise of socialism caused Liberals to move away from laissez-faire policies to more interventionist policies, which created the New Liberal movement.

Liberal socialism has been compared to post-war social democracy as it supports a mixed economy that includes both private property and social ownership in capital goods. While social democracy is anti-capitalist insofar as criticism of capitalism is linked to the private ownership of the means of production, liberal socialism identifies artificial and legalistic monopolies to be the fault of capitalism and opposes an entirely unregulated market economy. It considers both liberty and equality to be compatible and mutually dependent on each other. Liberal socialism is a type of socialism that has been most prominent in the post-war period. For Ian Adams, post-war social democracy and socialist New Labour are examples of liberal socialism, in contrast to classical socialism. However, those two forms of liberal socialism are based on two different economic theories, namely Keynesianism and supply side, respectively. According to Christopher Pierson, \\"actually existing liberal democracy is, in substantial part, a product of socialist (social democratic) forces\\". According to Ian Hunt, liberal socialism is an alternative social ideal grounded in both socialist Karl Marx and liberal John Rawls. Principles that can be described as liberal socialist are based on the works of liberal, left-liberal, radical and socialist economists and philosophers such as Roberto Ardig√≤, Eduard Bernstein, Henry Charles Carey, G. D. H. Cole, , John Dewey, Eugen D√ºhring, Henry George, , Peter Kropotkin, John Locke, John Stuart Mill, William Ogilvie of Pittensear, Thomas Paine, Karl Polanyi, Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, Carlo Rosselli, Adam Smith, Thomas Spence, Herbert Spencer and L√©on Walras. Other important liberal socialist figures include Norberto Bobbio, , Anthony Crosland, Piero Gobetti, Theodor Hertzka, Leonard Hobhouse, Oszk√°r J√°szi, John Maynard Keynes, , Chantal Mouffe, Franz Oppenheimer, John Rawls and R. H. Tawney. To Polanyi, liberal socialism's goal was overcoming exploitative aspects of capitalism by expropriation of landlords and opening to all the opportunity to own land. For Polanyi, it represented the culmination of a tradition initiated by the physiocrats, among others. Liberal socialism has been particularly prominent in British and Italian politics. Its seminal ideas can be traced to John Stuart Mill, who theorised that capitalist societies should experience a gradual process of socialisation through worker-controlled enterprises, coexisting with private enterprises. Mill rejected centralised models of socialism that he thought might discourage competition and creativity, but he argued that representation is essential in a free government and democracy could not subsist if economic opportunities were not well distributed, therefore conceiving democracy not just as form of representative government, but as an entire social organisation. While socialists have been hostile to liberalism, accused of \\"providing an ideological cover for the depredation of capitalism\\", it has been pointed out that \\"the goals of liberalism are not so different from those of the socialists\\", although this similarity in goals has been described as being deceptive due to the different meanings liberalism and socialism give to liberty, equality and solidarity.  History  = Argentina = Leandro N. Alem, founder of liberal socialism in Argentina's politics and head of the Revolution of the Park During the National Autonomist Party governments, liberal socialism emerged in Argentina's politics as opposed to the Julio Argentino Roca's ruling conservative liberalism, albeit president Domingo Faustino Sarmiento had previously implemented an agenda influenced by John Stuart Mill writings. A first spokesperson of the new trend was Leandro N. Alem, founder of the Radical Civil Union. Liberal socialists never governed in Argentina, but they constituted the main opposition from 1880 to 1914 and again from 1930 until the rise of Peronism. , , Jos√© Ingenieros, Juan B. Justo, , Alicia Moreau de Justo and Nicol√°s Repetto are among the representatives of the trend during the D√©cada Infame in the 1930s as part of the Radical Civic Union or the Socialist Party. Ingenieros' work has had diffusion all over Latin America. In the 2003 Argentine general election, Ricardo L√≥pez Murphy (who has denominated himself a liberal socialist in the tradition of Alem and Juan Bautista Alberdi) ended third with 16.3 per cent of the popular vote. Contemporary Argentine liberal socialists include Mario Bunge and Juan Jos√© Sebreli. = Belgium = Chantal Mouffe is a prominent Belgian advocate of liberal socialism. She describes liberal socialism as follows: = Britain =  John Stuart Mill  John Stuart Mill, influential 19th-century English thinker of liberalism who adopted some socialist views The main liberal English thinker John Stuart Mill's early economic philosophy was one of free markets. However, he accepted interventions in the economy such as a tax on alcohol, if there were sufficient utilitarian grounds. He also accepted the principle of legislative intervention for the purpose of animal welfare. Mill originally believed that equality of taxation meant equality of sacrifice and that progressive taxation penalised those who worked harder and saved more and therefore was a \\"mild form of robbery\\". Given an equal tax rate regardless of income, Mill agreed that inheritance should be taxed. A utilitarian society would agree that everyone should be equal one way or another. Therefore, receiving inheritance would put one ahead of society unless taxed on the inheritance. Those who donate should consider and choose carefully where their money goes‚Äîsome charities are more deserving than others. Considering public charities boards such as a government will disburse the money equally. However, a private charity board like a church would disburse the monies fairly to those who are in more need than others. Mill later altered his views toward a more socialist bent, adding chapters to his Principles of Political Economy in defence of a socialist outlook and defending some socialist causes. Within this revised work, he also made the radical proposal that the whole wage system be abolished in favour of a co-operative wage system. Nonetheless, some of his views on the idea of flat taxation remained, albeit altered in the third edition of the Principles of Political Economy to reflect a concern for differentiating restrictions on unearned incomes which he favoured; and those on earned incomes which he did not favour. In the case of Oxford University, Mill's Principles of Political Economy, first published in 1848, was the standard text until 1919 when it was replaced by Alfred Marshall's Principles of Economics. As Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations had during an earlier period, Mill's Principles of Economy dominated economics teaching and was one of the most widely read of all books on economics in the period. In later editions of Principles of Political Economy, Mill would argue that \\"as far as economic theory was concerned, there is nothing in principle in economic theory that precludes an economic order based on socialist policies\\". At some point, Mill also promoted substituting capitalist businesses with worker cooperatives, writing: > The form of association, however, which if mankind continue to improve, must > be expected in the end to predominate, is not that which can exist between a > capitalist as chief, and work-people without a voice in the management, but > the association of the labourers themselves on terms of equality, > collectively owning the capital with which they carry on their operations, > and working under managers elected and removable by themselves.  Ethical socialism  R. H. Tawney, founder of ethical socialism Liberal socialism has exercised influence in British politics, especially in the variant known as ethical socialism. A key component of ethical socialism is in its emphasis on moral and ethical critiques of capitalism and building a case for socialism on moral or spiritual grounds as opposed to rationalist and materialist grounds. Ethical socialists advocated a mixed economy that involves an acceptance of a role of both public enterprise as well as socially responsible private enterprise. Ethical socialism was founded by Christian socialist R. H. Tawney and its ideals were also connected to Fabian and guild- socialist values. It emphasises the need for a morally conscious economy based upon the principles of service, cooperation and social justice while opposing possessive individualism. Ethical socialism is distinct in its focus on criticism of the ethics of capitalism and not merely criticism of material issues of capitalism. Tawney denounced the self-seeking amoral and immoral behaviour that he claimed is supported by capitalism. He opposed what he called the \\"acquisitive society\\" that causes private property to be used to transfer surplus profit to \\"functionless owners\\"‚Äîcapitalist rentiers. However, Tawney did not denounce managers as a whole, believing that management and employees could join together in a political alliance for reform. He supported the pooling of surplus profit through means of progressive taxation to redistribute these funds to provide social welfare, including public health care, public education and public housing. Tawney advocated nationalisation of strategic industries and services. He also advocated worker participation in the business of management in the economy as well as consumer, employee, employer and state cooperation in the economy. Though he supported a substantial role for public enterprise in the economy, Tawney stated that where private enterprise provided a service that was commensurate with its rewards that was functioning private property, then a business could be usefully and legitimately be left in private hands. Ethical socialist Thomas Hill Green supported the right of equal opportunity for all individuals to be able freely appropriate property, but he claimed that acquisition of wealth did not imply that an individual could do whatever they wanted to once that wealth was in their possession. Green opposed \\"property rights of the few\\" that were preventing the ownership of property by the many. Ethical socialism is an important ideology of the Labour Party. Labour Prime Minister Clement Attlee supported the ideology, which played a large role in his party's policies during the postwar 1940s. Half a century after Attlee's tenure, Tony Blair, another Labour Prime Minister, also described himself as an adherent of ethical socialism, which for him embodies the values of \\"social justice, the equal worth of each citizen, equality of opportunity, community\\". Influenced by Attlee and John Macmurray (who himself was influenced by Green), Blair has defined the ideology in similar terms as earlier adherents‚Äîwith an emphasis on the common good, rights and responsibilities as well as support of an organic society in which individuals flourish through cooperation. Blair argued that Labour ran into problems in the 1960s and 1970s when it abandoned ethical socialism and that its recovery required a return to the values promoted by the Attlee government. However, Blair's critics (both inside and outside Labour) have accused him of completely abandoning socialism in favour of capitalism. = France =  Pierre-Joseph Proudhon  Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, 19th-century socialist advocate of mutualism While Pierre-Joseph Proudhon was a revolutionary, his social revolution did not mean civil war or violent upheaval, but rather the transformation of society. This transformation was essentially moral in nature and demanded the highest ethics from those who sought change. It was monetary reform, combined with organizing a credit bank and workers associations, that Proudhon proposed to use as a lever to bring about the organization of society along new lines. Proudhon's ethical socialism has been described as part of the liberal socialist tradition which is for egalitarianism and free markets, with Proudhon taking \\"a commitment to narrow down the sphere of activity of the state\\". James Boyle quoted Proudhon as stating that socialism is \\"every aspiration towards the amelioration of society\\" and then admitting that \\"we are all socialists\\" under this definition. Proudhon was a supporter of both free markets and property, but he distinguished between the privileged private property that he opposed and the earned personal property that he supported. By free markets, Proudhon meant industrial democracy and workers' self-management. Mutualism involved free association by creating industrial democracy, a system where workplaces would be \\"handed over to democratically organised workers' associations. [...] We want these associations to be models for agriculture, industry and trade, the pioneering core of that vast federation of companies and societies woven into the common cloth of the democratic social Republic.\\" Under mutualism, like in Mill's version of liberal socialism, workers would no longer sell their labour to a capitalist but rather work for themselves in cooperatives. Proudhon urged \\"workers to form themselves into democratic societies, with equal conditions for all members, on pain of a relapse into feudalism\\". This would result in \\"[c]apitalistic and proprietary exploitation, stopped everywhere, the wage system abolished, equal and just exchange guaranteed\\". Robert Graham noted that \\"Proudhon's market socialism is indissolubly linked to his notions of industrial democracy and workers' self-management\\". In his in-depth analysis of this aspect of Proudhon's ideas, K. Steven Vincent noted that \\"Proudhon consistently advanced a program of industrial democracy which would return control and direction of the economy to the workers\\". For Proudhon, \\"strong workers' associations [...] would enable the workers to determine jointly by election how the enterprise was to be directed and operated on a day-to-day basis\\". = Germany = Willy Brandt, Chancellor of West Germany (1969‚Äì1974) An early version of liberal socialism was developed in Germany by Franz Oppenheimer. Although he was committed to socialism, Oppenheimer's theories inspired the development of the social liberalism that was pursued by German Chancellor Ludwig Erhard, who said the following: \\"As long as I live, I will not forget Franz Oppenheimer! I will be as happy if the social market economy‚Äîas perfect or imperfect as it might be‚Äîcontinues to bear witness to the work, to the intellectual stance of the ideas and teachings of Franz Oppenheimer.\\" In the 1930s, the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), a reformist socialist political party that was up to then based upon revisionist Marxism, began a transition away from orthodox Marxism towards liberal socialism. After it was banned by the Nazi regime in 1933, the SPD acted in exile through the Sopade. In 1934, the Sopade began to publish material that indicated that the SPD was turning towards liberal socialism. , a prominent proponent of liberal socialism within the Sopade, declared that Sopade represented the tradition of Weimar Republic social democracy (a form of liberal democratic socialism) and declared that Sopade's held true to its mandate of traditional liberal principles combined with the political realism of socialism. After the restoration of democracy in West Germany, the SPD's Godesberg Program in 1959 eliminated the party's remaining Marxist policies. The SPD then became officially based upon liberal socialism (). West German Chancellor Willy Brandt has been identified as a liberal socialist. = Hungary = In 1919, the Hungarian politician Oszk√°r J√°szi declared his support for what he termed \\"liberal socialism\\" while denouncing \\"communist socialism\\". Opposed to classical social democracy's prevalent focus on support from the working class, J√°szi saw the middle class and smallholder peasants as essential to the development of socialism and spoke of the need of a \\"radical middle-class\\". His views were especially influenced by events in Hungary in 1919 involving the Bolshevik revolution during which he specifically denounced the Marxist worldview shortly after the collapse of the Hungarian Soviet Republic, calling his views \\"Anti-Marx\\". His criticism of orthodox Marxism was centered on its mechanical, value-free and amoral methodology. He argued that \\"[i]n no small measure, the present terrible, bewildering world crisis is a consequence of Marxism's mechanical Communism and amoral nihilism. New formulas of spirit, freedom and solidarity have to be found\\". J√°szi promoted a form of co-operative socialism that included liberal principles of freedom, voluntarism and decentralization. He counterpoised this ideal version of socialism with the then-existing political system in the Soviet Union, which he identified as based upon dictatorial and militarist perils, statism and a crippled economic order where competition and quality are disregarded. J√°szi's views on socialism and especially his works justifying the denouncement of Bolshevik communism came back into Hungarian public interest in the 1980s when copies of his manuscripts were discovered and were smuggled into Hungary that was then under communist party-rule. = Italy = Carlo Rosselli, Italian proponent of liberal socialism Going back to Italian revolutionaries and socialists such as Giuseppe Garibaldi and Giuseppe Mazzini, Italian socialist Carlo Rosselli was inspired by the definition of socialism by the founder of social democracy, Eduard Bernstein, who defined socialism as \\"organised liberalism\\". Rosselli expanded on Bernstein's arguments by developing his notion of liberal socialism (). In 1925, Rosselli defined the ideology in his work of the same name in which he supported the type of socialist economy defined by socialist economist Werner Sombart in Der modern Kapitalismus (1908) that envisaged a new modern mixed economy that included both public and private property, limited economic competition and increased economic cooperation. While appreciating principles of liberalism as an ideology that emphasised liberation, Rosselli was deeply disappointed with liberalism as a system that he described as having been used by the bourgeoisie to support their privileges while neglecting the liberation components of liberalism as an ideology and thus viewed conventional liberalism as a system that had merely become an ideology of \\"bourgeois capitalism\\". At the same time, Rosselli appreciated socialism as an ideology, but he was also deeply disappointed with conventional socialism as a system. In response to his disappointment with conventional socialism in practice, Roselli declared: \\"The recent experiences, all the experiences of the past thirty years, have hopelessly condemned the primitive programs of the socialists. State socialism especially‚Äîcollectivist, centralising socialism‚Äîhas been defeated\\". Rosselli's liberal socialism was partly based upon his study and admiration of British political themes of the Fabian Society and John Stuart Mill (he was able to read the English versions of Mill's work On Liberty prior to its availability in Italian that began in 1925). His admiration of British socialism increased after his visit to the United Kingdom in 1923 where he met George Drumgoole Coleman, R. H. Tawney and other members of the Fabian Society. An important component of Italian liberal socialism developed by Rosselli was its anti- fascism. Rosselli opposed fascism and believed that fascism would only be defeated by a revival of socialism. Rosselli founded Giustizia e Libert√† as a resistance movement founded in the 1930s in opposition to the Fascist regime in Italy. Ferruccio Parri‚Äîwho later became Prime Minister of Italy‚Äîand Sandro Pertini‚Äîwho later became President of Italy‚Äîwere among Giustizia e Libert√†'s leaders. Giustizia e Libert√† was committed to militant action to fight the Fascist regime and it saw Benito Mussolini as a ruthless murderer who himself deserved to be killed as punishment. Various early schemes were designed by the movement in the 1930s to assassinate Mussolini, including one dramatic plan of using an aircraft to drop a bomb on Piazza Venezia where Mussolini resided. Rosselli was also a prominent member of the liberal-socialist Action Party. Sandro Pertini, President of Italy (1978‚Äì1985) After Rosselli's death, liberal socialism was developed in Italian political thought by . Unlike Rosselli, Calogero considered the ideology as a unique ideology called liberalsocialism () that was separate from existing liberal and socialist ideologies. Calogero created the \\"First Manifesto of Liberalsocialism\\" in 1940 that stated the following: After World War II, Ferruccio Parri of the liberal socialist Action Party briefly served as Prime Minister of Italy in 1945. In 1978, liberal socialist Sandro Pertini of the Italian Socialist Party was elected President of Italy in 1978 and served as President until 1985.

Development After the first Praga R1 was built in 2012. Official Praga testdriver Danny van Dongen drove the car for the first time on October 10, 2012. Production of the R1 began in March 2013. Racing history On 15 November 2012 the Supercar Challenge organisation in conjunction with Praga Racing and Radical Benelux launched a new racing class. The Supercar Challenge Superlights would feature four sub-classes, one for the Praga R1, one for the Radical SR8, one for the Radical SR3 and one for Group CN cars. =2013= The first race of the Superlights class was run at the Slovakia Ring. Praga Racing announced that they would enter 10 Praga R1's in the first round. Due to a strike in the Spanish customs division most of the wheels, produced by Spanish company Braid Wheels, did not arrive in time. Due to not having enough wheels only three cars could start the first race. The drivers (Van Dongen, Wagner, Hrobarek and Rosina) had their first racing experience with the Praga R1 on May 17. Danny van Dongen was the fastest Praga in free practice, setting a third time overall behind two Radical SR8's, and in front of a Norma M20F and two Radical SR3's. Danny van Dongen took the first pole position in the PR1 class, fourth overall. Stefan Rosina won the first race. =2014= During the 2014 season the Praga R1 was part of the Supercar Challenge, drivers Berry van Elk, Carlo Kuijer, Nol K√∂hler and Danny van Dongen we participating in the championship in Europe. At the Menzo 24 Hours of Zolder the Praga R1 was classified 3rd in class and completed the first ever 24 hours race with the Praga R1. The drivers were Ronald van Loon, Nol K√∂hler, Berry van Elk and Carlo Kuijer. =2017= The Praga R1T was entered for the 2017 Dutch GT & Prototype Challenge in CN class, being run by VR Motorsport in their first year with the car and this championship. The driver line-up consisted of Tim Gray, Oliver Hewitt & Alastair Boulton. For a first season, the team performed well with mujltiple podium positions and an outright win at Zolder. =2018= The Praga R1T was entered for the 2018 Dutch GT & Prototype Challenge in CN class, being run by VR Motorsport, with drivers Tim Gray & Alain Berg. strong results saw the Praga win the CN class. The highlight of the year being an outright win against the more powerful LMP3 cars in a DTM support race at Zandvoort. =2019= Praga R1T at Brands Hatch The Praga R1T was entered for the 2019 Dunlop Endurance Championship, being run by VR Motorsport, with drivers Tim Gray, Grant Williams and Alastair Boulton at the wheel in various parts of the season. It had been a strong contender in the championship but in the second-half of the season, the car experienced problems and dropped to sixth before having a good race in the final round of the championship at Brands Hatch. After swapping the provisional pole position spot with the Brabham BT62, it ended up third on the grid. In the first race, fuse problems, accompanied by a door issue put the car down the field in 11th at the end of the race. In the second race, the car was a lot more reliable, ending the race in 2nd place. The team ended the season 4th overall but 1st in class. =2020= In 2020, VR Motorsport upgraded to a three-Praga entry with two Class 1 cars and one Class 2 entry. One of the R1T Evos took pole position and the overall race 2 win. The team will enter a car in the GT & Prototype Challenge as well.  Praga R1R  The Praga R1R is a mid-engined production sports car based on the R1. This is Praga's first road car since 1947 a.c, or 68 years. The car is powered by the same engine, transmission, brakes, clutch, and chassis, but has a few differences, like being slightly smaller than the R1.

Engels' first book, it was originally written in German as Die Lage der arbeitenden Klasse in England; an English translation was published in 1885. It was written during Engels' 1842‚Äì44 stay in Manchester, the city at the heart of the Industrial Revolution, and compiled from Engels' own observations and detailed contemporary reports. After their second meeting in 1844, Karl Marx read and was profoundly impressed by the book. Summary In Condition, Engels argues that the Industrial Revolution made workers worse off. He shows, for example, that in large industrial cities such as Manchester and Liverpool, mortality from disease (such as smallpox, measles, scarlet fever and whooping cough) was four times that in the surrounding countryside, and mortality from convulsions was ten times as high. The overall death-rate in Manchester and Liverpool was significantly higher than the national average (1 in 32.72, 1 in 31.90 and even 1 in 29.90, compared with 1 in 45 or 46). An interesting example shows the increase in the overall death-rates in the industrial town of Carlisle was before the introduction of mills (1779‚Äì87), 4,408 out of 10,000 children died before reaching the age of five, and after their introduction, the figure rose to 4,738. Before the introduction of mills, 1,006 out of 10,000 adults died before reaching 39 years old, and after their introduction, the death rate rose to 1,261 out of 10,000. Engels' interpretation proved to be extremely influential with British historians of the Industrial Revolution. He focused on both the workers' wages and their living conditions. He argued that the industrial workers had lower incomes than their pre-industrial peers and they lived in more unhealthy and unpleasant environments. This proved to be a very wide-ranging critique of industrialization and one that was echoed by many of the Marxist historians who studied the industrial revolution in the 20th century. Originally addressed to a German audience, the book is considered by many to be a classic account of the universal condition of the industrial working class during its time. The eldest son of a successful German textile industrialist, Engels became involved in radical journalism in his youth. Sent to England, what he saw there made him even more radical. In 1844, in Paris, Engels met and formed his lifelong intellectual partnership with Karl Marx. Engels showed Marx his book; Mansel, Philip: Paris Between Empires, p. 390 (St. Martin Press, NY) 2001Frederick Engels, \\"The Condition of the Working Class in England\\", contained in the Collected Works of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels: Volume 4 (International Publishers: New York, 1975) pp. 295‚Äì596. convincing Marx that the working class could be the agent and instrument of the final revolution in history.P. N. Fedoseyev, Karl Marx: A Biography (Progress Publishers: Moscow, 1973) p. 82. W. O. Henderson and W.H. Chaloner, who edited a recent edition of The Condition of the Working Class in England, say that the book was based on incomplete evidence but that it established Engels's reputation among socialists. The German original In the original German edition he said: English editions The book was translated into English in 1885 by an American, Florence Kelley (also known as Florence Kelley Wischnewetzky). Authorised by Engels and with a newly written preface by him, it was published in 1887 in New York and in London in 1891. These English editions had the qualification in 1844 added to the English title. Engels in his 1892 preface said: The book has been continuously reissued, and remains in print in several different editions.

Kerr & Co. edition of Marx's The Poverty of Philosophy. The book was translated by British socialist Harry Quelch. The Poverty of Philosophy (French: Mis√®re de la philosophie) is a book by Karl Marx published in Paris and Brussels in 1847, where he lived in exile from 1843 until 1849. It was originally written in French as an answer to the economic and philosophical arguments of French anarchist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon set forth in his 1846 book The System of Economic Contradictions, or The Philosophy of Poverty. History =The ideas of Proudhon= Proudhon addressing the French Assembly in July 1848. Pierre-Joseph Proudhon (1809-1865) was a French anarchist theoretician who wrote extensively on the relationship between the individual and the state. Proudhon believed in an orderly society but argued that the state represented an illegitimate concentration of official violence which effectively undercut any effort to build a just society.Paul Thomas, Marx and the Anarchists. London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1980; pg. 176. Proudhon rejected all political action as a form of class collaboration but argued instead that the working class could achieve its salvation through economic action alone; abstention from politics was advocated with a view to the ultimate eradication of the existing state and its political apparatus.Thomas, Marx and the Anarchists, pp. 177‚Äì178. Proudhon believed that the stateless future was not preordained by iron laws of history, but was rather to be the conscious creation of a population which had been morally awakened.Thomas, Marx and the Anarchists, pg. 179. This necessary morality, based upon honesty, decency, self-respect, and individual responsibility, was believed to be an inherent part of the working class‚Äîsomething to be developed and emphasized. By way of contrast, industrialists, businessmen, and those who serve them were held to be incapable of developing this morality due to the nature of their day-to-day economic and political activity. The act of labor itself was believed to be socially ennobling, whereas the act of economic exploitation backed by political force was held to be inherently corrupting.Thomas, Marx and the Anarchists, pp. 179‚Äì180. Therefore, Proudhon emphatically declared for a strict separatism between the working class and all others. =Karl Marx in exile= Karl Marx left Germany following the repression of the newspaper he edited, the Rheinische Zeitung, by the government of Prussia early in 1843. He landed in Paris, where he lived from October 1843 until December 1845.Thomas, Marx and the Anarchists, pg. 191. It was there that he first met Proudhon, who was already a well known radical writer, with four books to his credit. Despite an appeal being made as a prospective French collaborator, Proudhon declined to participate in the ill- fated Deutsch-franz√∂sische Jahrb√ºcher (German-French Yearbook) project with which Marx was intimately associated.Thomas, Marx and the Anarchists, pg. 192. Although the personal contact between the two was limited, Marx read Proudhon's writings at this time, discussions of which may be found in his work of the period, including the book written against Bruno Bauer, The Holy Family (1845), and the unpublished Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844. In the published book Marx lent critical support to some of the ideas of Proudhon against competing ideas of Bauer. Marx was particularly attracted to the comprehensive nature of Proudhon's writings up to 1845 and the latter's willingness to make larger connections from smaller observations.Thomas, Marx and the Anarchists, pp. 197‚Äì198. In his book What Is Property? Proudhon emphasized the social relationships emerging from private property, and the tendency of economic development to produce a propertyless proletariat in ever increasing numbers‚Äîideas which Marx found compelling. Marx's praise of Proudhon was not limitless, however, as he felt Proudhon did not fully grasp the way in which wages and money, for example, were themselves forms of private property.Thomas, Marx and the Anarchists, pg. 201. Marx was forced to exit Paris by the French government in 1845, with Brussels, Belgium his next destination.Thomas, Marx and the Anarchists, pg. 205. Despite his departure from France, he continued to see Proudhon as a potential political collaborator, asking him in 1846 to participate in a new international correspondence committee patterned after the London-based Workers' Educational Association, designed to propagate socialist ideas among the working class of continental Europe. Proudhon responded cautiously to Marx's appeal.Thomas, Marx and the Anarchists, pg. 206. Perhaps partially in consequence, Marx and his friend and political associate turned their organizing efforts to an established political body, the League of the Just. =Proudhon's The Philosophy of Poverty= =Marx's The Poverty of Philosophy= Marx read Proudhon's book late in 1846 and responded strongly and negatively, writing a lengthy letter to his Russian correspondent P.V. Annenkov on December 28, 1846 with a detailed exposition of his views that became the core of his 1847 book.Vera Morozova, \\"Introductory Note to The Poverty of Philosophy,\\" Marx- Engels Collected Works: Volume 6, Marx and Engels, 1845‚Äì1848. New York: International Publishers, 1976; pg. 672. He began working on a book-length formal reply the following January, completing the work in the spring and going to press in April 1847. The book, formally titled The Poverty of Philosophy: Answer to the Philosophy of Poverty by M. Proudhon, saw print in Brussels and Belgium early in July 1847. The book was written in the French language to strike its target most closely and for the cutting pun of a title to be rendered most unmistakably. The book was regarded by the political circle around Marx organized as the Communist League as a key part of their contemporary program, delineating the views of the League from those espoused by Proudhon and his followers. Somewhat surprisingly, following its initial release in 1847, The Poverty of Philosophy was never republished in full prior to Marx's death in 1883.Morozova, \\"Introductory Note,\\" pg. 673. The first German edition of the book was first published in 1885; a Russian language translation by the Emancipation of Labor group (Russian: –û—Å–≤–æ–±–æ–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏–µ —Ç—Ä—É–¥–∞) was released in 1886. A corrected Second French Edition materialized in 1896, initiated by Friedrich Engels and completed after his death by Marx's daughter, Laura Lafargue. The first English language edition of The Poverty of Philosophy was unveiled in London in 1900 by the pioneer Marxist publisher Twentieth Century Press.Morozova, \\"Introductory Note,\\" pg. 674. The translation for this edition was made by British socialist Harry Quelch. Quelch's version was reprised in the United States for the first time in 1910 by Charles H. Kerr & Co., a socialist publishing house based in Chicago. Content The tone of Marx's polemic against Proudhon is set from the outset, with a witty cut in lieu of a foreword: > \\"M.

It is first explicitly used in Marx's published book The Poverty of Philosophy, although Marx and Engels had already defined the term in The German Ideology. Some social relations are voluntary and freely chosen (a person chooses to associate with another person or a group). But other social relations are involuntary, i.e. people can be socially related, whether they like that or not, because they are part of a family, a group, an organization, a community, a nation etc. By \\"relations of production\\", Marx and Engels meant the sum total of social relationships that people must enter into in order to survive, to produce, and to reproduce their means of life. As people must enter into these social relationships, i.e. because participation in them is not voluntary, the totality of these relationships constitute a relatively stable and permanent structure, the \\"economic structure\\" or mode of production. The term \\"relations of production\\" is somewhat vague, for two main reasons: *The German word Verh√§ltnis can mean \\"relation\\", \\"proportion\\", or \\"ratio\\". Thus, the relationships could be qualitative, quantitative, or both. Which meaning applies can only be established from the context. *The relations to which Marx refers can be social relationships, economic relationships, or technological relationships. Marx and Engels typically use the term to refer to the socioeconomic relationships characteristic of a specific epoch; for example: a capitalist's exclusive relationship to a capital good, and a wage worker's consequent relation to the capitalist; a feudal lord's relationship to a fief, and the serf's consequent relation to the lord; a slavemaster's relationship to their slave; etc. It is contrasted with and also affected by what Marx called the forces of production. How Marx uses the concept Here are four famous quotations showing Marx's use of the concept of relations of production: (In other words, the English relations of production did not exist in Australia; there was no system of property rights and legal obligations and no economic necessity compelling workers to work for their boss. The servants therefore could leave Mr. Peel in order to find work or occupy free land to make a better living.) Definitions A social relation can be defined, in the first instance, as *a relation between individuals insofar as they belong to a group, or *a relation between groups, or *a relation between an individual and a group The group could be an ethnic or kinship group, a social institution or organisation, a social class, a nation or gender etc. A social relation is therefore not simply identical with an interpersonal relation or an individual relation, although all these types of relations presuppose each other. A social relation refers to a common social characteristic of a group of people. Society for Marx is the sum total of social relations connecting its members. Social relations of production in Marx's sense refer to *(often legally encoded) ownership and control relations pertaining to society's productive assets, *the way people are formally and informally associated within the economic sphere of production, including as social classes, *co- operative work relations (including household labor), *socio-economic dependencies between people arising from the way they produce and reproduce their existence, *relationships between different worksites or production sites *the quantitative proportions of different aspects of the sphere of production, considered from the point of view of society as a whole. The totality of social relations of production constitute the social structure of the economy, which according to Marx determine how incomes, products and assets will be distributed. Social/technical distinction and reification Combined with the productive forces, the relations of production constitute a historically specific mode of production. Karl Marx contrasts the social relations of production with the technical relations of production; in the former case, it is people (subjects) who are related, in the latter case, the relation is between people and objects in the physical world they inhabit (those objects are, in the context of production, what Marx calls the \\"means of labor\\" or means of production). However, Marx argues that with the rise of market economy, this distinction is increasingly obscured and distorted. In particular, a cash economy makes it possible to define, symbolise and manipulate relationships between things that people make in abstraction from the social and technical relations involved. Marx says this leads to the reification (thingification or Verdinglichung) of economic relations, of which commodity fetishism is a prime example. The marketplace seems to be a place where all people have free and equal access and freely negotiate and bargain over deals and prices on the basis of civil equality. People will buy and sell goods without really knowing where they originated or who made them. They know that objectively they depend on producers and consumers somewhere else, that this social dependency exists, but they do not know who specifically those people are or what their activities are. Market forces seem to regulate everything, but what is really behind those market forces has become obscured, because the social relationship between people or their relation with nature is expressed as a commercial relationship between things (money, commodities, capital) (see also value-form). Some social relations of production therefore exist in an objective, mind-independent way, not simply because they are a natural necessity for human groups, but because of the mediation of social and technical relations by commerce. In addition to creating new social and technical relations, commerce introduces a proliferation of relationships between tradeable 'things'. Not only do relationships between 'things' (commodities, prices etc.) begin to indicate and express social and technical relations, the commercial relations also begin to govern and regulate the pattern of human contact and technique. The fact therefore that particular social relations of production acquire an objective, mind-independent existence may not be due to any natural necessity asserting itself but only to a purely social necessity: commodity exchange objectifies social relations to the point where they escape from conscious human control, and exist such that they can be recognised only by abstract thought. Relations of distribution One of the theoretical problems in Marxian economics is to distinguish exactly between relations of production and relations of distribution, determining the significance of each in the allocation of resources. According to the crudest and most vulgar interpretations of Das Kapital, exploitation occurs only at the point of production. Marx himself obviously did not assert this at all, he only postulated the command over the surplus labour of others as the basis of the existence of capital and its economic power. Marx discusses the theoretical problem in two main places: the introduction to the Grundrisse manuscript and in chapter 51 of Das Kapital. In the Grundrisse, where he defines the total economy to include production, circulation, distribution and consumption (similar to James Mill), he raises the following question: He answers his own question negatively: Disagreeing with David Ricardo, who regarded distribution as the proper object of study for economics, Marx argues that the mode of production largely determines the mode of distribution: the source of income and products in production, and their distribution among the population must be analysed within one framework: In the last chapters of Das Kapital Vol 3, he develops the argument, defining relations of distribution as the \\"forms\\" which \\"express the relationships in which the total value newly produced is distributed among the owners of the various agents of production\\" (as income and products). His critique of political economy in this regard was (1) that relations of production or distribution are posited as \\"natural and eternal\\" rather than as historically specific relations, (2) that forms of distribution of income and products are crucially determined by property relations pertaining to productive assets; (3) that by constantly reproducing the relations of production, the mode of production of capital also reproduces the relations of distribution corresponding to it. Late in his life, Marx touches on the issue again: Criticism of Marx's concept It is frequently objected by Weberian sociologists (those in the tradition of Max Weber) that Marx paid insufficient attention to the intersubjective dimension of social relations, i.e. the meanings consciously attached by people to their social interactions. However, Marx's argument is that these subjective or intersubjective meanings permit of infinite variations, and therefore cannot be the foundation for a genuine science of society. Individual meanings depend on shared meanings, and these shared meanings arise out of objective circumstances which exist independently of individuals. So one must begin with understanding those objective interdependencies which by necessity shape and socialise human beings, i.e. those social relations which people as social beings must enter into, regardless of what they may think or wish. In this context, the young Vladimir Lenin commented: In fact, Marx devotes a great amount of attention in Das Kapital to explaining why economic relations appear in human consciousness in the way that they do, and why they might appear in a different way than they really are. Another sort of criticism, from economists, consists of the observation that processes of distribution (of products and income) can to a considerable extent develop independently or autonomously from what happens in production, with the aid of a developed credit system. In fact, gross distortions between value added in production, and the distribution of products and incomes, might occur‚Äîfor example, as a result of underdevelopment, imperialism, state intervention, unequal exchange, fictitious capital, credit bubbles, or capital gains from rising property values. That is, a society or region might get much more or much less income than the value of what it produces. In that case, there are intermediary agencies between production and consumption influencing the allocation of resources. Probably Marx would have acknowledged that, but he would presumably have argued that ultimately, the dyssynchrony or distortion between production and distribution would cause a crisis and then a readjustment of distribution to the real structure of production relations.

Marx regarded productive ability and participation in social relations as two essential characteristics of social reproduction and that the particular modality of these relations in capitalist production are inherently in conflict with the increasing development of human productive capacities.Marx, Grundrisse. (English Translation) A precursor to this concept was Adam Smith's concept of mode of subsistence, which delineated a progression of society types based on the way in which society's members provided for their basic needs.New Voices on Adam Smith, by Leonidas Montes, Eric Schliesser. Routledge, March 2006. P 295.  Significance of concept  Building on the four-stage theory of human development of the Scottish Enlightenment ‚Äì Hunting/Pastoral/Agricultural/Commercial Societies, each with its own socio-cultural characteristicsR Meek, Social Science and the Ignoble Savage (Cambridge 1976) p. 117-9 and p. 186-8 \\\\- Marx articulated the concept of mode of production: ‚ÄúThe mode of production in material life determines the general character of the social, political, and spiritual processes of life‚Äù.Quoted in J Childers ed., The Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism (New York 1995) p. 191 Marx considered that the way people relate to the physical world and the way people relate to each other socially are bound up together in specific and necessary ways: ‚Äúmen [who] produce cloth, linen, silk...also produce the ‚Äòsocial relations‚Äô amid which they prepare cloth and linen‚Äù.Quoted in J O‚ÄôNeill, Sociology as a Skin Trade (London 1972) p. 115 People must consume to survive, but to consume they must produce and in producing they necessarily enter into relations which exist independently of their will. For Marx, the whole secret of why/how a social order exists and the causes of social change must be discovered in the specific mode of production that a society has.M Hardt ed., The Jameson Reader (Oxford 2000) p. 11 He further argued that the mode of production substantively shaped the nature of the mode of distribution, the mode of circulation and the mode of consumption, all of which together constitute the economic sphere. To understand the way wealth was distributed and consumed, it was necessary to understand the conditions under which it was produced. A mode of production is historically distinctive for Marx because it constitutes part of an organic totality (or self-reproducing whole) which is capable of constantly re-creating its own initial conditions and thus perpetuate itself in a more or less stable ways for centuries, or even millennia. By performing social surplus labour in a specific system of property relations, the labouring classes constantly reproduce the foundations of the social order. A mode of production normally shapes the mode of distribution, circulation and consumption and is regulated by the state. As Marx wrote to Annenkov, ‚ÄúAssume particular stages of development in production, commerce and consumption and you will have a corresponding social order, a corresponding organization of the family and of the ranks and classes, in a word, a corresponding civil society‚Äù.Quoted in J O‚ÄôNeill, Sociology as a Skin Trade (London 1972) p. 116 However any given mode of production will also contain within it (to a greater or lesser extent) relics of earlier modes, as well as seeds of new ones.M Hardt ed., The Jameson Reader (Oxford 2000) p. 12 The emergence of new productive forces will cause conflict in the current mode of production. When conflict arises, the modes of production can evolve within the current structure or cause a complete breakdown. = Process of socioeconomic change = The process by which social and economic systems evolve is based on the premise of improving technology. Specifically, as the level of technology improves, existing forms of social relations become increasingly insufficient for fully exploiting technology. This generates internal inefficiencies within the broader socioeconomic system, most notably in the form of class conflict. The obsolete social arrangements prevent further social progress while generating increasingly severe contradictions between the level of technology (forces of production) and social structure (social relations, conventions and organization of production) which develop to a point where the system can no longer sustain itself and is overthrown through internal social revolution that allows for the emergence of new forms of social relations that are compatible with the current level of technology (productive forces).Marxism.org: Mode of Production. The fundamental driving force behind structural changes in the socioeconomic organization of civilization are underlying material concerns‚Äîspecifically, the level of technology and extent of human knowledge and the forms of social organization they make possible. This comprises what Marx termed the materialist conception of history (see also materialism) and is in contrast to an idealist analysis, (such as that criticised by Marx in Proudhon),J O‚ÄôNeill, Sociology as a Skin Trade (London 1972) p. 115-6 which states that the fundamental driving force behind socioeconomic change are the ideas of enlightened individuals. Modes of production =Tribal and neolithic modes of production= Marx and Engels often referred to the \\"first\\" mode of production as primitive communism. In classical Marxism, the two earliest modes of production were those of the tribal band or horde, and of the neolithic kinship group. M Hardt ed., The Jameson Reader (Oxford 2000) p. 46-7 Tribal bands of hunter gatherers represented for most of human history the only form of possible existence. Technological progress in the Stone Age was very slow; social stratification was very limited (as were personal possessions, hunting grounds being held in common);J Diamond, The World Until Yesterday (Penguin 2012) p. 13-1 and myth, ritual and magic are seen as the main cultural forms.M Hardt ed., The Jameson Reader (Oxford 2000) p. 47 With the adoption of agriculture at the outset of the Neolithic Revolution, and accompanying technological advances in pottery, brewing, baking, and weaving,G Childe, What Happened in History (Penguin 1954) p. 60-2 there came a modest increase in social stratification, and the birth of classJ Diamond, The World Until Yesterday (London 2012) p. 15-17 with private property held in hierarchical kinship groups or clans.M Hardt ed., The Jameson Reader (Oxford 2000) p. 47 Animism was replaced by a new emphasis on gods of fertility;Y Harari, Sapiens (London 2011) p. 235-7 and a move from matriarchy to patriarchy (arguably) took place at the same time.M Hardt ed., The Jameson Reader (Oxford 2000) p. 51 = Asiatic mode of production = The Asiatic mode of production is a controversial contribution to Marxist theory, first used to explain pre-slave and pre-feudal large earthwork constructions in India, the Euphrates and Nile river valleys (and named on this basis of the primary evidence coming from greater \\"Asia\\"). The Asiatic mode of production is said to be the initial form of class society, where a small group extracts social surplus through violence aimed at settled or unsettled band and village communities within a domain. It was made possible by a technological advance in data-processing ‚Äì writing, cataloguing and archivingY Harari, Sapiens (London 2011) p. 137 and p. 145 \\\\- as well as by associated advances in standardisation of weights and measures, mathematics, calendar-making and irrigation.G Childe, What Happened in History (Penguin 1954) p. 117-125 Exploited labour is extracted as forced corvee labour during a slack period of the year (allowing for monumental construction such as the pyramids, ziggurats and ancient Indian communal baths). Exploited labour is also extracted in the form of goods directly seized from the exploited communities. The primary property form of this mode is the direct religious possession of communities (villages, bands, and hamlets, and all those within them) by the gods: in a typical example, three-quarters of the property would be allotted to individual families, while the remaining quarter would be worked for the theocracy.G Childe, What Happened in History (Penguin 1954) p. 94-5 The ruling class of this society is generally a semi-theocratic aristocracy which claims to be the incarnation of gods on earth. The forces of production associated with this society include basic agricultural techniques, massive construction, irrigation, and storage of goods for social benefit (granaries). Because of the unproductive use of the creamed-off surplus, such Asiatic empires tended to be doomed to fall into decay.A R Burn, Persia and the Greeks (Stanford 1984) p. 565 = Antique or ancient mode of production = Sometimes referred to as \\"slave society\\", an alternative route out of neolithic self-sufficiency came in the form of the polis or city-state. Technological advances in the form of cheap iron tools, coinage, and the alphabet, and the division of labour between industry, trade and farming, enabled new and larger units to develop in the form of the polis,G Childe, What Happened in History (Penguin 1954) p. 25 and 196-7 which called in turn for new forms of social aggregation. A host of urban associations ‚Äì formal and informal ‚Äì took over from earlier familial and tribal groupings.O. Murray ed., The Oxford History of the Classical World (Oxford 1991) p. 207-10 Constitutionally agreed law replaced the vendettaM Hardt ed., The Jameson Reader (Oxford 2000) p. 51 \\\\- an advance celebrated in such new urban cultural forms as Greek tragedy: thus, as Robert Fagles put it, ‚ÄúThe Oresteia is our rite of passage from savagery to civilization...from the blood vendetta to the social justice‚Äù.R Fagles trans., The Oresteia (Penguin 1981) p. 19-21 Classical Greek and Roman societies are the most typical examples of this antique mode of production. The forces of production associated with this mode include advanced (two field) agriculture, the extensive use of animals in agriculture, industry (mining and pottery), and advanced trade networks. It is differentiated from the Asiatic mode in that property forms included the direct possession of individual human beings (slavery): ‚ÄúThe pagan State recognised only the Masters as citizens...work is assigned to the Slaves‚Äù, Alexandre Kojeve, Introduction to the Reading of Hegel (London 1980) p. 57 thus for example Plato in his ideal city-state of Magnesia envisaged for the leisured ruling class of citizens that ‚Äútheir farms have been entrusted to slaves, who provide them with sufficient produce of the land to keep them in modest comfort‚Äù.Plato, The Laws (Penguin 1988) p. 296 The ancient mode of production is also distinguished by the way the ruling class usually avoids the more outlandish claims of being the direct incarnation of a god and prefers to be the descendants of gods, or seeks other justifications for its rule, including varying degrees of popular participation in politics. It was not so much democracy, but rather the universalising of its citizenship, that eventually enabled Rome to set up a Mediterranean-wide urbanised empire, knit together by roads, harbours, lighthouses, aqueducts, and bridges, and with engineers, architects, traders and industrialists fostering interprovincial trade between a growing set of urban centres.G Childe, What Happened in History (Penguin 1954) p. 263-73 = Feudal mode of production = The fall of the Western Roman Empire returned most of Western Europe to subsistence agriculture, dotted with ghost towns and obsolete trade- routesP Wolff, The Awakening of Europe (Penguin 1968) p. 22-3 Authority too was localised, in a world of poor roads and difficult farming conditions.R W Southern The Making of the Middle Ages (London 1993) p. 20 and p. 80 The new social form which emerged in place of the ties of family or clan, of sacred theocracy or legal citizenship was a relationship based on the personal tie of vassal to lord, cemented by the link to landholding in the guise of the fief.J M Wallace-Hadrill, The Barbarian West (London 1964) p. 110-1 and p. 143 This was the feudal mode of production, which dominated the systems of the West between the fall of the classical world and the rise of capitalism (similar systems existing in most of the world as well). This period also saw the decentralization of the ancient empires into the earliest nation-states. The primary form of property is the possession of land in reciprocal contract relations, military service for knights, labour services to the lord of the manor by peasants or serfs tied to and entailed upon the land.Barrington Moore Jr, Social Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy (Penguin 1977) p. 419 and p. 4-5 Exploitation occurs through reciprocated contract (though ultimately resting on the threat of forced extractions).\\"The very essence of feudal property was exploitation in its most naked form\\", R H Tawney, Religion and the Rise of Capitalism (London 1937) p. 56 The ruling class is usually a nobility or aristocracy, typically legitimated by some concurrent form of theocracy. The primary forces of production include highly complex agriculture (two, three field, lucerne fallowing and manuring) with the addition of non- human and non-animal power devices (clockwork and wind-mills) and the intensification of specialisation in the crafts‚Äîcraftsmen exclusively producing one specialised class of product. The prevailing ideology was of a hierarchical system of society, tempered by the element of reciprocity and contract in the feudal tie.W Ullmann A history of Political Thought in the Middle Ages (Penguin 1965) p. 90 and p. 147 While, as Maitland warned, the feudal system had many variations, extending as it did over more than half a continent, and half a millennium,G C Coulton Medieval Panorama (Cambridge 1938) p. 50 nevertheless the many forms all had at their core a relationship that (in the words of John Burrow) was ‚Äúat once legal and social, military and economic...at once a way of organising military force, a social hierarchy, an ethos and what Marx would later call a mode of production‚Äù.J Burrow, A History of Histories (Penguin 2009) p. 317 During this period, a merchant class arises and grows in strength, driven by the profit motive but prevented from developing further profits by the nature of feudal society, in which, for instance, the serfs are tied to the land and cannot become industrial workers and wage-earners. This eventually precipitates an epoch of social revolution (i.e.: the English Civil War and the Glorious Revolution of 1688, the French Revolution of 1789, etc.) wherein the social and political organization of feudal society (or the property relations of feudalism) are overthrown by a nascent bourgeoisie.Marx, Preface to A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy Marx, Early writings, Penguin, 1975, p425-6 = Capitalist mode of production = By the close of the Middle Ages, the feudal system had been increasingly hollowed out by the growth of free towns, the commutation for money of servile labour,G C Coulton Medieval Panorama (Cambridge 1938) p. 73-6 and 284-6 the replacement of the feudal host by a paid soldiery, and the divorce of retainership from land tenureBarrington Moore Jr, Social Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy (Penguin 1977) p. 5 \\\\- even if feudal privileges, ethics and enclaves would persist in Europe till the end of the millennium in residual forms.M Scott, Medieval Europe (London 1964) p. 241 and p. 420 Feudalism was succeeded by what Smith called the Age of Commerce, and Marx the capitalist mode of production, which spans the period from mercantilism to imperialism and beyond, and is usually associated with the emergence of modern industrial society and the global market economy. Marx maintained that central to the new capitalist system was the replacement of a system of money serving as the key to commodity exchange (C-M-C, commerce), by a system of money leading (via commodities) to the re-investment of money in further production (M-C-M‚Äô, capitalism) - the new and overriding social imperative.M Hardt ed., The Jameson Reader (Oxford 2000) p. 267 The primary form of property is that of private property in commodity form ‚Äì land, materials, tools of production, and human labour, all being potentially commodified and open to exchange in a cash nexus by way of (state guaranteed) contract: as Marx put it, ‚Äúman himself is brought into the sphere of private property‚Äù.Quoted in J O‚ÄôNeill, Sociology as a Skin Trade (London 1972) p. 26 The primary form of exploitation is by way of (formally free) wage labour (see Das Kapital,J O‚ÄôNeill, Sociology as a Skin Trade (London 1972) p. 191 with debt peonage,Y Harari, Sapiens (London 2011) p. 368-71 wage slavery, and other forms of exploitation) also possible. The ruling class for Marx is the bourgeoisie, or the owners of capital who possess the means of production, who exploit the proletariat for surplus value, as the proletarians possess only their own labour power which they must sell in order to survive.P. King, The Philosophy Book (London 2011) p. 199-200 Yuval Harari reconceptualised the dichotomy for the 21st Century in terms of the rich who invest to re-invest, and the remainder who go into debt in order to consume for the benefit of the owners of the means of production.Y Harari, Sapiens (London 2011) p. 390 Under Capitalism the key forces of production include the overall system of modern production with its supporting structures of bureaucracy, bourgeois democracy, and above all finance capital. The system‚Äôs ideological underpinnings took place over the course of time, Frederic Jameson for example considering that ‚Äúthe Western Enlightenment may be grasped as part of a properly bourgeois cultural revolution, in which the values and the discourse, the habits and the daily space, of the ancien r√©gime were systematically dismantled so that in their place could be set the new conceptualities, habits and life forms, and value systems of a capitalist market society‚ÄùM Hardt ed., The Jameson Reader (Oxford 2000) p. 50 \\\\- utilitarianism, rationalised production (Weber), training and discipline (Foucault) and a new capitalist time-structure.M Hardt ed., The Jameson Reader (Oxford 2000) p. 47-50 and p. 277-8 = Socialist mode of production = Socialism is the mode of production which Marx considered will succeed capitalism, and which will itself ultimately be succeeded by communism - the words socialism and communism both predate Marx and have many definitions other than those he used, however - once the forces of production outgrew the capitalist framework.E H Carr, The Bolshevik Revolution 2 (Penguin 1971) p. 11 In his 1917 work The State and Revolution, Lenin divided communism, the period following the overthrow of capitalism, into two stages: first socialism, and then later, once the last vestiges of the old capitalist ways have withered away, stateless communism or pure communism. Marx typically used the terms the \\"first phase\\" of communism and the \\"higher phase\\" of communism, but Lenin points to later remarks by Engels which suggest that Marx's \\"first phase\\" of communism typically equates with what people commonly think of as socialism. The Marxist definition of socialism is a mode of production where the sole criterion for production is use-value and therefore the law of value no longer directs economic activity. Marxist production for use is coordinated through conscious economic planning,E H Carr, The Bolshevik Revolution 2 (Penguin 1971) p. 15-6 while distribution of economic output is based on the principle of to each according to his contribution. The social relations of socialism are characterized by the working class effectively owning the means of production and the means of their livelihood, through one or a combination of cooperative enterprises, common ownership, or worker's self-management. Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels deliberately wrote very little on socialism, neglecting to provide any details on how it might be organized on the grounds that, until the new mode of production had itself emerged, all such theories would be merely Utopian: as Georges Sorel put it, ‚Äúto attempt to erect an ideological superstructure in advance of the conditions of production on which it must be built...would be un-Marxist‚Äù.Quoted in E H Carr, The Bolshevik Revolution 2 (Penguin 1971) p. 13 However, later in life, Marx pointed to the Paris Commune as the first example of a proletarian uprising and the model for a future socialist society organized into communes, observing: = Communist mode of production = Communism is the final mode of production, anticipated to arise inevitably from socialism due to historical forces. Marx did not speak in detail about the nature of a communist society, which he would describe interchangeably with the words socialism and communism. However, he did refer briefly in the Critique of the Gotha Programme to the full release of productive forces in \\"the highest phase of communist society [...] [when] society will be able to inscribe on its banner: 'From each according to his capacities, to each according to his needs'\\".Quoted in E H Carr, The Bolshevik Revolution 2 (Penguin 1971) p. 12  Articulation of modes of production  In any specific society or country, different modes of production might emerge and exist alongside each other, linked together economically through trade and mutual obligations. To these different modes correspond different social classes and strata in the population. For example, urban capitalist industry might co-exist with rural peasant production for subsistence and simple exchange and tribal hunting and gathering. Old and new modes of production might combine to form a hybrid economy. However, Marx's view was that the expansion of capitalist markets tended to dissolve and displace older ways of producing over time. A capitalist society was a society in which the capitalist mode of production had become the dominant one. The culture, laws and customs of that society might preserve many traditions of the preceding modes of production, thus although two countries might both be capitalist, being economically based mainly on private enterprise for profit and wage labour, these capitalisms might be very different in social character and functioning, reflecting very different cultures, religions, social rules and histories. Elaborating on this idea, Leon Trotsky famously described the economic development of the world as a process of uneven and combined development of different co-existing societies and modes of production which all influence each other. This means that historical changes which took centuries to occur in one country might be truncated, abbreviated or telescoped in another. Thus, for example, Trotsky observes in the opening chapter of his history of the Russian Revolution of 1917 that \\"[s]avages throw away their bows and arrows for rifles all at once, without travelling the road which lay between these two weapons in the past. The European colonists in America did not begin history all over again from the beginning\\". Thus, old and new techniques and cultures might combine in novel and unique admixtures, which cannot be understood other than by tracing out the history of their emergence.

The Gotland rabbit has official landrace status in Sweden and is considered an endangered variety, but is also being developed as a formal breed under the same name. The landrace is related to the even rarer Mellerud rabbit. History Rabbits have been held at farms in Sweden since at least the 1500s, though decreasing in popularity during the 1900s. These rabbits were referred to as \\"bondkaniner\\" (\\"farm rabbits\\") in as early as 1881Nordens Ark on Gotland rabbits (in Swedish) and were kept mainly for their meat and pelts. As a result of this, health, productivity and nursing instincts were considered more important that type and colour, which has traditionally been of higher importance in showing breeds. The Gotland rabbit has therefore managed to retain a large genetic diversity in terms of shape and colour, at the same time maintaining good health and few known genetic illnesses.Ericson, Maria. Gotlandskanin och Mellerudskanin, v√•ra svenska lantraser, F√§rgatlas F√∂reningen Gotlandskaninen, 2010 As show breeds gained popularity, the farm rabbits became rarer until all but extinct. A few remaining populations were discovered in the 1970s on the island of Gotland. As a formal breed The modern Gotland rabbit originates from these populations, the studbook having been closed since a breeding animal inventory was performed in 1993.>Swedish Gotland Rabbit Society (in Swedish) Despite the landrace's name, the type represented by the Gotland rabbit is not unique to the island of Gotland - rather, these rabbits represent the old type of farm rabbit once found all over Sweden. F√∂reningen Gotlandskaninen ('Gotland Rabbit Society') is responsible for the preservation work of the breed. Although many rabbits of unknown heritage may resemble a Gotland rabbit, only rabbits born after parents registered by F√∂reningen Gotlandskaninen are considered to be purebred Gotlands and may be registered as such. Registered rabbits are maintained in an official gene bank registry. 4 week old Gotland rabbits Appearance and personality Despite having never been bred towards a written breed standard until recent times, most Gotland rabbits share a distinctive and recognizable type. The variety is of medium size with an adult weight of 3‚Äì4 kg (6.6-8.8 lb). The body of the doe is relatively elongated with a fine head while the buck is usually somewhat more compact with a rounder head and thicker muzzle. There is no weight difference between the genders. The ears are of medium length and relatively thin, pointed rather than rounded. The eyes are somewhat large with an alert expression. Any eye colour is allowed. The coat is short and fine, usually straight although a few rex coated Gotlands have been known. Any pattern and colour is allowed. The temperament of the Gotland rabbit is described as lively and curious, with the rabbit often being very interested in its environment. The Gotland is a medium quality producer with an average of 6-8 kits per litter, more rarely 10 or more. The does are usually good mothers that can be very protective of their young. The kits grow relatively slowly compared to modern production breeds, but in return require less feed. The Gotland rabbit is considered a hardy variety that is rarely affected by disease or genetic defects.Herlitz, A. & Malmros, K.. F√∂reningen Gotlandskaninens Sk√∂tselr√•d f√∂r lantraskaniner Lilla Tryckeriet, Visby, 2012 Requirements Gotland rabbits are generally hardy and well adapted to living outdoors year round, provided they are protected against drafts and harsh sunlight. Gotland rabbit breeders strive to produce animals that can consist on natural types of feed, mainly a good quality hay, which may be replaced with fresh grass and other non-toxic plants during summertime. Traditional rabbit pellets may be too high in calories for landrace rabbits and should be viewed as an occasional treat or fed in only small quantities, rather than a staple. It is important that the rabbit always has access to fresh water.

History The official foundation of the association took place on 3 March 1956 under the name HC Chigny-Vufflens . All 18 founding members approved the statutes of the association. Without having an ice rink, the members initially trained on ponds or the ice rink Cheseaux in Saint-Cergue . In 1957, the club completed its first official game in the 3rd league (fifth division), which ended with a 6: 9 defeat. In 1961, a committee began to develop plans for an ice rink in Morges. The ice rink was finally realized under the name Patinoire des Eaux-Min√©rales , in the same year the club was renamed and henceforth as Forward Hockey Clubcontinued. The inauguration of the new home venue took place in December 1962. In the 1962‚Äì63 season, the Forward HC arrived on the rise playoffs of the third division in the relegation in which they beat La Chaux-de-Fonds III. In the following season the club succeeded in the march in the first division. In 1970, the club rose to the National League B, in the Forward Morges was active until relegation in 1978.

Design and development The full size Potez-CAMS 161 flying boat in front of the 160 In 1936 the northern French factories of Potez and of the seaplane maker CAMS, the latter owned by Potez since 1932, were nationalized along with those of Amiot, Breguet and ANF Mureaux into SNCAN. In the same year the design bureau of Potez-CAMS was beginning the development of the Potez-CAMS 161 six engine, trans-Atlantic passenger flying boat, intended to be a key component of Air France's Transatlantique fleet. To test the design they built a 5/13 scale flying scale model of it, careful not just to scale dimensions of the flying surfaces and hull, but also to copy the form the nose around the cabin, engine cowlings and retractable float housings. Control surface detail and the flaps of the 161, together with its variable-pitch propellers, were included on the resulting Potez-CAMS 160. It was intended to prove both the aerodynamic and hydrodynamic behaviour of the airliner. It flew for the first time on 20 June 1938. The 160 was a high-wing monoplane. The wing was a semi-cantilever structure, with two parallel bracing struts on each side from the lower fuselage to the wing just inside the central engines, straight-edged in plan with taper on the trailing edge only and rounded tips. It was fitted with interconnected Handley Page slots and ailerons as well as split flaps. It was powered by six four-cylinder inverted inline air-cooled Train 4T engines, each producing driving three blade, variable-pitch propellers. The engines were mounted on the wing underside, housed in long, narrow cowlings intended to mimic those around the Hispano-Suiza 12Ydrs water-cooled V-12 engines of the full scale aircraft. The little flying boat had a conventional stepped hull and was stabilized on the water by a pair of floats, attached under the outboard engines and retracting into their cowlings. Its enclosed, tandem seat cockpit was shaped to reproduced the form of the 161's nose, though the full sized aircraft had proportionally shorter glazing. The 161 had a twin fin empennage with a N-strut braced, parallel chord tailplane mounted on top of the fuselage on a short pillar with marked dihedral. The fins were of the endplate type, with curved leading edges and roughly symmetric above and below the tailplane; on each, the rudder was split into an upper and lower part. All of these features appeared on the final, full size airliner. The Potez-CAMS 160 appeared, after its first flight, at the 1938 Paris Aero Show. Specifications 3-views of the Potez-CAMS 160.

Overview Situated on a hillock south of Bangalore city in Vasantapura, the Vasantha Vallabharaya Temple, as history records it, belongs to the times of Rishi Mandavya, who, according to sthalapurana, is said to have built the shrine. According to sthalapurana, Bangalore in the ancient times was called Kalyanpuri and the small town Vasantapura, where, the Vasantha Vallabharaya shrine \\"devoted to Vishnu\\" is located, was a site in the midst of a jungle where holy sages meditated. With the passage of time, the greenery was gradually replaced by tilled land. It is said many tirthas (springs) lay on the dirt track that went to the temple site. Those tirthas were considered holy as Lord Vallabharaya, \\"another incarnation of Vishnu\\", bathed in them after his marriage to Goddess Lakshmi at Narayana Vana, close to Tirupathi. Today, the road to the temple is paved and only two springs called the Devatirtha and Vasantatirtha remain. Sadly, two of those tirthas were filled with soil for real estate work. It is also apparent that the temple area has suffered owing to the steady growth in the civic works. Considered to be erected during the Chola dynasty, the ancient temple history also carries the story of Rishi Mandavya's finding of a Svayambhu image of Vallabharaya at the site where the shrine presently sits.

The Mellerud rabbit has official landrace status in Sweden and is considered a critically endangered variety. History The Mellerud rabbit shares part of its history with the better-known Gotland rabbit. Both landraces originated from old lines of farm rabbits that were once common all over Sweden. These rabbits were referred to as bondkaniner ('farm-rabbits') in as early as 1881Nordens Ark on Gotland rabbits (in Swedish) and were kept mainly for their meat and pelts. In the 1900s farm rabbits disappeared from most parts of the country and were largely believed to be extinct. In the late 1990s, a few rabbits of the old farm type were discovered in the care of an older woman, referred to as \\"Edith i Sj√∂skogen\\", living in Mellerud. She has kept rabbits since at least 1937, though the line was believed to be older still. The only known outcrossing to another population had been done in 1968, when two black and white rabbits, one buck and one doe, were added to the group. The population had earlier consisted of 15-20 animals on average, decreasing to lower numbers in recent years. A total of 7 animals were acquired from Edith in the early 2000s, providing the foundation animals for a breeding project to preserve the line. The Mellerud rabbit received official landrace status by Jordbruksverket in 2011.Swedish Gotland Rabbit Society (in Swedish) F√∂reningen Gotlandskaninen ('Gotland Rabbit Society') is responsible for the preservation work of the Mellerud rabbit along with the Gotland rabbit. Registered rabbits are maintained in an official gene bank registry. As of 2013, approximately 160 registered Mellerud rabbits are registered with the Society and breeders aim to produce a higher number of animals to ensure high genetic diversity. Appearance and personality The Mellerud rabbit is similar to the Gotland rabbit in terms of conformation. It is a medium-sized rabbit with an adult weight of 3‚Äì3.5 kg (6.6-7.7 lbs). The body of the doe is relatively elongated with a fine head while the buck is usually somewhat more compact with a rounder head and thicker muzzle. There is no weight difference between the genders. The ears are of medium length and relatively thin, pointed rather than rounded. The eyes are somewhat large with an alert expression. The eyes are brown, blue or a mixture of the two. The coat is short and fine. The colour is either albino or black with white spotting, referred to as Dutch markings. Because breeders have never strived to standardise the markings in the variety, there is a higher degree of variation in the white markings than in most traditional show breeds. Most Melleruds exhibit white muzzles, blazes to varying degrees, white front of chest and white frontpaws. The white may also extend to and include the sides of the face, the shoulders, the back and/or the hind legs.Ericson, Maria. Gotlandskanin och Mellerudskanin, v√•ra svenska lantraser, F√§rgatlas F√∂reningen Gotlandskaninen, 2010 The temperament of the Mellered rabbit is described as lively and curious. The Mellerud is often considered to be somewhat calmer than the Gotland rabbit, and also tends to produce somewhat smaller litters on average. The kits grow relatively slowly compared to modern production breeds, but in return require less feed. The landrace is considered hardy and few genetic defects are known. Requirements Mellerud rabbits are generally hardy and well adapted to living outdoors year round, provided they are protected against drafts and harsh sunlight.Herlitz, A. & Malmros, K. F√∂reningen Gotlandskaninens Sk√∂tselr√•d f√∂r lantraskaniner Lilla Tryckeriet, Visby, 2012 Mellerud rabbit breeders strive to produce animals that can consist on natural types of feed, mainly a good quality hay, which may be replaced with fresh grass and other non-toxic plants during summertime. Traditional rabbit pellets may be too high in calories for landrace rabbits and should be viewed as an occasional treat or fed in only small quantities, rather than a staple. It is important that the rabbit always has access to fresh water.

Each woman carries a pot of cooked rice or soup. The wunkirle either distributes to the food to the guests, or more frequently uses her ladle to indicate the distribution. At some feasts the wurkirlone of a village compete with each other in generosity by distributing small gifts of peanuts, candy, coins and other foods. The women dance at these times. The wunkirle's prestige may be indicated by her being carried in a hammock through the village by the women of her quarter. They also contribute gifts of their own, but always in the name of the wurkirle.\\" Besides acting as \\"emblems of honor,\\" feast ladles have spiritual power. According to the Dan, the ladles embody du and contain the power of the wunkirle. The wunkirmiam is for the woman what the masks are for the men; wunkirmiam are the woman's chief liaison with the power of the spirit world and the symbol of that connection. Like masks, each wunkirmian is given its own name. The most common form of the wunkirmian has a handle carved as a human head that displays the characteristic of the buangle mask: narrow eyes and an oval face. The face on the ladle depicts a specific woman. Carved wooden heads on pedestals or staffs Janus-faced heads on a staff are reported to be carried by certain masked performers. The two faces looking in opposite directions symbolize the supernatural ability of the gle to see in all directions. Like feast ladles, these heads are considered powerful spiritual objects that act as receptacles for du. Some are created as portraits of deceased family members that embody that person's spirit. Brass Casting Brooklyn Museum 22.212 Male Nude Holding Knife and Horn.jpgMale Nude Holding Knife and Horn, Brooklyn Museum Bracelets de cheville. Culture Dan.jpgAnkle bracelets MHNT It is difficult to determine the antiquity of brass casting among the Dan, but it is clear that the practice began at least in the early 19th century if not much earlier. Some scholars believe that the We people to the East may have introduced the practice to the Dan. Brass casting was a practice of Dan blacksmiths. In Dan communities, the blacksmith was always awarded a high status because he was responsible for agricultural tools and weapons. Brass- casting took place at night to protect the object from onlookers. Brass- casters created brass objects using the cire-perdue, or lost wax method. By the late 1930s, a Liberian government decree outlawing all brass jewelry resulted in an abundance of brass, which brass-casters used to figurative sculptures. Typically, figures stand at about 8 inches tall and carry objects of cultural importance in their hands. The figures were made principally as prestige items.

It is approximately long and flows through Madison Township in Columbia County and West Hemlock Township, Derry Township, Valley Township, Mahoning Township, and Danville in Montour County. The watershed of the creek has an area of . Its tributaries include Kase Run, Mauses Creek, and Sechler Run. Mahoning Creek is designated as a Trout-Stocking Fishery and a Migratory Fishery for part of its length and as a Warmwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery for the remainder. Mahoning Creek is considered by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection to be impaired by siltation. The main rock formations in the watershed include the Trimmers Rock Formation, the Clinton Group, the Catskill Formation, the Hamilton Group, the Bloomsburg and Mifflintown Formation, the Onondaga and Old Port Formation, and the Wills Creek Formation. The main soils include the Berks-Weikert-Alvira series, the Chenango-Pope-Holly series, the Clymer- Buchanan-Norwich series, and the Leck Kill-Meckesville-Calvin series. Most of the watershed is forested or agricultural land, but there is some developed land. There was historically a village of the Delaware tribe near the mouth of Mahoning Creek. The first people of European descent arrived in the area in the 1760s and 1770s. Various mills were constructed on it in the 1700s and 1800s. Numerous bridges have also been constructed across the creek. Part of the creek is in the Montour Ridge Landscape Corridor.  Course  Mahoning Creek near West Mahoning Street in Danville Mahoning Creek begins in a valley in Madison Township, Columbia County. It flows south for a short distance before turning west-southwest for several tenths of a mile, exiting Columbia County. Upon exiting Columbia County, Mahoning Creek enters West Hemlock Township, Montour County. It flows south-southwest alongside Pennsylvania Route 642 for a few miles before crossing Pennsylvania Route 642 and entering Derry Township. The creek then turns south for a few miles and enters Valley Township. In Valley Township, it continues flowing south in its valley and crosses Pennsylvania Route 642 before continuing south. The creek eventually enters a much broader valley and flows away from Pennsylvania Route 642. After several tenths of a mile, it crosses Interstate 80 and receives Kase Run, its first named tributary, from the left. The creek then meanders west for several tenths of a mile and then turns southwest, flowing alongside Pennsylvania Route 642 again. Not far from Mausdale, Mahoning Creek crosses Pennsylvania Route 642 and Pennsylvania Route 54 and receives the tributary Mauses Creek from the right. The creek then turns southeast and begins flowing alongside Pennsylvania Route 54 into Mahoning Township and through a water gap in Montour Ridge. It enters Danville and leaves behind the water gap, turning south-southwest and crossing US Route 11. After a few tenths of a mile, the creek receives Sechler Run, its last named tributary, from the left, and turns west-northwest. After several tenths of a mile, it exits Danville and enters Mahoning Township briefly before turning sharply southeast and reentering Danville. After a short distance, the creek reaches its confluence with the Susquehanna River. Mahoning Creek joins the Susquehanna River upstream of its mouth. = Tributaries = Mahoning Creek has three named tributaries, which are known as Kase Run, Mauses Creek, and Sechler Run. The creek also has a number of unnamed tributaries.

The watershed of the tributary Sechler Run has an area of . The tributary Mauses Creek joins Mahoning Creek upstream of its mouth and has a watershed area of . The tributary Kase Run reaches its confluence with the creek upstream of its mouth. Its watershed has an area of . Hydrology The daily sediment load in Mahoning Creek is and daily load of phosphorus is . The total maximum daily loads for these substances are and , respectively. There is significant stormwater flow and sedimentation in Mahoning Creek, as well as agricultural and urban runoff. However, the creek is less environmentally damaged than the nearby Chillisquaque Creek. Mahoning Creek is considered by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection to be impaired downstream of Kase Run, part of which is also impaired. Additionally, the tributary Mauses Creek is considered to be impaired, as are the upper reaches of the tributary Sechler Run. The cause of the impairment of Mahoning Creek is siltation and the source is agriculture and urban runoff/storm sewers. Sections of all three of its named tributaries are impaired, with the cause being siltation and the source being agriculture.

Geology and geography  Montour Ridge, which Mahoning Creek cuts through The elevation near the mouth of Mahoning Creek is above sea level. The elevation near the source of the creek is between above sea level. The highest parts of the watershed are in its eastern section. The watershed of Mahoning Creek is in the ridge and valley physiographic region's Appalachian Mountain Section. In the upland parts of the watershed of Mahoning Creek, 95 percent of the rock is sedimentary rock, mainly of the Trimmers Rock Formation, the Clinton Group, the Catskill Formation, the Hamilton Group, the Bloomsburg and Mifflintown Formation, the Onondaga and Old Port Formation, and the Wills Creek Formation. The Catskill Formation occurs in a large area in the northeastern part of the watershed and the Trimmers Rock Formation occurs in the rest of the northern part of the watershed and in the southernmost part of the watershed. The Hamilton Group is to the south of the northern area of the Trimmers Rock Formation and to the north of the southern area of the formation. The Onondaga and Old Port Formation occurs south of the Hamilton Group and near Sechler Run, as does the Keyser and Tonoloway Formation. The Wills Creek Formation is found in the central part of the watershed, as is the Bloomsburg and Mifflintown Formation. The Clinton Group occurs south of these formations and south of the Clinton Group is more of the aforementioned formations. 50 percent of the rock in the Mahoning Creek watershed is of the Trimmers Rock Formation, 15 percent is of the Clinton Group, and 10 percent is of the Hamilton Group. The Bloomsburg and Mifflintown Formation occupies 8 percent of the watershed. The Keyser and Tonoloway Formation, the Wills Creek Formation, and the Catskill Formation each occupy 5 percent, while the Onondaga and Old Port Formation makes up 2 percent. The most common soil series in the watershed of Mahoning Creek is the Berks-Weikert-Alvira series, a shaly silt loam. Other soil series in the watershed include the Chenango-Pope-Holly series, the Clymer-Buchanan-Norwich series, and the Leck Kill-Meckesville-Calvin series. The Chenango-Pope-Holly series is found in the lower reaches of the watershed, the Leck Kill- Minersville-Calvin series is found in the northwestern part of it, and the Clymer-Buchanan-Norwich series occurs in the southwestern part of the watershed. All other parts of it are occupied by the Berks-Weikert-Alvira series. The Berks-Weikert-Alvira makes up 90 percent of the soil in the Mahoning Creek watershed. 5 percent is of the Leck Kill-Meckesville-Calvin series, 3 percent is of the Clymer-Buchanan-Norwich, and 2 percent is of the Chenango-Pope-Holly series. Mahoning Creek cuts through Montour Ridge. It has a forested floodplain in Mahoning Township. Parts of the creek experience stream bank erosion.  Watershed  Mahoning Creek downstream of Kase Run The watershed of Mahoning Creek has an area of . It primarily drains the central portion of Montour County and is almost entirely in Montour County. However, a small portion of the creek's watershed lies in the neighboring Columbia County. The watershed makes up 30 percent of the area of Montour County. Mahoning Creek drains the area in the vicinity of Danville. The mouth of the creek is in the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Riverside. However, its source is in the quadrangle of Millville. It also passes through the quadrangle of Danville. 47.15 percent of the watershed of Mahoning Creek consists of forested land. 36.47 percent of the watershed is agricultural land and 16.38 percent is developed land. Most of the developed land is classified as \\"low-intensity development\\", but some is classified as \\"high-intensity development\\". There are 7.4 acres of wetlands in the watershed. Much of the land near the mouth of Mahoning Creek is developed. A strip of land crossing the watershed in its central section is also developed. The southernmost part of the watershed is largely agricultural land. North of this is an area of mostly forested land and the central part of the watershed is mostly agricultural land. The northern part includes both forested and agricultural land. The fastest development in Montour County is occurring in the watershed of the creek. Interstate 80 runs in an east-west direction through the watershed of Mahoning Creek. There are also a number of township roads near the creek and its tributaries. Pennsylvania Route 54, Pennsylvania Route 642, and US Route 11 are in the watershed as well.  History and etymology  Mahoning Creek was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2, 1979. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1192876. The word \\"mahoning\\" is a Native American word for \\"at the lick\\". There used to be a village of Delaware Indians at the mouth of Mahoning Creek. One of the first buildings in Danville, a gristmill built by George Montgomery's father, was built on Mahoning Creek. A tract of 180 acres in Danville, including an area along the creek, was once owned by the Penn family. Phillip Maus was among the first settlers in Valley Township, Montour County, having settled there in 1769. In 1772, Robert Curry settled on Mahoning Creek and was one of the first settlers in that part of Pennsylvania. The first woolen mill in Danville was built on Mahoning Creek. An agricultural fair was held on the creek in February 1856. Phillip Maus once built a sawmill on Mahoning Creek. This sawmill contributed significantly to the construction of numerous wooden buildings in the vicinity. Numerous bridges have been constructed over Mahoning Creek. A concrete tee beam bridge with a length of was constructed in 1930 and repaired in 1971. A two-span prestressed box beam or girders bridge with a length of was constructed over the creek in 1955 and repaired in 1988. Two bridge of the same type, but with one span and lengths of was built across the creek in 1963. These bridges carry Interstate 80. A bridge of the same type was constructed over the creek in 1971 with a length of and was repaired in 2008. Three more bridges of that type were constructed in Danville in 1974. They are , , and in length. Another prestressed box beam or girders bridge was constructed across the creek in 1994 with a length of . In 1995, a prestressed slab bridge with a length of was built over the creek. In the same year, a prestressed box beam or girders bridge with a length of was constructed over the creek. Mahoning Creek has a watershed association, which is known as the Mahoning Creek Watershed Association. It is one of two active watershed associations in Montour County. The association has carried out watershed assessments and water quality measurements of the creek. They have also worked on a watershed restoration plan.  Biology  Mahoning Creek is a Trout-Stocked Fishery and a Migratory Fishery from its source to the Pennsylvania Route 54 bridge. From that point to its mouth, it is a Warmwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. However, the tributaries Sechler Run, Mauses Creek, and Kase Run are Coldwater Fisheries and Migratory Fisheries, as are the unnamed tributaries of Mahoning Creek. Part of Mahoning Creek, its floodplain, and the nearby slopes are part of the Montour Ridge Landscape Corridor. Wild trout naturally reproduce in Mahoning Creek from its headwaters downstream to the US Route 11 bridge, a distance of . It is one of only two such streams in Montour County, the other being West Branch Chillisquaque Creek. In the 1820s, there were large shad, salmon and rockfish to be found in the creek's waters. These species of fish could weigh up to 7, 15, and 30 pounds (3.2, 6.8, and 13.6 kilograms), respectively. Eight species of birds inhabit the floodplains and slopes near Mahoning Creek. These include scarlet tanagers, black-throated green warblers, belted kingfishers, gray catbirds, black-capped chickadees, eastern wood-peewees, Louisiana waterthrushes, and wood thrushes. Mahoning Creek lacks a riparian buffer in some places. However, the Mahoning Creek floodplain and the nearby slopes are listed as a Locally Significant site on the Montour County Natural Areas Inventory. Eastern hemlock trees inhabit the slopes and river birch, silver maple, and silky dogwood inhabit the floodplain itself. American basswood also grows in the vicinity of the creek here. Additionally, spring wildflowers grow in this area. The site has a high level of plant biodiversity. However, many trees in the area are affected by an aphid species known as the hemlock wooly adelgid. Five species of shrubs grow in the vicinity of Mahoning Creek, its floodplain, and the nearby slopes: smooth alder, silky dogwood, gray dogwood, spicebush, and American elderberry. 11 herb species also grow in this location. These include skunk cabbage, bloodroot, sensitive fern, sedge, wood anemone, woolgrass, and others. There are also invasive plants such as multiflora rose, Japanese knotweed, and garlic mustard in the area.

They have a variety of special schools and vocational centres along with at-home education for young people with complex difficulties. They help to educate young people who present emotional and behavioural challenges, those with more complex needs including autism, and for young people who have experienced abuse. Ages range between 6‚Äì19 years. SACCS Sexual Abuse Child Consultancy Services (SACCS) is part of the residential care provision for children. SACCS assists abused children through therapy. One aim of SACCS is to suggest the idea that a lot of children and young people in care today are fostered, but for those who have suffered severe trauma this may be increasing problems and leading to fostering breakdown and multiple moves. They wish to help children come to terms with their experiences by addressing the conflict between the child‚Äôs chronological and emotional ages and by working at the child‚Äôs pace. For SACCS, recovery means 'when the child has internalized their attachments and consolidated their emotional development to a point where these can be successfully transferred to other environments and relationships.

Guests are not lacking to introduce themselves and talk about their upcoming productions, after which they traditionally have the number that follows. The artists who make the numbers come from around the world. At the end of the show, Patrick S√©bastien traditionally sings one of his songs, surrounded by dancers from the Moulin Rouge and in the presence of all the artists who performed that evening.

Ryerson Distinguished Service Professor of Theological Ethics at the University of Chicago. His research focuses on globalization as an ethical problem, hermeneutic philosophy, theological humanism, the history of ethics, and comparative religious ethics.  Biography  Schweiker was born on December 29, 1953, in Des Moines, Iowa. He earned his B.A. from Simpson College in 1976, his M. Div. from Duke Divinity School in 1980, and his PhD from the University of Chicago Divinity School in 1985. After graduating, he accepted an assistant professorship in theology and ethics at the University of Iowa. In 1989, he returned to the University of Chicago as assistant professor, was made full professor in 2000, and appointed the Edward L. Ryerson Distinguished Service Professor of Theological Ethics in 2007. That year, he also became director of the Martin Marty Center for the Advanced Study of Religion at the University of Chicago Divinity School. He has been guest professor at Uppsala University, where he received an honorary doctorate, and Mercator Professor at the University of Heidelberg, and lectured in China, South Korea, and South Africa. In 2015/16 Schweiker served as president of the Society of Christian Ethics. Professor Schweiker is an ordained minister in the United Methodist Church and is Theologian in Residence at the First United Methodist Church at the Chicago Temple.  Academic work  Schweiker's scholarship focuses on the ways in which humanity is vulnerable to new powers in contemporary times and the responsibility these powers and vulnerabilities generate for human agents. His work crosses the disciplinary lines of ethics, systematic theology, and hermeneutic philosophy. He has been recognized as a leader in the development of ‚ÄúTheological Humanism‚Äù and is the author of numerous books, with translations into Korean, Chinese, and essays in German. His Theological Ethics and Global Dynamics: In the Time of Many Worlds (2004) was nominated for the prestigious Grawemeyer Award in religion (2005). In this text, Schweiker describes the cultural dynamics of a globalizing world, which he insists are ‚Äúintrinsically bound to the representational, evaluative, and so motivational forces working on and in‚Äù human agents. As such, 'globality' presents us with a new a moral space, a new depiction of moral reality that requires us to rethink human power and our relationship with the nonhuman world without undermining human dignity and moral responsibility. Schweiker is editor of the Blackwell Companion to Religious Ethics, a collection of essays written by internationally renowned scholars of religion. In the introduction, Schweiker describes the volume as a companion meant to \\"aid in understanding and addressing the moral beliefs, value, and practices of the world‚Äôs religions.‚Äù He is also co-editor (with of David A Clarimont, Maria Antonaccio, and Elizabeth Bucar) of the \\"Encyclopedia of Religious Ethics,\\" which is currently in press with Wiley-Blackwell Publishers. Schweiker's scholarship in recent years has remained attentive to the theological and ethical questions related to global dynamics, comparative ethics, the possibilities of a renewed and robust religious humanism, and the ethics of responsibility concerned with the respecting and enhancing the integrity of life. He is a frequent lecturer and visiting professor at universities around the world and has been involved in several collaborative international projects. This includes his role as principle investigator (together with G√ºnter Thomas, Ruhr-University Bochum) of the \\"Enhancing Life Project\\", an interdisciplinary research project that brought together scholars from Germany, Iraq, Israel, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, and the USA together to discuss and study the essential aspirations of human beings and the expansion of human power in contemporary times. The project was supported by a generous grant from the Templeton Foundation.

The intention is that it would be funded by private investors and backed by the Welsh Government. In April 2016, BBC News reported that The Heads of the Valleys Development Company,Companies House (UK Government website) Retrieved 26 August 2017 would continue to negotiate with both the financial backers, Aviva, and the Welsh Government. The circuit is being designed to FIA and FIM standards with the aim of hosting events such as the MotoGP, Superbike World Championship, Motocross World Championship, British GT Championship, British Touring Car Championship and the World Touring Car Championship. Ken Skates, AM and Economy Secretary, issued a statement on 29 March 2017 that detailed reports had been requested and the decision concerning ¬£425M public funding would be available by mid-May.Circuit of Wales: Motor track decision expected mid-May, BBC News, Wales Politics on 29 March 2017. Retrieved 30 March 2017 In June 2017, a proposed taxpayer-funded guarantee of ¬£210million was rejected by the Welsh Government on the grounds that the financial risk was too great. The original planned opening had been 2016. In September 2018, an application to renew the expired planning consent was submitted to Blaenau Gwent County Borough Council. Proposal history The project was unveiled towards the end of 2011. After submitting plans to Blaenau Gwent County Borough Council, the circuit received unanimous approval of its outline planning and was given the go ahead to begin development in early July 2013, amidst opposition from groups including Gwent Wildlife Trust, Brecon Beacons National Park, Natural Resources Wales and the Association of Motor Racing Circuit Owners. However, by the end of July, the Welsh Government put the plans on hold whilst it reviewed the planning application. The Welsh Government indicated in August 2013 that the local council would take decisions concerning the project. In 2014, the developers asked the Welsh and UK governments to commit up to ¬£50m towards the scheme. While the developers believe that 6,000 jobs could be created, there are wider objections on environmental grounds. In July 2014, Alun Davies, Blaenau Gwent AM was found to have broken the Ministerial Code through lobbying Natural Resources Wales in favour of the racetrack.

Congestion at peak times on the Neath to Abergavenny Trunk Road would need to be resolved. In April 2016, departing Welsh Economy Minister Edwina Hart confirmed that the Welsh Government could not provide the required 100% guarantee to back construction of the circuit. Insurance company Aviva had stated that it could not guarantee even 20% of the ¬£357M package, and hence the Welsh Government had been forced to state its position.Minister 'cannot underwrite ¬£357m Circuit of Wales track' BBC News Wales, 6 April 2016, Retrieved 8 April 2016 Hart said there was a \\"significant question around the viability of the project\\" and hence was an \\"unacceptable risk\\" to the government underwriting the entire project, and therefore she had \\"reluctantly come to the conclusion\\" not to proceed with the guarantee after legal advice. Michael Carrick, CEO of Heads of The Valleys Development Company, said negotiations with the Welsh Government and Aviva would continue. In June 2017 a proposed taxpayer-funded guarantee of ¬£210million was rejected by the Welsh Government on the grounds that the financial risk was too great. Instead, ministers announced that ¬£100million would be spent on an automotive business park. Michael Carrick responded by saying that they were keen to continue with the project, understand the reasons it was not supported, and address them.

The time can vary, usually a duration is set from several minutes to a few hours. Unlike sketches, speed paintings may be considered \\"finished\\" after the time limit is up. Speed painting is particularly common among digital media artists, because digital painting mediums allow for a work to circumvent drying times of traditional media. Digital media artists primarily use speed painting to practice working quickly and efficiently. Speed painting techniques are also frequently used in concept art, particularly in the early stages of a production when the polish of an individual image matters less than a clear basic presentation of many candidate concepts for consideration. Traditional media artists also use limited-time pieces as a challenge of skill, and an exercise in not over thinking their work. Speedpainted pieces both digital and traditional are considered by artists to be an excellent exhibition of the subjective skill of a painter, as the time constraint requires efficient rendering of form and detail and a deep understanding of their chosen medium to capture a complete, strong image, and leaves little time for noticing and correcting mistakes. Denny Dent is recognized by many to be the pioneer of speed painting in the United States, introducing speed painting in live performances in 1981.

The ensuing panic affected gold markets and stock. China's regulation of the foreign exchange market had caused a decline in inflow of cash. On 19 June 2013, instead of injecting additional funds and easing its monetary policy, China's central bank People's Bank of China (PBOC) told commercial banks to \\"make full use of incremental funds and revitalize stock options.\\" On 24 June 2014 the PBOC told commercial banks to \\"control the risk associated with credit expansion\\" effectively increasing the scrutiny of shadow banks' lending practices. This resulted in a sudden shortfall in the cash market resulting in short term repo rates in excess of 25%. In effect China was using market forces to manage the economy.  Context  China's 2008 monetary stimulus package contributed to China's subsequent economic boom. By 2011 China's local government debts was already under scrutiny from national regulators. There were concerns even that the \\"massive, shady trade\\" in over-the-counter credit could place China's financial security and social stability, at risk. By 2011 half of the loans in China were in shadow banking with no regulatory scrutiny. In March 2013 Li Keqiang, an economist by training, was elected as Premier. In 2010 Li Keqiang had called for a global governance structure that was \\"more reflective of the changes in the global political and economic landscape.\\" By 2013 China was concerned about shadow banking, which includes hedge fund, private financing, trust loans, private funds and other non-bank financial institutions. A Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Research report published in January 2014 cautioned that \\"local government financing vehicles and shadow banking\\" remained a concern and if not addressed could lead to costly defaults.  Market Reaction  Following PBOC intervention in June 2013, the loss of liquidity from shadow banks caused the blue-chip Shanghai Composite Index (CSI300) to plummet 5.3% the largest daily decline in nearly 4 years. As result, the credit rating agency Moody's issued a warning on Chinese and Hong Kong debt obligations.  PBOC Reaction  Following the market's reaction, the PBOC refused to inject additional funds to cover the liquidity shortfall implying a dramatic policy change from rapid growth to quality growth. Analysts predict the sudden tightening of lending rates served as a warning to overzealous banks to control their lending practices.

The BX convoys were a World War II series of convoys across the Gulf of Maine from Boston to HalifaX. These convoys were escorted by the Western Local Escort Force (WLEF) of the Royal Canadian Navy to protect coastal shipping in transit between North American loading ports and trans- Atlantic convoy assembly points in Nova Scotia. Background Allied war materials had been transported from North America to the United Kingdom in HX convoys since 1939 and in slower SC convoys since 1940. These convoys were escorted by the Royal Navy and Royal Canadian Navy. The United States Navy provided a few escorts to HX and SC convoys beginning in September 1941. Declaration of war on 8 December 1941 removed United States neutrality assertions which had previously protected trade shipping in the Western Atlantic. Although the United States was slow to convoy coastal shipping, the Royal Canadian Navy established the WLEF in February 1942. Loaded ships eastbound WLEF escorted the first BX convoy from Saint John, New Brunswick, on 21 March 1942 and reached Halifax the following day. Ten of the first twelve BX convoys originated in Saint John. BX 4 was the first convoy originating in Boston on 3 April 1942, and BX 8 sailed from Boston on 18 April. BX 13 was the first convoy of the series to sail in multiple sections. The main convoy of eleven merchant ships left Boston on 3 May, and two ships left Saint John as convoy BX 13A on 5 May. BX 14 was the first of the series to sail from Portland, Maine, on 7 May. These early WLEF convoys sailed with as few as a single ship as the United States struggled to efficiently control sailing dates. BX 20 on 24 May was the first to include more than eleven ships. June convoys sailed in two sections with a main convoy like BX 25 with 43 ships leaving Boston on 17 June and a smaller convoy of seven ships leaving Boston two days later as BX 25B. The Mystic Steamship Company's collier was grounded and sank in the Cape Cod Canal on June 28, 1942. Temporary closure of the canal interrupted the flow of coastal shipping from Long Island Sound. Thirty-two ships of BX 27 left Buzzards Bay on 2 July, 15 ships of BX 27B left Boston on 3 July, BX 27C left Newport, Rhode Island on 4 July, four ships of BX 27D left Boston on 2 July, 2 ships of BX 27E left Portland on 1 July, and BX 27J left Saint John on 1 July. In the confusion, of BX 27 was torpedoed by on July 3 as the first loss from a BX convoy. The canal reopened on July 31, after the wrecked Stephen R. Jones was removed with the help of 17 tons of dynamite. Five ships sailed from Saint John as convoy BX 28F on 8 July, followed by 48 ships from Boston on 9 July as BX 28, 8 ships from Boston on 10 July as BX 28B, and 3 ships from Boston on 11 July as BX 28C. This four- section pattern of one Bay of Fundy section and three Boston sections continued until the BX convoy series was temporarily suspended on 11 September 1942 by shifting assembly of HX convoys from Halifax to New York City. The series resumed with convoy BX 38 from Boston on 25 March 1943 when the assembly point for SC convoys shifted from New York City to Sydney, Nova Scotia. For the remainder of the war, single-section BX convoys sailed at intervals of four to ten days collecting shipping from Gulf of Maine ports destined for SC convoys. Approximately 8 percent of the ships traveling in SC convoys loaded in the Gulf of Maine, including explosives loaded at Searsport, Maine. The most damaging attack on a BX convoy was made by on 14 January 1945. Convoy BX 141 was within visual range of Chebucto Head, Nova Scotia when Kapit√§n zur See Kurt Dobratz torpedoed the 6985-ton British tanker British Freedom at 1035, the 7176-ton American Liberty ship Martin van Buren at 1041, and the 8779-ton British tanker Athelviking at 1052. The two tankers sank, and the Liberty ship was destroyed by the surf after grounding. U-1232 managed to survive ramming by the and escaped in difficult ASDIC conditions off Halifax. Canadian warships of the WLEF escorted a total of 3464 ships across the Gulf of Maine in 206 BX convoys until convoy BX 164 made the last departure from Boston on 22 May 1945. Westbound shipping Ships traveling westbound (often empty) on similar routes were designated XB convoys. A total of 2194 ships crossed the Gulf of Maine westbound in 196 XB convoys.

The Squadron is commanded by 32 Engineer Regiment and provides close support engineering to the 4th Infantry Brigade. It is located in Marne Barracks, Catterick and has a long history. History 37 Armoured Engineer Squadron History 1861-2010 by Lt CL Curle 37 Field Squadron can trace its history back spanning three centuries to its original formation as the 37th Depot Company RE at Chatham on 1 April 1861. In the years that lead up to the present day Sappers and Officers of 37 have fought in almost every war that the British Army has been engaged in. They have deployed in Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia and the Middle East. =The Boer War= The 37th Depot Company RE remained so until 1885 where its name changed to ‚ÄòD‚Äô Depot Company RE and the number 37 was filled up by a service company. A new 37th Field Company RE formed in Aldershot in 1887 and served in the Curragh 1890-92, Shorncliffe 1892-94, Aldershot 1895-97, and Shorncliffe again from 1897-99. The Boers declared war in October 1899, and in November the 37th Field Company attached to the 5th Infantry Division embarked to the Cape. They were commanded by Captain W. A. Cairns and landed in Natal on 23 December 1899. With bolstered forces, in January 1900, Sir Redvers decided to attempt to take Ladysmith, outflanking the Boers by crossing the Tugela in the vicinity of Potgieter's Drift. Two divisions were detailed for this and the 37th Field Company were attached to the second. The 37th established a ferry at Potgieer's Drift, by means of which part of the Second Division crossed to the north side of the Tugela, ready to flank Ladysmith. The 37th then turned their skills to blasting and building a road up the south side of Zwaartkop, a high hill to the south-east of Potgieter's Drift, overlooking Skiet's Drift. It was up this road on 2 February that the 37th helped haul two naval 12-prs guns to the top and carried the ammunition up by hand. Col. Irvine of A Pontoon Troop noted that ‚Äú[t]he road up the hill was a very difficult one, and for 100 or 150 yards seemed almost impossible, as it went straight up the face of the kop at an angle of about thirty degrees.‚Äù Their next tasking was digging the ramp on the south bank of a crossing near to Munger's Drift, which would open a road across the plain to Ladysmith. The entire time the men worked, the bridge was under enemy fire, but they were unable to move into cover and instead continued to dig. There was a delay from the bridge being completed to the Brigade crossing and in this interval the intensity of the fire increased. Irvine wrote that they ‚Äúhad to lie down when we heard it begin, and in a second or two the bullets would cut the water just in front of us from the bank to bank with a horrible hiss.‚Äù The bridge remained intact throughout the contact, however there were four casualties from the 37th Field Company, all shot on the bank whilst continuing digging. Of these, one man dies from his wounds. This is the first documented fatality of a member of the 37th since it was formed. Unfortunately at the time detailed records were not kept of sappers killed in action and whilst his name almost certainly can be found on the South African Memorial Arch (Boer War) in Chatham which name is his is still not known. For the rest of the campaign, the 37th Field Company continued to be deployed on tasks with the Fifth Infantry Division, mainly building ramps for pontoons, dismantling bridges to be reused, or building roads for naval guns to be moved along. By 4 July 1891 they were halted at Volksrust having crossed the Drakensbergand were employed in constructing defences, and in repairing the railway line to Standerton. The war ended with the signing of the Treaty of Vereeniging on 31 May 1902 and the larger part of the Regimental units returned to England. By January 1903, 37th Field Company was one of only a few units stationed in South Africa. It finally returned in 1905, its new home Stobs Camp, Roxburghshire in Scotland from 1905-1906. In 1907 many alterations were made to the Corps of Royal Engineers to bring it into line with the new organisation of the Army for service abroad and the 37th Field Company was disbanded. =1915-1919= 37th Fortress Company was raised at Queenstown, Ireland in 1915 from half of 14 Survey Company, and later that same year changed to 37th Army Troops Company at Gallipoli. There is little written on the exact role that 37 had during this time. Three sections served on the island of Imbros, an island used mainly for water supply for Helles and ANZAC and as a rest camp; there was also a small advanced workshop for the beaches. There are discrepancies between different accounts as to where the main body was deployed, however the history of the Corps of Royal Engineers states that it was in Helles, where much of the engineering assets were involved in extending the trench systems or building and repairing piers. The unit moved to Salonika in January 1916 under the command of Capt. C.B. Ede as a Base Unit. Again, little is known of its exact role, however most engineering tasks were centred around the construction of roads through the mountainous country, involving blasting through hillsides and constructing culverts and bridges over dry gaps that would turn to mountain torrents after every rainfall. In September 1916 it worked with the 140th Army Troop and 95th Labour companies to make a road suitable for lorries that ran through Dorjan town and the battle belt to enable the attack upon Signal Allemand. The work was completed by the 23rd, when the first lorry travelled the route. The 37th Army Troop Company ended its time in Egypt and was once again disbanded in 1919. =1950s= In 1948 in Ripon, Yorkshire, 37 Field Squadron was formed as part of 24 field Engineer Regiment, moving to Hong Kong from 1949-1950. The proclamation of the Communist Chinese People's Republic made a Red Army invasion likely and 37 Squadron was deployed with 40 Infantry Division to help secure the border. The types of tasks they would have been involved in where repairing mine fields and enhancing wire obstacles, constructing gun emplacements, command posts and observation posts all along the northern border, a 12-mile water pipeline, an All-weather road linking the villages of Tsun Wan and Sek Kong, and camps were also constructed, though it is not clear if 37 field Squadron had direct involvement in all of these tasks. In 1950 the Squadron was re-designated as 56 Field squadron. A new 37 Field Squadron formed, and it is from this unit that the present 37 Armoured Engineer Squadron evolved, with no further disbandments. Major Westlake RE took command of 37 Field Squadron in November 1950 at Invictor Lines, Maidstone. Initially they were a holding unit as new troops were posted into 25 Field Engineer Regiment operating from what was later to become the RHQ in Invictor Lines, but by December 1950 the Regiment was complete and the Squadron moved into its permanent offices in the lines. Training around the Maidston area ensued, and in March 1951 the Squadron took part in a Brigade Exercise at Thetford. Maj B.A.E Maude MBE RE took command of the Squadron in August 1951. Having completed the divisional Exercise, Ex. SURPRISE PACKET on Salisbury Plane, the Squadron returned with news of their imminent departure for the Suez Canal Zone. On 26 October 1951, 37 Field Squadron emplaned at Lyneham Aerodrome for Tripoli, then onto Benghazi. A short break for Christmas was enjoyed with the 16/5 Lancers before a road move to Tobruck on 28 December 1951. Here they took to the seas on the \\"Empire Comfort\\" to rejoin their Regiment in Dhekelia, Cyprus. Initially 37 Field Squadron deployed to Libya as replacement for 22 Regiment. In April 1952 the Squadron, along with the rest of 25 Regiment, moved to the Suez Canal Zone, Egypt to be stationed at Moascar. These were times when the security of the Canal was considered essential to UK interests, but when there was growing opposition from Egyptian nationalists whose paramilitary groups carried out frequent and often grewsome attacks on British military and civilian personnel. From October 1951 to 1954 Egyptian nationalist extremists became more openly hostile, with British fatal casualties totalling 520, of which 394 were service personnel, including 30 Royal Engineers, the third largest category after the RAOC and RA. The Regiment was involved in security operations: blocking routes, protecting bridges, ferries and water filtration plants against attack, and supporting internal security measures like fencing and minefields, all in addition to a comprehensive training programme. From July 1952 to June 1954 37 Field Squadron was located at Gothic Camp, El Ballah on detachment to 32 Guards Brigade (1st Scots Gds, 3rd Coldsteam Gds and 1st Beds & Herts). This period of 'freedom' from the regiment was much enjoyed and it was during this time that the Squadron was handed over to the 2iC Capt B.G. Griffiths in February 1953, who picked up his majority one month later. Under his command the Squadron took part in Op RODEO FLAIL, a tank loading operation at Port Said, pontoon building, constructing several semi-permanent Bailey bridges over the Sweetwater Canal (one of which at El Firdan - a 30EWBB - was 82m/270 ft long over two piers x 17m/55 ft high), exercises TRIANGLE and LONGBOW and several long-range desert patrols in GMC armoured trucks (typically well beyond the official limits of the Canal Zone!). 2iC to Maj Griffiths in mid 1953 was 2/Lt D. Croghan, a rare appointment for a national service officer (who was also the unit's bridging officer and MTO). At this same time two other officers out of a total of 5 were n/s, as were many of the ORs, to no disadvantage of the unit that was always in the van of the brigade's operations and 'schemes'. In January 1955 37 Field Squadron embarked on the M. V. Georgic for the UK, under the command of the 2iC Capt Grosse. It was from sometime between January and June 1955 that 37 Field Squadron gained their mascot \\"Noddy\\". This elephant figurine with a nodding head was acquired by allegedly nefarious means from the brewery company Fremlins Ltd. That company shared the town of Maidstone with the Squadron. The brewery subsequently allowed them to keep the elephant, and it toured with the squadron on all their operations for the next fifteen years or so. Noddy still sits in the Squadron Headquarters corridor to this day, with an image of an Elephant being the emblem for 37 Armoured Engineer Squadron. In 1954 the United Nations turned down an application by Greece for the self-determination of Cyprus, and widespread rioting ensued. By April 1955 the EOKA (the National Organisation of Cypriot Combatants) had begun a terror campaign on the island to rid it of British Rule. A state of Emergency was declared in June 1955 and more British troops were deployed to the island. By autumn 1955 it became apparent that the troops would still be there over the winter, and so 37 Field Squadron under the command of Major B.J. Coombe RE, were deployed to help with the winterisation of the temporary camps on 1 November, arriving on 11th. There were regular attacks made on the detachments of the squadron working in the Troodos Mountains, and on 15 December the OC was ambushed by four terrorists, and his driver, LCpl J.B. Morum was killed. Maj. Coombe managed to single-handedly take on the enemy with a sten machine carbine. When his ammunition was expended he returned from his firing position to the vehicle and retrieved his driver's Sten, moved back to his firing position and continued his attack, when this ran out he drew his pistol and covered his opponents for 30 minutes. He killed one, wounded two and when the fourth attempted to escape he stopped him at 70 yards with his last three rounds. He was awarded the George Medal for his actions, where his citation said that he \\"displayed courage and initiative of the very highest order\\". After the winterisation was complete, the squadron turned to bridge repairs and the construction of a radar site at Pomos Point. Within this time the Squadron suffered other losses, Spr R.P.Melson (Bob) was wounded when his truck was ambushed near Petra, he died in hospital of bomb wounds on 24th Nov. 1955. Spr P.H.Percival was killed when a large boulder was rolled down an embankment into the path of his 2 Troop truck on 26th Nov.1955. 37 Field Squadron left Cyprus on the M.V.Devonshire on 26 February 1956, heading for the Invicta Lines, Maidstone. On their return 37 continued with their training, taking part in an atomic blast simulation, HGB builds and a 288 ft class 30 EWBPS build, bridge demolitions and work on the Kings Ferry in October 1956 during the Wyke Regis Training Area Bridging Camp. One month later and the squadron deployed to Malta to participate in the Suez operations of 1956 where among other tasks they constructed Nissen huts at Salima. They returned to Maidstone in 1957 where they dismantled a bridge in Sheppy in March of that year, before taking part in the filming of ‚ÄòDunkirk‚Äô in April 1957. Following this, in July they replaced several small Bailey bridges in Norfolk with piled trestle bridges. Soon afterwards, in August 1957 they were deployed to Christmas Island when it became reactivated to run a continuous programme of ‚ÄòH‚ÄôBomb test's as part of the British Nuclear programme, testing kiloton and megaton devices. The Engineer requirement for the programme was construction of a variety of laboratories, weapon assembly and tests sheds, decontamination houses and photographic processing workshops. Most had to be air-conditioned to strict tolerance limits and an elaborate piped water system was set up that could run at a variety of set temperatures. It is unclear exactly which tasks the squadron personal undertook, but as one of the major RE units posted to the island it is likely that they had a large input into the construction of the 50,000 ft scientific facilities constructed in the nine months the programme ran for. Sadly during this deployment in 1957 Spr Jerkins died of drowning, and was buried at sea. The Squadron's parting gift to the islanders was the construction of a children's playground in London Village before leaving in February 1958. On 15 August 1958, Sgt K. Bamforth of 1 Troop, 37 field Squadron, was presented the British Empire Medal by Lt. Gen. Sir Edwin L. Morris KCB, OBE, MC. for meritorious military service worthy of recognition by the Crown. In 1958, the Squadron moved to Osnabruck, Germany as part of the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR). =1960s - 1980s= In contrast with the previous decades, 37 Field Squadron was able to slow down some what as it entered the 1960s. It would be another twelve years before the Squadron deployed on an operation, and instead the years were filled with numerous training exercises and sports. 37 Field Squadron enjoyed its centenary in 1961, with a parade held on 16 May with Brigadier P.H. Man inspecting the Troops. Here there is a jump in the history to the 1970s where 37 Field Squadron served in Northern Ireland with 39 Infantry Brigade on an operation BANNER tour in the Infantry role in Belfast from March ‚Äì July 1972. They returned again to Northern Ireland from November 1973 to March 1974 carrying out an independent operation DESCANT tour, this time in the Engineer role supporting 8 Infantry Brigade in the Londonderry Area. In 1976 the Squadron came under the command of 35 Engineer Regiment, as it remains to this day. As part of this restructure it moved from Osnabruck to Gordon Barracks in Hameln. On 1 December 1977 the whole regiment was re-designated 4 Armoured Division Engineer Regiment, and as part of that they resumed the Infantry role once again in the Armagh this time, on Op BANNER from December 1977 to 1978 with 3 Infantry Brigade. They returned to Germany until called back for an Op DESCANT tour in Ballykelly with 8 Infantry Brigade in June 1980. =1990s= In December 1990, 37 Field Squadron deployed to the Gulf on Operation GRANBY as part of the 32 Armoured Engineer Brigade, 1 Division. They had as part of their assets an NBC reconnaissance unit equipped with Fuchs vehicles. During an advance of nearly 350 km in 97 hours of virtually non-stop fighting and driving, the Division has destroyed the Iraqi 46 Mechanised Brigade elements of at least three Iraqi Infantry divisions. In November 1992, 37 Field Squadron deployed from Hameln to Tomislavsgrad (TSG) in Bosnia on Op GRAPPLE, as part of the United Nations protection Force (UNPROFOR). The Squadron's principal role during this operation was to open a Main Supply Route called Route Triangle that crossed the mountains to Gorni Vakuf and Vitez. 37 Field Squadron returned from Bosnia, rejoining the Regiment for a short time before being deployed for its last time to Northern Ireland on an Operation DESCANT tour in September 1994. 4 and 5 troop did search based in Antrim and 6 troop were construction based at the maze, the Artillery were responsible for guarding the prison . 6 troop and support troop worked, building the new guard towers at the maze, and various security bases round the province. 35 Engineer Regiment, including 37, deployed during 1995 to Ploce on the Op GRAPPLE surge. The regiment as a whole built a camp for 24 Air Mobile Brigade, for which the Commanding Officer Lt Col NMH Fairclough RE got his OBE. In March 1998 the Squadron, along with the rest of the Regiment, deployed to the Former Republic of Yugoslavia on Operation LODESTAR/PALETINE, as part of the NATO led stabilisation force (SFOR). They returned again in October 1999 with an armoured troop from 77 Armoured Engineer Squadron attached for a six-month tour. =2000s= In January 2000 as part of a strategic Defence Review, 35 Engineer Regiment moved to Barker Barracks in Paderborn. In April of the same year 37 Field Squadron re-rolled to its present formation as 37 Armoured Engineer Squadron. In September of the same year, the Squadron deployed on Exercise ULAN EAGLE in Poland with 20 Armoured Brigade. In January 2001, the Squadron deployed to Kenya on Ex OAK APPLE, a construction exercise in Naivasha. They performed Troop tasks, constructing buildings and latrines for a camp. After an Adventurous Training break, they continued construction work, this time building a school, and dog kennels and shower and latrine blocks for the local Army units, whilst Support Troop dug waterholes for the wildlife. In September of the same year a troop deployed to Oman on Ex SAIF SAREEA as the Royal Engineers Neutral Organisation (RENO) troop. They returned in time to deploy at short notice with the remainder of the Squadron once again to Kenya on another construction tour this time in Meru National Park on Ex OAK APPLE 2, in January 2002. This time around Support Troop worked on the building of Kanjoo School. Armoured Troop built a Non-Equipment Bridge for easier access to the school. After some Adventure Training, the Squadron held a fun run, charity auction and other fund raising events to enable the school to buy new desks and books. 32 personnel from the Squadron deployed on Op TELIC 1 with 28 and 32 Engineer Regiments whilst the rest of the Squadron took to the Green Goddesses deploying on Op FRESCO to cover the fireman's strike in the Birmingham area. Elements went to Canada for Ex WARPAINT and Ex MEDMAN 1, with the full Squadron joining them for Ex MEDMAN 2 in June 2003. Following this busy period the Squadron, commanded by Major A.Hilton, were again warned for operations in Iraq and deployed two months earlier than planned in November 2003 on Op TELIC 3. They were initially divisional troops but then reverted to OPCOM 35 Engineer Regiment. Based in the AL Basra and Maysan area, the Squadron were responsible for overseeing the reconstruction of the 400Kva and 132Kva electrical transmission lines, force protection and construction tasks as well as solid waste removal and upgrading the recently destroyed sewage system in the city of Basra. A search troop and RESAT group were also detached to 77 Armoured Engineer Squadron and the US Army in BAGHDAD respectively. In January 2004, 86 personnel from both 73 and 75 Engineer Regiment (V) respectively were mobilised to deploy to Iraq and became fully integrated with 37 Armoured Engineer Squadron on 9 January 2004. Sadly the tour did not go without loss for 37 Armoured Engineer Squadron. On 31 January 2004, 22-year- old Spr Rab Thompson was killed in an accident in Basra when an excavation he was working and collapsed. His memory is maintained by the ‚ÄòRab Thompson Cup‚Äô ‚Äì An annual inter-troop games competition. 37 returned to Paderborn, though during the beginning of 2005 elements deployed to Cyprus as part of Op TOSCA. In October 2006 the Squadron undertook training with the 1 PWRR Battle Groups in Poland on exercise ULAN EAGLE. In April 2006 the Squadron again deployed to Iraq on Operation TELIC 8, this time stationed in Shaibah Logistics Base (SLB) and Basra Air Station (BAS). Later in the tour the Squadron deployed into Basra City, working from Basra Palace, as part of Op SINBAD, which involved the repair of schools, hospitals and other public amenities. The Squadron, along with the help of the RAF, pioneered a new way of replacing damaged or looted pylons that were having a drastic impact on the quality of life for the Iraqis. A Chinook helicopter lifted the 4.5 tonnes pylons from BAS and flew them to location where sappers from 37 and Iraqi Engineers were on the ground ready to fix them down. They erected a total of 30 pylons using this method. During the Tour 37 decided to honour British soldiers who had lost their lives on Op TELIC. They built the BASRA Memorial wall outside the front of the Headquarters of the Multi-National Division (south-East). The sappers Worked often in their own time, into the night after a day on task, to complete the wall before the end of their tour, and they fixed onto it plaques bearing the name of every fallen soldier. In March 2008 the Squadron, commanded by Major A. Devey RE, deployed to Gibraltar on Ex 29th SHOT, where they completed the difficult and dangerous demolition of a second World War observation post (OP) 300 ft up the Rock of Gibraltar. During the 8 weeks construction tour they deconstructed the OP by hand whilst being roped on. Other tasks completed during the exercise were the upgrading of the historical Garrison Library Kitchen, and the stair access inside St Michael's Cave was repaired. They erected a church bell in St Bernard's Church that had been donated by the RAF, and were able to participate in the Freedom of Gibraltar. On return from Gibraltar it was time for the Squadron to once again prepare itself for a deployment, this time on Op TELIC 13 under the command of Maj. A.A Garrow RE. 37 arrived in Iraq at the end of November 2008 with two distinct roles to fulfil. The first was to act as a Boat Troop, operating out of FOB OXFORD and enabling 1PWRR to patrol and influence the March areas at the back of the Contingency Operating Base (COB). These patrols were vital in clearing the area of insurgents, as its location had previously been used on numerous occasions for launching indirect fire into the COB. The only access to the area was via the waterways, and so Boat Troop worked tirelessly to maintain and man the boats for the daily patrols. The other two troops' main role was construction. It was announced during the tour that Op TELIC 13 would be the last deployment of British troops to Iraq, and therefore the Engineers had to ensure that it was left in a state to allow easy handover to both the Americans and the Iraqis. The early task involved the two troops moving out independently into the city of Basra to upgrade existing FOB's and to give force protection to Iraqi police stations. The troops worked with Iraqi civilian contractors to build HESCO bastion walls and sangars, and to upgrade amenities. Attention was then turned inside of the COB, with the majority of the Squadron tasked with the sensitive demolition of the divisional internment facility, when this was complete, 37 then raised an ammunition handling area for the US Army in its place, and de-constructed the old ammunition compound. Smaller tasks were also completed, with helicopter landing pads constructed a radar pad built, and outside of the COB sections deploying to strip out FOB's ready for the imminent departure. In the last weeks of the tour 37 were kept particularly busy. They went out on three bridging operations in a little over a week, one of which was a two night operation repairing the main bridge over the Shat Al Arab waterway. Those not bridging had the high-profile task of taking down Basra Memorial Wall. It was decided by the Prime Minister that the bricks and plaques would be removed to the UK where it would be resurrected as a permanent memorial to those who lost their lives during Operation TELIC. It was fitting that it was the same Squadron who had built the wall that had the task of taking it down again, even more so that some of the squadron members were involved in both. With the wall taken down, the Basra Air Base handed over to the US Army, 37 Armoured Engineer Squadron returned to Germany in May 2009. There was a short break for some leave and adventurous training. After the section and recce competitions, the sub-unit deployed to Salisbury Plain on Ex DRUIDS DANCE to support 1RGR, where, over the three-week period, the Squadron built 21 bridges including a double story MGB. =2010s= From October 2011 to May 2012 the sub-unit was deployed on Operation HERRICK 15 in Afghanistan. Since then, the sub-unit has completed a construction tour in Kenya in early 2015 and Ex PRAIRIE STORM in Canada in Jul 2016. In 2017, the sub-unit then moved into the forefront of NATO high readiness as part of the VJTF(L), conducting exercises in Canada, Germany and Denmark, as well as supporting smaller exercises in Latvia, Romania, USA and UK. In addition to this core commitment, the sub-unit has also supported Op SHADER with Mobility Support Training Teams working to develop the capability of the Iraqi Security Forces. In June 2018 the Squadron exercised the Freedom of Paderborn with 20th Armoured Infantry Brigade. In the summer of 2018, 35 Engineer Regiment disbanded, the sub-unit moved from Barker Barracks in Paderborn, Germany, to Marne Barracks in Catterick, North Yorkshire. 37 Armoured Engineer Squadron became 37 Field Squadron and became part of 32 Engineer Regiment. The sub-unit was deployed to the Falkland Islands as part of Project ANEMOI from Feb-Oct 2019.

The award is named after Simeon Bruner's late father, Rudy Bruner, founder of the Bruner Foundation. According to the Bruner Foundation, the RBA was created to increase understanding of the role of architecture in the urban environment and promote discussion of what constitutes urban excellence. The award seeks to identify and honor places, rather than people, that address economic and social concerns along with urban design.  Description  According to the Bruner Foundation, the award is intended to be a platform for the discussion of issues related to urban architecture, planning and revitalization. It has been recognized by the United States Conference of Mayors, The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the Environmental Design Research Association. The biennial award recognizes one Gold Medal and four silver medal winners each cycle. Each medalist is documented with a detailed case study published online and in a book by the Bruner Foundation. The gold medal winner receives $50,000 and the four silver medalists each receive $10,000 which must be used to benefit the project. These winners are chosen by a diverse committee of professionals involved in design and development. These committee members include architects, landscape architects, planners, developers, community organizers, financiers, and the mayor of a major metropolitan area.  Criteria and selection process  The selection process involves a study of a project's effect on its urban environment including a detailed application, discussion by selection committee members, and site visits to finalist projects. A selection committee is organized anew for each award cycle. In order to be eligible for consideration, projects must be: * an actual place, not just a plan or a program; * completed and in operation for sufficient amount of time to demonstrate success * located in the continental US There are no distinct categories. Projects may include any type that makes a positive contribution to the urban environment. Urban environment is broadly defined to include cities, towns, neighborhoods, counties and/or regions. Previous applicants and honorable mention winners may apply up to three times. Previous winners are not eligible.  Resources  In 1998 the University of Buffalo collaborated with the Bruner Foundation and the Urban Design Project of the School of Architecture and Planning to create a digital archive, making data gathered in reference to past winners of the Rudy Bruner Award for Urban Excellence accessible to the public. The goal of this archive is to allow public \\"access to award winning and fully documented urban design case studies as a resource for architecture students and practitioners as they study precedents in urban design.\\" The Digital Archive is managed by the UB Institutional Repository. The Bruner Foundation has published fifteen books containing detailed case studies of award-winning projects.http://www.brunerfoundation.org/rba www.brunerfoundation.org/rba  List of winners  2017 Gold Medal :SteelStacks Arts and Cultural Campus, Bethlehem, PA 2017 Silver Medals :La Kretz Innovation Campus + Arts District Park, Los Angeles, CA :Bruce C.

The opposing sides were the Landgraviate of Hesse-Cassel and the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation. According to a judgement by the Vienna Supreme Court (Wiener Hofgericht), Hesse-Cassel had to cede Upper Hesse, which included the University of Marburg, to Hesse-Darmstadt. In return for this substantial loss, in the Treaty of Werben on 22 August 1631, King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden promised to grant the state of Hesse-Cassel, various territories including parts of the Prince-Bishopric of M√ºnster (Hochstift M√ºnster) and Vest Recklinghausen (governed by the Electorate of Cologne) if he were victorious in the Thirty Years' War. On 9 February 1633, Hesse-Cassel captured the town of Dorsten without resistance from the Electorate of Cologne and the Vest of Recklinghausen and, in the years that followed, it was turned into the strongest fortress in the region by the Hessian, Colonel Dalwig, and Johann Adriansch. As early as 1636, an attempt was made under the command of Johann von G√∂tz to recapture Dorsten, but he was met with failure. The Siege of Dorsten, 1641 On 16 July 1641 a second siege of the town of Dorsten was begun by imperial Field Marshal Melchior, Count of Hatzfeldt and imperial Feldzeugmeister, Alexander II of Velen, with some 20,000 soldiers. This attack was started because, earlier, the Hessian lieutenant general, Kaspar, Count of Eberstein had moved off with a portion of his troops to participate in the Siege of Wolfenb√ºttel.Wolf, Manfred (1983).

The Imperial Artillery took post to the northeast amongst the sand hills, initially with 14 cannon. They were later reinforced by the Electorate of Cologne bringing the total to 30 guns. In a letter from the imperial Generalwachtmeister, Freiherr von Wendt, dated 16 July, to the mayor and town council of Recklinghausen, he demanded the following supplies for the provision of his soldiers outside Dorsten: 3,000 pounds of bread, 16 tonnes of beer, four head of cattle, 15 sacks of oats and several \\"kitchen items\\".Schneider, Franz (1862).

The soldiers, who came from the 12th Regiment of Infantry and 10th Regiment of Cavalry, constructed extensive siegeworks around the town. The Hessian defenders were commanded by Senior Commandant (Oberkommandant) Johann von Geyso and Commandant Emmanuel Kotz with 2,000 soldiers, 400 of whom had previously been redeployed from Kalkar. Other relief contingents called up by the Hesse-Cassel regent, Amalie Elisabeth of Hanau-M√ºnzenberg, were either very small in number (250 men under Colonel Carl von Rabenhaupt from Haltern and Borken) or arrived too late (troops under the command of Ernest Albert of Eberstein from Wolfenb√ºttel). On 25 August the first breach was made west of the Lippe Gate with 2,000 artillery shells, destroying the last line barrier. Once this breach had been widened by cannon fire and plans for an assault with initially 2,000 musketeers and 1,500 cuirassiers got under way, the Hessian commandants opened negotiations over the terms of surrender on 18 September with Field Marshal von Hatzfeld. The siege ended on 19 September. The Hesse- Cassel garrison were given safe passage for their remaining personnel comprising 650 men plus administrators and families. The Theatrum Europaeum recorded that the town of Dorsten had become a \\"lamentable ruin\\" as a result of the siege. With the capitulation of Dorsten, Hesse-Cassel had lost the most important fortress on the right bank of the Lower Rhine and, in the aftermath, concentrated their efforts in the Hessian War, together with France and Saxe- Weimar, on the left bank possessions of the Archbishopric of Cologne under Ferdinand of Bavaria and the neutral Duchy of J√ºlich under Wolfgang William.Engelbert, G√ºnther (1959).

The flood prompted the evacuation of 157 patients, and forced the hospital to shut down, with damages totaling over $180 million. Due to the flood, certain areas had been destroyed such as the laboratory, pharmacy, information services, food services, and mechanical and electrical systems. An interim emergency department was opened up in August 2008, and on October 27, Columbus Regional Hospital reopened with a new and improved facility. In 2012, the Federal Emergency Management Agency backed a project to protect CRH from any future flooding. 15 flood gates were installed around the campus in order to keep water out. Today, CRH is a fully functioning, 225-bed not-for-profit, providing emergency and surgical services and comprehensive care. WellConnect In 2014, Columbus Regional Health opened up a new walk- in clinic called WellConnect in the downtown area of Columbus, Indiana. In an effort to keep up with the times, CRH decided to create a new facility with a different approach on delivering health care services. The end result was derived from focus groups and surveys, to the benefit of those living in the downtown area. WellConnect is a place where you can meet with wellness experts and healthcare professionals. They offer walk-in care for minor illnesses, wellness programs, massage therapy, and cooking demonstrations. It is open to the public, Monday through Friday. Awards and recognition In 2014, CRH received an award for Excellence in Supply Chain Management from VHA Inc..

Sarƒ±s√ºl√ºk, who was seriously injured by police officer Ahmet ≈ûahbaz during the Gezi Park protests in Ankara, stayed in intensive care unit for 14 days. He was diagnosed with brain death on 12 June 2013 and died in Ankara Numune Hospital on 14 June 2013 at 3:15 pm. In the autopsy report it was stated that the bullet which killed him was found inside the brain.  Life  Sarƒ±s√ºl√ºk was born on 11 July 1986 in Sungurlu, √áorum, to family of a Turkmen Alevi origin. In 1991, he moved to Ankara together with his family. His father, Muzaffer Sarƒ±s√ºl√ºk, was a literature teacher. However, he resigned and started to live alone in the countryside of √áorum due to various reasons. His father lives a life far from technology and practices vegetarianism. His mother, Sayfƒ±, provided for the family by working as a cleaner. He had a poor childhood with three brothers and one sister. He completed his primary education in Kƒ±nƒ±k Primary School and started his high school education in Abidinpa≈üa Industrial Vocational High School; but did not continue his studies. Then he started going to Tuzlu√ßayƒ±r High School; but left in the second grade. He was detained during the free education protests at this school. After high school he worked in various sectors such as transporting cargo and worked in OSTƒ∞M as a welding worker. For a while, he took part at a police station construction in Hakk√¢ri. Death A memorial made in Kƒ±zƒ±lay at the point where Ethem Sarƒ±s√ºl√ºk was shot On 1 June, Sarƒ±s√ºl√ºk was wounded with a bullet shot by police officer Ahmet ≈ûahbaz during the Gezi Park protests. In a few days all of his organs stopped functioning and he died 13 days later. 7 days after his family filed a criminal complaint, the area in which he was shot was reconnoitered. His body was sent to the Ke√ßi√∂ren Forensic Medicine Institute for an autopsy. Apart from experts, the family's lawyers, Kazƒ±m Bayraktar and Teoman √ñzkan, joined the prosecutor and an observing expert for the autopsy. The process was recorded in the form of photos and videos. A 9-mm-bullet was removed from his brain. The bullet was estimated to have been fired at a distance of 4.8 meters. His family wanted to donate his organs; however, this request was not approved as the organs had become unusable following the autopsy. On 3 September 2014, it was decided that the suspect, police officer Ahmet ≈ûahbaz, was to be sentenced to 7 years and 9 months of imprisonment; consisting of a 1-year probation and 4 years and 2 months in prison. However, on 8 December 2014, the Chief Public Prosecutor's Office of the Supreme Court of Appeals, requested the sentence to be changed as the defendant ≈ûahbaz had committed \\"willful murder\\" by \\"targeting the group in front of him and deliberately shooting them\\". Funeral On 16 June 2013, at 12:30 in Kƒ±zƒ±lay, the crowd was gathered for the funeral of Sarƒ±s√ºl√ºk. The police did not allow the funeral authorities to assemble in Kƒ±zƒ±lay for the commemoration ceremony. Police and gendarmerie teams closed the road at Batƒ±kent junction when the funeral ceremony was taking place in Kƒ±zƒ±lay. People who had come to Kƒ±zƒ±lay for Sarƒ±s√ºl√ºk's funeral, left flowers at the spot in which Sarƒ±s√ºl√ºk was shot. The police intervened with people who wanted to take part in the commemoration ceremony. Water cannons and tear gas were used to disperse the crowd. A number of people were injured in the incident and two people were hit in the head by tear gas canister. Over 100 people were detained during the incident and Sarƒ±s√ºl√ºk's body was taken to the village of Beylice in the town of Sungurlu in √áorum with the vehicle of √áankaya Municipality. CHP representative from Tunceli, H√ºseyin Ayg√ºn, √áorum's representative, Tufan K√∂se, and various institutions and organizations participated in the funeral ceremony. The ceremony was carried out by the √áorum branch of the Hacƒ± Bekta≈ü Veli Foundation and followed the Alevi-Bekta≈üi tradition and custom.  Claims  Established in 1979 as an illegal organization after the division of THKO, the Tƒ∞KB issued a statement on its official website, following the death of Ethem Sarƒ±s√ºl√ºk. In this statement, it was alleged that Sarƒ±s√ºl√ºk was a member of the Turkey Revolutionary Communist League. Reactions To commemorate Ethem Sarƒ±s√ºl√ºk and to protest against the release of the police who killed Sarƒ±s√ºl√ºk, KESK Istanbul Branches Platform, Dƒ∞SK Istanbul Representative Office, Istanbul Medical Chamber, and TMMOB Istanbul Branch called for thousands of people to gather in Taksim Square. His elder brother, Mustafa Sarƒ±s√ºl√ºk, was a nominee from HDP at the November 2015 Turkish general election to represent Ankara's 2nd district. Legacy In July 2013, a park was named after him in the Batƒ±kent neighborhood of Yenimahalle district in Ankara. In the same year, a library was created in his name in Mamak, Ankara. In 2013, Mordoƒüan Theater Festival in Mordoƒüan, ƒ∞zmir, was dedicated to Ethem Sarƒ±s√ºl√ºk's memory. Singer Alpay composed the song \\"Ethem'in Sessiz √áƒ±ƒülƒ±ƒüƒ±\\" in honor of Ethem Sarƒ±s√ºl√ºk and all those who had lost their lives during the Gezi Park protests. Director G√ºrkan Hacƒ±r also made a documentary about Ethem Sarƒ±s√ºl√ºk's life, titled Haziran Yangƒ±nƒ±. The film was released on 12 June 2015.

The type species, Bunostegos akokanensis, was named from the Moradi Formation in 2003. It was a cow-sized animal with a distinctive skull that had large bony knobs, similar in form to those of other pareiasaurs but far larger. The species appears to have lived in a desert in the centre of the supercontinent of Pangaea. Analysis of the limb bones (including the scapulocoracoid, humerus, radius, ulna, pelvis, and femur) was published in 2015, and revealed that Bunostegos walked upright on four limbs, with the body held above ground. This new information directly suggests that it could be the first tetrapod with a fully erect gait. Description The animal has been described as about the size of a modern cow with a knobbly skull and bony plate armor on its back.\\" Its teeth show it to have been a plant eater. It lived in an isolated desert region of the supercontinent of Pangaea some 260 million years ago. Its home region appears to have supported a distinctive fauna, in contrast to the rest of the supercontinent, where species were broadly distributed. It is particularly notable for the large bony knobs on its head, bigger than any seen in other species of pareiasaur. In life they were probably skin-covered horns or ossicones similar to those of modern giraffes. They are thought not to have served a protective function but were probably purely ornamental, perhaps aiding recognition between or within particular species. Bunostegos may have been part of a relict population that clung on in central Pangaea, isolated from other more advanced species by the hyperarid conditions in which it lived. It is more closely related to older and more primitive pareiasaurs. The centre of the supercontinent appears to have been a very dry desert, which prevented population exchanges between the interior and exterior and kept Bunostegos in reproductive isolation. Only a few million years later, however, Bunostegos and most of the other pareiasaurs died out in the Permian‚ÄìTriassic extinction event of 252 million years ago. The evidence Bunostegos walked upright: * the shoulder part (scapulocoracoid) where the upper arm bone moved is oriented more downward and to the back than off to side as in other pareiasaurs, allowing a greater vertical movement. * the humerus (upper arm bone) does not fit into a spread out posture * the elbow joint allows a front to back movement as in an animal standing upright. Near vertical hind limbs were usual for pareiasaurs, but Bunostegos was more advanced in having all four limbs vertical. Discovery Bunostegos akokanensis was named by paleontologists Christian A. Sidor, David C. Blackburn and Boub√© Gado in 2003. Remains of Bunostegos were uncovered from the Moradi Formation near the town of Akokan in 2003 and 2006. The genus name means \\"knobby roof\\" in Greek as a reference to the bony knobs on its skull and the species name akokanensis references Akokan. Bunostegos is currently known from several skulls and postcranial remains. The holotype specimen MNN-MOR72, which served as the basis for the initial description of Bunostegos, is a weathered skull lacking the lower jaw. MNN-MOR86, a better-preserved skull also lacking the lower jaw, MNN-MOR28, a less deformed but heavily weathered skull, and MNN-MOR47, a partial skull preserving the palate and braincase, served as the basis for a 2013 description of the skull anatomy of Bunostegos. Relationships Bunostegos belongs to a group of reptiles called pareiasaurs, a group of large herbivores that lived across much of Pangaea during the Permian period. The most derived pareiasaurs such as Elginia and Arganaceras have highly ornamented skulls with many bony projections. The skull of Bunostegos is also heavily ornamented, yet Bunostegos is not thought to be very closely related to derived pareiasaurs. In its initial description, Sidor, Blackburn, and Gado considered Bunostegos to possess a combination of basal (\\"primitive\\") and derived (\\"advanced\\") pareiasaur features. An analysis of the evolutionary relationships of pareiasaurs published in 2013 found Bunostegos to be one of the most basal taxa within Pareiasauria, with primitive features such as a high number of marginal teeth contributing to its position in the evolutionary tree. Given that more derived pareiasaurs than Bunostegos lack heavily ornamented skulls, ornamentation likely evolved independently in Bunostegos and in advanced pareiasaurs. Below is the cladogram from the 2013 study: Paleoecology Bunostegos was part of a distinct paleofauna that existed in what is now Niger during the Late Permian. Other Gondwanan paleofaunas are known from the Karoo Basin of South Africa, Luangwa Basin of Zambia, and Ruhuhu Basin of Tanzania. These faunas are all quite similar to each other, implying that there were few biogeographic barriers to prevent faunal interchanges between these basins. In addition to Bunostegos, the Moradi Formation has yielded fossils of two very basal temnospondyl amphibians (Saharastega and Nigerpeton) that share more in common with temnospondyls from the Carboniferous and Early Permian than with contemporary forms, and the unusually large captorhinid reptile Moradisaurus. The only other fossil assemblage that shows similarities with the Moradi assemblage is that of the Ikakern Formation in Morocco, which includes a late-surviving species of the lepospondyl amphibian Diplocaulus, an unnamed large captorhinid, and the pareiasaur Arganaceras. Studies of the sediments of the Moradi Formation show that the region was extremely arid during the Late Permian but had a shallow groundwater table that could support plant and animal life. Climate models of the Late Permian suggest that this arid region extended across much of central Pangaea. The Moradi Formation may have been a refugium for many tetrapods that were once diverse earlier in the Permian but had been replaced elsewhere on the supercontinent by new tetrapod faunas. The presence of Bunostegos in the Moradi Formation supports this hypothesis because, as a basal pareiasaur, it is most similar to pareiasaurs that lived during the Middle Permian ‚Äîseveral tens of millions of years before it actually occurs in the fossil record. Ancestors of Bunostegos may have been part of a long ghost lineage living in isolation in central Pangaea long after other basal pareiasaurs became extinct.

He did enough to be retained on a non-contract basis for the 1988‚Äì89 season, receiving his debut on 20 December 1988 in a 2‚Äì1 win over rivals Southend United in the Associate Members Cup. Rooke failed to add to his solitary appearance during the season, generally confined to the reserve team. In pre- season for the 1989‚Äì90 season during a tour of Scotland, he displaced regular left-back Clive Stafford, impressing enough to earn him a run in the first- team during the opening games of the league season. However, after the defence leaked a number of goals, the inexperienced Rooke was one of the first players to be replaced.
