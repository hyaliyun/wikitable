History The contribution of the Pallavas to the cultural development was significant. They encouraged the growth of Tamil literature. The Pallavas earned name and fame through their developed art and architecture. Mamallapuram finds a prominent place in the tourist map of the world. Even today, their temples and sculptures stand testimony to the cultural achievements of the Pallavas. Pillar of Mahendravadi Pallava temple, 7th c. Presence of Pallavas can be seen in Mahandravadi. An ancient cave temple of the 7th centuryhttps://www.bl.uk/catalogues/indiaofficeselect/PhotoShowDescs.asp?CollID=1864 (monolithic rock cut temple)http://asi.nic.in/asi_monu_alphalist_tamilnadu.asp is under the control of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). Maintenance is handled by ASI. This village, erstwhile a big town was established by a Pallava King, Mahendra Varman I, who was ruling the great Pallava kingdom. It was considered that the historical town extended its boundary from the existing Mahendravadi as Mela Veedhi (West Street) and Keezh Veedhi (East Street). Kilvidhi is a village located at the distance of 4.5 km from Mahendravadi. The Parpana street and Big Street shows evidence of a very old house system in culture and towards worship of Lakshmi Narayan and Siva. There are two old temples, namely Siva Temple and Lakshmi Narayanan Temple, which define the history of the village. It was believed that these temples were from the old Pallava history. Very surprise to note that Mahendra varman 1 is towards Shiva. But the cave temple and Lakshmi Narayanan Temple dedicated to Vishnu. During Karthigai month Tamil Month, karthigai deepam festival celebrated in ancient Shiva temple. The temple on the lake is very attractive for devotees in and around the villages/town, where many people come and worship the goddess called \\"Madhuvathamman\\" (or \\"Madhagu Kattha Amman\\") meaning \\"Goddess of the Lake reservoir\\". The nearest town is Nemili. Tourists can visit the town for the famous Lord Veerabhatra Swamy Temple, Lord Siva temple, and Ponniamman temples.  Language  People speak only and mainly Tamil. This is something to be wondered, why other language people did not exist in this village by historical family roots. Almost 72.12 percentage literacy level in this village as per 2011 census. Education Mahendravadi has a primary and higher secondary school run by state government. The quality of education and pass percentage is always higher level compare to any other schools in this region.

Transport Mahendravadi is well-connected by bus to the nearby towns Nemili, Banavaram, Sholinghur and Arakonam. Every 30 minutes to 45 minutes the buses ply operated by state government transport corporation and private bus operators. There is a railway station called \\"Mahendravadi\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PK7O6nNG22c at distance. However, usage of the railway is not great.

Economy Historical Lake ‚Äì viewHistorical monuments major source of income for the people, and they are all dependent on lake irrigation as well as bore well water. Paddy (Wetland), Groundnut and Sesame (Dry Land region) are the major crops cultivated. However, the catchment area for the historical pallava king made lake is occupied by small hamlets thus making the region very poor for rain water conservation. The lake region is slowly encroached by people. Moreover, the sand sediments of the lake have not been cleared for many decades. There has been a direct canal from Palar river to Mahendravadi lake, which was natural water flow from Anaicut of Palar river. The main source of water through north east monsoon are the rains from October to December. However, the rainfall is far below average of north east monsoon fall. The lake is fully dependent on Palar water, and the dark side is \\"palar river itself is a dry river\\". The lake has been capable of supplying water resources to seven other lakes below its lake bed villages. After 14 years,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/over-360-pwd-tanks- full-to-the-brim/article7932421.ece the lake filled with overflowing water on 24 November 2015.

People believes that this goddess is very powerful, and there is a grand festival yearly once for the goddess. This festival has been celebrated for two days, and during this period, all family members join together to pray to the goddess for their health and wealth. Recent past 5 years this festival has been celebrated for 4 days. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlAkA7ZIKVg The notable things to observe here is, the first right to worship the god (offering garland and pongal) is to scheduled caste when the god comes from her temple of lake crest to village entrance that means decoration and urchava veedhi ula. This is great example to extend of respecting scheduled caste is first in place. The harmony and being together is integral part of the village culture irrespective of caste system. Newly Married couple offer their mangal suthra (thaali) to the goddess and tie the new mangal suthra. This happens invariably in all newly married couple. it is a must visit festival to see the offering given to goddess. Every Amavasai (Dark moon day), full night festive happens at temple and thousands of devotees come and spend their entire night. Pongal is another grand festival in the village, as like the entire Tamil Nadu celebrate. It has been a 4- or 5-day festival, and people enjoy these periods of harvesting. Nowadays Diwali has also been getting colourful since it was not that much important, as per Tamil culture.

Born in Bridgnorth, Shropshire, (the Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online states that he may have been a native of Ireland) Magowan was educated in England and was admitted to practice as an attorney of the King's Bench in 1782. In 1788, he married Ann Stainforth. He immigrated to St. John's Island (later Prince Edward Island) in 1789 from London. He was first elected to the colony's assembly in 1790. For some time, he and Attorney General Joseph Aplin were the only practicing lawyers on the island. Magowan was deputy to Thomas Desbrisay, secretary and registrar, from 1795 to 1800. He was named acting attorney general in 1798 when Aplin was relieved of his duties and became attorney general in 1800, serving in that post until his death in Charlottetown in 1810. Magowan was reelected to the assembly in 1803 and 1806. His grandson Alexander Henry Boswall MacGowan later served in the British Columbia assembly.

By 1868 it came to be known as Rajkot High School, and was named Alfred High School in 1907. The present buildings of the Alfred High School were built for Kathiawar by the Nawab of Junagadh, Nawab Nawab Sir Muhammad Bahadur Khanji Babi, and was named Prince Alfred, the Duke of Edinburgh, as a memorial. This School was opened in January, 1875 by Sir Philip Wodehouse, Governor of Bombay.\\"Source \\", Retrieved on 26 December 2007 =Mohandas Gandhi= Mahatma Gandhi graduated from Rajkot High School in 1887 at age 18. Accounts vary on Gandhi's time at the school. Several accounts suggest he was a quiet and academically unremarkable student who did not participate in sports or extracurricular activities. Gandhi said of his schooling, \\"I had not any high regard for my ability. I was to be astonished whenever I won prizes and scholarships\\". However, Rajmohan Gandhi suggests that this view comes from a misreading of his \\"self-deprecating\\" autobiography. Out of 38 students who had passed the high school entrance examination, Gandhi was one of only two students in his year to matriculate. Following graduation Gandhi enrolled at the Samaldas College in Bhavnagar, where he stayed for one term before travelling to London. Following India's independence in 1947, the school was renamed the \\"Mohandas Gandhi High School\\" in honour of Gandhi.\\"Colonial Tour of RMC \\", Retrieved on 26 December 2007 In 2017, the school was closed and announced that it will be converted into museum.

He was the son of Radhamohan Bose. He is often referred in The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna. Ramakrishna often visited his house and participated in kirtana and other devotional functions. Sri Maa Sarada Devi and some other devotees of the master including Swami Adbhutananda lived in the house of Balaram Bose after the master's death. He was a great philanthropist and donated regularly to government and civilian organizations. Biography =Early life= Bose was born in a very prominent Vaishnavite family of North Calcutta whose ancestral seat was in Hooghly District. His father was Radhamohan Bose. His grandfather Guruprasad Bose established a Radha Shyam temple in his house and because of that, the section of the area became known as Shyam Bazar in Calcutta. His residence in north Kolkata, where Swami Vivekananda founded the Ramakrishna Mission on 1 May 1897, is presently known as the Balaram Mandir.Sengupta, Subodh Chandra (ed.) (1988) Sansad Bangali Charitabhidhan (in Bengali), Kolkata: Sahitya Sansad, p.331 The place has been sanctified by the numerous visits of Sri Ramakrishna, his disciples, and Holy Mother Sri Sarada Devi. Bose's extended family of his uncles had estates in several parts of India esp. in the Balasore region of Orissa. His cousins Nimaicharan and Hariballav Bose were the custodians of the ancestral property and they provided him with an allowance.Sri Ramakrishna Bhaktamalika in Bengali, by Swami Gambhirananda, Udbodhan publishers Balaram was intensely spiritual since his early days and he spent considerable time in his younger days in Puri. Fearing that he would become an ascetic his cousins and father made him come back to Calcutta and put him up in a house in Baghbazar area. Balaram was married to Krishnabhavini Devi who was likewise spiritual minded and they had two daughters and a son. =Influence of Sri Ramakrishna= Bose met Sri Ramakrishna for the first time in 1881 and apparently had asked him if God exists.\\"Certainly he does\\", came the response. Sri Ramakrishna regarded Balaram Bose as one of the principal suppliers of the mother, implying that Balaram provided bulk of the food, clothing and other items for serving the devotees and the God. In The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna it is recorded that Sri Ramakrishna saw Balaram in a vision, as part of a huge procession of the followers of Sri Gauranga or Sri Chaitanya in a sankirtan or song and dance in praise of the divinity along with lord Sri Chaitanya himself.Gospels of Sri Ramakrishna, by Mahendra Nath Gupta (M), translated by Swami Nikhilananda After his first meeting with Sri Ramakrishna, Balaram became a lifelong devotee. His entire family was intensely spiritual. His wife Krishna Bhavini was very dedicated to Sri Ramakrishna and the holy mother and she was also the sister of Swami Premananda, a direct monastic disciple of Sri Ramakrishna who later came to be known as swami Premananda. Sri Ramakrishna often used to go to Balaram's house on holy occasions where he used to be in spiritual ecstasy. An account has been made of his stay in The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna on the occasion of the rathayatra or the car festival of lord Jagannath. Sri Ramakrishna also spent several days in Balaram's house during his illness when his devotees shifted him to Calcutta for better treatment. Balaram also named his only son after Ramakrishna. After the passing away of the Master, Balaram would provide a small amount for his monastic brother disciples in Baranagar Math. Despite the fact that he was not well off and did not have any regular income of his own and that he depended on the sustenance provided by the family estate, he never shied away from serving Sri Ramakrishna and his devotees and followers. Holy mother of Ramakrishna Order, Sri Sarada Devi, also stayed in Balaram Bose's house for sometime while staying in Calcutta. We get a picture of absolute humility and complete surrender from M's The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna in the incident where he was waiting patiently outside the house for the Master to finish his conversation with Vidyasagar for several hours, without making any endeavour to disturb the Master. =Legacy= There is a street in Calcutta named after Balaram Bose, called Balaram Bose Ghat Road. His ancestral house, affectionately called Balaram Mandir, is now under the ownership of Ramakrishna Mission. His ancestral house is now called Balaram Mandir. It was here that the Ramakrishna Mission Association was born- Swami Vivekananda held the historic meeting on 1 May 1897 to finalize his plan for founding the Association in the name of his Master.Lay Disciples of Sri Ramakrishna on Belur Math website Many direct disciples of Sri Ramakrishna, including Swami Vivekananda, Swami Brahmananda, Swami Turiyananda, Swami Premananda, Swami Akhandananda and Swami Adbhutananda stayed in Balaram Mandir. The Holy Mother Sri Sarada Devi also stayed in Balaram Mandir. There is a small shrine dedicated to Lord Jagannath inside the temple. There is also the chariot of Lord Jagannath which was pulled by Sri Ramakrishna on a Ratha yatra (car festival) day.Car Festival at Balaram's House, The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna The Gadadhar Ashrama, now under Ramakrishna Mission, in Bhawanipur area of Calcutta, began in the memory of one of his grandsons.Sri Ma Darshan (Bengali), volume 3, by Swami Nityatmananda, published by Sri Ma Trust, Chandigarh Notes  Further reading  * They lived with God, by Swami Chetanananda. * The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna, by M, translated by Swami Nikhilananda * Sri Ramakrishna Bhaktamalika (Bengali), by Swami Gambhirananda, Udbodhan Publishers Category:Ramakrishna Category:Lay disciples of Ramakrishna Category:Scholars from Kolkata Category:1842 births Category:1890 deaths Category:19th-century Indian scholars ","title":"Balaram Bose"},{"id":"14891158","text":"Akluj is a town in Solapur district, Maharashtra, India.

GTBH was established in 1979 (fully functional in 1987) with 350-bed capacity which has now been expanded to 1500-bed capacity. It is the first Delhi Government tertiary care hospital in Trans-Yamuna (East Delhi) area, catering to the East Delhi population as well as patients from adjacent states. It is an associated teaching hospital attached to the University College of Medical Sciences, University of Delhi. Location Dilshad Garden, Delhi-110095 History It was envisioned as a teaching affiliate to University College of Medical Sciences and as such it can trace its history parallel to that of UCMS. UCMS was founded in 1971, due to the efforts of the Health Minister of New Delhi. It was proposed by the minister to provide medical education to every student who attained the eligibility criteria and wished to become a doctor. The criteria being stringent (minimum 60% aggregate), but it still caused a 100 or so students to be left out, even with the presence of two Medical Colleges in Delhi ‚Äì MAMC and LHMC. That year classes began in the makeshift Department of Chemistry, Delhi University, North Campus. This was to become the UCMS of tomorrow. It then started having its clinical postings (practicals) at Meerut Medical College. Shortly, it was shifted to Safdarjung Hospital in South Delhi. In 1986, it shifted to its present location at Dilshad Garden and was associated with Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital, a 1000 bedded institution, as its teaching hospital.

Brain Damage competed for a number of different promotions throughout his career, but is best known for his work in Independent Wrestling Association Mid-South (IWA Mid-South) and Combat Zone Wrestling (CZW). In IWA Mid-South, Brain Damage formed a tag team with Deranged, known as the Vulgar Display of Power. They won the IWA Mid-South Tag Team Championship once and also won the IWA Mid- South Double Death Tag Team Tournament in both 2007 and 2008. In CZW, Brain Damage is a two time CZW Iron Man Champion and a two time CZW Ultraviolent Underground Champion. He held both the Iron Man Championship and the Ultraviolent Underground Championship simultaneously. Career =Independent Wrestling Association Mid-South= Brain Damage began wrestling in Independent Wrestling Association Mid-South (IWA Mid-South) in 2000, making his first appearance at the second night of the King of the Death Match tournament on October 21. He defeated his trainer, Toby Klein, in a singles match that was not a part of the tournament. His next appearance for the promotion was in 2005, when he competed in the 2005 edition of the annual King of the Deathmatch tournament. He lost his first round match, an \\"Unlucky Seven Staple Gun match\\" on the first night of the tournament to Mitch Page and Tank, who both qualified for the second round. In 2006, Damage began competing primarily for IWA Mid-South. It was during this time that he formed the tag team the Vulgar Display of Power with Deranged, with the two making their first IWA Mid-South appearance on January 20, 2006 at The Edge of Insanity, where they unsuccessfully challenged for the NWA Midwest Tag Team Championship in a scramble match. Just under a month later at Hardcore Hell and Back on February 17, the Vulgar Display of Power lost to Necro Butcher and Toby Klein in a three-way street fight, which also involved the team of Corporal Robinson and Mitch Page. The following night, at Payback, Pain and Agony, Damage lost to Klein in a singles match. After a short hiatus, Damage returned to IWA Mid- South at the end of March, when the Vulgar Display of Power defeated Corporal Robinson and Hardcore Craig at Hurt. A week later, at We're No Joke, Team Underground (Chandler McClure and Eric Priest) defeated the Vulgar Display of Power, however, the Vulgar Display of Power were able to defeat The Iron Saints (Sal and Vito Thomaselli) at the following show. In June, Damage competed in the 2006 King of the Deathmatch tournament, defeating Darin Childs, his tag team partner Deranged, and Tank en route to the final, where he lost in a four-way \\"House of Pain Total Elimination match\\". Following the tournament, Damage took another hiatus from IWA Mid-South, returning in August at Simply the Best 7, when the Vulgar Display of Power defeated Ian Rotten and Drake Younger to win the IWA Mid-South Tag Team Championship. The following night, Damage defeated Younger in a \\"first to two straight falls barbed wire board barbed wire bat match\\". Following this match, in October, Damage announced his retirement from professional wrestling and vacated the IWA Mid- South Tag Team Championship. Despite this, Damage returned to wrestling a few months later, and eventually returned to IWA Mid-South in June 2007 competing at the 2007 King of the Deathmatch tournament, where he reached the semi- finals before losing to Freakshow. The Vulgar Display of Power defeated The Devil‚Äôs Rejects (Tank and Iceberg) and Six Feet Under (Insane Lane and Freakshow) and Darin Childs and Massive in a four-way tag team hardcore rumble match at Point Proven later that month, before taking another hiatus until October. On October 26, the Vulgar Display of Power won the 2007 Double Death Tag Team Tournament by defeating Ian Rotten and Insane Lane in a House of Horrors match in the final. Damage did not appear in IWA Mid-South again until March 2008, when the Vulgar Display of Power accompanied to the ring by HalfBreed Billy Gram, defeated Mean n' Hard (Mitch Page and Rollin Hard) at IWA Mid-South's 500th show. Damage returned to IWA Mid-South in October to join Deranged to compete in the 2008 Double Death Tag Team Tournament. The team was accompanied to the ring by Halfbreed Billy Gram, and even though they were still billed as Vulgar Display of Power, they were openly representing Cult Fiction. After defeating The Tough Crazy Bastards (Toby Klein and Necro Butcher), Corporal Robinson and Tracy Smothers, and Dysfunction and Danny Havoc en route to the final, they defeated Drake Younger and Devon Moore to win the tournament for the second year in a row. =Combat Zone Wrestling= Damage began competing for Combat Zone Wrestling (CZW) in 2005, appearing at their Tournament of Death IV show on July 30 in New Castle, Delaware. In his first round match, he defeated Beef Wellington in a two out of three falls tables match after winning the third fall by powerbombing Wellington through a \\"Light Tube Table\\". He lost his second round match to Necro Butcher, however, in a fans bring the weapons match, where the fans at the show provided the weapons used during the match. In 2006, Damage participated in the Tournament of Death V, defeating Necro Butcher and Toby Klein in a Fans Bring The Weapons Death match, by eliminating Klein to eliminate him from the tournament. He won a four-way Barbed Wire and Panes of Glass Death match in the second round, but was defeated by Nick Gage in the final. Damage began competing full-time for CZW in 2007, competing mainly in singles competition. On April 7, at Out With the Old, In With the New, Damage defeated Danny Havoc, before Drake Younger at Restore the Order in May to win the CZW Ultraviolent Underground Championship. After the match, he quickly established himself as a villainous character by joining Maven Bentley's faction, also including Mitch Ryder and DJ Hyde, and being involved in a scripted altercation with Lobo. Damage also competed at Tournament of Death VI, but lost to Drake Younger in the final. Damage defended the Ultraviolent Underground Championship against Younger at Dishonorable Conduct in August, however, the match ended in a double pin, so the owner of CZW, Zandig vacated the championship. At TOD: Fast Forward, Damage won a four-way elimination match to win the vacant championship. Damage also competed at Cage of Death 9, but was eliminated from the Cage of Death match. On January 12, 2008, Damage defeated Joker in a 20-minute Iron Man Home Run Derby Deathmatch in overtime, to retain the Ultraviolent Underground Championship and win the CZW Iron Man Championship. At the following CZW show, 9 F'N Years, Damage lost the Ultraviolent Underground Championship back to Younger, although he still remained the Iron Man Champion. He dropped the Iron Man Championship to DJ Hyde at Summer School in a four-way match, which also involved Danny Havoc and Insane Lane. The following month, on July 12, Damage defeated Hyde to win back the championship.

He came from a very prosperous background and had the fortune of sponsoring the expenditures of the Master and his devotees when the Master lived in Calcutta in his last days. He was also known as Suresh Chandra Mitra, but Sri Ramakrishna called him \\"Surendra\\". Suresh lived in Simulia Street, the same locality as Narendranath (Swami Vivekananda). Biography Mitra was probably born in 1850. Little is known about his early life except that it was carefree and open, like that of many rich people in erstwhile Bengal. According to his own testimony, Mitra was initially indifferent towards religion.\\"Lay Disciples of Sri Ramakrishna\\", belurmath.org, 2012. =Meeting with Sri Ramakrishna= Mitra probably met Sri Ramakrishna in 1880, when he (near age 30) went there in company with another prominent householder disciple, Ram Chandra Datta. Ramakrishna accepted him with all his past vices and preached to him on self- surrender. From then on Mitra, became a frequent visitor to Dakshineswar temple. =Contribution towards Ramakrishna Movement= Mitra had several notable contributions towards the early growth of the Ramakrishna Order. While Sri Ramakrishna was in Dakshineswar, he supplied Rs 10/- every month for the devotees of Sri Ramakrishna.The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna by M Though small in amount, the sum went a long way in meeting the daily needs of the devotees who stayed with the Master. Sri Ramakrishna suffered from a terminal throat cancer and had to be shifted to the city of Calcutta. Naturally many devotees thronged to the place where he lived. The young devotees like Swami Vivekananda spent almost all their time serving the Master in those days. This was the time when they took the oath of renunciation. They left their homes and dedicated their lives to serving the Master. Mitra bore the entire expenditure of the Cossipore Garden House (about Rs 60 per month), where Sri Ramakrishna spent his last days. He also joined with other householder disciples to bear the expenses of his monastic brother disciples. Mitra commissioned the famous oil painting in which Sri Ramakrishna points out the harmony of religions to Keshab Chandra Sen. After the Master left his body, the young devotees of Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa were told to go back home. Their spiritual practices were hindered due to lack of funding, and they had to go through a difficult phase of life. It was in this phase that Sri Ramakrishna appeared in a vision to Mitra and scolded him for neglecting his children.\\"Ramakrishna Math, Baranagar\\", rkmbaranagar.org, 2012. According to The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna, volume 5, Mitra had come to Narendra (Swami Vivekananda) and requested that he find a house where the monastic disciples could reside. It was also a place where the householder disciples could come and spend some time in solitude, away from the din and bustle - \\"A cool haven for the unfortunate ones being roasted in the crucible of the world\\". He promised that he would sponsor its rent. Thus began the formation of Baranagar Math, which was later moved first to Alambazar and then to Belur. Mitra immediately jumped into action and rented a house where the young monks could stay. It was in Baranagore, midway north between Calcutta and Dakshineswar. He also sponsored a part of their expenses and spent around Rs 100 a month meeting their expenses. Many other household devotees of the Master followed Mitra's example. Swami Vivekananda and other young disciples began living in an old neglected house where they focused on their spiritual practices. During the construction of Belur Math, the marble flooring in the shrine-room was installed using a lump sum of money that Mitra had set aside for the Math. =Devotion and loyalty towards Sri Ramakrishna= According to The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna by Mahendranath Gupta and other literary sources on Sri Ramakrishna, Mitra was one of the most faithful household devotees. The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna also illustrates many vices of Mitra. However his most significant contribution was his steadfast loyalty and unwavering faith to his Master. While being engaged in his family Durga Puja, he had a vision that the Master himself was present in the Puja, though Sri Ramakrishna was then bed- ridden in Shyampukur. Later, Ramakrishna himself recounted this incident to Mitra.Ramakrishna Leela Prasanga, by Swami Saradananda, Udbodhan publishers\\"Shyam Pukur Bati Sri Ramkrishna Smaran Sangha\\", shyampukurbati.org, 2012. =Death= Mitra died on 25 May 1890, at the age of forty, in Kolkata (Calcutta). Little is known about his death except Swami Vivekananda's lament to his disciple Sarat Chandra Chakravarty that Mitra's family did not allow his brother disciples to look after him, presumably because of their fear of losing their property to the Ramakrishna Order. The exact conversation is provided here: > \\"Disciple: Sir, I have heard that you did not see him very often while he > was dying. > > Swamiji: We could only do so if we were allowed [by his relatives]. Well, > it is a long tale. But know this for certain that among worldly people it is > of little count to your relatives and kinsmen whether you live or die.

A specialist right-hand batsman, Carroll was born and raised in South Melbourne, and joined the local South Melbourne Cricket Club as a youth. He had a long association with South, and during the 1930s he coached the future Australian cricket captains Lindsay Hassett and Ian Johnson, as well as Australia's greatest all-rounder, Keith Miller. When he turned 18, Hughie and his brother Eddie crossed over to North Melbourne Cricket Club and he made his 1st XI debut in 1903/04 and played 5 seasons at the club. While playing for North Melbourne he was also called up for Victoria, debuting in 1905/06. In 1908, he joined the East Melbourne Cricket Club. This culminated in a successful period for club and state. In his third season for Victoria (1907/08) he scored consistently and made 61 against the touring English team, which put his name up as a possible Australian selection. But, this was not to be, although on 12 February 1909 he played for the Rest of Australia XI (Australia A) against the Australian test team, scoring 69 runs in the first innings. He stayed at East Melbourne until the outbreak of the First World War. With cricket going into recess, Hughie retired from all forms of cricket. He was 29. After the resumption of District Cricket in 1918, Hughie came out of retirement, returning to the 1st XI ranks at Northcote Cricket Club in December 1918 and staying there until the end of the 1923/24 season. He even returned to the Victorian team for 2 games, one in 1922 and the other in 1924. By then he was 39 years of age. Hughie then played 2 seasons for Fitzroy Cricket Club in 1924/25 and 1925/26. In total, Carroll played 37 first-class matches for the modest return of 1,706 runs at an average of 26.24.

In season 1926/27 he averaged 70; in 1927/28 he average 111; and in 1928/29 he averaged 109, including a remarkable 14 centuries! In that season‚Äôs final he made 301 not out of a total of 404. He was then appointed coach of Shepparton Cricket Club at the Annual General Meeting on Monday 16 September 1929 and made 141 in his first game for the club. By now he was 44 years of age, but in 10 games for the club he scored 450 runs at an average of 56.25. Work then took him to Benalla in January 1930. In 1931 Hughie had returned to Melbourne, remarkably returning to 1st XI District Cricket with St Kilda Cricket Club at the age of 46.

The school was established in 2005 under the patronage of HH Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the United Arab Emirates and Ruler of Dubai. The founding Executive Dean was Yassar Jarrar. According to the school‚Äôs Web site, it ‚Äúaims to promote good governance through enhancing the region‚Äôs capacity for effective public policy.‚Äù The school works to achieve its mission through a four-pronged approach, including applied research in public policy and management, academic programs in public policy and public administration, executive education programs, and knowledge forums for scholars and policy makers. Applied research The school conducts applied research in public policy and management, focusing on areas such as organizational development, public sector management, gender and public policy, e-government, education, economics, labor and demographics and disability policy. Research is conducted with an eye to academic rigor and to policy relevance for the Arab world. DSG has a series of publications, consisting primarily of policy briefs, working papers and reports. Academic programs On December 16, 2009, the school graduated its first cohort of 32 students in an intensive, one-year Master of Public Administration program. Designed for mid-level public sector professionals, the MPA program trains students in the theory and techniques of public sector management, and to help them better understand the political and social context in which public policies are designed and implemented and public services are provided. The MPA was conducted \\"in coordination with\\" the Harvard Kennedy School‚Äôs Faculty Advisory Committee, although there was little contact between the two schools and the formal affiliation ended in 2011. The MPA degree is awarded by DSG, not by Harvard University. DSG offers an Executive Diploma in Public Administration (EDPA) in partnership with the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore.. All DSG academic programs are accredited by the UAE Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research. Executive education The school conducts customized and open executive education programs through its faculty and in affiliation with the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University and the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore. Executive education clients have included organizations within the Dubai Government, as well as governments throughout the Arab world. In May 2008, the school signed a Memorandum of Understanding to provide academic and training programs for Egyptian government officials. A similar agreement was reached in July 2008 with the Government of Syria, and discussions are ongoing with officials in other governments throughout the Arab world. Public affairs The school provides a platform for public dialogue and knowledge exchange by convening conferences, lectures, seminars and policy forums. DSG's Distinguished Speakers Series has featured guests such as Lee Kuan Yew, Klaus Schwab, Lawrence Summers, John Chambers, David Ellwood, Joseph Nye, Francis Fukuyama, Suad Joseph, Kishore Mahbubani and Bob Graham. Conferences have included: \\"Best Practices in Entrepreneurship Policy\\" (November 2009), \\"Healthcare Challenges in the GCC\\" (November 2009) and \\"Natural Resources and Economic Development: Risks and Policy Challenges‚Äù (December 2009). The school hosts a Research Seminar Series, which brings together academics and researchers, serving as a focal point for the identification of research interests. The Dubai Initiative The Dubai School of Government had an affiliation with the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, that ended by 2011. This joint partnership, known as the Dubai Initiative, included funding, coordinating and facilitating fellowships, internships, faculty and graduate research grants, working papers, multi-year research initiatives, conferences, symposia, public lectures, policy workshops, faculty workshops, case studies and customized executive education programs.

Informally, an acceptor is a device with a finite state control, a finite number of input symbols, and an internal store with a read and write function. Each acceptor has a start state and a set of accepting states. The device reads a sequence of symbols, transitioning from state to state for each input symbol. If the device ends in an accepting state, the device is said to accept the sequence of symbols. A family of acceptors is a set of acceptors with the same type of internal store. The study of AFA is part of AFL (abstract families of languages) theory.Seymour Ginsburg, Algebraic and automata theoretic properties of formal languages, North-Holland, 1975, . Formal definitions =AFA Schema= An AFA Schema is an ordered 4-tuple (\\\\Gamma, I, f, g), where # \\\\Gamma and I are nonempty abstract sets. # f is the write function: f : \\\\Gamma^* \\\\times I \\\\rightarrow \\\\Gamma^* \\\\cup \\\\\\\\{\\\\empty\\\\\\\\} (N.B. * is the Kleene star operation). # g is the read function, a mapping from \\\\Gamma^* into the finite subsets of \\\\Gamma^*, such that g (\\\\epsilon) = \\\\\\\\{ \\\\epsilon \\\\\\\\} and \\\\epsilon is in g(\\\\gamma) if and only if \\\\gamma = \\\\epsilon. (N.B. \\\\epsilon is the empty word). # For each \\\\gamma in g(\\\\Gamma^*), there is an element 1_\\\\gamma in I satisfying f(\\\\gamma', 1_\\\\gamma) = \\\\gamma' for all \\\\gamma' such that \\\\gamma is in g(\\\\gamma'). # For each u in I, there exists a finite set \\\\Gamma_u ‚äÜ \\\\Gamma, such that if \\\\Gamma_1 ‚äÜ \\\\Gamma, \\\\gamma is in \\\\Gamma_1^*, and f(\\\\gamma,u) e \\\\empty, then f(\\\\gamma,u) is in (\\\\Gamma_1 \\\\cup \\\\Gamma_u)^*. =Abstract family of acceptors= An abstract family of acceptors (AFA) is an ordered pair (\\\\Omega, \\\\mathcal{D}) such that: #\\\\Omega is an ordered 6-tuple (K, \\\\Sigma, \\\\Gamma, I, f, g), where ## (\\\\Gamma, I, f, g) is an AFA schema; and ## K and \\\\Sigma are infinite abstract sets #\\\\mathcal{D} is the family of all acceptors D = (K_1, \\\\Sigma_1, \\\\delta, q_0, F), where ##K_1 and \\\\Sigma_1 are finite subsets of K, and \\\\Sigma respectively, F ‚äÜ K_1, and q_0 is in K_1; and ##\\\\delta (called the transition function) is a mapping from K_1 \\\\times (\\\\Sigma_1 \\\\cup \\\\\\\\{ \\\\epsilon \\\\\\\\}) \\\\times g(\\\\Gamma^*) into the finite subsets of K_1 \\\\times I such that the set G_D = \\\\\\\\{ \\\\gamma  \\\\delta(q,a,\\\\gamma) ‚â† √∏ for some q and a \\\\\\\\} is finite. For a given acceptor, let \\\\vdash be the relation on K_1 \\\\times \\\\Sigma_1^* \\\\times \\\\Gamma^* defined by: For a in \\\\Sigma_1 \\\\cup \\\\\\\\{ \\\\epsilon \\\\\\\\}, (p,aw,\\\\gamma) \\\\vdash (p',w,\\\\gamma') if there exists a \\\\overline{\\\\gamma} and u such that \\\\overline{\\\\gamma} is in g(\\\\gamma), (p',u) is in \\\\delta(p,a,\\\\overline{\\\\gamma}) and f(\\\\gamma,u)=\\\\gamma'. Let \\\\vdash^* denote the transitive closure of \\\\vdash. Let (\\\\Omega, \\\\mathcal{D}) be an AFA and D = (K_1, \\\\Sigma_1, \\\\delta, q_0, F) be in D. Define L(D) to be the set \\\\\\\\{ w \\\\in \\\\Sigma_1^*  \\\\exists q \\\\in F . (q_0,w,\\\\epsilon) \\\\vdash^* (q,\\\\epsilon,\\\\epsilon)\\\\\\\\}. For each subset \\\\mathcal{E} of \\\\mathcal{D}, let \\\\mathcal{L}(\\\\mathcal{E}) = \\\\\\\\{L(D)  D \\\\in \\\\mathcal{E} \\\\\\\\}. Define L_f(D) to be the set \\\\\\\\{ w \\\\in \\\\Sigma_1^*  \\\\exists(q \\\\in F)\\\\exists(\\\\gamma \\\\in \\\\Gamma^*) . (q_0,w,\\\\epsilon) \\\\vdash^* (q,\\\\epsilon,\\\\gamma)\\\\\\\\}. For each subset \\\\mathcal{E} of \\\\mathcal{D}, let \\\\mathcal{L}_f(\\\\mathcal{E}) = \\\\\\\\{L_f(D)  D \\\\in \\\\mathcal{E} \\\\\\\\}. Informal discussion =AFA Schema= An AFA schema defines a store or memory with read and write function. The symbols in \\\\Gamma are called storage symbols and the symbols in I are called instructions. The write function f returns a new storage state given the current storage state and an instruction. The read function g returns the current state of memory. Condition (3) insures the empty storage configuration is distinct from other configurations. Condition (4) requires there be an identity instruction that allows the state of memory to remain unchanged while the acceptor changes state or advances the input. Condition (5) assures that the set of storage symbols for any given acceptor is finite. =Abstract family of acceptors= An AFA is the set of all acceptors over a given pair of state and input alphabets which have the same storage mechanism defined by a given AFA schema. The \\\\vdash relation defines one step in the operation of an acceptor. L_f(D) is the set of words accepted by acceptor D by having the acceptor enter an accepting state. L(D) is the set of words accepted by acceptor D by having the acceptor simultaneously enter an accepting state and having an empty storage. The abstract acceptors defined by AFA are generalizations of other types of acceptors (e.g. finite state automata, pushdown automata, etc.). They have a finite state control like other automata, but their internal storage may vary widely from the stacks and tapes used in classical automata. Results from AFL theory The main result from AFL theory is that a family of languages \\\\mathcal{L} is a full AFL if and only if \\\\mathcal{L} = \\\\mathcal{L}(\\\\mathcal{D}) for some AFA (\\\\Omega, \\\\mathcal{D}). Equally important is the result that \\\\mathcal{L} is a full semi- AFL if and only if \\\\mathcal{L} = \\\\mathcal{L}_f(\\\\mathcal{D}) for some AFA (\\\\Omega, \\\\mathcal{D}).

Shiprock, New Mexico. The Navajo Section is a physiographic section of the larger Colorado Plateaus Province, which in turn is part of the larger Intermontane Plateaus physiographic Division. Geography The Navajo Section is located in northeastern Arizona and northwestern New Mexico. It is named for the Navajo Nation, with about half of the area of the section on the Navajo Reservation. The section is characterized by broad rolling plains on easily eroded and carved rocks, with cuestas (ridges) and tablelands capped by gently dipping resistant sandstone beds. One of the most prominent landform features of the Navajo Section is Shiprock, a monadnock formation near the town of Shiprock, New Mexico. =Elevations= The lowest point in the Navajo Section is about , near the Four Corners area. The boundary between this section and the Canyon Lands Section is nearby, in the San Juan River basin. The highest point of the Navajo Section is at Chromo Mountain on the Continental Divide near Chama, New Mexico. =Adjacent= Adjacent to the Navajo Section are the: # Canyon Lands Section to the north. # Rio Grande rift of the Basin and Range Province to the east. # Acoma-Zuni Section to the south. # Grand Canyon Section to the west Geology and physiography The area is predominately generally horizontal sandstone beds with some shale sequences of late Cretaceous and early Cenozoic age. A few areas of the section also have abundant volcanic necks and buttes, but due to the arid weather and soft sandstone, many of the rock formations of the area have eroded to form distinctive features of long cuestas, shallow canyons and valleys, narrow fan terraces, undulating plateaus, isolated mesas, steep hills, and some shale badlands. ;San Juan Basin Near the Four Corners area is a steeply tilted monocline known as The Hogback, which trends southwestward from where the San Juan River enters the area. Here the San Juan River flows into an area known as the San Juan Basin, where the western San Juan Basin is typified by exposures of the Fruitland and Menefee Formations. A stepped sequence of high stream terraces, present above the San Juan River and its tributaries, represents abandoned Pleistocene flood plains.

Stob Choire Claurigh (Scottish Gaelic: Stob Choire Clamhraidh) is a Scottish mountain situated east of Fort William in the Lochaber district of the Highland council area. It is part of one of the best ridge walks on the Scottish mainland.\\"100 Best Routes on Scottish Mountains\\" Page 72 ‚ÄúOne of the longest and most entertaining ridge walks on the (Scottish) mainland‚Äù. Overview Stob Choire Claurigh stands in the Grey Corries, a group of mountains strung out along an eight km long ridge which never falls below the 800 metre (2,600 ft) contour and includes twelve summits, four of which reach Munro status. Stob Choire Claurigh is the highest of the Grey Corries reaching a height of 1,177 metres (3,862 ft). The upper part of the mountain and the main section of the ridge is composed of pale grey quartzite rocks and scree making an eye-catching sight which is well seen from the villages of Spean Bridge and Roybridge and the A86 road which runs between them. The mountains name translates from the Gaelic language as ‚ÄúPeak of the Brawling Corrie‚Äù, taken from the verb clamhras which means clamouring or brawling. The name refers to the roaring of the many stags, which inhabit the corries of the mountain in the breeding season.\\"The Munros\\" Page 76 Gives details of translation.\\"The Magic of the Munros\\" Page 67 Gives details of translation. Geography Stob Choire Claurigh is a substantial mountain which includes four subsidiary tops (three of which are listed in the 1997 edition of Munro's Tables),The Munros and Tops 1891-1997. Spreadsheet giving details of changes to Munro's Tables at each revision. four high corries and long, forested, northern slopes which descend to the valley of the River Spean. Three main ridges radiate from the summit. The northern ridge descends for two km to the ‚ÄúMunro Top‚Äù of Stob Coire Gaibhre (958 metres) continuing for a further two km to the Forestry Commission owned Leanachan Forest where it broadens into the Spean valley. Four hundred metres from the summit on the northern ridge is the North Top (1121 metres), at this point a spur goes east to the subsidiary summit of Stob Coire na Ceannain (1123 metres), offering easy scrambling. This eastern spur can be used as a means of ascent up rough, stony slopes from the Lairig Leachach pass. The two other ridges link to adjacent Munros, with the south ridge connecting to Stob Ban, 1.5 km distant, over a col with a height of 803 metres. The twisting, high level SW ridge continues for three km over the ‚ÄúMunro Top‚Äù of Stob a‚Äô Choire L√®ith (1105 metres) to link to the Munro of Stob Coire an Laoigh. The four principal corries on the mountain are steep walled, holding snow well into the spring with streams which rise at around the 1000 metre mark, they drain in various directions but all eventually feed the River Spean, reaching the west coast at Loch Linnhe. Ascents and view The most popular starting point for the direct ascent of Stob Choire Claurigh is Corriechoille farm (grid reference ) at the end of the minor road from Spean Bridge. The route follows the Lairig Leacach track through a short section of the Leanachan Forest, the track is left immediately after the forest and steep slopes are climbed on the right hand side to reach the north east ridge. The ridge is followed over Stob Coire Gaibhre and along the rim of Coire na Ceannain which gives airy views down to its circular lochan, to reach the summit which is marked by a pile of quartzite boulders. There is a fine view from the top, especially to the SW where there is a fine outlook of the switchbacks and tops of the Grey Corries ridge backed by Aonach Beag and Ben Nevis. Many walkers will continue SW along the Grey Corries ridge descending eventually by the north ridge of Stob Coire an Laoigh down to the forest and eventually Corriechoille.\\"The Munros\\" Page 76 Gives details of ascent from Corriechoille.

Macaulay studied at King's College in Aberdeen, graduating in 1782. He became qualified as a Presbyterian preacher in 1785 but instead became a school teacher on the Isle of Skye. In 1790, he married Mary Macdonald. In 1802, Macaulay began recruiting settlers for the Earl of Selkirk for a proposed settlement in Upper Canada near the current site of Sault Ste Marie. Later the following year, the location was changed to Prince Edward Island. Macaulay was granted a M.D. from the University of Glasgow in 1803 before his departure. On the island, he built a chapel on his property at Point Prim, where he also taught school. He was granted a licence to practice law by Governor Joseph Frederick Wallet DesBarres but Peter Magowan, the island's attorney general, protested this on the grounds that Macaulay had no formal legal training and was also a preacher. In 1809, he joined the Loyal Electors, a group critical of the island's ruling elite, particularly Lord Selkirk. Macaulay served as speaker for the legislative assembly from 1818 to 1824.

On 17 August the three ships got caught near a sandbank, 157 miles north and 51 miles east of Sandy Cape. With shrinking leeway, both Cato and Porpoise grounded. Bridgewater sailed on, despite knowing that the other two vessels had come to grief. The crew and passengers of the wrecked vessels were able to land on a sandbank as both their ships broke up. On 26 August 1803 with no sign of rescue, Porpoise passenger Matthew Flinders and Captain John Park of Cato took the largest cutter (which they named Hope), and twelve crewmen and headed to Sydney to seek rescue. Through marvelous navigation, Hope made it to Port Jackson by 8 September. Although three lives had been lost in the joint shipwreck, , and the schooners and , were able to rescue all the remaining passengers. Rolla then took the people she had rescued to Canton.

They form a narrow chain of reefs with small cays that extends for around in a west to east line. Cato also gave its name to the nearby Cato Reef, which it discovered.

Born as Gordon Langley Hall, Simmons lived her first decades as a male. As a young adult, she became close to British actress Dame Margaret Rutherford, who she considered an adoptive mother, and who was the subject of a biography Simmons wrote in later years. After sex reassignment surgery in 1968, Simmons wed in the first legal interracial marriage in South Carolina.  Early life  Simmons' parents were servants at Sissinghurst Castle, the English estate of biographer Harold Nicolson and his novelist wife, Vita Sackville-West. Simmons was born in Sussex as Gordon Langley Hall to Jack Copper, Vita Sackville-West's chauffeur, and another servant, Marjorie Hall Ticehurst, before they were married. Although she claimed to have been born with an unusual condition that resulted in the swelling of her genitals with the result that she was mistakenly identified as a boy, Charleston author Edward Ball's book Peninsula of Lies (2004) states that she was born male. As a child, Simmons was raised by her grandmother and at one point visited the castle and met Virginia Woolf, Sackville-West's lover. Woolf made Sackville-West the subject of the novel Orlando: A Biography, which bears a striking resemblance to Simmons' own life story.  Early career  In 1946 Simmons emigrated to Canada. Still living as a man, she crewcut her hair and became a teacher on the Ojibway native reserve on Lake Nipigon, experiences from which were translated into the best-selling Me Papoose Sitter (1955)‚Äîthe first of many published books. After a stint as an editor for the Winnipeg Free Press, Simmons moved back to England in 1947, to teach theatre at the Gregg School in Croydon, Surrey. She moved to the United States in 1950, and became the society editor for the Nevada Daily Mail in Missouri before moving to New York and working as the society editor of the Port Chester Daily Item. Shortly after moving to New York, Simmons met artist Isabel Whitney, beginning a friendship that would last until Whitney's death in 1962. During this time, Simmons began a prolific writing career, including a series of biographies which covered personalities such as Princess Margaret (1958), Jacqueline Kennedy (1964), Lady Bird Johnson (1967), and Mary Todd Lincoln (1970) among many more. While living in Whitney's New York townhouse in the 1950s, Simmons was introduced to Margaret Rutherford and her husband Stringer Davis. Rutherford, interested in meeting Simmons to discuss a role in a possible adaptation of Me Papoose Sitter, became enamored with the young author and she and Davis agreed to serve as unofficial adoptive parents. Subsequently, Simmons and Whitney purchased a house in Charleston, South Carolina, though Whitney would die two weeks later, leaving Simmons the house and $2 million. Move to South Carolina The mansion Simmons purchased with Whitney, was located in the Ansonborough neighbourhood of Charleston, a neighbourhood known for housing the city's queer elite. Simmons began restoring the house, and designed the interior with early American antiques and furniture by Thomas Chippendale. Much later, shortly before her death, her pursuit of Chippendale pieces brought her into contact with Edward Ball, a journalist whose family had owned a Chippendale-style commode, and who would later write a biography about her. In her autobiographical books, Simmons said she was born intersex with ambiguous genitalia, as well as an internal uterus and ovaries, and was inappropriately assigned male at birth. Simmons underwent sex reassignment surgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital in 1968, carried out by Dr. Milton Edgerton. In Ball's Peninsula of Lies, he disputes Simmons claim that she was intersex, suggesting instead that Simmons had male genitalia and was unable to bear children.  Marriage  Simmons legally changed her name to Dawn Pepita Langley Hall, and became engaged to John-Paul Simmons, then a young black motor mechanic with dreams of becoming a sculptor. Their marriage on 21 January 1969 was the first legal interracial marriage in South Carolina, and the ceremony was carried out in their drawing room reportedly after threats to bomb the church. After a second ceremony in England, the crate containing their wedding gifts was firebombed in Charleston, and Simmons received a ticket the next day when the charred remains were obstructing a sidewalk. On 17 October 1971, her daughter, Natasha Margienell Manigault Paul Simmons, was born, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Ball claims to have been told by John-Paul Simmons that Natasha was his child from another relationship, although \\"Natasha fervently believed Dawn was her mother\\". After an intruder raped Simmons and broke her arm, the family moved to Catskill, New York. Later years and death In 1982, she divorced John-Paul Simmons, who had been abusive and suffered from schizophrenia. After spending several years in Hudson, New York, she moved in with her daughter and three grandchildren, who had returned to Charleston. In 1985, while back in Charleston, Simmons was featured as an extra in several scenes of ABC's miniseries North and South. In her final years, Simmons developed Parkinson's disease, and died at her daughter's home on 18 September 2000. In culture In the 1987 film Withnail and I, set in 1969, the character Marwood reads a tabloid newspaper article about Gordon Langley Hall, entitled \\"I Had to Become a Woman\\". Author Jack Hitt profiled Simmons in a 1996 episode of This American Life titled \\"Dawn\\". Hitt, a native of Charleston, had grown up down the street from Simmons. From interviews, including with Simmons, Hitt assembled stories of her transsexuality, interracial marriages in the South, her rumoured voodoo powers, and rumoured hosting of a full-fledged debut for her chihuahua. Hitt expanded the piece for publication in the October 1998 GQ.

It is most commonly found in the hills of the Roero, northwest of Alba, where it is part of the white Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita (DOCG) wines of Roero. It can also be used to produce DOC wines in Langhe.J. Robinson (ed) \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\" Third Edition pg 35 Oxford University Press 2006 Arneis (literally: little rascal, in Piemontese) is so called because it is regarded as a somewhat difficult variety to grow. It is a crisp and floral varietal, and has been grown for centuries in the region. The white wines made from the Arneis grape tend to be dry and full bodied with notes of pears and apricots.K. MacNeil The Wine Bible pg 331-333 Workman Publishing 2001 History Wine historians disagree on how long Arneis has been growing in the Piedmont region and under what name. A potential root of the name Arneis in the Piemontese dialect, renesi, makes an appearance in the description of several different grape varieties in the 15th century. Some historians believe that Arneis may be the Ranaysii grape that was documented in 1432 growing in the province of Turin around the village of Chieri. Around Canale in the province of Cuneo a Reneysium grape was documented in 1478. The first usage of the name Arneis appears in Italian ampelographer Count Giuseppe di Rovasenda's 1877 text where the grape was described as already being well established in Piedmont.J. Robinson, J. Harding and J. Vouillamoz Wine Grapes - A complete guide to 1,368 vine varieties, including their origins and flavours pg 54 Allen Lane 2012 Despite sharing several similar synonyms, Arneis has no genetic relationship to the notable Piedmontese red wine grape Nebbiolo but the two grapes do share a close historic relationship. For centuries the white Arneis grape was used to soften the tannins and harshness of Nebbiolo grape in the wines of the Barolo region, hence the common synonym of Nebbiolo bianco, Barolo bianco or \\"white Barolo\\".Oz Clarke Encyclopedia of Grapes pg 38 Harcourt Books 2001 In the vineyard, Arneis was often planted with Nebbiolo in a field blend with the aim of having the sweet scent of ripe Arneis berries attract birds and keep them away from the more valuable Nebbiolo clusters. In the 20th century, as Barolo producers begun focusing on 100% varietal Nebbiolo, acreage steadily declined almost to the point where the variety was on the verge of extinction. By the 1970s, only two producers were making any kind of Arneis, Bruno Giacosa and Vietti. The 1980s saw a renaissance in interest for white Piedmont wines and plantings began to increase. By 2000, there were . By 2006 the number of plantings of Arneis declined to around nearly all found in the Roero and Langhe region of Piedmont. Wine regions Most of the plantings of Arneis are found in the province of Cuneo in Piedmont where the grape is used in the wines of the Roero and Langhe DOCs. Arneis is found primarily in the Italian wine region of Piedmont where it is featured in the white DOC/G wines of Roero and Langhe. It is permitted as a blending grape in the red Nebbiolo based wines of Roero but its use in this capacity is today rarely seen. In 2004, nearly 1 million gallons (38,000 hectoliters) of DOC designated Arneis was produced in these two regions. Outside of Piedmont, limited plantings of the grape can be found in Liguria and on the Italian island of Sardinia. In the United States, Arneis is mostly found in California wine region of Sonoma County and the Oregon wine region of the Willamette Valley. Other American Viticultural Areas with some plantings of the grape include the Mendocino, Russian River Valley, Paicines and Santa Ynez Valley AVAs.Appellation America \\"Arneis\\", Accessed: September 2nd, 2013 It is also being grown in Willcox, Arizona. In the 21st century, plantings of Arneis have begun appearing the Australian wine regions of Tasmania, Victoria and New South Wales as well as the New Zealand wine region of Gisborne in the North Island. Viticulture and winemaking One of the classic flavor notes associated with Arneis is that of ripe pears. The Arneis vine can be a difficult grape to cultivate, with naturally low acidity and tendency to get over ripe if it is harvested after September. Additionally, the vine is prone to powdery mildew though recent cloning research has begun to isolate clones of Arneis that have more tolerance to mildew. The vine's propensity for low crop yields and for the wine to oxidize easily, contributed to its steady decline in the early to mid 20th century. Better understanding of the variety in the later half of the century helped revive the variety as winemakers found that the chalky, sandy soils around Roero gave the grapes more acidity and structure while Arneis grapes planted in sandy clay soil developed an elegant and exotic perfume. Arneis historical role has been as a softening for Nebbiolo, though today the grape is more commonly seen as a varietal wine. Wines fermented and/or aged in oak will be more full bodied while unoaked Arneis can have more aromatics and perfume. Arneis has the potential to produce highly perfumed wines with aromas of almonds, apricots, peaches, pears and hops. Some producers make a late harvest passito Arneis. Synonyms Arneis is also known under the synonyms Bianchetta, Bianchetta d'Alba, Bianchetta di Alba, Bianchetto, Bianchetto Albese, Bianchetto di Alba, Bianchetto di Verzuolo, and Nebbiolo bianco.Arneis, Vitis International Variety Catalogue, accessed 2010-11-23 References Category:White wine grape varieties Category:Wine grapes of Italy Category:Piedmont ","title":"Arneis"},{"id":"14891438","title":"Irish and Breton twin towns"},{"id":"14891445","text":"Parap is an inner suburb of the city of Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia. History Parap derived its name from that applied by Dr John A Gilruth, first Commonwealth Administrator in 1912. He applied the name Paraparap (believed to have been a pastoral property of Dewing near Moriac, Geelong), but had to abbreviate it to Parap later during his term. Parap was also the staging point to the event known as the Darwin Rebellion, on 17 December 1918, in protest against Gilruth's administration. Parap became well known as the 2¬Ω Mile in subsequent years, being near the Railway Workshop when the train ran in pre-World War II years.Northern Territory Government In 1919, when the England to Australia air race was announced, Darwin airport was established in the suburb of Parap to act as the Australian Terminal. Darwin hence operated two airports, a civilian airport and a military field. In 1945, the Department of Aviation made the existing Darwin military airfield available for civil aviation purposes. As a result, the civilian airport at Parap was closed down and airport operations combined with the military airport. The London- Australia Air Race was actually a means of returning Australian Flying Corps pilots and crews to Australia after the cessation of hostilities ‚Äì they were required to fly their aircraft home, with a ¬£10,000 prize as the incentive for the first aircraft manned by Australians to reach Australia in less than 30 days before the end of 1919. Having departed Hounslow Heath Aerodrome near London on 12 November, Ross and Keith Smith landed their Vickers FB27 Vimy G-EAOU 40 at Darwin aerodrome at 3.05 pm on Friday 10 December 1919 and were met by the Acting Administrator, Staniforth Smith. They had accomplished the first ever flight from Europe to Australia, a distance of 18,500 kilometres, in 27 days and 20 hours. The following day, the Acting Administrator entertained the heroes at Government House, where they were joined by Lieutenant Hudson Fysh DFC, another veteran of the Light Horse and No.1 Squadron AFC, who had been responsible for clearing the airstrip at Fannie Bay. The aerodrome in Darwin at which they landed was in the suburb of Parap, near the site of the present pool. Parap is well known for its streets being named after early Australian aviators and explorers including; Ross Smith Avenue, Hudson Fysh Avenue, Leichhardt Crescent and Gregory Street. Present day Parap is a predominantly residential suburb and is usually associated with its sister suburb, Fannie Bay and the adjacent inner suburbs of Ludmilla and Stuart Park. Price Street in Parap was named after Mr Edward W.

It was the writer/artist duo's first published use of the name Superman, which they later applied to their archetypal fictional superhero. The title character of this story is a telepathic villain, rather than a physically powerful hero like the better- known character. (Although the name is hyphenated between syllables due to it being broken between pages on the story's opening spread, it is spelled Superman in the magazine's table of contents and in the story's text.) Publication High school friends Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster tried selling stories to magazines in order to escape Depression-era poverty. With their work rejected by publishers, 18-year-old Shuster produced the duo's own typed, mimeographed science fiction fanzine titled Science Fiction: The Advance Guard of Future Civilization, producing five issues. Siegel wrote \\"The Reign of the Superman\\" in 1932. Inspired by the spread of the term \\"Superman\\" in popular culture of their time and thus indirectly inspired by Friedrich Nietzsche's idea of a super-human (the √úbermensch), it featured a meek man transformed into a powerful villain bent on dominating the world. It appeared in issue #3 of the fanzine, with accompanying artwork by Shuster. Siegel published it under the pen name Herbert S. Fine, combining the first name of a cousin with his mother's maiden name. The term \\"Superman\\" derives from a common English translation of the term √úbermensch, which originated with Friedrich Nietzsche's statement, \\"Ich lehre euch den √úbermenschen\\" (\\"I will teach you all the Superman\\"), in his 1883 work Thus Spoke Zarathustra. The term \\"Superman\\" was popularized by George Bernard Shaw with his 1903 play Man and Superman. The character Jane Porter refers to Tarzan as a \\"superman\\" in the 1912 pulp novel Tarzan of the Apes by Edgar Rice Burroughs, and Siegel would later name Tarzan as an influence on the creation of his and Shuster's Superman. Story A mad scientist, a chemist named Professor Ernest Smalley, randomly chooses raggedly dressed vagrant Bill Dunn from a bread line and recruits him to participate in an experiment in exchange for \\"a real meal and a new suit\\". When Smalley's experimental potion grants Dunn telepathic powers, the man becomes intoxicated by his power and seeks to rule the world. This superpowered man uses these abilities for evil, only to discover that the potion's effects are temporary. Having killed the evil Smalley, who had intended to kill Dunn and give himself the same powers, Dunn cannot recreate the secret formula. As the story ends, Dunn's powers wear off and he realizes he will be returning to the bread line to be a forgotten man once more. Subsequent \\"Superman\\" characters In 1933, Siegel read a 48-page black-and- white comic book titled Dan Dunn. He decided that a Superman who was a hero could make a great comic character, and conceived a character as a hero bearing little resemblance to his villainous namesake. He wrote a crime story which Shuster drew in comic format. Titling it \\"The Superman\\", they offered it to Consolidated Book Publishing, the company that had published Detective Dan. Although the duo received an encouraging letter, Consolidated never again published comic books. Discouraged, Shuster burned all pages of the story, but the cover survived because Siegel rescued it from the fire. Siegel and Shuster compared the character to Slam Bradley, a private detective the pair later created for Detective Comics #1 (March 1937). \\"We had a great character,\\" Siegel later said, \\"and were determined it would be published.\\" Siegel and Shuster would next use the name in the story they sold to DC Comics, which published it in June 1938's Action Comics #1.

Founded in London in 1873 by Samuel Gluckstein and Barnett Salmon (1829-1897), they pursued an aggressive expansion to become the largest tobacco sellers in the UK, with over 140 retail outlets. They claimed however to be the largest tobacconist in the world. History The Gluckstein and Salmon families grew to prominence in the second half of the nineteenth century through their involvement in the tobacco industry.http://melbourneblogger.blogspot.ca/2012/11/lyons-tea-rooms- salmon-and-gluckstein.html Beginning as small-time cigar manufacturers, by the turn of the century Salmon and Gluckstein Ltd was the world's largest retail tobacconist, owning 140 retail outlets in 1901. Salmon and Gluckstein Ltd was bought by Imperial Tobacco in 1902 and the brand remained in prominence until 1955. The business was started in 1855 by Samuel Gluckstein who, having arrived in London in 1841 from Germany, began working in the Jewish tobacco industry. The first business operated from Crown Street, Soho, and by 1864, when the firm was incorporated, Samuel Gluckstein had been joined by Henry Gluckstein and Laurence Abrahams. By that date the business had relocated to 43 Leman Street. In 1870 a difference of opinion concerning the sharing of the profits resulted in the firm's dissolution. Henry Gluckstein and Laurence Abrahams went on to found Abrahams & Gluckstein, cigar manufacturers of 26 Whitechapel High Street, while Samuel Gluckstein formed a partnership with his two sons Isidore and Montague Gluckstein. They were also joined by Barnett Salmon, a tobacco salesman, who later became Samuel's son-in-law by marrying Helena Gluckstein. In 1873 Samuel Gluckstein died leaving the business to his two sons and Barnett Salmon. In that same year the company Salmon & Gluckstein Ltd. was established. In order to avoid future family disputes the three men decided to form a family fund by pooling their resources. The principle of the venture was to encourage the strong to support the weak, with each member withdrawing what was required. As the number of members increased over the years, a more ordered system developed, but essentially this tightly-organised pooling arrangement formed the basis of the bulk of the family's business activities from the late nineteenth century onwards. Until 1887 these business interests were centred on the firm of Salmon & Gluckstein, tobacco manufacturers and tobacconists. From 1887, however, Montague Gluckstein became interested in the idea of providing catering services for the large exhibitions which were sweeping Victorian Britain.http://melbourneblogger.blogspot.ca/2012/11/lyons-tea-rooms-salmon- and-gluckstein.html Judging the business of catering to be beneath them, the family only gave their support to Montague on the understanding that the family name would not be used. Accordingly, Montague began searching for a suitable figurehead for his new venture, finding him in Joseph Lyons, a distant family relation. As a result the family company of J. Lyons and Co. was formed.

Initially focused on soul music, it became one of the major outlets for reggae in the UK. History The label was set up by the Palmer Brothers - Harry, Jeff, and Carl - initially as a soul label, but later concentrating on Jamaican music, releasing rocksteady singles from 1967.Moskowitz, David V. (2006) Caribbean Popular Music: an Encyclopedia of Reggae, Mento, Ska, Rock Steady, and Dancehall, Greenwood Press, , p. 229-230 Much of the label's output was licensed from Jamaican producers such as Clancy Eccles, Alton Ellis, Bunny Lee, and Lee \\"Scratch\\" Perry, although they also released music by local talents such as Junior English and Delroy Washington. Derrick Morgan became one of Pama's biggest stars, having a UK chart hit with \\"Moon Hop\\". Pama's biggest hit came with Max Romeo's \\"Wet Dream\\", which reached #10 in the UK singles chart (despite lack of airplay, in part due to its risqu√© lyric), and sold over 250,000 copies. The rivalry between Pama and their main UK reggae competitor, Trojan Records, was clear, with Trojan's Tighten Up series of compilations and Pama's similarly titled Straighten Up series going head to head. The rivalry had been fueled by Bunny Lee's earlier licensing of Derrick Morgan's \\"Seven Letters\\" to both Pama and Trojan. Pama introduced a number of subsidiary labels, often associated with individual producers, including Pama Supreme, Supreme, Crab, Bullet, Gas, Nu Beat/New Beat (Laurel Aitken), Success (Rupie Edwards), Camel, Escort, Unity (Bunny Lee), and Punch (Lee \\"Scratch\\" Perry).Larkin, Colin:\\"The Virgin Encyclopedia of Reggae\\", 1998, Virgin Books, In addition to the many reggae releases, the label also released few non- reggae albums, including Butlins Red Coat Review, and an album commemorating the investiture of The Prince of Wales. The Pama label lasted until the mid-1970s, at which point Carl Palmer was the driving force, and concentrated on establishing a UK distribution network for reggae, later resurfacing as Jet Star, one of the largest distributors of reggae music. Pama Records is now owned by Phoenix Music International who continue to distribute the Pama label digitally.

After 42 years Walters, the United Kingdom's longest-serving artistic director, and his wife and associate director, Auriol Smith, stepped down from their posts at the Orange Tree Theatre in June 2014. Career =Early years= Sam Walters was educated at Felsted School and while there, in 1957, he won the Public Schools Debating Association public speaking competition. He also captained the Essex Young Amateurs cricket team. He then took a degree at Merton College, Oxford (1959‚Äì62), where he was president of the Experimental Theatre Club.

The Orange Tree was London's first purpose built Theatre in the Round. \\"When we started the Orange Tree Theatre in 1971, we only wanted to put on plays. There was no political or social aim, nor did we philosophise about theatre-in-the-round or a style of minimal theatre. There was no money for stage lights or a raised stage, so we performed by daylight on the same floor level as the seating. And we discovered the excitement of making the audience part of the action.\\" (Sam Walters in conversation with Marsha Hanlon for the Orange Tree Theatre appeal brochure in 1991). Walters won a Time Out Award for his 1987‚Äì88 season in the old theatre, being described as a \\"theatrical totter\\", and in 1989 was awarded a Winston Churchill Travelling Fellowship, part of which he spent in Prague during the Velvet Revolution, and part in Moscow and Leningrad.

He was a grandson of √çmar and a member of the U√≠ √çmair. Gofraid was most probably among those Vikings expelled from Dublin in 902, whereafter he helped his kinsman Ragnall conquer Northumbria. Another kinsman, Sitric C√°ech, became ruler of Dublin around the same time. Ragnall died in 920, and so the following year Sitric left Dublin to rule in Northumbria, and Gofraid succeeded Sitric as ruler of Dublin. Sitric's early reign was marked by raids he conducted against the native Irish, including one at Armagh. Sitric C√°ech died in 927 and Gofraid left for Northumbria, delegating authority in Dublin to his sons. This upset the sons of Sitric, who allied with a \\"son of Helgi\\", possibly Tomrair mac Ailchi of Limerick, and seized the city. This act began a period of conflict between the Vikings of Dublin and Limerick which would last until 937. Gofraid's attempt to rule in Northumbria was unsuccessful and he was driven out by √Üthelstan of England within six months. He returned to Dublin to eject the sons of Sitric and continued to rule as king there. Following his return he led further raids, including attacks on Kildare and Dunmore Cave. In 931 he led an attack on a camp established by the Vikings of Limerick at Mag Raigne, near the borders of Gofraid's kingdom, with the intent of containing Gofraid's power. Gofraid died of a sickness in 934 and he was succeeded as king by his son Amla√≠b mac Gofraid. Background The ruling Vikings of Dublin were expelled from the city in 902 by a joint force led by M√°el Finnia mac Flannac√°n, overking of Brega and Cerball mac Muirec√°in, overking of Leinster.Downham, p. 26 Those Vikings that survived the capture of the city split into different groups; some went to France, some to England, and some to Wales.Downham, p. 27-28; Fragmentary Annals of Ireland, ¬ß 429; Annales Cambriae, s.a. 902; Brenhinedd y Saesson, s.a. 903; Brut y Tywysogyon (Pen. 20), s.a. 903; Brut y Tywysogyon (RBH), s.a. 903 Archaeological evidence suggests Dublin remained occupied in the years immediately following this expulsion, perhaps indicating only the ruling elite were forced to leave.Downham, p. 27 However, Viking raids on Irish settlements continued, and in 914, a large Viking fleet travelled to Waterford.Sawyer, p. 97; Annals of the Four Masters, s.a. 914; Chronicon Scotorum, s.a. 914; Annals of Ulster, s.a. 914 The arrival of this fleet marked the re-establishment of Viking rule over parts of Ireland, and was followed by more Vikings settling in Limerick the following year.Downham, p. 31 The main historical sources for this period are the Norse sagas and the Irish annals. Some of the annals, such as the Annals of Ulster, are believed to be contemporary accounts, whereas the sagas were written down at dates much later than the events they describe and are considered far less reliable. A few of the annals such as the Fragmentary Annals of Ireland and the Annals of the Four Masters were also compiled at later dates, in part from more contemporary material and in part from fragments of sagas.Radner, p. 322-325 According to Downham, \\"apart from these additions [of saga fragments], Irish chronicles are considered by scholars to be largely accurate records, albeit partisan in their presentation of events\\".Downham, p. 12 Biography Gofraid is presumed to have left Dublin with the rest of the ruling Vikings in 902.Hart In 917 the Irish Annals describe two grandsons of √çmar, Sitric C√°ech and Ragnall, leading their fleets to Ireland.Downham, pp. 31, 273-274 Sitric sailed his fleet to Cenn Fuait in Leinster, and Ragnall sailed his fleet to Waterford. Niall Gl√∫ndub, overking of the Northern U√≠ N√©ill, saw these Vikings as a threat, and he marched an army south to repel them. Sitric and his army fought against the men of the U√≠ N√©ill at Mag Femen in County Tipperary and claimed victory, though only through timely reinforcement by Ragnall and his army.Annals of Ulster, s.a. 917; Annals of the Four Masters, s.a. 917 This was followed by another at the Battle of Confey (also known as the Battle of Cenn Fuait), against Augaire mac Ailella, overking of Leinster, who died in the battle. Augaire's death marked the end of effective opposition to the Vikings' return to Ireland. Sitric led his men on a triumphant return to Dublin, where he established himself as king, while Ragnall returned to England and soon became King of Northumbria. Gofraid is first mentioned in the annals by the Annals of Ulster in 918, which describe him leading a battalion of troops at the Battle of Corbridge in northern England.Annals of Ulster, s.a. 918 This battle was fought between Ragnall and Constant√≠n son of √Åed, the king of Scotland, and although it was indecisive it allowed Ragnall to establish himself as king at York. In the annals' account Gofraid is fully titled Gofraid ua √çmair (Gofraid, grandson of √çmar), making him brother or cousin of Ragnall and Sitric C√°ech.Downham, pp. 254-255 Ragnall died in 921 with Sitric C√°ech succeeding him as King of Northumbria.Downham, p. 34 Gofraid is mentioned by the annals that same year as taking control of Dublin. One of his first acts as King of Dublin was to lead a raid on Armagh. According to the Annals of Ulster and the Annals of the Four Masters the Dubliners ravaged a wide area, though the monastery and the prayer-houses with their culdees and the sick were spared.Annals of Ulster, s.a. 921; Annals of the Four Masters, s.a. 921 A portion of the raiders who headed northwards to Mag Ilesen were defeated by Aignert mac Murchada and Muirchertach mac N√©ill, later King of Ailech, and were forced to flee leaving many dead behind.Annals of Ulster, s.a. 921 Another raid was led by Gofraid in 924, this time sailing to the south of Ireland, taking many hostages. He took them to Rosscarbery, and according to the Annals of Ulster he also sailed to Limerick where he lost a large number of his followers in battle against the son of Ailchi, presumably Tomrair mac Ailchi.Annals of Ulster, s.a. 924; Annals of Inisfallen, s.a. 924 Two years later his son Albann led a raiding force north, landing at Linn Duachaill on 4 September. The raiders were attacked by the army of Muirchertach mac N√©ill, overking of the Northern U√≠ N√©ill, at the bridge of Cluain na Cruimther on 28 December and were routed. Albann and a large part of the force was killed, and around half of the army were besieged by the U√≠ N√©ill at Athcrathin in County Down for a week, until a force led by Gofraid relieved them.Annals of Ulster, s.a. 926; Annals of the Four Masters, s.a. 926; Downham, pp. 254-255 In 927 Gofraid's kinsman Sitric C√°ech, King of Northumbria, died. The Irish annals record the Gofraid left Ireland that year, along with a great many others from Dublin and Linns to claim Sitric's throne. During his absence it seems Gofraid delegated authority to his sons, thus (according to the Annals of Clonmacnoise) drawing the ire of the sons of Sitric. Sitric's sons allied with a \\"son of Helgi\\", probably Tomrair mac Ailchi of Limerick or a kinsman, and conquered Dublin, though this success was short-lived as Gofraid returned after only six months abroad.Downham, pp. 34-41 Gofraid's attempt to rule in Northumbria was unsuccessful, and he was driven out by King √Üthelstan. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle makes no mention of Gofraid, simply stating that √Üthelstan succeeded Sitric as King in Northumbria, and thereafter held a meeting with the other kings in Britain, establishing peace. A later account by William of Malmesbury tells a different story. In his version, Gofraid goes to \\"Scotia\\" following Sitric's death, to attend a meeting at Dacre with √Üthelstan, Constantine II of Scotland, and Owen I of Strathclyde. Instead, he and a Viking ally called Thurfrith lead a force to York and besiege the city. √Üthelstan turns on the Vikings and Gofraid is captured. The city is looted by the Anglo-Saxons and Gofraid is allowed to return to Ireland under oath. It is not certain how much of William's account is based on truthful historical sources and how much is made up.Woolf, p. 151 Following his return to Dublin, the next mention of Gofraid in contemporary accounts is with regards to raids he led. In 929 he plundered Kildare, and the following year he plundered Dunmore Cave, killing 1000 people in the attack. Expert opinion is divided, but it is believed that Dunmore Cave was perhaps being used as a temporary dwelling place, or perhaps as a place of burial for the native Irish.Moyes, p. 586 In 931 Gofraid left Dublin for Mag Raigne in Ossory, where the rival Vikings of Limerick had set up a camp following a failed attack on Connaught the previous year. The annals report that Gofraid's aim was to expel a grandson (or great-grandson) of √çmar from Mag Raigne, perhaps one of the sons of Sitric who had seized Dublin in 927 probably allied with the Limerick-based Tomrair mac Ailchi. Downham suggests that the establishment of the camp at Mag Raigne was an attempt by the Vikings of Limerick to limit the ability of Gofraid and his kin to project their power through Ireland. Chronicle evidence suggests the conflict between Dublin and Limerick lasted until 937 when Gofraid's son Amla√≠b won a victory at Lough Ree where he captured the Limerick king Olaf Scabbyhead and destroyed his ships. Gofraid did not live to see this victory, having died in 934, with Amla√≠b succeeding him as king of Dublin. The Annals of Ulster describe him as \\"a most cruel king of the Norsemen\\", and say he died of a sickness.Annals of Ulster, s.a. 934 Family In the annals Gofraid is identified by the use of \\"ua √çmair\\", meaning \\"grandson of √çmar\\", but never with a patronymic. As such, it is not possible to identify which of the three known sons of √çmar (B√°rid, Sichfrith or Sitriuc) - if any - was the father of Gofraid. One possible reason for the lack of a patronym might be that Gofraid was the child of a son of √çmar who never ruled Dublin, or who spent most of his time outside Ireland, thus making Gofraid's legitimacy to rule Dublin dependent on the identity of his grandfather, not his father. Another possibility is that Gofraid was a grandson of √çmar through a daughter, again with his right to rule dependent on his grandfather. Gofraid's kinsmen √çmar, Sitric, Amla√≠b and Ragnall are the other known grandsons of √çmar identified by the use of \\"ua √çmair\\". All except for Amla√≠b ruled as either King of Dublin or King of Northumbria at one time or another.Downham, p. 29 Four individuals are identifiable as sons of Gofraid. His son Amla√≠b succeeded Gofraid as King of Dublin, and eventually reclaimed Northumbria for the Vikings too. Another son, Albann, was killed in battle against Muirchertach mac N√©ill in 926. Bl√°caire mac Gofraid, King of Dublin from 940-945, was another son, as was Ragnall mac Gofraid who ruled Northumbria in 943 and 944, probably along with his cousin Amla√≠b Cuar√°n, until they were driven out by Edmund I of England.Downham, p. 111-112, 238, 248, 253 Later descendants include Camm√°n mac Amla√≠b, son of Gofraid's son Amla√≠b, who is recorded as being defeated in battle in 960, and also in 962 if he is identical to the individual recorded as \\"Sitriuc Cam\\". Gofraid mac Amla√≠b, recorded by the annals as dying in 963, may have been a brother of Camm√°n, or he may have been a son of Amla√≠b Cuar√°n.Downham, p. 249, 253 =Family Tree= See also *Gofraid mac Fergusa, a genealogical figure partly based upon fabricated annal entries concerning Gofraid ua √çmair Notes References =Citations= =Primary Sources= * Accessed via Internet Archive.  * * Accessed via Internet Archive. * * =Secondary Sources=  * Subscription or UK public library membership required.   * * External links * * CELT: Corpus of Electronic Texts at University College Cork.

It was created in 1982.\\"Andes\\" at EcuadorExplorer.com It covers 1462.80 km2, from two spurs of the eastern range of the Andes to the basins of the Nangaritza, Numbala, and Loyola rivers. About 85% of the park is in the province of Zamora Chinchipe, and the remainder is in the province of Loja. It is categorized as a megadiverse zone and an area with a high level of endemic species because it is a meeting point between four ecological systems: Northern Andes, Southern Andes, Amazonian, and Pacific.Guide to Pdocarpus National Park Although considerable knowledge has been gathered about its biodiversity in parts of the area, only a minority of the species inhabiting the park has been discovered so far. The Podocarpus National Park spans from lower montane rain forests at c. 1000m up to high elevation elfin forests at 3000 m. Paramo or subparamo vegetation is found at elevations >3000 m where a complex of more than 100 lagoons exists, among the best-known being the Lagunas del Compadre. The park has two main entrances. One is in 'Cajanuma Sector' c. 8 km south of Loja where elfin forest and paramo habitats at elevations between c. 2900 and 3500 m can be accessed. The other is in 'Bombuscaro Sector', corresponding to the Bombuscaro River in lower montane forest habitats at elevations from c. 1000 m upwards. There are two alternative entrances without park guards. The 'Romerillos Sector', corresponding to the Jambo√© River southeast of the Bombuscaro Sector is also an entrance for gold miners that work inside the park. Another entrance is at Cerro Toledo, east of the Yangana-Valladolid route in the southwestern part of the park. Flora The park contains an exceptionally diverse flora, and has been considered the 'Botanical Garden of America'. Its high and low mountain-forest ecosystems, located in the Nudo de Sabanilla pass, and its very humid mountain and premontane forests in the basin of the Numbala River, have more than 4,000 species of plants including trees that can measure up to 40 meters, like the romerillo (Podocarpus glomeratus) which gives its name to the park, and many other valuable species like the Cinchona - the national tree of Ecuador - and a huge variety of orchids. Among the main species found in the region are chilca (Baccharis sp.), laurel, San Pedro cactus, uvilla, black elder, pumamaqui (Oreopanax sp.), sappanwood, array√°n, cashoco, alder, acacia, sage, guato blanco, cedar, castor-oil plant, walnut, yumbingue (Terminalia guyanensis) and canel√≥n (Swartzia littlei). Fauna So far, 68 species of mammals have been recorded in the park and its surroundings; four of them are on Ecuador's \\"Red List\\" as either endangered or vulnerable: * Mountain tapir (Tapirus pinchaque) * Spectacled bear (Tremarctos ornatus) * Northern pudu (Pudu mephistophiles) * Jaguar (Panthera onca) Other notable mammals include: * Amazonian hog-nosed skunk (Conepatus semistriatus) * Common grey shrew opossum (Caenolestes fuliginosus) There are 560 registered species of birds, which accounts for 6% of all birds registered worldwide and 40% of the birds registered in Ecuador.Guide to Pdocarpus National Park For this reason it was identified in 1995 by Wedge and Long as one of the important areas for the conservation of neotropic birds.Guide to Pdocarpus National Park The area has also been identified as a diversity hotspot of insects such as geometrid moths. So far, 1,266 species of this family have been recorded in the northern part of the park and adjacent montane forests, a number exceeding any other place in the world. Tourist information The city of Loja is nearby, approximately 25‚Äì90 minutes from the two major entrances of Cananuma and Bombuscaro. There are three guided trails that take from 15 minutes (Speckled Bear Trail) to 1 hour and 20 minutes (Cloud Forest Trail). There are longer trails for those who prefer to backpack or camp. It costs $10 to enter for foreign adults (less for Ecudaoreans, children, and seniors).Loja city Tourist information Visitors can also enter from Vilcabamba and Zamora, which are both located directly next to the national park. Climate The rainy season varies throughout the park. In the east the rainy season is March - July, while in the west the rainy season is October - December. The mean temperature at high elevations is 12 ¬∞C (54 ¬∞F) while in the lower parts of the park it is 18 ¬∞C (64 ¬∞F).Loja city Tourist information  External links  References Category:National parks of Ecuador Category:Biosphere reserves of Ecuador Category:Protected areas established in 1982 Category:Geography of Loja Province Category:Geography of Zamora-Chinchipe Province Category:Tourist attractions in Loja Province Category:Tourist attractions in Zamora-Chinchipe Province Category:1982 establishments in Ecuador ","title":"Podocarpus National Park"},{"id":"14891740","title":"Jordi Burillo"},{"id":"14891751","text":"Preparing 463L pallets for the air transport of Tricon containers.

He was born and died in Munich. Biography Karl Ritter von Halt was a track and field athlete who competed in the 1912 Summer Olympics. He finished 22nd in the javelin throw competition and 14th in the shot put event. He also participated in the pentathlon competition. There he was eliminated in the third event because he did not finish his 200 m run. He also participated as a member of the German team in the first round of the 4x100 metre relay competition. Halt finished ninth in the decathlon. He nearly won the decathlon at the 1914 Baltic Games in Malm√∂, losing to Finland's Johan Svanstr√∂m by a fraction of a point after a calculation error had been fixed. In 1921 he became Karl Ritter von Halt after he received the Military Order of Max Joseph. In 1936 he was named President of the Committee for the organization of the Fourth Winter Olympics in Garmisch by Reichssportf√ºhrer Hans von Tschammer und Osten. Karl Ritter von Halt was elected as member of the Executive Committee of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1937, a post he held until 1945. In 1944 Karl Ritter von Halt led the Sports Office of the Third Reich, Nationalsozialistischer Reichsbund f√ºr Leibes√ºbungen (NSRL), taking over from Arno Breitmeyer as Reichssportf√ºhrer. He remained the NSRL leader until the office and the organization were disbanded in 1945 following Nazi Germany's defeat in World War II. Karl Ritter von Halt was successful in clearing his past as Nazi leader in the post-war years, although tourists to Garmisch protested in 2006 that the town's football stadium was still named after him. It was quietly renamed Stadion am Gr√∂ben. Ritter von Halt led the National Olympic Committee of Germany between 1951 and 1961, succeeding Duke Adolf Friedrich of Mecklenburg.

The salivary glands are classified as major or minor. The major salivary glands consist of the parotid, submandibular, and sublingual glands. The minor salivary glands consist of 800-1000 small mucus-secreting glands located throughout the lining of the oral cavity. Presentation Salivary gland tumours usually present as a lump or swelling in the affected gland which may or may not have been present for a long time. The lump may be accompanied by symptoms of duct blockage (e.g. xerostomia). Usually, in their early stages it is not possible to distinguish a benign tumour from a malignant one. One of the key differentiating symptoms of a malignant growth is nerve involvement; for example, signs of facial nerve damage (e.g. facial palsy) are associated with malignant parotid tumours. Facial pain and paraesthesia are also very often associated with malignant tumours. Other red flag symptoms which may suggest malignancy and warrant further investigation are fixation of the lump to the overlying skin, ulceration and induration of the mucosa. Diagnosis Coronal MRI showing right parotid adenoid cystic carcinoma. There are many diagnostic methods that can be used to determine the type of salivary gland tumour and if it is benign or malignant. Examples of diagnostic methods include: Physical exam and history: An exam of the body to check general signs of health. The head, neck, mouth, and throat will be checked for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient's health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken. Endoscopy: A procedure to look at organs and tissues inside the body to check for abnormal areas. For salivary gland cancer, an endoscope is inserted into the mouth to look at the mouth, throat, and larynx. An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. MRI or CT Scan: These tests can confirm the presence of a tumour. An MRI or CT Scan can also show whether metastasis has occurred. Biopsy: The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy: The removal of tissue or fluid using a thin needle. An FNA is the most common type of biopsy used for salivary gland cancer, and has been shown to produce accurate results when differentiating between benign and malignant tumours.Vaishali H Anand et al. FNAC and Histopathology of Salivary Gland Tumors. SEAJCRR. 2014 Feb 3(1):609-618 Radiographs: An OPG (orthopantomogram) can be taken to rule out mandibular involvement. A chest radiograph may also be taken to rule out any secondary tumours. Ultrasound: Ultrasound can be used to initially assess a tumour that is located superficially in either the submandibular or parotid gland. It can distinguish an intrinsic from an extrinsic neoplasm. Ultrasonic images of malignant tumours include ill-defined margins. =Classification= Due to the diverse nature of salivary gland tumours, many different terms and classification systems have been used. Perhaps the most widely used currently is that system proposed by the World Health Organization in 2004, which classifies salivary neoplasms as primary or secondary, benign or malignant, and also by tissue of origin. This system defines five broad categories of salivary gland neoplasms:230x230px Benign epithelial tumors * Pleomorphic adenoma * Warthin's tumor * Myoepithelioma * Basal cell adenoma * Oncocytoma * Canalicular adenoma * Lymphadenoma  Sebaceous lymphadenoma  Nonsebaceous lymphadenoma * Ductal papilloma  Inverted ductal papilloma  Intraductal papilloma  Sialadenoma papilliferum * Cystadenoma * Malignant epithelial tumors  Acinic cell carcinoma  Mucoepidermoid carcinoma  Adenoid cystic carcinoma  Polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma  Epithelial-myoepithelial carcinoma  Clear cell carcinoma, not otherwise specified  Basal cell adenocarcinoma  Sebaceous carcinoma  Sebaceous lymphadenocarcinoma  Cystadenocarcinoma  Low-grade cribriform cystadenocarcinoma  Mucinous adenocarcinoma  Oncocytic carcinoma  Salivary duct carcinoma  Salivary duct carcinoma, not otherwise specified  Adenocarcinoma, not otherwise specified  Myoepithelial carcinoma  Carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma  Mammary analogue secretory carcinoma  Carcinosarcoma  Metastasizing pleomorphic adenoma  Squamous cell carcinoma  Large cell carcinoma  Lymphoepithelial carcinoma  Sialoblastoma * Soft tissue tumors  Hemangioma * Hematolymphoid tumors  Hodgkin lymphoma  Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma  Extranodal marginal zone B cell lymphoma * Secondary tumors (i.e. a tumor which has metastasized to the salivary gland from a distant location) Others, not included in the WHO classification above, include: * Intraosseous (central) salivary gland tumors * Hybrid tumors (i.e. a tumor displaying combined forms of histologic tumor types)  Hybrid carcinoma  Others * Others  Keratocystoma  Sialolipoma Treatment Most patients with early-stage lesions that are resectable generally tend to undergo surgery as their initial therapeutic approach, whereas those with advanced or unresectable cancers tend to be treated with radiotherapy (RT) alone or chemoradiotherapy (CRT), which hampered the comparison of the efficacy of RT alone with that of surgery combined with adjuvant RT. But some effort had been made to reflect the role of surgery in salivary gland tumours. John Hunter from a 37-year-old man called John Burley on 24 October 1785. The tumour weighed over 4 kilograms and took twenty-five minutes to remove. The specimen currently resides in the Hunterian Museum at the Royal College of Surgeons of England Treatment may include the following: * Surgery Complete surgical resection, with adequate free margins, is currently the mainstay treatment for salivary gland tumours. However elective treatment of the N0 neck region remains a controversial topic * Radiotherapy If a salivary gland tumour is cancerous, Radiation Therapy may be necessary Fast neutron therapy has been used successfully to treat salivary gland tumors, and has shown to be significantly more effective than photons in studies treating unresectable salivary gland tumors. * Chemotherapy Currently little is known about the efficacy of chemotherapy in treating salivary gland tumours. Chemotherapy, which plays an important role in systemic therapy, is generally reserved for the palliative treatment of symptomatic locally recurrent and/or metastatic disease that is not amenable to further surgery or radiation. Conventional chemotherapy regimens, such as cisplatin and 5-FU or CAP (cisplatin, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide) are still utilized as first-line therapy for patients with advanced lesions. Targeted Therapy - Due to the poor results with chemotherapy, it's urgent to explore novel therapeutic interventions for this disease. And great expectations have been put into individualized therapies: in particular, the EGF receptors family (EGFR and HER2), KIT and androgen receptors are the most commonly investigated molecular targets in SGCs. Their expression seems not to be linked to its pathogenetic role in the development of SGCs, but more to the histogenetic origin of the tumor cells. Various targeted agents, such as imatinib, cetuximab, gefitinib, trastuzumab, had been used for exploring new treatment for salivary gland tumours, but on account of the rare incidence of salivary gland tumours, the number of cases available on targeted therapy for analysis is relatively small.  Epidemiology  Little is known about the total incidence of salivary gland tumours as most benign tumours go unrecorded in national cancer registries. The majority of salivary tumours are benign (65-70%). Within the parotid gland 75 - 80% of tumours are benign. Around 50% of the tumours found in the submandibular glands are benign. Sublingual gland tumours are very rare but if present, they are most likely to be malignant. In the United States, salivary gland cancers are uncommon with an incidence rate of 1.7 in 100000 between 2009 and 2013.

Scintimammography is not used for screening or in place of a mammogram. Rather, it is used when the detection of breast abnormalities is not possible or not reliable on the basis of mammography and ultrasound. Procedure In the scintimammography procedure, a woman receives an injection of a small amount of a radioactive substance which is taken up by cancer cells, and a gamma camera is used to take pictures of the breasts. Technetium-99m sestamibi (99mTc-MIBI) is the most commonly used radiopharmaceutical. When performed with MIBI the procedure may also be known as a Miraluma test. The typical dose is 740‚Äì1,110 megabecquerels (MBq) with the patient lying prone on the bed for imaging approximately 10 minutes after injection. 99mTc-DMSA and 99mTc-MDP may also been used, but provide less sensitive results. Equipment Breast-specific gamma cameras have been developed with a smaller field of view than conventional cameras, allowing higher resolution imagery and compression of the breast as in x-ray mammography (which improves detection of smaller lesions).

As a lawyer he is best remembered for his pioneering work in establishing a system of pro bono defense for inmates in New York State who did not have the finances for a lawyer. He was also a staff member of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy, known unofficially as the Warren Commission. He played an instrumental role in developing the single bullet theory. Background Norman Redlich was born on November 12, 1925, in the Bronx, the second and youngest child of Pauline and Milton Redlich. His parents were Jewish, and they owned a small company which manufactured gardening and plumbing equipment. He served in the United States Army during World War II; after which he earned his B.A. degree from Williams College in 1947, and his L.L.B. degree from Yale Law School in 1950. Career Redlich wrote for The Nation magazine in the late 1940s and into the 1950s. Early coverage included people like Elizabeth Bentley. He then worked for his parents company for most of the 1950s while simultaneously pursuing further graduate work at New York University. He received his LLM from the NYU law school in 1955. He joined the faculty at NYU in 1960. =Warren Commission Years= In 1963, J. Lee Rankin appointed Redlich as a special assistant on the Warren Commission. He was credited with disproving the Belin Theory, which related to a city bus ticket in Lee Harvey Oswald's pocket helping him escape to Mexico. However, controversy arose when Gerald Ford provided J. Edgar Hoover with a probe into Redlich's past and found that he was on the Emergency Civil Liberties Committee, which defended very controversial cases, including those of political activists and communists that the ACLU and other rights group did not. Following a leak to right-wing politicians, on May 5, 1964, Ralph F. Beermann accused Redlich of defending Cuba on various issues. This incident and the ECLC ties led many to consider Redlich a communist sympathizer. =Later years= In 1960 he joined the faculty of the New York University School of Law, where he was later Dean from 1974 to 1988. In 1972, he was named as corporation counsel of New York City by then-mayor John Lindsay. In 1975, Redlich became dean of NYU Law School. From 1977 to 1999, Redlich was a member of the Vermont Law School board of trustees. In 1993, he received the highest award given to lawyers by the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, the Whitney North Seymour Award. In 1996, he was awarded the Robert J. Kutak Award, given annually by the American Bar association's educational department to those who it feels have made outstanding contributions in the field of legal education. Redlich was chairman of the American Jewish Congress national governing council. He was also a member of the executive committee of the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, and a member of the board of directors of The New Press.

In 1929, she was one of thirteen girls selected as \\"WAMPAS Baby Stars\\", a group that included future Hollywood legend Jean Arthur. She would star in five films that year, including Broadway Scandals, which starred Jack Egan and Sally O'Neil. She was at the height of her career in 1929. With the advent of sound films, her career suffered due to what critics dubbed as a grating voice. She had only one film role in 1930, and did not have another until 1934.

The charity works in predominantly subsistence agriculture communities, where children often work on family farms until sundown, and schools and homes are not equipped with electricity, making it difficult for children to do homework or develop study habits. History EPI was founded in 2007 by retired chemical engineer and vice-president of engineering at ExxonMobil Research and Engineering, Ben Markham. While living in Ghana, Markham had observed the darkness of rural homes and school classrooms, and a scarcity of play equipment in schoolyards. With help from Brigham Young University, playground equipment that generates electricity from children's play was created. The concept was field-tested and improved in Ghana in 2008. Kweku Anno converted the design to use locally available materials. After school selection involving EPI social scientists and the Ghanaian Ministry of Education, Anno Engineering manufactured and installed the systems. Initially, EPI hand-modified LED camping lanterns so they could be recharged by the EPI system. In 2009, Energizer became a sponsor for EPI, donating development of LED lanterns specifically designed for the EPI service. The lantern has a computer chip that manages the charging of the custom battery pack and the operation of the LED lights, which provides lighting equivalent to a 25-watt incandescent light bulb for over 40 hours per charge. The lights have an expected service life greater than five years. In 2009‚Äì2010, EPI began including science kits with its playground equipment. , EPI power-generating play equipment was installed at 42 rural schools. Products and services Children at recess in Ghana on Playworld Systems Inc. MGR. The EPI system currently includes a power generating merry-go-round attached to a generation train with a hub bearing. A drive shaft from the hub connects to a helical gearbox, which turns a shaft, which then turns a magnet windmill generator. The electricity generated by the merry-go-round and all other play equipment in the EPI system is converted to direct current and used to charge a battery. A thirty-watt solar panel is also connect to the power enclosure to prevent battery discharging during school breaks. The panel provides about 20% of the total system energy when school is in session. Children in Ghana study with EPI lanterns. =Education= Without much access to government-provided electricity or school supplies, the teaching of science within rural villages is often abstract or theoretical. This makes it difficult for children to learn basic concepts as foundations of further learning. In 2009, an EPI intern traveled to Ghana for three months to meet with the Ghanaian Ministry of Education, elementary education developers, and the students and teachers of rural villages to assess which needs were not being met. It was decided that EPI playground equipment could work for teaching general mechanics, physics, energy transfer, and other basic principles of science for instance demonstrating the conversion of power to electricity. In the spring of 2010, two more interns from EPI traveled to Ghana to test the science kits and train teachers to use them. The average cost of an EPI system, which includes school selection, manufacturing costs, shipping fees, science lab, teacher training, and installation, is $10,000. In mid-2010, EPI began a scholarship program for promising young children who attend EPI-sponsored rural schools, and who have benefited from the EPI equipment. With the help of this scholarship, one student from rural Ghana is now attending high school, an opportunity not available otherwise.

They proposed that human communication is the basis of society and the creator of community and that through deep human communication comes the most positive of human experience: co-operation, sharing, harmony, peace, love and creativity. A founding principle of the Centre was that the quality of our culture depends on the quality of our communication. Education, scientific advance, artistic elevation and personal expansion are made possible through human communication. Purpose of the Centre The purpose of the Centre for Human Communication was articulated in its 1978 Education Prospectus: \\"The centres are more like living organisms than rigid institutions. In recent years the pace of life has quickened and many organisations have been unable to respond appropriately to the revolution that is taking place in the world. Humankind is participating in a global renaissance. The Centres for Human Communication are committed to the positive evolution of humanity through the power of creativity, communication and consciousness. Apart from this the Centres have no philosophy, doctrine or affiliation whatsoever.\\" Achievements Kingsland's seven level colour model, Spectrum Theory, formed the core of the Centre's pioneering research into human communication, personal and organisational development. The outcome was a cascade of new perspectives on work, many of which were described by Ronnie Lessem in his series of books on Intrapreneurship, Quality and Management. Work on Vision was one of the centre's earliest achievements at the beginning of the 1970s. The original Vision to Action model (later also called Vision to Reality) was invented at this time by Kevin Kingsland and shared through hundreds of seminars and communication groups. It is a seven level model which describes the way a vision incarnates as it unfolds through the levels of the mind and is reified. Spectrum Theory Subsequently tens of thousands of businesses were set up using the Vision to Action/Reality process. In parallel with the development of the Centre a new business model emerged which became known as The Community Company. The first Community Company was incorporated as Grael Associates Limited and became the trading face of the Centre. Together they formed a whole, rather like Yin yang. The Centre and Grael provided complementary learning and development opportunities for people. Development Like any true growth centre, the original centre itself grew and replicated reflecting the growth of the individuals who manifest the Centre. Subsequently other centres emerged in Britain: Torquay, Exeter, Carlisle, Westbury. Others were established abroad, some physical and some virtual.

There are references to them in several ancient texts such as Mahavamsa, Manimekalai and also in other Sanskrit and Pali literature. They are generally being represented as a class of superhumans taking the form of serpents who inhabit a subterranean world. Certain places such as Nagadeepa in Jaffna and Kalyani in Gampaha are mentioned as their abodes. The names of some Naga kings in Sri Lankan legends such as Mani Akkhitha (Mani Naga) and Mahodara are also found in Sanskrit literature among superhuman Nagas, and the cult of Mani Naga prevailed in India up to medieval times. They inhabited the Northern and Western parts of Sri Lanka. The Jaffna Peninsula was mentioned in Tamil literature as Naka Nadu, in Pali literature as Nagadeepa and in Greek gazetteer as Nagadiba or Nagadibois. The name Nagabhumi was also found on an ancient coin from Uduthurai, Jaffna and in a Tamil inscription from Pudukkottai referring to the Jaffna peninsula.K. Rajan - Situating the Beginning of Early Historic Times in Tamil Nadu: Some Issues and Reflections (2008) p17-18  Etymology  The Naga people of Sri Lanka, were a totemic tribe of serpent worshipershttps://roar.media/english/life/srilanka-life/of-ancient-serpent- worshippers-and-auspicious-times/ and the word \\"Naga\\" literally means \\"snake\\" or \\"serpent\\" in Sanskrit, Pali and Tamil. Cognates of the word Naga include NayƒÅr, Nair, NaynƒÅr and NƒÅyakar, which are names of various communities in South India. The tribe is also known by the Dravidian term Cheran. Origin According to Manogaran, some scholars also \\"have postulated that the Yakshas and Nagas [...] are the aboriginal tribes of Sri Lanka\\". Scholars like K. Indrapala regard them as an ancient tribe who started to assimilate to Tamil culture and language from the 3rd century BCE. According to him, in the end of 9th century or probably very long before that time, the Nagas assimilated into the two major ethnic groups of the island. According to V. Kanakasabhai, The Oliyar, Parathavar, Maravar and Eyinar who were widespread across South India and North-East Sri Lanka are all Naga tribes. According to several authors they may have been a Dravidian tribe.Laura Smid (2003). South Asian folklore: an encyclopedia : Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka. Great Britain: Routledge. 429. Many Tamil poets who contributed to the Sangam literature attached Naga prefixes and suffixes to their names to indicate their Naga descent. Early references Buddha's visit to Nagadeepa. Detail from Kelaniya Raja Maha Vihara =Mahavamsa= The chronicle has stated that the Buddha, during his second visit to the island, pacified a dispute between two Naga Kings of Nagadeepa, Chulodara and Mahodara over the possession of a gem-studded throne. This throne was finally offered to the Buddha by the grateful Naga kings who left it in Nagadeepa under a Rajayathana tree (Kiri Palu) as an object of worship. Since then the place was become one of holiest shrines of Buddhist of the island for many centuries. The references to Nagadeepa in Mahawamsa as well as other Pali writings, coupled with archaeological and epigraphical evidences, have established that Nagadeepa of the Mahawamsa is the present Jaffna Peninsula. The chronicle further state that in the eighth year after the Enlightenment, the Buddha visited the island for the third time, on an invitation of Maniakkhita, the Naga king of Kalyani (Modern day Kelaniya) who is the uncle of the Naga king of Nagadeepa. =Manimekalai= In the Tamil epic it has stated that the Manimekalai, the heroine, is miraculously transported to a small island called Manipallavam where there was a seat or foot stool associated to the Buddha. The seat in Manipallavam is said to be used by the Buddha when he preached and reconciled the two kings of Naga land and was placed in Manipallavam by the king of gods, Indra. The legend speaks of the great Naga king Valai Vanan and his queen Vasamayilai who ruled over Manipallavam in the Jaffna Peninsula. Their daughter, the princess Pilli Valai had a liaison at the islet with the early Chola king Killivalavan; out of this union was the Prince Tondai Eelam Thiraiyar born, who historians note was the early progenitor of the Pallava Dynasty. He went on to rule Tondai Nadu from Kanchipuram. Nainativu was referred to as Manipallavam in ancient Tamil literature following this union. Royals of the Chola-Naga lineage would go on to rule other territory of the island, Nagapattinam and Tondai Nadu of Tamilakam. By the time Buddhism had reached Tamilakam, the twin epics of ancient Tamil Nadu Silappatikaram (5‚Äì6th century CE) and Manimekalai (6th century CE) were written, speaking of Naga Nadu across the sea from Kaveripoompuharpattinam. The island according to the Tamil epic was divided into two territory, Naga Nadu and Ilankaitheevam. Naga Nadu, or the whole island was also known as Cherantheevu, derived from Dravidian words Cheran (meaning Naga) and theevu (meaning island). Identifying Manipallavam The similarity of the legend about the Buddha's seat given in the Mahavamsa to that in the Manimekalai has led certain scholars to identify the Manipallavam with Nagadeepa (Currently Nainativu), which has caused the history to be extracted out of the legend. Cƒ´ttalai CƒÅttanƒÅr, the author of the Manimekalai, reflected the perception at the time that Naga Nadu was an autonomous administrative entity, kingdom or nadu stretching across coastal districts, distinguished from the rest of the island also ruled intermittently by Naga kings. The Naga king Valai Vanan was stated in the Manimekalai to be the king of Naga Nadu, one of the two territories in Sri Lanka, the other being Ilankaitheevam. Several scholars identify Naga Nadu with the Jaffna Peninsula, and Manipallavam with Nainativu. Other scholars identify Karaitivu as Manipallavam. Senarath Paranavithana rejects the identifaction of Manipallavam with Nainativu and the Jaffna Peninsula, because Manimekalai states the island to have been uninhabited, whereas the Jaffna Peninsula have been inhabited centuries before the date of the epic. He also notes that Manimekalai does not mention that the two Naga kings had their abode in Manipallavam as stated in the Mahavamsa, nor did it mention that the holy seat was placed there by Gautama Buddha, but by Indra. Further states Canto IX, II. 13‚Äì22 that an earthquake destroyed a city in Gandhara which in turn affteced 100 yojanas of Naga Nadu, thus rejecting the identification of Naga Nadu with Jaffna Peninsula. =Ramayana= In the Indian epic Ramayana, the mythological island Lanka is been often identified with Sri Lanka. The inhabitants of Lanka were mentioned as non-humans, mainly referring to the Rakshasas and Yakshas, but also mentioning the Nagas. Indrajit, the son of Ravana was married to Sulochana, a Naga princess. =Others= Ptolemy in his 1st century map of Taprobane mentions Nagadibois. Ptolemy mentions in 150 CE that King Sornagos, a descendant of this lineage, ruled from the early Chola capital of Uraiyur during this time. Culture =Irrigation= It is also believed they were great irrigation engineers who built water storages. The Giant's Tank dam and reservoir system in Mannar, Sri Lanka is considered by some (Such as Author, Mudaliyar C. Rajanayagam) to have been built by the Nagas based on the extensive ruins and the presence of villages with surrounding the port with Naga name (e.g. Nagarkulam, Nagathazhvu and Sirunagarkulam).Lionel Wijesiri .

In 1759, the village was elevated to a town with the name Air√£o by Joaquim de Melo P√≥voas, first governor of the . Later, the district around Air√£o became part of Manaus and when it was dismembered in 1938, became New Air√£o. Conservation The municipality contains part of the Anavilhanas National Park, a conservation unit that was originally an ecological station created in 1981, as well half of the Jau National Park, declared by UNESCO Natural Heritage of Humanity. It holds about 24% of the Rio Negro Left Bank Environmental Protection Area, a sustainable use conservation area created in 1995. It also contains the Rio Negro State Park North Section, created in 1995. To the south of the state park the municipality contains about 60% of the Rio Negro Right Bank Environmental Protection Area, a sustainable use conservation unit that controls use of an area of Amazon rainforest along the Rio Negro above the junction with the Solim√µes River. It also contains about 16% of the Rio Negro Sustainable Development Reserve, a sustainable use conservation unit created in 2008 in an effort to stop deforestation in the area, which is threatened due to its proximity to Manaus. Tourism People go to Novo Air√£o to access to the surrounding area, including both Anavilhanas and Jau National Parks, native communities and to feed and/or swim with the pink dolphins. The latter facility is offered at a small floating caf√© down at the harbour. It is possible to pay some boatmen at the port for trips to Anavilhanas archipelago, (the ruins of the old town, and nearby petroglyphs), and perhaps the Ja√∫ River (this one may require permission from the federal environment agency ICMBio). The boatmen should belong to the Associac√£o de Operadores de Turismo em Novo Air√£o (ATUNA), and be flying the ATUNA flag on their boat, as well some other companies registered on Brazilian Ministry of Tourism, as they are the only ones allowed to access the National Parks and surrounding areas, to perform nice sightseeing tours for alligator focusing, bird watching, perform aquatic trails, piranha fishing, wildlife observation in general and visit some interesting native communities. It is a good idea to check-in on CAT (Tourist Information Center) at the city's entrance, for a complete list of lodges, hostels and hotels, as well tourism operators, as a starting point to plan your trip. Because of the current bus and boat schedules, it is difficult to make a day trip to Novo Air√£o, and one should plan to spend at least a night there. There are good places to stay in the town, of variable quality, from top-lodging to bed and breakfast houses. Usually, those from ANATUR (Novo Air√£o Tourism Association) offer fine service and infrastructure. Buses leave from Manaus coach terminal early in the morning and boats from the Port of Manaus in the evening.\\".Visit Manaus Guide 2010, T.C.

History  The name Star√© Mƒõsto (lit. Old Town) hints on its antecedence in comparison to the adjacent Fr√Ωdek. Indeed, Fr√Ωdek is not the oldest settlement in the area (first mentioned in 1386), but was preceded by Jemnicze mentioned in 1327 (and maybe earlier in 1305). After Fr√Ωdek was established, it grew considerably and absorbed Jemnicze. Later in the area a village Staremiesto was first mentioned in 1434. Politically the village belonged initially to the Duchy of Teschen, formed in 1290 in the process of feudal fragmentation of Poland and was ruled by a local branch of Piast dynasty. In 1327 the duchy became a fee of Kingdom of Bohemia, which after 1526 became part of the Habsburg Monarchy. In 1573 it was sold as one of 16 villages and the town of Friedeck and formed a state country split from the Duchy of Teschen. After World War I and fall of Austria-Hungary it became a part of Czechoslovakia. In March 1939 it became a part of Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. After World War II it was restored to Czechoslovakia.

Prominent members of this group were Christopher Marlowe, Robert Greene, and Thomas Nashe from Cambridge, and John Lyly, Thomas Lodge, and George Peele from Oxford. Thomas Kyd is also sometimes included in the group, though he is not believed to have studied at university. This diverse and talented loose association of London writers and dramatists set the stage for the theatrical Renaissance of Elizabethan England. They are identified as among the earliest professional writers in English, and prepared the way for the writings of William Shakespeare, who was born just two months after Christopher Marlowe. Term George Saintsbury, who coined the term \\"university wits\\" The term \\"University Wits\\" was not used in their lifetime, but was coined by George Saintsbury, a 19th-century journalist and author.Sager, Jenny \\"Melnikoff, Ed., Robert Greene\\", Early Modern Literary Studies. Volume: 16. Issue: 1 Saintsbury argues that the \\"rising sap\\" of dramatic creativity in the 1580s showed itself in two separate \\"branches of the national tree\\": > In the first place, we have the group of university wits, the strenuous if > not always wise band of professed men of letters, at the head of whom are > Lyly, Marlowe, Greene, Peele, Lodge, Nash, and probably (for his connection > with the universities is not certainly known) Kyd. In the second, we have > the irregular band of outsiders, players and others, who felt themselves > forced into literary and principally dramatic composition, who boast > Shakespeare as their chief, and who can claim as seconds to him not merely > the imperfect talents of Chettle, Munday, and others whom we may mention in > this chapter, but many of the perfected ornaments of a later time.George > Saintsbury, History of Elizabethan Literature, MacMillan, London, 1887, > pp.60-64 Saintsbury argues that the Wits drew on the ploddingly academic verse-drama of Thomas Sackville, and the crude but lively popular entertainments of \\"miscellaneous farce-and-interlude-writers\\", to create the first truly powerful dramas in English. The University Wits, \\"with Marlowe at their head, made the blank verse line for dramatic purposes, dismissed, cultivated as they were, the cultivation of classical models, and gave English tragedy its Magna Charta of freedom and submission to the restrictions of actual life only\\". However, they failed \\"to achieve perfect life-likeness\\". It was left to \\"the actor-playwrights who, rising from very humble beginnings, but possessing in their fellow Shakespeare a champion unparalleled in ancient and modern times, borrowed the improvements of the university wits, added their own stage knowledge, and with Shakespeare's aid achieved the master drama of the world.\\" The term \\"University Wits\\" was taken up by many writers in the 20th century to refer to the group of authors listed by Saintsbury, often using his basic model of dramatic development. Adolphus William Ward in The Cambridge History of English Literature (1932) has a chapter on \\"The Plays of the University Wits\\", in which he argues that a \\"pride in university training which amounted to arrogance\\" was combined with \\"really valuable ideas and literary methods\\".The Cambridge History of English Literature: General index, Volume 15, p.9 In 1931, Allardyce Nicoll wrote that \\"it was left to the so-called University Wits to make the classical tragedy popular and the popular tragedy unified in construction and conscious of its aim.\\"Allardyce Nicoll, The Theory of Drama, Thomas Y. Crowell, 1931, p.165 Characteristics Dido, Queen of Carthage, co-written by Marlowe and Nashe Edward Albert in his History of English Literature (1979) argues that the plays of the University Wits had several features in common: > (a) There was a fondness for heroic themes, such as the lives of great > figures like Mohammed and Tamburlaine. (b) Heroic themes needed heroic > treatment: great fullness and variety; splendid descriptions, long swelling > speeches, the handling of violent incidents and emotions. These qualities, > excellent when held in restraint, only too often led to loudness and > disorder. (c) The style was also ‚Äòheroic‚Äô. The chief aim was to achieve > strong and sounding lines, magnificent epithets, and powerful declamation. > This again led to abuse and to mere bombast, mouthing, and in the worst > cases to nonsense. In the best examples, such as in Marlowe, the result is > quite impressive. In this connexion it is to be noted that the best medium > for such expression was blank verse, which was sufficiently elastic to bear > the strong pressure of these expansive methods. (d) The themes were usually > tragic in nature, for the dramatists were as a rule too much in earnest to > give heed to what was considered to be the lower species of comedy. The > general lack of real humour in the early drama is one of its most prominent > features. Humour, when it is brought in at all, is coarse and immature. > Almost the only representative of the writers of real comedies is > Lyly.Edward Albert, History of English Literature, Oxford University Press, > 1979, p.89. G. K. Hunter argues that the new \\"Humanistic education\\" of the age allowed them to create a \\"complex commercial drama, drawing on the nationalisation of religious sentiment\\" in such a way that it spoke to an audience \\"caught in the contradictions and liberations history had imposed\\".G. K. Hunter, English Drama 1586-1642: The Age of Shakespeare, Clarendon, 1997, p.24. While Marlowe is the most famous dramatist among them, Robert Greene and Thomas Nashe were better known for their controversial, risqu√© and argumentative pamphlets, creating an early form of journalism. Greene has been called the \\"first notorious professional writer\\".Edward Gieskes: Writing Robert Greene: Essays on England's First Notorious Professional Writer (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2008) Supposed disputes An apparent attack on Shakespeare as an \\"upstart crow\\" in the pamphlet Greene's Groats-Worth of Wit, published as the work of the recently-deceased Robert Greene, has led to the view that the two \\"branches\\" Saintsbury describes were in conflict, and that the University Wits resented the rise of the \\"actor-playwrights\\", as Shakespeare did not have the elite education the Wits did. However, many scholars believe that the pamphlet was in fact written by Henry Chettle, a writer listed by Saintsbury as one of the \\"irregular band of outsiders\\" supposedly resented by the Wits.Schoone-Jongen, Terence G., Shakespeare‚Äôs Companies, Ashgate Publishing, 2008, p. 28. In the pamphlet \\"Greene\\" tells fellow-writers ‚Äî generally assumed to be Peele, Marlowe and Nashe ‚Äî to watch out for an upstart who is \\"beautified with our feathers\\". Jenny Sager argues that \\"From its conception the term 'University Wits' has provided generations of critics with a sounding board from which to articulate their attitudes towards modern academia\\", often setting the supposedly snobbish Wits against Shakespeare and others as representatives of unlettered talent. Jeffrey Knapp argues that some authors have imagined an \\"all out war\\" between authors and actors, initiated by the Wits. Knapp criticises Richard Helgerson for claiming that a form of popular theatre was replaced by an elitist \\"author's theatre\\" because of the work of the Wits, arguing that praise for actors and willingness to collaborate are more typical of their careers.Jeffrey Knapp, Shakespeare Only, University of Chicago Press, 2009, p.62.

One of the most successful trainers in Canadian Thoroughbred racing history, Rowntree embarked on his racing career as a jockey in his native Toronto, riding from 1949 through 1951. As a trainer, he learned his conditioning skills as an assistant to Hall of Fame trainer and Kentucky Derby winner, Lou Cavalaris, Jr. Rowntree obtained his trainer's licence in 1959 and was hired by Stafford Farms in 1967 where he remained until the death of owner Jack Stafford in 1981. During his training career, Gil Rowntree won eight Canadian Classic Races and following the creation of the Sovereign Awards program in 1975 he was voted the first- ever winner as Canada's Outstanding Trainer. In 1973, Gil Rowntree set a record when horses he trained ran 1-2-3 in the Prince of Wales Stakes, the second leg of the Canadian Triple Crown series. Although Rowntree has won four editions of Canada's most prestigious race, the Queen's Plate, he is best known as the trainer of the 1978 Queen's Plate runner-up, Overskate. The Hall of Fame colt was twice voted Canadian Horse of the Year as part of his record setting nine Sovereign Awards while competing in Canada and at various tracks in the United States. As well, Rowntree conditioned Canadian champions Deceit Dancer, Proud Tobin, Northern Blossom, Ten Gold Pots, Allan Blue, Key to the Moon, Sound Reason and Tudor Queen, the 1969 American Champion Two-Year-Old Filly, and in the pre Sovereign Award era, the de facto Canadian Two Year-Old Champion. Gil Rowntree makes his home near Woodbine Racetrack in Etobicoke, Ontario and continues to train Thoroughbreds for various owners plus breed, race and train horses for his own Gil Rowntree Racing Stable.

Due to his work in the cardiac field he is known as a research giant in primary care, and was knighted by King George V in 1915. Biography James Mackenzie was born at Pictonhill in Scone, where his father was a farmer. He left school at Perth Academy aged 14 and was apprenticed to a chemist. In 1873 he was offered a partnership in the chemist's firm but turned it down in order to study medicine.Papers and Correspondence of Sir James Mackenzie (1853‚Äì1925) . Archives Hub. After private tuition in Latin he passed his entrance examination for the University of Edinburgh in October 1874 and qualified as a doctor in 1878. After completing his residency in Edinburgh, Mackenzie became a general practitioner in borough of Burnley in Lancashire, England where he continued to practice medicine for more than a quarter of a century. While he was engaged in a busy practice, he made many original observations, completed his MD degree on hemi-paraplegia spinalis (awarded by the University of Edinburgh in 1882) and had many scientific papers published. During Mackenzie's initial research carried out in the Burnley general practice he corresponded and discussed his findings with other well known pioneers Wenkebach and Osler. Mackenzie's ongoing investigations led him to leave general practice and become a specialist cardiologist. He expressed prophetic concerns about the specialisation of medicine including cardiology stating: 'I fear the day may come when a heart specialist will no longer be a physician looking at the body as a whole, but one with more and more complicated instruments working in a narrow and restricted area of the body ‚Äì that was never my idea'. Memorial in Burnley, Lancashire. Blue plaque, London. In his early studies Mackenzie used Riva-Rocci's sphygmograph to graphically record the pulse. Later Mackenzie devised a \\"polygraph,\\" that allowed him to make simultaneous records of the arterial and venous pulses. He used this to evaluate the condition of the heart and to measure the AV interval. In 1890 he discovered premature ventricular contractions and use of the polygraph enabled Mackenzie to make original distinctions between harmless and dangerous types of pulse irregularities (arrhythmias). Mackenzie also demonstrated the efficacy of Digitalis in the treatment of arrhythmias and made important contributions to the study of the energetics of the heart muscle. In November 1907 Mackenzie left Burnley for London and set up as a consulting physician where his reputation grew rapidly. In 1915 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society and was knighted. Three years later he founded the influential Mackenzie Institute of Clinical Research in St Andrews, which involved local General Practitioners in detailed long-term recording of patients' symptoms and illnesses. Ironically Mackenzie himself suffered from an irregular heart beat, as a result of ischemic heart disease. He had his first heart attack in 1901, and recorded in himself the atrial fibrillation that accompanied this episode. By 1907 Mackenzie experienced frequent episodes of angina pectoris which he mentioned to Sir Thomas Lewis and in 1908 he had a severe episode of cardiac pain, probably due to a myocardial infarction. His angina continued after 1908 and became progressively worse until in January 1925 he had a prolonged and severe attack of angina and died at around 4am in the morning of 26 January 1925. Before his death Mackenzie has asked that his friend John Parkinson perform an autopsy after his death. This was done and showed extensive coronary artery disease and evidence of recent and old myocardial infarction. A description of the case was published in the British Heart Journal in 1939. Two early polygraphs and a bronze bust of Mackenzie are in the collection of the Tayside Medical History Museum.

It is south-east of the city of P√©cs. History The history of Koz√°rmisleny is rooted in the early Bronze Age, as indicated by archeological findings. Roman remains have also been found in the area. The transcontinental military road connecting Sremska Mitrovica-P√©cs-Szombathely-Sopron led not far from the place. The Avars living here between the 6th-9th centuries also left some relics behind. Several tombs have been found dating back to the time of the Hungarian conquest. The village got its present form when two smaller settlements, Kiskoz√°r and Misleny, were united in 1928. The name of Koz√°r was first mentioned in documents in 1332-1335, in the papal tithe registers, in the form Kosar. Misleny was first mentioned in a document dating back to 1266, as Myslen. The place played an important role in the development of Baranya county. Originally there were two areas, each governed by a castle built in their centres. One of them was Baranyav√°r, the other Koaszt with its centre somewhere between Koz√°rmisleny and Nagykoz√°r. Baranya county developed out of these two areas. Kiskoz√°r was inhabited continuously, even under the Turkish rule. In the l7th and l8th centuries South Slav families settled next to the Hungarian population. Some of them got assimilated, others moved away after some time. Around 1760, German settlers came and by the middle of the last century they were in majority. Misleny was inhabited under the Turkish rule, and in the 17th-18th centuries its population was partly Hungarian and partly Slav. After the war of independence (1703‚Äì1711), only the Hungarians remained. Present Koz√°rmisleny is currently going through a period of growth and development of infrastructure. The town has restaurants, pension lodgings, two confectioneries, two bakeries and SPAR shops, two pharmacies, as well as dentists and adult and children doctor's offices. The population has also grown. In the 1970s there were 2000 people living in Koz√°rmisleny, now the population is 5579. The President of the Republic of Hungary declared it a town on 1 July 2007, becoming the 13th town of Baranya County. The town has a community centre. The Janikovszky √âva General Community Centre came into existence with the unifying of the nursery, the kindergarten, the primary school, and the library. In the town there are two catholic churches and a reformed church. The original Roman Catholic church of the village was consecrated in 1971. Inside this church is a statue of St Margaret of Scotland. The second Roman Catholic church, built as a part of the convent, belongs to the St Francis of Assisi Sick Nurses. Its construction began in 1993 and was consecrated on 31 March 1997, to St Nicholas of Fl√º (Klaus Ruder, patron saint of Switzerland). The designs were made by Ott√≥ Vince, an architect living in P√©cs. Several local associations and civil organizations work in Koz√°rmisleny. These are active in organizing the town's feasts, competitions and folk dance meetings. The town celebrates its day on 6 September. Awards are given on this day. East of Koz√°rmisleny, there is a mediumwave broadcasting station working on 873 kHz with 20 kW using a 133 metres high guyed mast radiator as antenna.

Harnam Singh left Kapurthala in 1878 after the premature death of his elder brother led to a struggle for the succession to the Kapurthala throne. Under the influence of his English Tutor Rev. Woodside and aided by a Bengali Missionary Golaknath Chatterji, Harnam Singh converted to Christianity thus renouncing his rights for good. He was the first president of the All India Conference of Indian Christians, which played an important role in the Indian independence movement, advocating for self-rule and opposing the partition of India.  Biography  Harnam Singh was made a hereditary Raja by the British Government 1907 for public service, awarded a Knighthood, KCSI, gave the administration of his Awadh properties for his lifetime, a move which was objected by Jagatjit Singh (his nephew) but in vain. In 1875, he married Rani Priscilla Kaur Sahiba (n√©e Priscilla Golaknath), and had nine children, seven sons and two daughters: # Raja Raghbhir Singh, OBE (3 May 1876 ‚Äì 17 November 1932) # Kanwar Rajendra Singh (1877‚Äì1883) # Raja Sir Maharaj Singh, CIE, CStJ (17 May 1878 ‚Äì 6 June 1959), who had issue (see article) # Lieutenant Colonel Dr. Kanwar Shamsher Singh, M.D., MRCS, LRCP (21 June 1879‚Äì?) # Captain Dr. Kanwar Indrajit Singh, MC, M.D., MRCP (27 December 1883 ‚Äì 23 November 1914) (KIA) # Kanwar Sir Dalip Singh (2 June 1885 ‚Äì 13 January 1971) # Kanwar Jasbir Singh, CIE (16 June 1887 ‚Äì 15 October 1942), who had issue including: #*Air Vice Marshal Kanwar Jaswant Singh, PVSM (1915‚Äì1963) #*Lieutenant Kanwar Billy Arjan Singh (1917‚Äì2010) # Rajkumari Bibiji Amrit Kaur, DStJ (2 February 1889 ‚Äì 9 February 1964) # Bibi Raj Kaur (29 May 1882 ‚Äì 29 May 1882) Raja Harnam Singh held many dignities in his life. He was a member of the Legislative Council for the Punjab from 1900‚Äì1902, a Member of the Kapurthala Council of State and an honorary Fellow of Panjab University. He was appointed a CIE in 1885 and knighted with the KCIE in 1898. In 1907, Harnam Singh was given the personal title of Raja (roughly equivalent to the modern British life peerage) and was made a hereditary Raja in 1911, thus enabling him to found a separate branch of the Ahluwalia dynasty. Harnam Singh died in 1930 at the age of 78, and was succeeded in his title by his eldest son, Raghubir Singh, who himself died two years later without issue. whereupon the title devolved upon his second surviving son, Raja Maharaj Singh.

Ruins of Newark Priory Grade I List Entry Scheduled Ancient Monument listing. History Newark Priory was, before its reconstruction, run by the Canons Regular of St Augustine and the register of Bishop Woodlock (1312) states that the priory was first founded by a Bishop of Winchester. The Priory was granted substantial lands \\"to the canons there serving God\\" in the late 12th Century by Rauld de Calva and his wife Beatrice de Sandes for the Augustinian canons \\"to build a church\\" when Richard I reigned (1189‚Äì99) so according with its Early English Gothic architecture, the present priory dates to then. It was dedicated to the Virgin Mary and Saint Thomas Becket in contemporary documents \\"Thomas the Martyr\\" and originally, the land where the church was built was called Aldbury. This gradually changed its name from Aldbury to Newark or the New Place (') of St Thomas near Guildford, at one point being called Newstead. The taxation roll of 1291 shows considerable non-ecclesiastic assets (temporalities). The priory held tenements or rents in ten London parishes, producing an income of ¬£5 16s 3d; in the wider Diocese of London; in the Diocese of Rochester ¬£1 6s was produced annually; and in Diocese of Winchester income of ¬£27 10s 3¬Ωd. During Henry VIII's Dissolution of the Monasteries Newark Priory was dissolved. The prior himself was pensioned off, all valuables sent to the Tower of London and the land given to the Master of the King's Horse. It has been said that a cannon was employed from the top of Church Hill to bombard or demolish what were the then extensive buildings. This incident is portrayed in one of a series of paintings made by artist Tessa Kewen. The last known prior of Newark Priory was Richard Lipscombe, appointed just before the surrender of the establishment and lands in 1538. The building, falling into ruin, was said to have been further destroyed by locals using the stones for road mending until Lord Onslow, the owner in the 1730s, decided to preserve what remained. Today Newark Priory still exists as ruins today and is a scheduled monument and a Grade I listed building. It was placed upon the English Heritage Register of Buildings at risk, established in 2007. It is located upon private land so is unable to be reached at closer proximity than the Wey path by Newark Lock and Newark Mill. Its island of a few acres is a meadow crossed at its end by Newark Lane between Pyrford and Ripley. A dawn service is held each year on Easter Day at 6am in the ruins, run by churches from the surrounding towns including Byfleet, West Byfleet, Pyrford and Ripley.

The \\"operands\\" of the product are types, and the structure of a product type is determined by the fixed order of the operands in the product. An instance of a product type retains the fixed order, but otherwise may contain all possible instances of its primitive data types. The expression of an instance of a product type will be a tuple, and is called a \\"tuple type\\" of expression. A product of types is a direct product of two or more types. If there are only two component types, it can be called a \\"pair type\\". For example, if two component types A and B are the set of all possible values of that type, the product type written A √ó B contains elements that are pairs (a,b), where \\"a\\" and \\"b\\" are instances of A and B respectively. The pair type is a special case of the dependent pair type, where the type B may depend on the instance picked from A. In many languages, product types take the form of a record type, for which the components of a tuple can be accessed by label. In languages that have algebraic data types, as in most functional programming languages, algebraic data types with one constructor are isomorphic to a product type. In the Curry‚ÄìHoward correspondence, product types are associated with logical conjunction (AND) in logic. The notion directly extends to the product of an arbitrary finite number of types (a n-ary product type), and in this case, it characterizes the expressions which behave as tuples of expressions of the corresponding types. A degenerated form of product type is the unit type: it is the product of no types. In call-by- value programming languages, a product type can be interpreted as a set of pairs whose first component is a value in the first type and whose second component is a value in the second type. In short, it is a cartesian product and it corresponds to a product in the category of types. Most functional programming languages have a primitive notion of product type. For instance, the product of type1, ..., typen is written type1\` * \`...\` * \`typen in ML and \`(\`type1\`,\`...\`,\`typen\`)\` in Haskell. In both these languages, tuples are written \`(\`v1\`,\`...\`,\`vn\`)\` and the components of a tuple are extracted by pattern-matching. Additionally, many functional programming languages provide more general algebraic data types, which extend both product and sum types. Product types are the dual of sum types. Example An example of a product type is the type of a vector in a vector space or an algebra over a field: the type is a product of a number type, and a direction type. Thus, for example, the brochure for the International System of Units starts out in section 1.1 saying \\"The value of a quantity is generally expressed as the product of a number and a unit\\", and also presents the unit product of a Newton and a meter with the product notation of mathematics: Newton meter (N m or N ¬∑ m). This is properly indicative of the vector space nature of SI units over the abelian group of dimensions under multiplication, and the field of real numbers -- the SI units form an algebra over a field.

Biography Hall was known as the Red-haired Music Maker and the Pineapple Picador in his recording heyday of the 1920s and 1930s. In 1923, he released the song \\"It Ain't Gonna Rain No Mo',\\" which sold over two million copies in the United States.Whitcomb, p. 47. It was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA. The song is also considered the first musical hit on radio. He wrote \\"Underneath the Mellow Moon\\" and \\"Carolina Rose\\". Hall also wrote songs with Carson Robison and Art Gillham. Hall began his career in 1922 Chicago as a song plugger for Forster Music. He traveled around the country and stopped in towns to play in music stores, theaters, and radio. In vaudeville he began singing and playing the xylophone. He found the ukulele to be more portable and quickly became an expert with that instrument. In January, 1924 he signed with the National Carbon Company to host the Eveready Hour a pioneer commercially sponsored variety program on WEAF in New York. On November 4, 1924 the program was on a pre-network 18 station \\"hook-up\\" to broadcast election returns with entertainers Will Rogers, Carson Robison, Art Gillham, and the Waldorf Astoria Orchestra. Eveready even painted their batteries with a red top to cash in on Hall's popularity. In 1929 Wendell Hall hosted the Majestic Music Hour and a few years later Gillette's Community Sing. He made a few musical short films. After his radio days were over Wendell Hall wrote commercials for radio. Beginning in September 1933, Hall had a program on NBC that the F. W. Fitch Company sponsored. He did some collaborations with Carson Robison, recording versions of Stephen Foster tunes such as \\"Camptown Races\\" and \\"Oh! Susanna.\\" He made many recordings on record labels of the time: Victor, Gennett, QRS, Brunswick. Hall performed on a variety of stringed instruments, including the standard ukulele, the taropatch ukulele, banjo, and the hybrid banjolele, as well as the tiple. Like so many of the other performers during the era, Hall was a big fan of the instruments created by the C.F. Martin & Company, particularly their Taropatch. Like other performers, he was unsuccessful in obtaining an endorsement deal with Martin, but in response to his letter offering to endorse their product, Martin offered their 20% discount for professional performers and to inlay his name in the head of the instrument. He published an instruction book, Wendell Hall's Ukulele Method, with Forster Music in 1925, that was edited by May Singhi Breen. He also marketed a series of custom ukuleles through the Regal Musical Instrument Company of Chicago, with his picture on the head of The Red Head Ukulele and banjolele with red tuning pegsTranquada, p. 6. that became collectors' items for several generations afterward.Whitcomb, pp. 49‚Äì50. When the ukulele dropped in popularity, many performers distanced themselves from it, Hall was no exception. It wasn't until Arthur Godfrey brought the instrument back to life in the 1950s that it re-emerged. Due to this resurgence, Hall was able to land a radio show on WBKB five days a week.Tranquada, p. 148. His instruction booklets were updated and republished at that time as well.  Personal life  On June 4, 1924, Hall married Marion Martin. The wedding was performed live on the radio, believed to be the first broadcast ceremony in history.Elmer Douglass, \\"Marriage of Friends Stirs Elmer's Soul,\\" Chicago Daily Tribune, June 5, 1924, 10  Bibliography  * Wendell Hall's Ukulele Method, Edited by May Singhi Breen, Forster Music Publisher, Inc., 1925 * Ten Trick Tunes, Forster Music Publisher, Inc., 1926 * Jingle Tunes No. 1, Forster Music Publisher, Inc., * Francis Gerald Fritz, Dissertation University of Wisconsin: https://minds.wisconsin.edu/handle/1793/7192  References  Sources * * External links * *The Library of Congress - National Jukebox - Blue Island Blues Retrieved 9/27/2011 *[ Wendell Hall] at Allmusic.com * Hilmes, Michelle, Only Connect: A Cultural History of Broadcasting in the United States (2d ed.), Thomson Wadsworth, 2007, pp. 49‚Äì51. * Hilmes, Michelle, Radio Voices - American Broadcasting, 1922-1952, University of Minnesota Press, 1997. * Discography of Wendell Hall on Victor Records from the Encyclopedic Discography of Victor Recordings (EDVR) Category:1896 births Category:1969 deaths Category:American country singer-songwriters Category:American banjoists Category:Singers from Kansas Category:Vaudeville performers Category:Gennett Records artists Category:American ukulele players Category:20th-century American singers Category:Songwriters from Kansas ","title":"Wendell Hall"},{"id":"14892734","text":"Mirabad is a town and union council of Tando Allahyar District in the Sindh Province of Pakistan.Official website of District Government Tando Allahyar It has a population of 57,361, and is located in the north-east of the district where it forms part of Jhando Mari Taluka.

He won his first two senior county titles in 1975 and 1976 while still only a minor. Fogarty captured another set of back-to-back county medals in 1981 and 1982. This latter victory was subsequently converted into a Leinster title. Fogarty won another two county titles in 1987 and 1990, before finishing off his club career by winning another two-in-a-row in 1992 and 1993. Once again, this latter victory was converted into a second Leinster club title. =Inter-county= Fogarty first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the Offaly minor hurling team in the mid-1970s. He played at this level for his native-county in both 1975 and 1976, however, success eluded him on both occasions. Fogarty later joined the county under-21 team where he did win a Leinster title in 1978. It was a sign of things to come for Offaly. By this stage Fogarty had already joined the Offaly senior team. He made his debut in the 1976-77 National Hurling League, however, Offaly were defeated at the semi-final stages. In spite of this success was slow in coming in the championship as Fogarty‚Äôs side was defeated in 1977, 1978 and 1979. All this changed in 1980 when Offaly recorded a sensational 3-17 to 5-10 victory over All-Ireland champions Kilkenny in the Leinster final. Not only was it Fogarty‚Äôs first Leinster title but it was also the first time that Offaly had won the provincial title. Offaly's fairytale season subsequently ended with a defeat by Galway in the All-Ireland semi-final. Offaly bounced back in 1981 with Fogarty capturing a second consecutive Leinster medal. This victory allowed Offaly a straight passage into the All-Ireland final where Galway provided the opposition. Things looked bad for Offaly as the second-half saw Galway take a six-point lead. The men from the West failed to score for the final 23 minutes of the game, allowing Offaly to capture a 2-12 to 0-15 win. Fogarty had finally captured his first All-Ireland medal. Offaly surrendered their provincial crown to Kilkenny in 1982; however, Fogarty was still presented with his first All-Star award. Kilkenny remained on top in 1983, however, Offaly bounced back in 1984 to win the Leinster title for the third time. A facile win over Galway in the All-Ireland semi-final resulted in Offaly being installed as hot favourites to claim their second All-Ireland title. Cork provided the opposition in the championship decider in the first ever meeting of these two teams. Offaly's favourites tag turned out to be completely unjustified as Cork swept them off the field on a score line of 3-16 to 1-12. In 1985 Offaly retained their provincial crown, giving Fogarty a fourth Leinster title. This victory allowed Offaly to advance directly to the All- Ireland final where Galway provided the opposition. After an exciting game Offaly emerged victorious giving Fogarty a second All-Ireland title. The next few years saw Kilkenny reclaim the Leinster title, however, Offaly returned to their winning ways in 1988 with Fogarty capturing a fifth Leinster medal. The subsequent All-Ireland semi-final resulted in a loss for his side. The following year he added a sixth Leinster medal to his collection, however, the subsequent All-Ireland semi-final produced one of the biggest hurling shocks of all-time. Antrim came from nowhere to defeat the men from the Faithful County on a score line of 4-15 to 1-15. The significance of Antrim's victory was not lost on the Offaly team, who provided a guard of honour for the Ulstermen as they left the field. Fogarty was later presented with a second All-Star award. In 1990 Fogarty won a seventh Leinster medal, however, defeat soon followed in the All-Ireland semi-final. 1991 began well as Offaly captured their first National League title; however, Fogarty played no part in that victory. He was recalled for the Leinster championship games against Dublin. It was his last game for Offaly as he retired immediately after the game. =Provincial= Fogarty has also lined out with Leinster in the Railway Cup inter-provincial competition. He captured a winners‚Äô medal in this as captain of the side in 1988 as Leinster defeated Connacht. Post-playing career In retirement from playing Fogarty has remained involved with the game of hurling. He moved to County Kilkenny in 1984 and turned his hand to club coaching. He guided the Kilkenny club O'Loughlin Gaels to their first county title in 2001.

Vol. 30. Detroit: Gale, 2010. Biography In Context. Web. 28 Feb. 2013. was an Irish literary critic and author, who also co-founded a literary journal. Biography Mary Gunning Maguire was born in Collooney, County Sligo, daughter of Charles Maguire and Catherine Gunning. Her mother died in 1895, leaving her to be reared by her grandmother Catherine in Ballisodare, County Sligo. She attended boarding school in St. Louis' Convent, Monaghan. Educated at Royal University, Trinity she was founder of the Twilight Literary Society which led her to meet W. B. Yeats. She regularly attended the Abbey Theatre and was a frequent visitor amongst the salons, readings and debates there. After graduation in 1909 she taught with Louise Gavan Duffy at St Ita's - a companion school to Patrick Pearse's St. Enda's School. She was active with Thomas MacDonagh and others in national and cultural causes. She co-founded The Irish Review (1911‚Äì14) with David Houston, Thomas MacDonagh et al. and she and her husband Padraic edited the magazine for some months of its four-year career. She was encouraged by Yeats to specialise in French literary criticism and to translate Paul Claudel. She married Padraic Colum in July 1912, and they moved to New York in 1914, living occasionally in London and Paris. In middle age she was encouraged to return to writing, and became established as a literary generalist in American journals, including Poetry, Scribner's, The Nation, The New Republic, Freeman, the New York Times Review of Books, The Saturday Review of Books, and The Tribune. She associated with James Joyce in Paris, and discouraged him from duping enquirers about the origins of the interior monologue in the example of Edouard Dujardin. She accepted Joyce's very ill daughter Lucia for a week in their Paris flat at the height of her 'hebephrenic' attack, while herself preparing for an operation in May 1932. She served as the literary editor of The Forum magazine from 1933‚Äì41, commenced teaching comparative literature with Padraic at Columbia University in 1941. She rebutted Oliver St. John Gogarty's intemperate remarks about Joyce in the Saturday Review of Literature in 1941. A work of reminiscence \\"Our Friend James Joyce (1959)\\", written by herself and her husband, each writing various chapters, and assembled posthumously by Padraic Colum, sensitively recalls the writer; her letters are held in Scribner's Archive, Princeton University Library, while a collection of her papers is held at SUNY. She was the author of several books, including the autobiographical Life and the Dream, and From These Roots, a collection of her criticism.

Ownership Pravda was published by Pravda Press, a limited liability company with Nemanja Stefanoviƒá (48%), Jugoslav Petkoviƒá (47%), and Nikola Petroviƒá (5%) listed as its owners. Nemanja Stefanoviƒá's brother is Neboj≈°a Stefanoviƒá, a Serbian Radical Party (SRS) and later Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) official. History The first issue of Pravda appeared on 5 March 2007, about six weeks after the 2007 Serbian parliamentary election, in which the most popular political party in Serbia at the time, the Serbian Radical Party (SRS) led by Vojislav ≈†e≈°elj who had been in the dock at the Hague since 2003, once again won the most seats (81 out of 250). Still, despite yet another impressive electoral showing, SRS had trouble forming a government due to facing a situation where no other party wanted to enter into a coalition with them. Within days of the premiere issue, journalist Predrag Popoviƒá, who previously edited Nacional, became editor-in-chief. Popoviƒá would later reveal that he had been hired by Aleksandar Vuƒçiƒá, a high-ranking SRS official at the time. Pravda adopted an anti-establishment editorial policy within the Serbian context and was critical of the Serbian ruling coalition formed around the policy of cohabitation between prime minister Vojislav Ko≈°tunica of the Democratic Party of Serbia (DSS) and the president of the republic Boris Tadiƒá of the Democratic Party (DS). The paper generally espoused rightist political views and promoted the SRS political agenda. Pravda created minor controversy in Serbia when in November 2007 it started publishing irregular columns by Mira Markoviƒá, the wife of late Serbian and Yugoslav president Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá and herself a fugitive from the Serbian justice system. The paper's 1 June 2012 issue was announced to be its last as the newspaper folded. It switched to an all-digital online format.Uga≈°en list \\"Pravda\\", B92.net, 1 June 2012 Reaction Pravda is frequently cited, including by Predrag Popovic, its onetime editor-in-chief, as having been a publication controlled by Aleksandar Vuƒçiƒá and tailored for his personal day- to-day political needs, When the daily got launched in March 2007, Vuƒçiƒá was a high-ranking member of the Serbian Radical Party (SRS), an opposition party whose leader Vojislav ≈†e≈°elj had been detained in the Hague, awaiting trial, since February 2003. In a November 2014 interview, upon being temporarily released from detention, Vojislav ≈†e≈°elj mentioned that the roots of Vuƒçiƒá's row with Serb businessman Miroslav Mi≈°koviƒá and the tycoon's subsequent persecution and incarceration were in their past dealings over Pravda: > \\"According to my information, Vuƒçiƒá asked Mi≈°koviƒá for money for Pravda on > several occasions, but got rejected each time. Mi≈°koviƒá reasoned that > already paying Tomislav Nikoliƒá off with large sums of money was more than > enough so he figured why now also pay Vuƒçiƒá.

The information is then collated and downloaded on to a CD or DVD, which is analyzed on a computer by an accredited individual.

Geography Eyres Monsell is bounded to the north by the historic village of Aylestone. To the east is the village of South Wigston and to the south and west is the civil parish of Glen Parva. The ward is also adjacent to Blaby. The area is defined by Saffron Road to the east, the Birmingham to Peterborough railway to the south, and Leicester Road to the west. Although located in the far south-west corner of Leicester, the area is under the administration of Leicester City Council rather than Leicestershire County Council as some of the neighbouring areas are. Eyres Monsell is five miles south of Leicester city centre and is in walking distance from Fosse shopping park in Enderby. It is the southernmost ward of Leicester City. History St Hugh's Church, Sturdee Road The late 1940s saw an urgent need for new housing. The late 1940s and 1950s saw a large increase in housing being built across Leicester, including 2,500 new houses built between 1946-1959 in Eyres Monsell, which was being built south and adjacent to earlier Saffron Lane Estate.https://www.le.ac.uk/emoha/community/resources/postwar/Leicester%20History%20Notes%201945-1962.pdf Eyres Monsell had been purchased, for the sum of ¬£40,500, in 1950 from councillor Bolton Eyres-Monsell (after whom the area is named) in a compulsory purchase order by Leicester City Council. Previously the land was largely rural which allowed the Council to avoid building tower blocks, and instead focus on open-plan development and greener spaces. Eyres Monsell would become Leicester's second largest estate built after World War II.

Macy and Marcia Gay Harden. The film was released as The Heist in the United Kingdom. Plot Roger (Christopher Walken) is a security guard at an art museum, where he spends a lot of time staring at his favorite painting, The Lonely Maiden, a beautiful woman staring forlornly out into the distance. Despite the fact he has a wife, Rose (Marcia Gay Harden), he has become rather obsessed with the painting. Rose wants Roger to retire so they can move to Florida. One afternoon, Roger learns that several pieces including The Lonely Maiden are to be permanently moved to another museum in Copenhagen, Denmark. Unable to follow the maiden, Roger falls into despair until he meets Charles (Morgan Freeman), another guard who has a similar attraction to a painting on another floor, a painting of a woman with cats. George (William H. Macy) is also obsessed with a piece of art, a nude sculpture of a Greek warrior; he often strips down and poses naked beside it during his night shift. Using the advantages between their shifts and experience, George comes up with the idea to steal their favorite works of art and replace them with replicas. Roger volunteers to tag the artworks being shipped, while Charles and George seek assistance in replicating their favorites. Because Charles is a painter, he's able to do the cat painting perfectly, but he fails in capturing The Lonely Maiden. The men hire a street artist (Breckin Meyer) for that task, forcing Roger to steal Rose's Florida vacation savings to pay for the job. Rose becomes suspicious and nearly ends up having Roger taken off the volunteer staff. George manages to replicate \\"his\\" sculpture and the Maiden copy is also completed. On the day of the switch, George sneaks into the warehouse in the crate with the statue. He successfully swaps the three marked pieces, but can't resist stripping down and posing with the statue. A guard shows up, forcing George to hide in the crate without his clothes. The next morning, when Roger and Charlie (with the unwitting accompaniment of Rose) come to collect him, the crate containing George ends up in the wrong van. A panic-stricken Charlie gives chase, and they manage to successfully rescue George, who emerges from the shipping crate unclothed, much to Rose's shock. Having pulled off the heist without getting caught, they retire from their jobs and Rose is none the wiser. On a trip to Florida, Roger is enthralled by Rose as she looks out over the ocean because she strikingly resembles the Lonely Maiden pose. Their love life is rekindled. Meanwhile, the three men hide their treasures in a shack on Charles' apartment roof so that they can go and view them at their leisure. However, when Roger looks at the painting, it doesn't inspire him like it once did. He smiles and remembers his wife. Meanwhile, in Copenhagen, a guard on duty passes The Lonely Maiden copy and looks at it, smiling. Cast * Morgan Freeman as Charles Peterson * Christopher Walken as Roger Barlow * William H.

It was investigated by the Serious Fraud Office, the City of London Police, the Accountancy Investigation and Disciplinary Board and the subject of many civil legal actions in the High Court.\\"Langbar launches legal challenges\\" Investors Chronicle 17 March 2006 Crown Corporation, which changed its name to Langbar International Limited in 2005, was a pump and dump fraud, in that the company did not possess the assets that it declared at listing. History Created as Crown Corporation Limited (CCL) in Bermuda, the company was listed on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) in London in October 2003. Its purpose was purportedly buying companies that were not living up to their economic potentials and improving them before selling them at a profit. 59% of the shares in the company were purchased by Lambert Financial Investments for a total of $570 million, with $275 million presented as certificate of deposit from Banco de Brasil and $295 million to be paid later, but CCL was notified that the certificate was fraudulent and the funds were never paid. Other stockholders failed to pay for their shares. In spite of being aware of the serious financial shortcomings, CCL misled investors as to the state of its finances, including making increasingly extravagant claims about its financial activities. In June 2005, Stuart Pearson, head of Langbar Capital. A British business executive, Pearson was brought to Brazil and presented with an elaborate deception meant to convince Pearson that the company's financial value was legitimate. The company merged with Pearson's investment firm, taking its name of Langbar International. The value of Langbar International rose with Pearson's declarations to the market that the funds had been released from Brazil, which encouraged further investment. However, trading was suspended in October when the company's value was questioned, and in short order the company collapsed altogether. Investors, most of whom purchased after Pearson came aboard, lost as much 100 million. Nabarro Wells, a London firm that had advised Langbar, was fined ¬£250,000 for due diligence failures in 2007. In 2008, shareholders in Langbar International. The Serious Fraud Office was aggressively pursuing conspirators in the fraud with seven arrests in Spain and Switzerland when the man The Guardian characterized as the central conspirator, Lambert head Avi Arad, died of a heart attack. According to the Guardian, \\"the prospect of other potential defendants blaming Arad for the fraud was now glaring.\\" Given the death of Arad, the disposition of Pearson was the final stage in the investigation by the SFO. Charged with 13 counts of fraud, Pearson faced trial to determine the question of how much he knew of the fraud and when he had discovered it. Evidence was presented that Pearson had overlooked warnings, including a phone call from a banker at the London branch of Banco de Brasil informing him that there was no record of the money from Lambert. With a jury convinced of at least criminal negligence, Pearson was found guilty in 2011 on three counts, for making \\"misleading, false or deceptive or reckless\\" claims about the existence of the money. Barred from being a director for five years, he was also sentenced to a year in jail, but the SFO determined that confiscation of assets from Pearson could not be made because he had been acquitted of dishonesty, had been sentenced for recklessness, and had lost money himself. The blatant fraud contributed to a rewriting of company requirements on Aim.

The Romans built a fort there to help supply Hadrian's Wall. Many ruins still exist today. The fort was abandoned as the empire declined. In the 6th century, northeast England became a centre of education as part of the Kingdom of Northumbria. The Vikings raided the area in the 9th century, establishing settlements and controlling most of northern England. The town was founded in 1245, and developed as a fishing port. Salt-panning became began in 1499. During the Civil War, parliament's Scottish allies captured the town, leading the royalists to flee south, leading to the Battle of Boldon Hill. In the Victorian era, coal mining led to a boom in the town, increasing from 12,000 in 1801 to 75,000 by the 1860s. The rapid growth made sanitation a problem. In the 1850s, shipbuilding became a prominent industry. Zeppelin airships attacked the town in World War I, and Nazi air raids caused damage and death in World War II. Throughout the 20th century, industry declined and services and tourism played an increasing role in the economy. Foundation and Roman Times The earliest inhabitants of the area were the Brigantes, a strong and fiercely independent Briton tribe however there is no evidence to suggest they built a settlement where the present day town now stands. It was John Leland in the 16th century who first suggested the town had been known as 'Caer Urfa.' The Brythonic word 'Caer' meaning a fortified place or seat of royal power, 'Urfa' is suggested to be a simple corruption of 'Vide Infra' the Aramaic name for the Roman stronghold. A large Roman fort has been excavated in South Shields on the Lawe Top, overlooking the River Tyne; it has been the setting for an investigation by the Channel 4 archaeological television programme Time Team. Founded c. AD 120 the fort is mentioned in The Notitia Dignitatum (a list of forts and bases compiled in the 4th century) where it is referred to as Arbeia. Arbeia, meaning \\"place of the Arabs\\" (one of the garrisons being the Tigris Boatmen from modern day Iraq), was intended as the maritime supply fort for Hadrian's Wall, and contains the only permanent stone-built granaries yet found in Britain. It was occupied until the Romans left Britain in the 5th century. A Roman gatehouse and barracks have been reconstructed on their original foundations, while a museum holds artefacts such as an altarpiece to a previously unknown god, and a Roman-era gravestone set up by a native Palmyrene to his freedwoman and wife, a Briton of the Catuvellauni tribe. There is also a tablet with the name of the emperor Alexander Severus (died 235) chiselled off. The fort was at the end of a road named Wrekendike, connected to a larger road which led between Newcastle (Pons Aelivs) and Chester-Le-Street (Congangis); parts of this road are still visible in Wrekenton near Gateshead. The Romans also built a small wharf in nearby Marsden Bay for the purposes of loading sandstone from a quarry. The wharf's remnants are still extant, although time and tide have left little to see. Arbeia was abandoned by the Romans c. 400, when Emperor Honorius informed the people of Britain that they must look to their own country's defence. One of the many peoples to take advantage of the Roman Empire's collapse were the Anglo-Saxons. Dark Ages Britain in the 6th century is often considered a confused and violent place, the Romans taking their laws, gods and legions with them, when they left. However, the north east of England became a centre of learning and education, a beacon of light throughout Europe. King Oswald of Northumbria united the kingdoms of Bernicia to the north of the River Tees and Deira to the South creating the powerful and influential Kingdom of Northumbria. In AD 647 King Oswy of Northumbria (Oswald's Brother) at the request of St. Aidan allowed a monastery to be built. The site today is in the very town centre of South Shields and is named St. Hilda's Church although the original Anglo-Saxon building is but a remnant under the present Norman nave. St. Hilda's was one of many monastic institutions along the coast of north east England including Jarrow, where the Venerable Bede lived and worked. C. AD 865 the monastery at St. Hilda's was raided by the Vikings . However the Vikings or Danes weren't just raiders; they created settlements, brought new customs, laws and Gods, effectively controlling all of northern England. This form of government was known as the Danelaw. The Anglian (or Danish) influence can be seen to this day; the Geordie accent which contains words of Danish origin and has many more Anglo-Saxon pronunciations than standard English. Middle Ages In 1100 the Normans built St Hilda's church where the nunnery once stood, in the town's market place. The church remains one of the oldest churches in the UK. The first reference to 'Scheles' (fishermens' huts) occurs in 1235, and the town proper was founded by the Prior and Convent of Durham in 1245 . On account of the complaints of the burgesses of Newcastle upon Tyne, an order was made in 1258, stipulating that no ships should be laden or unladen at Shields, and that no shoars or quays should be built there. However, South Shields subsequently developed as a fishing port. Salt panning along the Tyne began in 1499 and achieved major importance; Daniel Defoe speaks of the clouds of smoke being visible for miles, while a witness in 1743 mentions two hundred boiling-pans. Glass manufacturing was begun by Isaac Cookson in the 1730sIsaac Cookson at Oxford Dictionary of National Biography and there were eight glass works by 1827 . Coal mining and chemical manufacture also became important. South Shields had the largest alkali works in the world. In 1644, during the English Civil War, Parliament's Scottish allies under Alexander Leslie, 1st Earl of Leven wanted to capture the Tyne and Newcastle upon Tyne. Leslie captured the fort on the Lawe Top, following a lengthy siege. After the capture, the Royalist forces retreated to the south and evidence suggests a consequential skirmish may have occurred in the small town of Boldon, the ensuing skirmish is known as the Battle of Boldon Hill, though the topography of Boldon is not favourable for a battle. 19th century Following the Reform Act of 1832, championed by Lord Grey and the Whigs, County Durham was able to return two members for two divisions, and the boroughs of Gateshead and South Shields acquired representation. The coal industry flourished in Victorian times, drawing immigrants from far and wide. In South Shields the population soared from approximately 12,000 in 1801 to 75,000 by the late 1860s. Collieries in South Shields included: *Templetown (1805‚Äì1826) *St. Hilda's (1810‚Äì1940) *West Harton (1844‚Äì1969) *Boldon (1869‚Äì1982) *Marsden (1879‚Äì1968) *Whitburn (1879‚Äì1968) *Westoe (1909‚Äì1993) Coal mining was very hazardous. Shafts could collapse at any time and before the safety lamp was invented in 1815 naked flames carried by miners to light their way could ignite gas underground causing explosions and many deaths. Some mines even had shafts that stretched several miles out under the sea. Overcrowding in the town made sanitation a problem, partly solved by Cleadon Water Pumping Station (a large tower erected in 1858 above the town following an outbreak of cholera). South Shields' place at the mouth of the Tyne with shifting and unpredictable sand bars and channels into the river meant that ships frequently ran aground. Following one such incident the world's first self-righting lifeboat was designed by William Wouldhave in 1790. In the 1850s, with the Tyne's growing shipbuilding industry and the mouth of the Tyne. South and North Shields needed to stop the flow of sand that threatened shipping. In 1854 the first foundations were laid of the North and South Piers. They were both completed in 1885. An engineering problem was encountered in managing the new piers. The sand on Littlehaven Beach was now flowing up the Tyne through the incoming tide. As a solution the Herd Groyne Pier was erected in 1882. South Shields-born Charles Palmer opened his shipyard in 1851 at Jarrow, at first building wooden ships and then moving onto iron. His shipyard patented rolled armour-plate for warships. In 1865 Alderman John Readhead founded his shipyard John Readhead & Sons in South Shields, which built small cargo ships and colliers for clients the world over until the yard was closed in 1968. Various slipways and dry docks can still be seen today stretching from Tyne Dock towards the mouth of the Tyne. Joseph Mallord William Turner 1775‚Äì1851. 'Shields on the River Tyne' 1823 Turner made an engraving of Shields on the River Tyne in 1823. This is now in Tate Britain in London. He also painted Keelmen Hauling Coals by Night in 1835, having himself rowed out into the Tyne at Jarrow Slake in order to do so. The town became famous for its maritime industries and the Marine School was founded by Dr. Thomas Winterbottom in 1837. Originally in Ocean Road, it is now part of South Tyneside College in Westoe Village and has an international reputation. From the late 1980s to 2008 it possessed the nationally unique combined public observatory and planetarium, which has provided education and entertainment for twenty thousand children a year. During the industrial boom years of the 19th and early 20th centuries, many notable public buildings were built across the town, reflecting its wealth. These included the town hall of 1910, and the Customs House. South Shields was incorporated as a municipal borough in 1850 under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835. It became a county borough in 1889 with the passing of the Local Government Act 1888, and remained as such until 1974 when it became part of the Metropolitan Borough of South Tyneside in the (now former) county of Tyne and Wear. The Shields Gazette, founded in 1849, is the oldest provincial evening newspaper in the United Kingdom. 20th century In 1908‚Äì1909, The Harton Coal Company (which by this time owned all of the collieries in South Shields and the surrounding area, as well as the Marsden limestone quarries) embarked on a scheme to almost completely electrify their collieries, both above and below ground, including the network of lines connecting the collieries at St. Hilda, Harton and Westoe (then known as Benthouse) to staithes on the river. Wagons of coal from Boldon and Whitburn were steam-hauled to sidings in the town, where they could be collected by electric locomotives. Siemens carried out the electrification work, as well as supplying the locomotives for use on the electrified sections of the railway. When this work was completed, the electricity used by the HCC at the five collieries amounted to around 6% of that available to the coal industry as a whole, which for a time made it one of the largest single users of electricity in the entire country. The last of the \\"Harton Electrics\\" were retired in 1989. Four of the locomotives are preserved: E4 at the Stephenson Railway Museum, E2 at Beamish Museum, with E10 and the AEG-built E9 at the Tanfield Railway. The Rattler pub on the seafront is named after the passenger service run primarily for miners by the HCC between Westoe Lane Station and Whitburn Colliery, using a motley collection of second-hand rolling stock, which gave a very rough ride and resulted in its rather unflattering nickname. Most of the trackbed of the colliery railway has either been built on or turned into footpaths. The impressive South Shields Town Hall of 1910 bears a copper weather vane in the form of a galleon. The town's crest (pre-1974) featured the lifeboat and the associated motto - Always Ready - which was later adopted as the motto of South Tyneside. Zeppelin airships raided the Tyne in World War I and the town's seafront amusement park was attacked in 1915. In World War II, South Shields suffered well over 200 air raid alerts and 156 people were killed. Many houses were damaged, particularly by incendiary bombs and parachute mines. One direct hit on the market place killed more than 40 people who had taken shelter in tunnels below the square. There was a memorial to them in the form of a cobbled Union Flag on the ground of the market square, however, this was removed as part of an overhaul of the town centre in the late 1990s. South Shields lost more seafarers than any other port in Britain during World War II. The celebrated artist L S Lowry spent frequent periods at the Seaburn Hotel in Sunderland, and painted a number of works in South Shields.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/uk/10141164/LS- Lowry-in-the-North-East.html Historically the town was part of County Durham, but it became part of Tyne and Wear in 1974. In 1977 the town was visited by boxer Muhammad Ali, whose wedding was blessed in the local mosque at Laygate. The visit has since been the subject of a BBC documentary. Ali visited the town after receiving an invitation from a local boys' boxing club.BBC - Tyne - History - The King of South Shields: A knockout royal visit On 1 September 1987, Johnny Cash performed an open-air concert at Bents Park. Recently a 'lost' interview was discovered, the only interview granted by Cash just before this show. South Shields has undergone significant economic change in the light of de-industrialisation. Service industries, including tourism and retail, play an increasing role in the economic make-up of the town and indeed across the wider area.

It was one of the residences of Archbishops of Strasbourg, rulers of the Prince- Bishopric of Strasbourg, which was an ecclesiastical principality of the Holy Roman Empire from the 13th century until 1803. A series of members of the House of Rohan held the see in the 18th century. The 140 metre wide fa√ßade of red Vosges sandstone is considered to be one of the most impressive examples of its kind. The building was erected between 1780 and 1790 by the architect Nicolas Salins de Montfort on the site of the previous building, which had been built in 1670 and burned down in 1779. This previous building had in turn replaced the small Ch√¢teau Vieux (Old Castle) of 1417, which is still preserved today. That building saw two of the three marriages of Charles, Prince de Soubise; firstly in 1741 to Anne Therese of Savoy and secondly to Anne Victoire of Hesse-Rotenburg in 1745. The architect of the new castle had been commissioned by the Strasbourg Prince-Bishop Louis Ren√© √âdouard de Rohan- Gu√©m√©n√©, who also resided in the magnificent Rohan Palace in the city where he held office, as well as in the less stately Rohan Castle of Mutzig. In order to furnish the castle, Louis Ren√© assembled a vast collection of costly Qing porcelain and lacquerware. The surviving pieces of this collection are prominently displayed in the apartments of the Strasbourg palace.Le go√ªt chinois du cardinal de Rohan By the time of the outbreak of the French Revolution, only the outside was completed. When cleric rule was abolished, the building lost both its owner and its function. The gradual decline of the building was stopped under Napoleon III, who had it renovated and extended in the direction of the city. Already in 1853, the park was irrevocably cut and destroyed by the Marne-Rhine Canal. Since 1858, the castle houses a city museum (history, decorative arts, a large archaeological department), which was joined by the art and ethnographic collection of the politician Louise Weiss in the 20th century. Previously, the castle had served at times as a home for officers' widows and, after the Franco-Prussian War, as a barracks. Today, one of its wings is used as a youth hostel, and another houses the Espace Rohan, Saverne's 500-seat theatre and concert hall. The castle is listed as a Monument historique since 1933 by the French Ministry of Culture.

Morville Hall is located at the junction of the A458 road and the B4368 road, three miles outside the market town of Bridgnorth. It is a large grey stone mansion with projecting wings, originally built in two storeys in the 16th-century but increased to three as part of an 18th-century enlargement. Once part of the Aldenham estate, the house stands on the site of the abandoned Morville Priory. Morville Hall was originally an Elizabethan country house dating from 1546, at the time the site was acquired by Roger Smyth, who married into the local Cressett family. It was enlarged and expanded around 1750 by Arthur Weaver, MP for Bridgnorth. The gardens are the main attraction for many visitors and incorporates the Dower house Gardens and features such as a Cloister garden and Elizabethan knot garden. The gardens have been a 15-year project for Katherine Swift who wanted to show how gardens have developed and evolved through history. Each section of her garden relates to a previous occupant of the Hall, from the Elizabethan Smyths through to the 18th century Weavers, and finally to the seven Victorian age Warren sisters who lived on in the house long after the death of their father, the last one, Juliana, dying in the 1920s.

Bernard & Graefe Verlag, Bonn 1996, p. 65 chief designer and inventor.The University of Texas at Dallas: Vice Admiral Charles E. Rosendahl Collection - Biographical Information (See also: Charles E. Rosendahl) Zaschka is one of the first German helicopter pioneers and he is a pioneer of flying with muscle power and the folding car. Zaschka devoted himself primarily to aviation and automotive topics, but his work was not limited to them. Engelbert Zaschka is a prominent representative of the rotary aircraft, a class of rotorcraft systems - according to Zaschka. In 1928/1929 Zaschka developed and constructed the first collapsible and foldable small car (folding car) and in 1934 an early muscle-powered airplane. Biography Engelbert Zaschka came from a family of musicians, his father Wenzel taught zither and played in the Freiburg City Orchestra, his mother Emilie, n√©e Rombach, was a singer; he was the second oldest of four children. He grew up in the Scheffelstra√üe and in the B√ºrgerwehrstra√üe, where his father had the tenement house no. 11 built in art nouveau style in 1910. At the age of 14 he applied for his first patent, founded a \\"hobby flying club\\" in Freiburg-Wiehre and allegedly made his first flying attempts at the Freiburg Schlossberg. After attending the \\"H√∂here B√ºrgerschule\\" in Freiburg, he went to Altenburg to study engineering. Afterwards he worked as an engineer at Rheinmetall in D√ºsseldorf and went to Berlin in 1916. There he worked as chief designer at Orion Aktiengesellschaft f√ºr Motorfahrzeuge. In the 1930s and 1940s Zaschka was employed by the aircraft manufacturer Henschel. In Berlin, he was registered in 1926 in the Neuk√∂lln district of Lichtenrader Stra√üe 59, in 1929 in Selchower Stra√üe 15/16 near Tempelhofer Flugfeld, in 1934 in Flughafenstra√üe 21 and in 1943 in Weserstra√üe 34a. After the Second World War, he settled again in Freiburg im Breisgau, where he operated a workshop (vehicle factory. family bicycles or Zaschka vehicle factory) at T√ºrkenlouisstra√üe 47. Zaschka died on 26 June 1955 in his hometown Freiburg im Breisgau. Zaschka became one of the first German helicopter pioneers. His machine is a striking representative of the Rotationsflugzeug (Zaschka calls it \\"rotating airplane\\").Engelbert Zaschka: Drehfl√ºgelflugzeuge. Trag- und Hubschrauber. C.J.E. Volckmann Nachf. E. Wette, Berlin-Charlottenburg 1936, p. 57 Chief Engineer Engelbert Zaschka pursued in 1929 in Berlin, the approach of the folding-Zaschka three-wheeler. This city car concept was aimed to be cost effective and space saving by the vehicle could be folded after use sparingly. In 1934 Engelbert Zaschka completed a large human-powered aircraft. He was an inventor who held numerous international patents as it related to the helicopter. Engineering Activities = Zaschka Helicopter = Zaschka- Rotationsflugzeug (Zaschka Rotary-Wing Airplane) In 1927Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum Washington: Zaschka Helicopter (1927) Engelbert Zaschka of Berlin built a helicopter, equipped with two rotors, in which a gyroscope was used to increase stability and serves as an energy accumulator for a gliding flight to make a landing. Gliding in this case means a straight descent. He wanted to develop an efficient propeller drive.Engelbert Zaschka: Drehfl√ºgelflugzeuge. Trag- und Hubschrauber. C.J.E. Volckmann Nachf. E. Wette, Berlin-Charlottenburg 1936, p. 47 A swivelling propeller at the rear provided propulsion and rudder control. The machine was a combination of an autogyro and a helicopter. The principal advantage of the machine, Zaschka says, is in its ability to remain motionless in the air for any length of time and to descend in a vertical line, so that a landing may be accomplished on the flat roof of a large house. In appearance, the helicopter does not differ much from the ordinary monoplane, but the carrying wings revolve around the body. = Zaschka Human-Power Aircraft (1934) = Zaschka Human-Power Aircraft, Berlin 1934 In 1934Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum Washington: Zaschka Human-Power Aircraft (1934) Engelbert Zaschka completed a large human-powered aircraft, the Zaschka Human-Power Aircraft.

Once in the skin, the bacterium Dermatophilus congolensis causes inflammation of the skin as well as the appearance of scabs and lesions. Symptoms There are two different manifestations of rain scald: the winter form, which is more severe due to the longer coat of the horse, and the summer form, which is less severe. Horses are usually affected on the back, head, and neck where insects commonly bite, and the legs, which are commonly infected if the horse is kept in moist footing. Initially, the horse will display a matted coat and bumps which will progress to crusty scabs and lesions. The animal may also be pruritic and display signs of discomfort. Diagnosis Diagnosis is most commonly done with the identification of bacteria in the lesions by microscopic evaluation. A positive diagnosis of rain scald can be confirmed if filamentous bacteria are observed, as well as chains of small, spherical bacteria (cocci). If a diagnosis cannot be confirmed with a microscope, blood agar cultures can be grown to confirm the presence of D. congolensis. The resulting colonies have filaments and are yellow in colour. Treatment Rain scald normally heals on its own; however, the condition can spread, so prompt treatment is recommended. Although some cases can be severe, most rain scald is minor and can be treated at home naturally. Treatment involves cleaning affected areas with antiseptic scrub and applying a solution of 1% potash alum. Affected areas should be gently washed with a mild disinfectant shampoo or solution like chlorhexidine or povidone iodine. A broad-spectrum antibiotic powder, spray or ointment is applied. Severely affected horses may need systemic antibiotic treatment by injection or by mouth. Typically the condition is not life-threatening, nor does it impact the welfare of the horse, so treatments are more for the owner's peace of mind and cosmetic appeal of the animal. Prevention In addition to wet conditions, exposure to ticks, biting flies, and contact with other infected animals can also cause the spread of rain scald. Tick and insect control is an effective way to stop the spread of the bacteria from one animal to another. Separating infected animals will help to isolate bacterial colonies. Keeping the animal in a dry, well-ventilated area out of the rain and wet conditions will stop the bacteria from growing. As the bacteria multiplies best in warm, wet conditions, keeping the horse stabled, sheltered, or rugged with a waterproof rug during wet weather, protects the skin from prolonged wetting and helps to prevent infection.

In the United Kingdom, Emergency Diversion Routes are planned road traffic routes that bypass the main trunk road network. Emergency Diversion routes provide the public, where possible, with a planned, checked and agreed junction to junction diversion route that circumnavigates an incident which has resulted in the closure of the main carriageway. In some other locations suitable diversion routes are not possible; this then requires the Highways Agency and its partners to implement alternative tactics such as strategic signs and signals. These are managed by the National Traffic Control Centre (NTCC). Emergency diversion routes are marked with road signs in the form of simple geometric shapes - open and filled circles, squares, and diamonds. Normally, these additions to roadsigns will be ignored by drivers. When an incident closes a motorway or trunk road, police and Highways England Traffic Officers can activate 'trigger signs' at junctions before a closure advising traffic as to which symbol to follow around the incident along an alternative road and bring road users back onto the motorway or main road at a later junction beyond the closure.

It is a major architectural, historical, and cultural landmark in the city. It was built next to Strasbourg Cathedral in the 1730s, from designs by Robert de Cotte, and is considered a masterpiece of French Baroque architecture. Since its completion in 1742, the palace has hosted a number of French monarchs such as Louis XV, Marie Antoinette, Napoleon and Jos√©phine, and Charles X. Reflecting the history of Strasbourg and of France, the palace has been owned successively by the nobility, the municipality, the monarchy, the state, the university, and the municipality again. Its architectural conception and its iconography were intended to indicate the return of Roman Catholicism to the city, which had been dominated by Protestantism for the previous two centuries. Thus the prelate's apartments face the cathedral, to the north, and many of the statues, reliefs and paintings reflect the Catholic dogma. Since the end of the 19th century the palace has been home to three of Strasbourg's most important museums: the Archaeological Museum (Mus√©e arch√©ologique, basement), the Museum of Decorative Arts (Mus√©e des arts d√©coratifs, ground floor) and the Museum of Fine Arts (Mus√©e des beaux-arts, first and second floor). The municipal art gallery, Galerie Robert Heitz, in a lateral wing of the palace, is used for temporary exhibitions. The Palais Rohan has been listed since 1920 as a Monument historique by the French Ministry of Culture.  History  = Up to 1871 = In 1727 Armand Gaston Maximilien de Rohan, bishop of Strasbourg since 1704 and cardinal since 1712, commissioned the architect Robert de Cotte to design the palace; deCotte provided initial plans the same year. Seven years prior, in 1720, Cardinal deRohan had already charged deCotte with renovation and embellishment works on his castle in Saverne, the predecessor of the current Rohan Castle. DeCotte had also previously designed the H√¥tel du grand Doyenn√©, the first h√¥tel particulier in Louis Quinze style built in Strasbourg. The Palais Rohan was built on the site of the former residence of the bishop, the \\"bishop's demesne\\", which is recorded since at least 1262. The area itself is near the heart of the ancient Argentoratum, first mentioned in 12BC. Diverse archaeological excavations on Place du Ch√¢teau, the square facing the palace, have unearthed many remains of the Roman camp. Building work on the Palais Rohan took place from 1732 until 1742Martin, p. 94. under the supervision of the municipal architect Joseph Massol, who also worked on the H√¥tel de Hanau and the H√¥tel de Klinglin during the early years of the project. Massol was assisted by the architects Laurent Gourlade and √âtienne LeChevalier. The sculptures, including statues as well as reliefs, were provided by Robert Le Lorrain, assisted by Johann August Nahl, Gaspard Pollet, and Laurent Leprince, and the paintings by and . The √©b√©niste Bernard Kocke and the ironworkers and locksmiths Jean-Fran√ßois Agon and his son Antoine Agon worked on the furnishings of the apartments, while the stucco was the work of the Italians Castelli and Morsegno.Martin, pp. 94‚Äì95, 116, 121, 153, 181, 184. A budget of 344,000 French livres had been established for the construction ‚Äì 200,000 livres lent from the Cathedral chapter (Grand Chapitre) and 144,000 raised as local taxes over a period of twelve years ‚Äì but the final cost is estimated at one million French livres. The palace is mostly built in yellow sandstone from Wasselonne, with pink sandstone for the less visible parts. The House of Rohan owned the palace until the French Revolution, when it was confiscated, declared bien national (\\"state owned\\"), and finally auctioned off on 8August 1791.Martin, p. 214. Bought by the municipality, it became the new town hall (h√¥tel deville) the same year, succeeding the Neubau. Much of the furniture and many of the works of art in the Palais were sold, and in 1793 the eight life-sized mural portraits of prince-bishops decorating the Salle des √©v√™ques (Bishops' Hall) were destroyed. They were replaced in 1796 by allegories of civic virtues painted by Joseph Melling. Only the portrait of Armand Gaston, the builder of the palace, was later restored to its original place with a 1982 replica of Hyacinthe Rigaud's lost painting. Melling also replaced the overdoor portraits of kings of France, decorating the same room with paintings of vases.Martin, p. 221, note 86. The Palais Rohan remained the h√¥tel de ville until 1805. That year, the municipality presented it to Napoleon, who returned the H√¥tel deHanau in exchange. Like the palace, the h√¥tel had been state-owned since the Revolution. The 1805 arrangement proved favourable for the municipality: the maintenance of the H√¥tel deHanau was less costly than that of the larger Palais Rohan. It pleased Napoleon, for whom the palace was the more conspicuous display of grandeur. As for the palace, imperial ownership meant renewed splendour. The present to Napoleon was officially accepted by decree on 21January 1806; the interiors were then refurbished by the architect Pierre-Fran√ßois-L√©onard Fontaine. In the years before the Franco-Prussian War and the return of Alsace to Germany, the Palais Rohan was the property of the French state, which was in turn an empire, a kingdom, a monarchy, a republic, and again an empire. = Since 1871 = The palace on 5October 1744, during a visit of King Louis XV of France The year 1871 signified the end of French rule and the beginning of German rule over Alsace, which had until 1681 been linked to Germany through the Holy Roman Empire. Having lost the Franco-Prussian War, France had to cede the departments of Bas-Rhin, Haut-Rhin, and Moselle (the territory also known as Alsace-Lorraine, or Elsass-Lothringen in German) to the newly created German Empire. Now under new administration and having lost its residential purpose, the Palais Rohan had to be assigned a new role. Between 1872 and 1884, until the opening of the Palais universitaire, it was used by the newly established Kaiser-Wilhelms-Universit√§t, the Imperial German version of the University of Strasbourg, as the seat of the faculties of law, philosophy, and sciences. The palace then served as the university's library until the opening of the National and University Library in 1895. After this, the palace again became the property of the city and was adapted to receive the municipal art collections that were being built up again by director Wilhelm von Bode after their total destruction during the Siege of Strasbourg (see below, Mus√©e des beaux-arts). The first section of the new Kunstmuseum der Stadt Strassburg, established in 1898, was inaugurated in 1899. After the return of Alsace to French rule in 1918, the new director of the Mus√©e des beaux-arts and the Mus√©e des arts d√©coratifs, Hans Haug (1890‚Äì1965), put major efforts into presenting the Palais Rohan as a coherent whole again. Strasbourg suffered during World War II, and on 11August 1944 the palace was damaged by British and American bombs. After the war, restoration measures were soon undertaken under the supervision of the architects Robert Danis (1879‚Äì1949) and Bertrand Monnet (1910‚Äì1989), but in 1947 a fire broke out and devastated a significant part of the collections of the Museum of Fine Arts. This fire was an indirect consequence of the bombing raids: because of the destruction inflicted on the palace, the building had suffered from damp, which was treated with welding torches, and poor handling of these caused the fire. Rebuilding and refurbishing the palace took until well into the 1950s, with full restoration not completed until the 1990s.Recht, Foessel, Klein, p. 66. In 1989 a large trompe-l'≈ìil fresco depicting the Roman goddess Ceres was rediscovered behind layers of plaster and white paint in the former dining hall, the eastern wing of the Synod Hall (see below, Apartments). It is thought to have been concealed under Napoleonic ownership, and had been forgotten since.Schnitzler, p. 53. = Notable guests = Fresco depicting Ceres, rediscovered in 1989 King Louis XV of France stayed in the palace from 5 to 10October 1744. Maria Josepha of Saxony, Dauphine of France, spent two nights in the palace from 27 to 29January 1747. Queen Marie Antoinette spent her first night on French soil there on 7 to 8May 1770. In 1805, 1806, and 1809 Emperor Napoleon spent several nights in the palace; his wife, Empress Josephine stayed for longer periods, from September 1805 until January 1806 (Battle of Austerlitz), and from May until July 1809 (Battles of Aspern-Essling and of Battle of Wagram).Martin, p. 190.Martin, p. 219. Napoleon's second wife, Empress Marie Louise, spent her first nights on French soil in the palace, from 22 to 25March 1810; she came from Austria like Marie-Antoinette. Other royal French guests were Charles X, on 7 and 8September 1828, and Louis Philippe I from 18 to 21June 1831. In the early 20th century, the sculptor Ringel d‚Ä≤Illzach used one of the rooms of the palace as an atelier. After World War II, the first great art exhibition in the palace, \\"L'Alsace fran√ßaise 1648‚Äì1948\\", was inaugurated on 13June 1948 by Jean de Lattre de Tassigny,Schnitzler, pp. 184‚Äì185. one of the chief artisans of the Liberation of Alsace (1944‚Äì45). On 8 May 1985, American President Ronald Reagan dined in the Palace and signed the official Strasbourg guestbook, on the occasion of his visit to the European Parliament. In December 1989, the Palais Rohan hosted the dinner parties of the heads of state of the European Council, including Fran√ßois Mitterrand, Helmut Kohl, Margaret Thatcher, Giulio Andreotti and Felipe Gonz√°lez. Twenty years later, before the 2009 Strasbourg‚ÄìKehl summit, it was the site of a meeting between French President Nicolas Sarkozy and his American counterpart Barack Obama as well as their wives Carla Bruni and Michelle Obama. In the 21st century, the palace was the setting for the official dinner for the 2016 Fed Cup finalists, the gala dinners for the 20th and the 25th anniversary of Eurimages, as well as other festive receptions, since it can be booked for such occasions from the municipality.  Structure  The palace is structured around a large and paved courtyard. It has a trapezoidal plan, and the land falls away toward the river Ill. To compensate for the slope, the riverside (southern) fa√ßade of the main wing has four floors (including the Mansard roof), while the courtyard (northern) fa√ßade has three floors. The half-buried floor corresponds to the basement and now houses the archaeological museum (see below, Museums). The riverside fa√ßade is thus both the highest and the widest of the palace. The terrace before it, facing the quai des Bateliers, is closed at both ends by elaborate wrought-iron gates adorned with the coat of arms of the House of Rohan.Martin, p. 87. The riverside fa√ßade is formed by the main residential bulk and the library wing on the west side, which offers a contrast in shape and design, notably through its single, very large window. The main part of the fa√ßade is symmetrically arranged around an avant-corps of four columns with Corinthian capitals. The avant-corps is crowned with a voluminous triangular pediment, again adorned with the coat of arms of the House of Rohan, while the library wing is crowned with a semicircular pediment. That pediment was originally surmounted by two copper statues of angels, now lost.Martin, pp. 87‚Äì90. The library wing was not part of the original 1727 plan but was conceived in 1733, after the cardinal bought up and demolished a row of houses on the current rue de Rohan. The architect, Robert de Cotte, was thus able to distribute the interior spaces of the residential bulk on an even grander and also more practical plan, notably putting the main staircase to the left (east) of the apartment wing instead of the centre.Martin, pp. 51 and 83. The courtyard fa√ßade of the main wing, in the same classical style as its counterpart facing the Ill, is narrower. A strong emphasis is put on the verticality of the windows, by which means the impression of height is accentuated. Again, a central avant-corps is crowned with a triangular pediment bearing reliefs and in this case also statues. Both fa√ßades are richly decorated with allegorical mascarons (depicting seasons, temperaments, continents and elements), eighteen in all on the riverside fa√ßade and nine in all on the courtyard fa√ßade, to which the riverside fa√ßade adds a pair of broad wrought-iron balconies. Due to the difference in width and the trapezoidal plan, the centres of the fa√ßades are not aligned. The courtyard is divided in three sections separated by a row of arches. The left section (as seen from the cathedral) belongs to the Communs wing, which housed the servants. The right section belongs to the stables wing. Left and right of the fa√ßade are exedras decorated with busts of Roman emperors. The entrance to the palace is through the left exedra. Facing the courtyard fa√ßade is a peristyle with five arches. The central arch, the highest and widest, faces the centre of the fa√ßade and opens on the palace's main gate.Martin, pp. 58, 64, 75‚Äì76, 83, 87 and 90. The front of the palace on Place du Ch√¢teau (called Place del'√âv√™ch√© between 1740 and 1793), designed in a more Baroque style than the rest of the palace, is wide and curved. The central gate is framed by two pairs of columns and juts out in the shape of a Triumphal arch. The upper part of the front section is crowned with statues representing allegories of faith such as \\"Religion\\" and \\"Eucharist\\", and personifications of Christian virtues such as \\"Mercy\\" and \\"Penance\\". Plaster casts of some of these statues are displayed in the lapidarium inside the Barrage Vauban. The wooden portal (oak) and the walls east and west of the gate are decorated with trophies and heraldic symbols relating to the House of Rohan and the episcopal polity. The two pavilions connecting the Communs and the stable wings with the gate section are decorated with sixteen mascarons representing male and female Old Testament prophets, and with crescent-shaped pediments, in contrast to the triangular pediments of the fa√ßades. The east (left) pavilion housed the palace's kitchens while the west (right) pavilion housed the offices of the ecclesiastical court.Martin, pp. 58 and 64. = Exterior views = Strasbourg place du Ch√¢teau Palais Rohan octobre 2013 07.jpgEntrance of the palace Palais Rohan Strasbourg France Gates April 2010.JPGThe main portal Palais Rohan Strasbourg Inner Court 1 April 2010.JPGFa√ßade facing the inner courtyard Strasbourg PalaisRohan 09.JPGPediment with coat of arms of the courtyard fa√ßade Strasbourg, Rohan Palace, main courtyard; Cathedral.jpgView from the main courtyard towards the entrance and the Cathedral Stra√üburg Palais Rohan 09.jpgFa√ßade facing the river Sculpture on fa√ßade facing River Ill, Palais Rohan de Strasbourg.jpgA mascaron depicting Cybele on the riverside fa√ßade Strasbourg PalaisRohan n05.jpgDetail of a wrought iron balcony  Apartments  Gilded stucco in the Bedchamber of the King The apartments on the piano nobile today form a part of the Mus√©e des arts d√©coratifs. The chambers of the prince-bishops and cardinals of the House of Rohan are divided into the grand appartement (display space, facing the river, or south) and petit appartement (living space, facing the inner court and the cathedral, or north), as in the Palace of Versailles.Recht, Foessel, Klein, p. 71. On either side of the suites are the two most spacious rooms of the palace, the Synod Hall (a single, vast room composed of the dining hall and the guards' hall, separated by a row of arches) and the library, which both extend over the entire longitudinal axis of the wing. The library also serves as the nave of the palace's very small chapel. The grand appartement is composed of the Salle des √©v√™ques (Bishops' Hall) ‚Äì the former Antichambre du roi ‚Äì the Chambre du roi (Bedchamber of the King), the Cabinet du roi (Cabinet of the King), also known as the Salon d'assembl√©e (Assembly Room) and the Garde-robe du roi (Cloakroom of the King). The \\"petit appartement\\" is composed of the Antichambre du prince-√©v√™que, the Chambre du prince-√©v√™que, the Cabinet du prince-√©v√™que (turned into Napoleon's bedchamber after 1800) and the Garde- robe du prince-√©v√™que. The castle's garderobe (Cabinet de commodit√©s) is situated next to the cloakroom of the prince-bishop. The interiors were designed according to the decorative principles established by Jacques- Fran√ßois Blondel in his influential book De la distribution des maisons de plaisance et de la d√©coration des √©difices en g√©n√©ral (1738), and the stucco and boiseries were influenced by the style of Nicolas Pineau.Martin, p. 50.Recht, Foessel, Klein, p. 67.Martin, p. 184. Many of the original furnishings were sold in the wake of the French Revolution. Some works of art, including the overdoors from the Salle des √©v√™ques, part of the municipal collections, were destroyed with the museum situated in the Aubette when the Prussian Army shelled the city during the Siege of Strasbourg in 1870. In the 20th century and especially during the reconstruction following the bomb damage of August 1944, a great deal of effort went into locating the surviving missing objects and replacing the lost works with identical or similar pieces.Schnitzler, pp. 191‚Äì192. They were supervised by the aforementioned Hans Haug, who had become director of the newly created network of the municipal museums on 1January 1945.Schnitzler, p. 186. Some elements, though, were never restored, such as the stucco of the library. It was lost in 1817 because of leaks through the ceiling; as the only free-standing part of the building, the library has a flat roof. Among the works of art on view in the apartments, several stand out for their artistic and historic value. The set of eight (originally nine) tapestries depicting \\"The History of Constantine\\" was woven around 1624 after modellos by Rubens. It had been commissioned by Louis XIII of France, who later presented it to the Marquis of Cinq- Mars.Martin, p. 148. Three tapestries are displayed in the Chambre du roi, one in the Cabinet du roi, and four in the library. The set of eight 17th-century Italian busts of Roman emperors in the Salle des √©v√™ques belonged to the personal collection of Cardinal Mazarin. Both sets of works were bought in 1738 from the respective heirs by Armand Gaston deRohan.Martin, p. 133. Another bust of particular value is the marble portrait of Armand Gaston, sculpted in 1730‚Äì1731 in Rome by Edm√© Bouchardon. It is also displayed in the library. The floor of the chapel is partly covered with a 1745 imitation of a Turkish carpet, woven in the Aubusson manufactory and bearing in its centre the coat of arms of Armand Gaston deRohan. The carpet covering the large table in the middle of the library was woven in Portuguese India around 1730. It was given to the Cathedral chapter after 1806 and sold to the Mus√©e de Cluny in 1865 but was returned to the city of Strasbourg on permanent loan in 1939.Martin, pp. 184 and 222. On display in most of the rooms are surviving works from Louis Ren√© deRohan's vast collection of Japanese vases and Chinese pottery and lacquerware from the Ming and Qing dynasties, originally destined for the new castle in Saverne. A curio cabinet in the Garde-robe du prince- √©v√™que displays dessert tableware from the Manufacture de S√®vres, made in 1772‚Äì1774 for Louis-Ren√© deRohan's special embassy in Vienna. These items now belong to the Mus√©e des arts d√©coratifs.Martin, p. 211. A pair of large canvases with hunting dogs by Jean-Baptiste Oudry (1742), now hanging in the Salle du synode, once hung in the Parisian h√¥tel particulier of Samuel-Jacques Bernard. The three paintings in the chapel are copies of works by Antonio da Correggio: Adoration of the Shepherds, Virgin and Child with Sts Jerome and Madeleine, and The Rest on the Return from Egypt. They were made in 1724 in Modena and Parma by Robert deS√©ry (1686‚Äì1733) for Armand Gaston, whom he had met in Rome the same year.Martin, p. 187. DeS√©ry would later provide many other paintings for the cardinal's apartments, all of them copies of paintings by greater masters. Napoleon's green bed is an authentic work by Jacob- Desmalter. The red canopy bed in the King's bedchamber is a 1989 copy of a bed kept in the Ch√¢teau d'Azay-le-Rideau, thought to be very similar to the lost original.Martin, p. 221, note 93. The portraits of kings Louis XIV and Louis XV of France in the library are copies made in 1950 of originals by Hyacinthe Rigaud kept in the Palace of Versailles. These 20th-century copies are replacements for the 18th-century copies of the same paintings that were destroyed during the French Revolution at the same time as the portraits of the prince-bishops in the Bishops' Hall (see above, History).Martin, p. 222, note 126. The overdoor paintings in the antechamber of the prince-bishop are also 20th-century copies, replacing 18th-century copies of French Baroque masters such as Antoine Coypel, Charles Le Brun, and Charles de La Fosse, that were destroyed in 1944. These paintings represent biblical stories; the lost first copies were made in 1737‚Äì1740 in Versailles.Martin, p. 193. The other paintings on the walls belong to the Mus√©e des beaux-arts, including Louis XV offrant la Paix √† L'Europe (\\"Louis XV presenting Peace to Europe\\", 1737) by Fran√ßois Lemoyne, on display in the Garde-robe du prince-√©v√™que, and La d√©ification d'√ân√©e (\\"The Deification of Aeneas\\", 1749) by Jean II Restout, on display in the Chambre du prince-√©v√™que.Jacquot, p. 210. = Interior views = Palais Rohan, Strasbourg (France).jpgSynod hall Strasbourg rohan chambre roi.jpgCanopy bed in the King's bedchamber Strasbourg Palais Rohan (18).JPGChinese ceramics in the King's bedchamber Strasbourg, Palais Rohan, tapisserie dans la biblioth√®que (4).JPGTapestry from \\"The History of Constantine\\" in the library Strassburg 5917.jpgBedchamber of Napoleon in the Empire style Strassburg 5922.jpg18th-century pedal harp in the Prince- bishop's bedchamber Strassburg 5923.jpg18th-century cocklestove in the Prince-bishop's antechamber D√©tail du salon des √©v√™ques du Palais des Rohans, √† Strasbourg.jpgVases from China and a 17th-century bust of Septimius Severus from the Mazarin collection in the Bishop's hall Strasbourg, Palais Rohan, nature morte n¬∞1 de la salle du Synode.JPGPainting by Jean-Baptiste Oudry (1742) in the Synod hall Strasbourg, Palais Rohan, grand cabinet 17√®me si√®cle (2).JPG1660s cabinet from Florence, Italy in the Prince-bishop's antechamber  Museums  Entrance to the museums (seen in 2008) = Mus√©e des beaux-arts = The Mus√©e des beaux-arts (Museum of Fine Arts), on the first and second floors of the palace, is the successor of the Mus√©e de peinture et de sculpture (Museum of painting and sculpture), established in 1803 and entirely destroyed by Prussian artillery shelling and the subsequent violent fire during the night of 24‚Äì25August 1870. The new museum was opened in 1899. The collections present an overview of European art from the 13th century to 1871, with considerable weight given to Italian as well as Flemish and Dutch paintings, with artists such as Hans Memling, Correggio, Anthony van Dyck, Giotto, Pieter de Hooch, Botticelli, Jacob Jordaens, and Tintoretto, among many others. The collections of Upper Rhenish art until 1681 (Baldung, Hemmel, Stoskopff, Witz, and others) had been moved into the dedicated Mus√©e de l'≈íuvre Notre-Dame in 1931. = Mus√©e des arts d√©coratifs = The Mus√©e des arts d√©coratifs (Museum of Decorative arts) is on the ground floor. It was established in its current form in the years 1920‚Äì1924, when the collections of the Kunstgewerbe-Museum Hohenlohe, originally established in 1887, were relocated in the stables wing adjacent to the palace apartments. The collections had previously been in the Renaissance former municipal slaughterhouse Grandes Boucheries or Gro√üe Metzig, which now hosts the Mus√©e historique de Strasbourg.) The Mus√©e des arts d√©coratifs suffered in the World War II bombing raids of 1944 but the building has since been restored and the collections replenished. Besides the furniture and decoration of the cardinals' apartments, the collections focus on the local production of porcelain (Strasbourg faience), silver-gilt, and clockmaking, with original parts of the medieval Strasbourg astronomical clock including the automaton rooster from 1354. The reconstructed living room of a former h√¥tel particulier, the 1750s H√¥tel Oesinger, displays 18th-century furniture in situ on a more intimate scale than the rooms of the palace. = Mus√©e arch√©ologique = The Mus√©e arch√©ologique (Archaeological Museum) is in the basement. The former archaeological collections of the city had been entirely destroyed, along with the municipal library, during the Siege of Strasbourg in 1870. A new collection was started in 1876 on behalf of the \\"Society for the preservation of the historical monuments of Alsace\\" (, ). It was moved into the palace in 1889, first opened to the public in 1896, and moved to its present location in 1907. The museum displays finds from northern Alsace from the Paleolithic Era to the Merovingian dynasty, with a special focus on Argentoratum.

A centre, he played club rugby for Newport. He won 27 caps for Wales and was selected to play in the British Lions on two tours of Australia and New Zealand. After his rugby career Thomas became a successful business man. He died on 9 April 2012 in Burnham, Buckinghamshire. Early and club career Born in Machen in 1929, Thomas went to school at Bassaleg Grammar and was chosen for the Welsh Secondary Schools rugby and cricket teams, before attending Caerleon Training College. After qualifying from college he became an instructor-lieutenant in the Royal Navy, playing for and captaining Devonport Services before playing for the Navy XV. He joined Newport in 1946 and played against South Africa (1952), New Zealand (1954) and Australia (1957) for the club. A versatile player, Thomas found himself being moved between centre and wing and was chosen many times due to his ability as a utility back.Smith (1980), p. 324. He was also recognized as an accurate placekicker and was strong in the tackle, with a powerful hand- off.Smith (1980), p. 339. Thomas also represented Cornwall and Monmouthsire at county level, and played invitational matches for the Barbarians and Crawshays. In 1958 ha was a member of the 1958 touring Barbarian team that played in Africa, scoring a try and two conversions in the win over East Africa. He also played cricket for Cornwall in the 1951 Minor Counties Championship, making four appearances. International career Thomas made his debut against France in 1949 in an away game in the Stad de Colombe Paris which Wales lost. The selectors kept faith with Thomas and he turned out for the next four Five Nations Tournament games, which saw Wales win the Grand Slam in 1950, the first time since 1911. Thomas was also part of the Wales Grand Slam team in 1952. In 1953 he was dropped from the squad as the selectors believed his play was becoming stale and was blamed for a bad pass in the game against England. In a 1954/55 pre-season club trial he broke a leg, however he was back playing for Newport the next season and a return to club form saw his return to the Welsh side. On 19 January 1957 he was awarded the captaincy of Wales against England, and again later in the season against Scotland. =International matches played= WalesSmith (1980), p. 472. * 1950, 1951, 1952, 1953, 1956, 1957, 1959 * 1949, 1950, 1951, 1952, 1956, 1958, 1959 * 1950, 1951, 1952, 1956, 1958, 1959 * 1950, 1951, 1952, 1956, 1957. 1958 * 1951 British Lions * 1950 *New Zealand 1950, 1950, 1959 References Bibliography * Category:1929 births Category:2012 deaths Category:Barbarian F.C. players Category:British and Irish Lions rugby union players from Wales Category:Crawshays RFC players Category:London Welsh RFC players Category:Newport RFC players Category:People from Machen Category:Royal Navy officers Category:Rugby union centres Category:Wales international rugby union players Category:Wales rugby union captains Category:Welsh rugby union players Category:People educated at Bassaleg School Category:Welsh cricketers Category:Cornwall cricketers Category:Rugby union players from Newport, Wales Category:Devonport Services R.F.C. players ","title":"Malcolm Thomas (rugby union)"},{"id":"14893312","text":"The Caracal is a right tributary of the river Olt in Romania.

Dudmaston Hall is located near the village of Quatt, a few miles south of the market town of Bridgnorth, just off the A442 road. History The property is a late 17th-century country mansion and an example of a traditional Shropshire country estate, in that it comprises the main hall, the landscaped gardens, parkland, managed woodlands, lakeside, farmland and the estate cottages, for example at Quatt, a model village designed by London architect John Birch in 1870 for the workers and tenants of the estate. =Wolryche connection= The Dudmaston estate has been in the Wolryche family or the barely related Wolryche-Whitmore family since 1403, when William Wolryche of nearby Much Wenlock acquired it by marriage to the heiress of the former owners, Margaret de Dudmaston.Oliver Garnett (2005): Dudmaston, Shropshire: Warrington, The National Trust, p. 24. It is likely that the medieval house was replaced by a structure on the site of the present building in the 16th century. This is shown in a stylised way on old maps as a fortified manor house. It is likely that the main source of income was sheep raising, an important part of the late medieval economy, in which the wool trade played a central role. Unlike many of the Shropshire and Staffordshire gentry, the Wolryches accepted the Reformation and became stalwart Anglicans, but were royalists, as loyal to the House of Stuart as to their Tudor predecessors. Francis Wolryche (1563‚Äì1614) was wealthy enough to have himself and his wife, Margaret Bromley, buried under elaborate effigies in Quatt church. Their son, Sir Thomas Wolryche, 1st Baronet (1598‚Äì1668), was the first of the Wolryche baronets George Edward Cokayne Complete Baronetage, Volume 2 ‚Äì a dignity he achieved not by the usual route of purchase, but through his enthusiastic support for Charles I, who knighted him July 1641 and raised him to the baronetcy a few weeks later. On the outbreak of the English Civil War, he raised troops for the king and was appointed governor of Bridgnorth Castle. When Parliamentary forces arrived at Bridgnorth in 1646, Wolryche's garrison set fire to the town, which was largely destroyed,Commemorated by an inscription at the North Gate Museum: see below. before retreating into the castle, only to surrender shortly afterwards. Sir Thomas Wolryche was fined ¬£730 14s by Parliament and was one of the few royalists not to recover his money at the Restoration in 1660.Garnett (2005), pp. 24‚Äì25. =Construction of the present Hall= Sir Thomas's eldest son, Francis (1627‚Äì89), the second baronet, was declared a lunatic. It was his fifth son, John Wolryche, who took over the estate in 1668. He began building a new house at Quatt, now the dower house, but died in 1685, before work was finished.Garnett (2005), p. 25. John's son, Sir Thomas Wolryche (1672‚Äì1701) inherited his uncle's baronetcy and his father's determination to rebuild. However, he embarked on a much more ambitious project, replacing the old manor house with a new sandstone building, the core of the present Dudmaston Hall. The architect appears to have been Francis Smith of Warwick, who provided a substantial, well-built, but not grand residence. Modelled on Belton House in Lincolnshire, it has an H-plan lay-out, a large central entrance hall, backed by a saloon, and flanked by three-roomed wings. Construction probably began before 1700, but Thomas died in 1701 before it was complete.Garnett (2005), p. 26. Management of the estate passed to Sir Thomas's widow, Elizabeth Weld. However, their son, Sir John Wolryche (1691‚Äì1723), the fourth baronet, came to maturity in 1712 and took over the reins. For a decade he spent heavily on gambling, horses and hunting. In 1723, attempting to ford the Severn after attending races at Chelmarsh, directly opposite Dudmaston, he drowned, leaving no male heir. The estate was burdened by heavy debts and was passed to Sir John's sister, Mary, only on payment of ¬£14,000. She, her mother Elizabeth, and her uncle, Colonel Thomas Weld, resided at Dudmaston, and over the next half century, largely restored it to a sound financial footing by frugal management.

When he died in 1774, it passed to a distant cousin, George Whitmore, who died shortly afterwards, passing it to his nephew, William Whitmore (1745‚Äì1815). He was a seaman from Southampton who had also inherited a number of other large properties, giving him the resources to restore and reshape Dudmaston. He spent large sums on repairs and on refurnishing the hall.Garnett (2005), pp. 27‚Äì28. Whitmore also commissioned the gardener and landscape designer William Emes to produce a scheme for the grounds. Emes came up with a formal plan but it was never executed. Instead, Whitmore left his wife, Frances Lister, and his own gardener, Walter Wood, to develop the grounds. Wood had previously worked on a Picturesque-style garden for the poet William Shenstone at The Leasowes, near Halesowen, then also part of the county of Shropshire. Carefully controlling the Quatt Brook, a small tributary of the Severn to the south of the hall, he now reshaped its course through the Dingle, a small, wooded valley, which was itself artfully quarried and sculpted. His small cliffs, waterfalls and rustic bridges created a framework for the winding paths and seating areas, laid out by Frances.Garnett (2005), p. 18. It is unclear which Dingle came first, but it is likely there were cross-influences with that at Badger, Shropshire, where Emes certainly was involved in the design,Victoria County History: Shropshire, volume 10, Badger, s.1. and where the squire, Isaac Hawkins Browne was an associate of Whitmore. (Browne was soon to take a seat in the House of Commons for Dudmaston's pocket borough of Bridgnorth.) Whitmore's son, also William, added the old family name of Wolryche to his own. A man of enormous energy, he not only had an active career as a reforming M.P., but also greatly modified the house and grounds. In the hall his improvements include a fine Regency staircase, new windows, and a large new dining room ‚Äì now the modern art gallery.Garnett (2005), pp. 28‚Äì29. He also completely reshaped the landscape to the west, which forms the main view from the hall. The Big Pool was formed by combining three small lakes and terraces constructed, with small flights of steps and walls. To the south he broke the formality with the American Border, an area that was then planted mainly with rhododendrons but today contains a wide range of Asian and American plants.Garnett (2005), p. 20. Features and amenities The hall contains an outstanding art collection, described by the National Trust as \\"one of Britain's most important public collections of modern art\\",National Trust  Dudmaston  What to see & do including sculptures by Henry Moore and Barbara Hepworth plus an extensive collection of mid-20th- century Spanish paintings and pottery, collected by former resident Sir George Labouchere during his diplomatic service.Dudmaston Hall Other than that, many activities go on around the estate ‚Äì pig-farming, asparagus-growing. Dudmaston also features in its very own traditional way of \\"tushing\\" using a horse to pull logs in the woods where a tractor can not reach. This is done with a Fell Pony, which were originally used as pack ponies for carrying lead from the mines. Notable residents =William Wolryche-Whitmore= William Wolryche- Whitmore's epitaph in St. Andrew's church, Quatt William Wolryche-Whitmore (1787‚Äì1858) was an important reforming politician. He was the son of William Whitmore, who inherited Dudmaston from a distant cousin, the last of the Wolryche Baronets, and Frances Lister. In 1810 he married Lady Lucy Bridgeman, daughter of the Earl of Bradford. The young couple set out on a Grand Tour, which included a visit to Napoleon Bonaparte, exiled on Elba. On the death of his father in 1815, William inherited Dudmaston and five years later he took up the family's parliamentary seat of Bridgnorth. William quickly became a major spokesman for the liberal causes of Parliamentary Reform and Catholic Emancipation. He spoke against the power of the West Indian sugar planters and looked forward to the ending of Caribbean slavery.Hansard 1828 He warned of the disastrous consequences for the Indian economy of British colonialism.Hansard 1823 After the Reform Act of 1832, he won the new parliamentary seat of Wolverhampton for the Whigs after a bitterly contested campaign. One of his major concerns was providing new opportunities for working-class people through emigration, and he strongly opposed the use of convict and slave labour everywhere. His last contribution in parliament was on the subject of emigration to South Australia.Hansard 1834. Despite the fact that it could be considered against the interest of himself and his class, he campaigned long and hard for repeal of the Corn Laws. The great majority of his contributions in parliament were on this subject.Hansard: Mr Wolryche- Whitmore Links to all Wolryche-Whitmore's recorded interventions. He continued to campaign even after he left parliament. His successor in the Wolverhampton seat was Charles Pelham Villiers, another radical Whig who continued his anti- Corn Law work. The repeal was not achieved until 1846, when the Tory leader, Robert Peel, split his party to force the measure through with Whig support. While continuing his political campaigns, William remodelled the house and the estate on more modern lines, diversifying the economic activities and improving conditions for his workers and tenants. This was at great cost, however, and he left mortgages totalling ¬£60,000 to his nephew, Francis Laing, who inherited the estate on his death. =Charles Babbage= In 1814, Georgiana Whitmore, a daughter of William Whitmore and sister of the budding politician, married computing pioneer Charles Babbage. Babbage lived at Dudmaston Hall for significant periods and even engineered the central heating system.Visit Dudmaston Hall- Enjoy England Their son Henry Prevost Babbage's 1910 Analytical Engine Mill was on display at Dudmaston Hall until the 1980s, after which it was moved to the Science Museum in London. =George and Rachel Labouchere= Eternity Gates by Antony Robinson, installed in 1983 to celebrate the ruby wedding anniversary of Sir George and Lady Rachel Labouchere Rachel Hamilton-Russell (1908‚Äì1996) was the daughter of Olive, who was herself the daughter of Francis Wolryche-Whitmore and Alice Darby of Coalbrookdale. She was bequeathed the estate by her uncle, Geoffrey, on condition that it should pass to the National Trust. Rachel had trained as a botanical artist at the Flatford Field Studies Centre and established an important collection of paintings and drawings of plants at Dudmaston. She met George Labouch√®re (1905‚Äì1999), a diplomat and scion of a Huguenot family, while working at the Admiralty during World War II in 1942 and was to marry him the following year. They agreed that she would accompany him to his diplomatic postings and that he would then retire to Dudmaston with her. George's next posting was to Stockholm, and Rachel had to fly over the North Sea to marry him there, forced to turn back once when the cloud cleared and left the aeroplane exposed to German attack.Obituary of George Labouchere in the Independent Subsequent postings were in China, from 1946 to 1948, and then in Argentina, Austria, Hungary and Belgium. George was knighted in 1955 and appointed ambassador to Francoist Spain in 1960. It was there that the Lachoucheres acquired an important group of artworks, produced by artists of the left-wing opposition to the regime ‚Äì a significant component of the collection they would install at Dudmaston. Uncle Geoffrey moved out in 1966, allowing Rachel and George to retire to Dudmaston. The process of transferring it to the National Trust was completed in 1978, although they continued to reside in the house and to improve both it and the grounds. They established a sizeable collection of modern art, alongside a collection of material inherited from the Wolryche-Whitmores and the Darbys. Following a strong interest in the economic and social history of the region, Rachel campaigned for the preservation and enhancement of the industrial heritage of the Severn Valley. She served for fourteen years as president of the Ironbridge Gorge Museum Trust, which was established in 1967. Almost until her death she was active at Dudmaston, frequently engaging visitors in discussion. The couple had no children and Rachel died in 1996. George outlived her by three years. Rachel Labouchere left a memorandum of wishes with the National Trust stipulating that a tenancy would always be available to her relatives, to keep Dudmaston a family home, as it had been for over 850 years. She nominated her second cousin, Col. James Hamilton-Russell, whose descendants still live there today.

He played five seasons of Major League Baseball as an outfielder for the New York Yankees, St. Louis Browns and Detroit Tigers. Professional career Mapes, who was listed with a height of , and a weight of , was originally signed as an amateur free agent by the Cleveland Indians prior to the season. He never played for the Indians, and was later drafted by the New York Yankees in the 1946 Rule 5 draft. After a season in the minors, Mapes was recalled to the Major League level, where he saw limited time as a backup to an outfield that contained Joe DiMaggio, Tommy Henrich, and Johnny Lindell. Mapes hit .250, with 12 runs batted in, and his first career home run. In his second season, Mapes saw regular time as a starter. He hit .247 with seven home runs and 38 runs batted in, but also led the team in strikeouts in helping the Yankees claim the American League pennant. He was the team's starting right fielder against the Brooklyn Dodgers, and he helped the team win the 1949 World Series, the team's first World Series en route to five consecutive world championships. In , Mapes led the team in strikeouts for the second consecutive season. His playing time remained the same, but his power numbers improved from a year earlier. Mapes hit batted .247 with 12 home runs and 61 runs batted in, but also grounded into a team-high 14 double plays. The Yankees finished the season with the American League pennant once again, but Mapes saw little time in the postseason; Mapes only appeared in one game as the Yankees won the 1950 World Series in a four-game sweep of the Philadelphia Phillies. As Mapes' numbers started to decrease in , including a batting average which fell to .216, the Yankees decided to cut ties with him. He was purchased by the St. Louis Browns on July 31, 1951. After a moderate season with the Browns, he was traded with Matt Batts, Dick Littlefield, and Ben Taylor to the Detroit Tigers for Gene Bearden, Bob Cain, and Dick Kryhoski. In , for the Tigers, Mapes hit a career-low .197, and was traded back to the Browns, with Neil Berry and cash, for Jake Crawford. However, instead of choosing to play for the team that had traded him a year earlier, Mapes decided to end his professional baseball career. He played his final game on September 28, 1952. Mapes wore number 3 for the Yankees until that number was retired in honor of Babe Ruth. Mapes then wore number 13 before switching to number 7. When Mapes was traded by the Yankees in 1951, Mickey Mantle took uniform number 7. Mapes, thus, is mainly remembered as the Yankee who wore both Babe Ruth's and Mickey Mantle's numbers. On December 5, 1996, Mapes died in Pryor, Oklahoma, at the age of 74.

History The Sanada clan claimed descent from the Seiwa Genji. Historically, the clan's banner was established by Unno Yukiyoshi in the early 16th century. He emblazoned the Rokumonsen on his banner. The Sanada were key vassals in the Takeda army, with three famous generals being Sanada Yukitaka and his sons Sanada Nobutsuna, Sanada Masateru, and Sanada Masayuki. Sanada Yukitaka, son of Unno Munetsuna, established the clan and its name at the beginning of the 16th century. Sanada Yukitaka Sanada MasayukiIn the Sengoku period, Sanada Masayuki (1547-1611) led the clan. His second son Sanada Yukimura (1567-1615) was sent as a hostage to the Toyotomi clan in 1587. In 1594, he married Chikurin-in, an adopted daughter of Toyotomi Hideyoshi; therefore, he was officially Hideyoshi's son-in-law.Nussbaum, Louis-Fr√©d√©ric. (2005). \\"Sanada Nobushige\\" in Japan Encyclopedia, p. 816. In 1600, at the Battle of Sekigahara, Yukimura sided with the Western army. He fought against Tokugawa Hidetada at Ueda Castle, successfully delaying him from reaching Sekigahara with 38,000 reinforcements. He opposed the Tokugawa again at the Battle of Osaka where he died. =Edo era= Sanada Nobuyuki (1566-1658) was the oldest son of Masayuki. In 1587 he married Komatsuhime, an adopted daughter of Tokugawa Ieyasu. Therefore he was officially Ieyasu's son-in-law. In 1600, he sided with the Eastern army. He was given control of Ueda Domain in Shinano Province and Numata Domain in K≈çzuke Province with revenues of 65,000 koku. In 1622, Nobuyuki was transferred to Matsushiro Domain (100,000 koku) in Shinano. His descendants remained there until the Meiji Restoration in 1868. Sanada clan forces took part in the attack on Aizu in 1868, on the side of the imperial army. They were slated to take charge of Aizu prisoners of war, but refused. =Modern era= In 1871, the former daimy≈ç was made a count in the kazoku peerage system. The head of a cadet branch of the clan was given the title of baron. The Meiji-era ornithologist Yukiyasu Kiyosu was the son of Sanada Yukitami, the last lord of Matsushiro.

The island and its lighthouse are run by the private, non-profit Rose Island Lighthouse Foundation. History The Native American name for Rose Island was \\"Conockonoquit\\". Fortifications were constructed during the American Revolution on the island. In 1798, the U.S. government began constructing Fort Hamilton on Rose Island, but never completed the fort. Units of the U.S. Infantry were stationed there. The stone barracks from the fort still remain. The U.S. Navy used Rose Island to store explosives during World Wars I and II as part of the Naval Torpedo Station. The government stopped using the island after World War II (except for the lighthouse) and declared it government surplus. The abandoned fort was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2001 as Fort Hamilton Historic District. Lighthouse Built in 1870, the Rose Island Light served as an aid to navigation for a century, and was deactivated in 1970 after the Newport Bridge was built. In 1984, a group of citizens started the Newport Lighthouse Foundation to preserve the light. As of 2008, it has been restored to its Victorian appearance.

During Emperor Gaozong's reign and Emperor Ruizong's first reign  By Emperor Gaozong's Yifeng era (676-679), Ge had become Zhongshu Sheren (‰∏≠Êõ∏Ëàç‰∫∫), a mid-level official at the legislative bureau of government (‰∏≠Êõ∏ÁúÅ, Zhongshu Sheng). When his mother died, he was recalled to the imperial administration after observing a brief mourning period, but throughout the next four years, whenever he went home, he would change into mourning clothes and live in a small hut. During the Chuigong era of Emperor Gaozong's son Emperor Ruizong, he served as the director of palace affairs and was created the Viscount of Bohai.  During Wu Zetian's reign  In 690, Emperor Ruizong's mother Empress Dowager Wu took the throne herself as \\"emperor,\\" establishing Zhou Dynasty and interrupting Tang Dynasty. She made Ouyang Tong the minister of defense (Â§èÂÆòÂ∞öÊõ∏, Xiaguan Shangshu). In 691, he was made minister of rites (Âè∏Á¶ÆÂçø, Siling Qing) and acting Nayan (Á¥çË®Ä), the head of the examination bureau of government (È≥≥Èñ£, Fengge) and a post considered one for a chancellor. However, about a month later, Ouyang became engulfed in a controversy and offended Wu Zetian. At that time, there was a movement led by one Wang Qingzhi (ÁéãÊÖ∂‰πã) to have Wu Zetian's nephew Wu Chengsi created crown prince, displacing her son Li Dan (the former Emperor Ruizong). Ouyang's senior colleague Cen Changqian strenuously opposed and wanted that Wang's group of petitioners be disbanded. Ouyang supported Cen. As a result, Wu Zetian had him, Cen, and another chancellor Ge Fuyuan arrested and interrogated by her secret police official Lai Junchen. Lai tortured Ouyang severely, but Ouyang refused to confess to treason, so Lai forged a confession in his name. Soon, Ouyang, Cen, and Ge were executed. After Wu Zetian was overthrown in a coup in 705 and her son Li Xian, himself a former emperor, was restored to the throne (as Emperor Zhongzong), Ouyang's titles were posthumously restored.

Early life Hezekiah Orville Gardner was born around 1825 at New York, being a brother to four other sluggers. He was the older brother of Howell \\"Horrible\\" Gardner, a notorious pugilist turned evangelist himself. Orville \\"the Awful\\" Gardner was described as being over six feet tall, and having a powerful build, even in advanced age. Fighting career He used the name Orville \\"the Awful\\" Gardner, becoming one of the best fighting men in New York along with the famous John \\"Old Smoke\\" Morrissey and the infamous William \\"Bill the Butcher\\" Poole. The name 'Awful Gardner' brought fear into all fighting men in the country during the 19th century. Gardner became known as the celebrated prizefighter of Newark City and was known as a street fighter. Gardner killed a man and was forced to leave Newark for New York City where he became an emigrant runner. Gardner earned fame as a pugilist after going 33 rounds with Allen McFee in 1847, resulting in a victory for Gardner. Gardner was involved in several affrays all over the country and he became a distinguished boxing trainer of such champions as John Morrissey, Tom Hyer, and Joe Coburn. Gardner was a friend of Morrissey and trained him to become the Heavyweight Champion. Gardner is often noted for holding Yankee Sullivan's arms back while letting his boxer (Morrissey) get in some hits. Gardner was never known to be in a gang but was a Bowery thug, possibly being one of Morrissey's allies rather than one of his gang members (Gardner being older and trainer to Morrissey, as well as Gardner being a friend of Bill Poole). Newspapers reported in 1856 that Gardner would most likely defeat Dominick Bradley for the Heavyweight Championship of America. Gaining a notorious reputation Gardner had earned notoriety as a boxer but became notorious as one of New York's bad characters. The name 'Awful Gardner' began to fit him from all of his sinful ways of drinking and gambling, as well as his 'awful' ways of brutality in and out of the ring. He also was an emigrant runner. Gardner was always in the newspapers usually for barroom brawls. He beat several men in a brawl in 1852 at the Oyster Saloon, escaping the police. The New York Times called him 'Mr. Awful Gardner' after having bit another pugilist's nose or ear off after an argument in 1853 (later setting up a prize fight with the other boxer). Gardner fled to Canada after being charged with assault but returned in 1854 after his son drowned. Gardner spent time in jail and in 1855 he was convicted of assault and battery in another case. He was sentenced to six months in the Sing Sing Prison, being released in 1856, but he would return. Reform and Christianity After his release he gave up drinking and tried to reform thinking he would never see his son again if he continued his sinful ways. He attended the Revival of 1857 at New York City and found God, converted his brother Howell, and the New York Times noted his transformation. He no longer went by the nickname \\"Awful Gardner\\" and he became a preacher whom many came to see. Gardner gave interviews and converted many. Jerry McAuley noted that Gardner, whom he had known as desperado, had given a powerful sermon at the Sing Sing Prison which converted many convicts, including McAuley. Gardner then began one of the first AA meetings, which was called the \\"Coffee and Reading Room\\". Gardner was in and out of newspapers across the country. He was mistakenly thought to have been killed in 1883, but it was his brother Howell Gardner, who died from burns received in an explosion. Orville had become ill in the late 1870s, living in the Home of the Aged and Infirm as an inmate. Gardner soon made headlines in 1889 when he was sent to an Insane Asylum. He most likely died of his illness.

It is located on Wenlock Edge south west of Much Wenlock in Shropshire, England. The manor is a Grade I listed building and since 1937 has been used as a youth hostel.  History and amenities  Wilderhope Manor from the rear Wilderhope Manor is an Elizabethan-period manor house, built of local limestone and dating from 1585. The house was built for Francis Smallman and his initials can be seen on the ceilings. The manor remained in the family until 1734 when the estate including the neighbouring Wilderhope farm was sold to Thomas Lutwyche. It is believed that the manor house was not used as a main residence after the sale in 1734 and by 1936 was in a poor state and unoccupied. In 1936 the property was purchased by the W. A. Cadbury Trust who donated it to the National Trust on condition that it was used as youth hostel. Opening as a youth hostel in 1937, it has remained in use by the Youth Hostels Association since. A ¬£500,000 refurbishment was completed in 2012 and the youth hostel offers 72 beds including a bridal suite with a four-poster bed. Despite years of disuse many of the original features such as the oaken stairways, oak spiral stairs and ornate plaster ceilings survived. The adjoining stable block is itself a Grade II listed building. The manor house is in limestone with dressings in gritstone, quoins, hood moulds, copings and finials on the front, and a stone-slate roof. There are two storeys and attics, and an approximately H-shaped plan. The entrance front has six bays and four unequal gables, three of them over projecting bays. In the left projecting gable is a porch, the windows are mullioned and transomed, and at the rear is a semicircular stair turret with a conical roof. The stables, now used for other purposes, are in brick with a storey band, and have tile roofs with parapeted gables. They have a single storey and lofts, and a U-shaped plan with a main range of three bays. The windows are casements with segmental arches, and there are doorways and loft openings. The surrounding manor of Wilderhope is also managed by the National Trust and comprises wooded valleys, pasture, flower-rich meadows and ancient hedgerows dating back centuries along unchanged field boundaries. Evidence of medieval ridge and furrow ploughing can still be seen in fields below Wilderhope Coppice.  Major's Leap  The Manor's owner during the English Civil War was Major Thomas Smallman. He was a Royalist who was forced to flee from Cromwell‚Äôs approaching troops. After managing to escape on horseback, Major Smallman took a do-or-die plunge down a steep slope at Wenlock Edge. His horse was killed but Smallman survived thanks to an apple tree breaking his fall. Since then the ghosts of Smallman and his horse are said to appear in an area now known as Major‚Äôs Leap and have been said to have been seen at the manor.

Overview  HRSA is the lead federal agency responsible for monitoring and improving historically scarce health care services for 60 million people living in rural areas. In financial year 2008, HRSA invested $175 million to improve health care in rural America, where access to medical services is often limited. ORHP is the lead office for coordinating and carrying out these grant activities, which help fund Critical Access Hospitals and other rural hospitals, community health centers, rural health clinics, and other rural providers of health care. In addition, the office serves as a \\"policy voice\\" within HHS to make sure regulatory actions take into account the special conditions faced by rural health care providers. The Director of ORHP is currently Tom Morris, who took over for Marcia Brand in 2008.  History  Congress created the ORHP in 1987 and charged HRSA with advising the HHS Secretary on health care matters affecting rural hospitals, coordinating activities that related to rural health care, and maintaining a national information clearinghouse for state governments, federal policymakers, and providers. Congress was concerned that the proceeding decades had seen many rural hospitals close and that there was a lack of coordination within the Federal Government for rural health activities. Assisting states HRSA funds state-run Offices of Rural Health in each of the 50 states to collect and disseminate health-related information about rural areas, provide technical assistance to rural providers and hospitals, and work with communities to recruit and retain health providers. In addition, ORHP provides technical assistance and funding to state rural health associations through a partnership with the National Rural Health Association.  Rural grant programs  Through the Outreach and Network Development grant programs, HRSA funds improve the delivery of rural health care by encouraging greater collaboration and the creation of networks among local health care providers. Agency funds also strengthen \\"Critical Access Hospitals,\\" small rural institutions that serve as key access points for Medicare beneficiaries. Other grants help rural hospitals and clinics acquire computer file-sharing systems and telemedicine equipment, which allows physician-to-physician and doctor-patient consultations over great distances. HRSA also administers the Black Lung Clinic program, which provides treatment and rehabilitation for people who have occupation-related respiratory and pulmonary disease, and the Radiation Exposure Screening and Education Program, whose grantees educate, screen and refer for treatment people who were harmed by above-ground nuclear tests in the Southwest in the mid-20th century or by the mining, milling or transport of uranium.  Conducting research  HRSA supports rural health research centers to conduct short and long-term studies on rural health issues. The centers study critical trends facing rural communities in their quest to secure adequate, affordable, high-quality health services for their residents. The centers' research findings inform a wide audience of national, state and local decision-makers concerned with rural health.  Technical assistance  HRSA offers technical assistance to more than 4,000 rural health clinics. Through quarterly conference calls, HRSA helps these small ambulatory clinics react to regulatory and market changes in health care. The agency also supports the Rural Recruitment and Retention Network, which helps locate qualified health care professionals to work in rural communities.  Rural Health Information Hub  HRSA oversees services provided by the University of North Dakota's Rural Health Information Hub ‚Äì formerly the Rural Assistance Center. RHIhub serves as an \\"information portal\\" to help rural communities and other rural stakeholders access the full range of available health care programs, funding and research.  Regional commissions  HRSA works with the Appalachian Regional Commission, the Delta Regional Authority, the Denali Commission, and the U.S.-Mexico Border Health Commission to improve service delivery and reduce health disparities. Two programs, the Delta States Rural Development Network Grant Program and the Delta Rural Hospital Improvement Project, target resources to improve health care in the Mississippi Delta.  Border health  ORHP manages HRSA's Border Health Activities. Much of the U.S.-Mexico border is rural, and the few urban areas located on the border often face challenges similar to those affecting rural communities, such as ensuring an adequate workforce, infrastructure development and improving poor health outcomes. Lessons learned on the U.S.-Mexico border may provide insight to communities everywhere that seek to improve services amid changing demographics and forecasts of long-term health workforce shortages nationwide. Activities as part of this initiative have included expanding Community Health Centers sites to additional communities (there are now 31 in the border region), funding a technical assistance website on border health issues on the Rural Assistance Center website, and providing support funding for the National Rural Health Association's Border Health Initiative that is working to find policy challenges to provide care along the border.

Tipping, 6 U.S. (2 Cranch) 406 (1805), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that a citation must accompany a writ of error in order for the court to hear the case.  Background  In the older common law procedure, a writ of error was a writ issued by an appellate court directing a lower court to deliver the record in the case for review. It was the most common form of remedial process available to the losing party after the final determination of the case on its merits.Black's Law Dictionary (8th ed., 2004). Similarly in the older common law context, a citation was a court- issued writ commanding a person to appear at a certain time and place in order to do something demanded in the writ, or to show cause for not doing something demanded. At which was whether the courts of the United States have jurisdiction to hear a case in which one alien sues another alien. The Circuit Court for the District of Kentucky held that the courts did not have jurisdiction in a case where the parties were both aliens. There was a writ of error to the Supreme Court.  Opinion of the Court  Where the writ of error lacks a citation, the writ of error must be dismissed. But see Mason v.

It is off the N78 road, about 3 kilometres east from Castlecomer.  Geography  The area around Aughamucky is of great interest and, as a result of the abundance of peat and coal, also has a wide diversity of unique flora and fauna. The roads in Aughamucky are the Yellow road, leading to Castlecomer, the Dairy Road leading to Smithstown, the Bog Road leading to Monegore Bog (where locals dug for peat as a supplementary source of fuel), and the Rock Lane which leads to the river (known locally as The Tunnel) and the Rock coal mine. The crossroads where all these roads meet is today known as Ryan's Cross. This is named after a mining family of Ryans who worked in the pits for hundreds of years. In past times, it was common for timber boards to be laid on the road at the crossroads so that the people could meet on summer evenings to dance on the boards.  History  In 1637, about 120 square kilometres (30,000 acres) including Aughamucky were granted to Sir Christopher Wandesford by his cousin, Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford, the King's Lord Deputy of Ireland. Wandesforde laid out the town of Castlecomer. This became Ireland's first town built in stone and mortar. The Wandesford family started the coal mine there. In 1640 the first seam was opened. The coal mines, which supplied anthracite coal, were known as the Deerpark Mines (the largest), The Vera (named after Vera Wandesforde) and The Rock near Glenmullen in Aughamucky. In 1875 it was estimated that the seam had produced as much as 15 million tons of coal ‚Äì a large amount for such a small seam. Despite this physical achievement on behalf of the miners, their standard of living did not improve over the centuries. Until the 1950s, water was carried by hand from the local wells. Buckets of water were carried a few miles by the local children for washing and drinking purposes. One of these wells was known as \\"Crennans well\\" which produced a high quality of drinking water. The miners small three roomed cottages which could be homes to ten plus people were thatched with rushes or reeds from the local area, sanitation did not exist, transport to mass, shopping and visiting was either by foot or by horse/donkey or \\"jennit\\" and cart.  Culture  Many of the residents are descendants of the coal miners who worked in the mines for the Wandesford family over a period of 300 years. It is close to the Monegore peat bog, which over the centuries provided the local community with peat as fuel for heating and cooking. In the 1901 Census the population of the Aughamucky area was shown as 126. Of the 24 families who are shown, the head of families of the Ryans, Currys and the Coogans were shown as working in the mines. Ten family heads were recorded as farmers. The remaining family heads were classified as labourers working presumably on the farms. The majority of the farmers were shown as members of the Church of Ireland.

Lovett was chosen on the recommendation of Woodrow Wilson, then president of Princeton, and was invited to become Rice's first president in 1907. He accepted and was inaugurated in 1908. Following his inauguration, Lovett was deeply involved in the planning of the university. He oversaw the acquisition of a new site for the campus, the initial architectural planning, the development of the curriculum, and the recruitment of faculty and students.

The Indians demanded unrestricted hunting grounds and reparation for the Chivington massacre of Black Kettle's band. Treaties made here gave the Indians reservations south of the Arkansas, excluded them north to the Platte and proclaimed peace. Several white captives were released, among them a woman and four children from Texas, the Box family, taken by a war party under Satanta. The aftermath This is one of the shortest treaties in history. None of its major provisions were ever implemented. Both sides charged violations and warfare continued until the Medicine Lodge treaties of 1867. There is a monument one mile west of the Little Arkansas River, on the Council Grounds, in Kansas, commemorating the Treaty. References *Cozzens, Peter, ed. (2003).

(1977) The Fur Trade in Canada: An Introduction to Canadian Economic History. Revised and reprinted. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, pp.386-392. Introduction Harold Innis begins The Fur Trade in Canada with a brief chapter on the beaver which became a much desired fur due to the popularity of the beaver hat in European society.Innis (Fur Trade) p. 13 He remarks that it is impossible to understand the developments of the fur trade, or of Canadian history, without some knowledge of the beaver's life and habits.Innis (Fur Trade) p.3. Biographer John Watson notes that Innis was following an analytical approach he had learned during his post-graduate work at the University of Chicago. In such case studies, Innis had been taught it was necessary to understand the nature of a commodity or staple product and to adopt a comprehensive view of it by studying its geography.Watson, Alexander, John. (2006). Marginal Man: The Dark Vision of Harold Innis. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, p.147. Since First Nations cultures and ways of life are intrinsically tied to landscape, it was their techniques of hunting and preparation, coupled with geography that essentially determined the development of the fur trade Innis (Fur Trade) p. 14 In the case of the beaver the techniques for creating the best quality of beaver pelt hats included the age of the animal and what time of year the beaver was killed. Thus, Innis notes that the most valuable beaver fur was to be found north of the St. Lawrence River especially in the deciduous forests of the Pre-Cambrian Shield with its abundance of waterways. He suggests that beaver fur could be carried long distances because the pelt of the average adult weighed less than two pounds. The animal itself was a good source of food. Innis points out that the beaver \\"migrates very little and travels over land very slowly.\\" Although beavers reproduce prolifically, it takes them more than two years to mature. These biological characteristics made their destruction in great numbers inevitable, especially after Indian hunters acquired European axes that could chop through beaver lodges and dams. European guns, knives and spears also made the sedentary beaver easy prey.Innis, (Fur Trade) pp. 3-6. Innis concludes his introduction by noting that as beaver populations were destroyed in eastern areas, traders were forced to push north and west in search of new sources of supply. \\"The problem of the fur trade,\\" he writes, \\"became one of organizing the transport of supplies and furs over increasingly greater distances. In this movement, the waterways of the beaver areas were of primary importance and occupied a vital position in the economic development of northern North America.\\"Innis, (Fur Trade) p.6. Fur trade history Harold Innis meticulously traces the fur trade over more than four centuries, from the early 16th century to the 1920s. It is a story filled with military conflict between French and English imperial forces and among warring Indian tribes. It is also a tale of shrewd barter and commercial rivalry. Yet Innis, the economic historian, tells the story in 400 pages of dry, Euro-centric and dense prose packed with statistics.Vancouver Public Library. Great Canadian Books of the Century. Vancouver: Douglas & McIntyre, p.40. The authors note that \\"Innis was not the most elegant of writers‚Äîhis prose is often swamped with unnecessary detail.\\" Rupert's Land, the territory controlled by the Hudson's Bay Company under its Royal Charter of 1670. The company eventually ruled an area stretching from Labrador to the Pacific. Innis begins by chronicling the first contacts between European fishing fleets and eastern native tribes in the early 16th century.Innis, (Fur Trade) pp.9-12. After the founding of the French settlement at Quebec in 1608 by Samuel de Champlain, the colony known as New France depended on furs for its economic survival. Champlain joined forces with the Huron Confederacy and its tribal allies against the Iroquois Confederacy in the long struggle to control the fur trade.Moore, Christopher. (1987) \\"Colonization and Conflict: New France and its Rivals 1600-1760.\\" In The Illustrated History of Canada, edited by Craig Brown. Toronto: Lester & Orpen Dennys Ltd., pp.107-115. As New France grew, French colonists, first known as coureurs de bois and later voyageurs, travelled north and west from Montreal in search of new supplies while their British rivals set up northern trading posts run by the Hudson's Bay Company. The commercial rivalry continued after the British Conquest of New France in 1759, with the establishment of the North West Company by a group of bilingual Scottish Gaelic/English-speaking Montreal merchants who had come to British North America from the Scottish Highlands in the wake of the defeat of the Jacobites at the Battle of Culloden and the incipient beginnings of the Highland Clearances. The two companies built trading posts far west of Lake Superior and Hudson Bay, but the Nor'Westers were more aggressive as they travelled north to the Arctic Ocean via the Mackenzie River and west to the Pacific. The fierce competition ended in 1821 with the amalgamation of the companies into a Hudson's Bay Company monopoly. The Company finally surrendered its northwestern empire when it sold its land to Canada in 1869 following the decrease in profits and demand for furs.Innis, (Fur Trade) pp.43-338. Innis rounds out the story by documenting the decline of the fur trade monopoly as silk hats and fancier fox fur displaced beaver. The coming of steam boats to the West and the building of railways brought increasing competition from independent traders and new companies from the American West as well as firms from Winnipeg, Edmonton and Vancouver. Improved transportation also brought increased control of the trade and cheaper goods. Increased control led to more inspections, better accounting, conservative policies, decreased aggression, and expansion of districts. Problems that arose included the difficulty in monitoring large districts and policies that were sometimes too rigid. The increase in agriculture also brought competition through decreased reliance on game for food.Innis (Fur Trade) P. 320-365 Innis ends by noting that in 1927 the Hudson's Bay Company announced it had invested in two fox farms in Prince Edward Island making the outlook for the trade in wild fur increasingly uncertain. \\"The time would appear to have arrived,\\" Innis writes, \\"for a competent survey of the problems of the trade looking to the conservation of one of Canada's important natural resources.\\"Innis, (Fur Trade) pp.341-379. The quotation appears on p.379. Indeed, in the end there was an abundance of goods and a lack of furs, suggesting the trade was no longer a major part of the economy.Innis (Fur Trade) p. 373-4 Furs, culture and technology Innis's account of the fur trade as \\"the history of contact between two civilizations, the European and the North American,\\" focuses on the radical effects of new techniques and technologies.Innis, pp. 388‚Äì389. The trade became important in the late 16th century when the beaver hat, a new style of waterproof headgear, became popular among well-dressed European gentlemen.Innis, (Fur Trade) p. 12. Innis stresses however, that the trade was propelled by native people's intense demand for European manufactured goods: A beaver felt hat > The importance of iron to a culture dependent on bone, wood, bark and stone > can only be suggested. The cumbersome method of cooking in wooden vessels > with heated stones was displaced by portable kettles. Work could be carried > out with greater effectiveness with iron axes and hatchets, and sewing > became much less difficult with awls than it had been with bone needles. To > the Indians, iron and iron manufactures were of prime importance. The French > were the gens du fer.Innis, (Fur Trade) p. 18. Muskets, knives and metal spears also made hunting easier and more efficient, but Innis points out that the convenience of European manufactured goods came at a high price. The native peoples became dependent on European traders for fresh supplies, ammunition and spare parts. More efficient hunting with guns led to the extermination of the beaver and the need to push into new hunting territories in search of more furs. This competition led to outbreaks of fighting. \\"Wars between tribes which with bows and arrows had not been strenuous,\\" Innis writes, \\"conducted with guns were disastrous.\\"Innis, (Fur Trade) p. 20. Everything was made worse because native peoples had no immunity to European diseases such as smallpox which continually ravaged their communities, decimating whole populations.Innis, (Fur Trade) p. 21. Finally, European rum, brandy and strong wine brought illness, conflict and addiction.Innis, (Fur Trade) p. 19. Also see, Ray, Arthur. \\"When Two Worlds Met\\" in The Illustrated History of Canada, edited by Craig Brown. Toronto: Lester & Orpen Dennys, p. 88: \\"Since alcohol was cheap to obtain, could be consumed on the spot, and was addictive, the European traders had very strong economic incentives to trade and give away large quantities of liquor.\\" Again and again, Innis draws attention to what he sees as the disastrous and catastrophic effects of the contact between a more technologically advanced European civilization and traditional native societies. He writes that the aboriginal peoples' dependence on the trade in beaver pelts to secure European iron goods \\"disturbed the balance which had grown up previous to the coming of the European.\\"Innis, (Fur Trade) p. 388. Decades later, Innis would return to this concept of balance in his communications writings.Innis mentions the native peoples specifically in his essay \\"Industrialism and Cultural Values.\\" In The Bias of Communication. (1951) Toronto: University of Toronto Press, p. 141. Just as aboriginal peoples depended on imported manufactured goods, European traders relied for their survival on native tools and techniques. Birch-bark canoes enabled traders to travel in spring, summer and fall; snowshoes and toboggans made winter travel possible; while Indian corn, pemmican and wild game provided sustenance and clothing. Equally important, Innis notes, was the natives' thorough knowledge of woodland territories and the habits of the animals they hunted.Innis, (Fur Trade) p. 13. Biographer John Watson argues that in his study of the fur trade, Innis broke new ground by making cultural factors central to economic development. In Watson's terms, The Fur Trade in Canada is a \\"complex analysis\\" of three distinct cultural groups: metropolitan European customers who bought expensive beaver hats, colonial settlers who traded beaver fur for goods from their home countries and indigenous peoples who came to depend on European iron-age technologies.Watson p. 152. Also, Innis notes the dependence of traders on First Nations peoples,Innis (Fur Trade) p. 16 and suggests their dominance in early trading when he writes, \\"The trade in furs was stimulated by French traders who rapidly acquired an intimate knowledge of the Indian's language, customs, and habits of life\\" > The trader encouraged the best hunters, exhorted the Indians to hunt beaver, > and directed their fleets of canoes to the rendezvous. Alliances were formed > and wars were favoured to increase the supply of fur. Goods were traded that > would encourage the Indian to hunt beaver. Innis writes that the French used Christianity to make First Nations more amenable to trade. They encouraged war or promoted peace as ways of winning First Nations support. He notes these policies led to an increase in the overhead costs of trade that decreased profits and encouraged the growth of monopolies.Innis (Fur Trade), pp. 30‚Äì31 Economic effects of staple products =Canada as a \\"marginal\\" colony= Innis's 15-page conclusion to the Fur Trade in Canada explains the significance of staple products, such as furs, to colonial development. It also explores the effects of the staples trade on the more technologically advanced home countries of France and Britain. \\"Fundamentally the civilization of North America is the civilization of Europe,\\" Innis writes, \\"and the interest of this volume is primarily in the effects of a vast new land area on European civilization.\\"Innis, (Fur Trade) p.383. He notes that European settlers in North America survived by borrowing the cultural traits of the indigenous peoples, but also sought to maintain European standards of living by exporting goods not available in the home country in exchange for manufactured products. In Canada's case, the first such goods were the staples cod fish and beaver fur. Later staples included lumber, pulp and paper, wheat, gold, nickel and other metals.Innis, (Fur Trade) pp.383-385. Innis maintains that this two-way trade had significant effects. The colony put its energies into producing staples while the mother country manufactured finished products. Thus, the staples trade promoted industrial development in Europe, while the colony remained tied to the production of raw materials. As time passed, colonial agriculture, industry, transportation, trade, finance and government activities tended to be subordinated to the production of staple commodities for industrial Britain, and later for the rapidly developing United States. This cumulative dependence on staples relegated Canadians to the status of hewers of wood and drawers of water.Innis (Fur Trade) pp.384-386. \\"The economic history of Canada has been dominated by the discrepancy between the centre and margin of Western civilization,\\" Innis concludes.Innis, (Fur Trade) p.385. For him, as biographer Donald Creighton points out, Canada's economic axis began as \\"a great competitive east-west trading system, founded on the St. Lawrence River and the Great Lakes, one end of which lay in the metropolitan centres of western Europe and the other in the hinterland of North America. It was a transoceanic as well as a transcontinental system.\\"Creighton, Donald. (1957). Harold Adams Innis: Portrait of a Scholar. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, p.105. =Concept of \\"cyclonics\\"= Innis argued that a country dependent on the export of staple products would always be vulnerable both to disruptions in the sources of supply and to the whims of export markets. In the case of beaver fur, for example, a slight change in fashion in sophisticated metropolitan centres like London and Paris could have devastating effects in a marginal \\"backwoods\\" colony dependent on exporting staples. Innis developed the concept of \\"cyclonics\\" to explain the disruptions that occurred when new technologies led to the rapid exploitation and then exhaustion of staple commodities.Watson, p.89. European-made guns, for example, increased the efficiency of beaver hunting, but led to the animal's rapid extermination forcing traders into costly, long-distance searches for new sources of supply. Later, the decline of the white pine, a vital commodity in the lumber trade, forced the shift to pulp and paper production based on abundant spruce.Innis, (Fur Trade) p.396. Shifts from one staple to another led to constant economic cyclones. \\"Canadians have exhausted their energies,\\" Innis wrote in 1929, \\"in opening up the West, in developing mines, hydro- electric power and pulp and paper mills of the Canadian Shield, in building transcontinental railways, grain elevators and cities.\\"Innis, \\"notes and comments,\\" quoted in Watson, p.162. Harold Innis argues that the need to pay for costly railways led to Canadian Confederation in 1867. For Innis, imported industrial techniques led to rapid resource exploitation, overproduction, waste, depletion and economic collapse. These were the problems of economically marginal, staples-producing countries like Canada.Watson, p.160. =Politics and the staples trade= Innis famously writes that Canada \\"emerged not in spite of geography but because of it.\\" The country's boundaries roughly coincide, he argues, with the fur-trading areas of northern North America.Innis, (Fur Trade) p.392-393. Certainly the increased demand for furs, such as beaver, resulted in increased exploration westward. Innis maintains that the shift from furs to lumber led to European immigration and the rapid settling of the West. The \\"coffin ships\\" that carried the lumber to Europe brought back emigrants as a \\"return cargo.\\" The export of lumber, and later wheat, required improvements in transportation --- the construction of canals and the building of railways. The costs of these transportation improvements were largely responsible, he writes, for the Act of Union joining Upper and Lower Canada in 1840-41, and the political Confederation of Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia in 1867.Innis, (Fur Trade) pp.394-397. Economic reliance on staples production in a vast country led to the development of centralized banking, a strong federal government, and \\"the combination of government ownership and private enterprise which has been a further characteristic of Canadian development.\\"Innis, (Fur Trade) pp.396 & 401. Through the encouragement of the monopoly of the Hudson's Bay Company is born centralized control, use of military aggression, and hints of nationalism .Innis (Fur Trade) p. 32-51 Innis concludes that the maintenance of ties with France and Britain encouraged a diversity of institutions and greater tolerance adding that \\"Canada has remained fundamentally a product of Europe.\\"Innis, (Fur Trade) p.401. Assessment Historian Carl Berger notes that it took 15 years to sell the first thousand copies of The Fur Trade in Canada. Yet, he writes, the book is one of the few in Canadian historical literature that deserves to be described as seminal. According to Berger, Innis showed that Canada was far from \\"a fragile political creation and that its existence represented the triumph of human will and determination.\\" He replaced this \\"old and familiar truism\\" with the idea that river systems and the Canadian Shield imposed a geographic unity and that \\"Confederation was, in a sense, a political reflection of the natural coherence of northern America.\\" Berger adds that, in exploring the links between economic changes and political developments, \\"Innis's insights pointed to a general reinterpretation of Canadian history.\\" Innis also \\"placed Indian culture at the centre of his study of the fur trade and was the first to explain adequately the disintegration of native society under the thrust of European capitalism.\\"Berger, Carl. (1976). \\"Harold Innis: The Search for Limits.\\" In The Writing of Canadian History. Toronto: Oxford University Press, pp.97-100. Unlike other historians, Innis emphasized the contributions of First Nations peoples.Dickason, Olive; McNab, David. (2009). Canada's First Nations: A History of Founding Peoples From Earliest Times. Don Mills, Ontario: Oxford University Press, p.ix \\"We have not yet realized,\\" he writes, \\"that the Indian and his culture were fundamental to the growth of Canadian institutions.\\"Innis (Fur Trade), p.392. Berger refers to the \\"sense of fatalism and determinism in Innis's economic history\\" adding that for Innis, material realities determined history, not language, religion or social beliefs. \\"His history, as history, was dehumanized,\\" Berger adds.Berger, pp.97-98. Biographer John Watson argues however, that The Fur Trade in Canada is \\"more complex, more universal, and less rigidly deterministic than commonly accepted.\\" Watson points for example, to Innis's central concern with the role of culture in economic history and his awareness of cultural disintegration under the impact of advanced technologies. \\"Innis never uses the staple as anything more than a focusing point around which to examine the interplay of cultures and empires,\\" he writes.Watson, pp.148-149.

Though the Department of Journalism was first founded in 1930 under the School of Liberal Arts, initial course offerings eventually led to the establishment of the School of Journalism in 1955. This new school brought together the advertising program, which dates back to 1936, and the journalism program to form what became the School of Communications in 1985. Joining the advertising/public relations and journalism programs to form a more comprehensive communications school were programs in film-video, media studies and telecommunications. The film-video program, originating in the College of Arts and Architecture, and the media studies program, previously a communications studies major housed in the College of Liberal Arts, were both introduced at Penn State in the 1960s. The telecommunications major was born in the College of Liberal Arts, dating back to the mid-1970s. After its establishment in 1985, the School of Communications was upgraded to the College of Communications in 1995, followed by the departmentalization of the college in 2000. On April 21, 2017, the college was renamed the Donald P. Bellisario College of Communications, after the acclaimed writer, producer, director and alumnus Donald P. Bellisario committed $30 million to support students and faculty in the college and to establish the Donald P. Bellisario Media Center, set to open in fall 2020.

It is an allegory that presents a range of problems to scholars of the drama of the Jacobean and Caroline eras. Date and publication The play was licensed for publication by Sir Henry Herbert, the Master of the Revels, on 16 April 1630 and was published later that year, in a quarto printed by the brothers Richard and Thomas Cotes for the bookseller Francis Constable. Constable dedicated the work to Henry Carey, 4th Baron Hunsdon and 1st Earl of Dover. In his dedication, Constable repeats the statement of the title page, that the author is deceased.David Moore Bergeron, Textual Patronage in English Drama, 1570‚Äì1640, London, Ashgate, 2006; p. 40. The full title of the play in the 1630 quarto is Pathomachia or the Battle of Affections, Shadowed by a Feigned Siege of the City of Pathopolis. The title page also states that the play was \\"Written some years since\\" by the late author and is now issued by one of his friends. The play's running title, which appears at the top of the pages of text, is Love's Lodestone. A University play by that name was staged c. 1616; the implication is that the Pathomachia of 1630 is the same work as the Love's Lodestone of c. 1616.E. K. Chambers, The Elizabethan Stage, 4 Volumes, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1923; Vol. 3, p. 499. The play also exists in two manuscript texts; one is part of MS. Harl. 6869 Art. 1 in the collection of the British Library, and the other is MS. Eng. poet. e. 5 in the collection in the Bodleian Library.Alfred Harbage, \\"Elizabethan and Seventeenth-Century Play Manuscripts,\\" Papers of the Modern Language Association Vol. 50 No. 3 (September 1935), pp. 687‚Äì99; see p. 695. Pathomachia shares the Harleian MS. with another allegorical play, titled The Fallacies, or the Troubles of Hermenia, which is dated 1631 and ascribed to Richard Zouch. The Harleian MS. text of Pathomachia contains variant readings and some material absent from the printed text, but is missing its last seventeen or so lines. Authorship There is no external evidence of the author's identity. One 19th-century commentator, misreading Francis Kirkman's 1661 play list, assigned the play to Anthony Brewer, an attribution for which there is no sound justification. An attempt to assign the play to John Marston has been rejected by the scholarly consensus. Attempts to assign the play to the Cambridge Platonist philosopher Henry More are problematical chronologically, since More was born in 1614. (He might have written Pathomachia in his mid- teens, but he couldn't have written Love's Lodestone at the age of two.) The blind academic Ambrose Fisher (died 1617) has also been suggested as a candidate.Peter Laslett, \\"Sir Robert Filmer: The Man Versus the Whig Myth,\\" William and Mary Quarterly Vol. 5 (1948), pp. 523‚Äì46. Perhaps the strongest case has been made for Thomas Tomkis as the author of Pathomachia; the play shares obvious commonalities with Tomkis's Lingua (1607). In fact Pathomachia contains two direct references to \\"Madame Lingua,\\" and shows a range of similarities with Tomkis's play.Paul Edward Smith, ed., Pathomachia, Washington DC, Catholic University of America Press, 1942. Tomkis was an academic playwright; his Albumazar (1615) was acted at Cambridge University.Chambers, Vol. 3, p. 498. Genre Composed in prose rather than verse, Pathomachia relies heavily on the tradition of allegory and the morality play; its characters are personifications of the human passions, Love, Hatred, Pride, Malice, Envy, Curiosity, etc. The play treats Love and Hatred as the King and Queen of the country of the emotions; but the royal figures have neglected their duties and a rebellion has sprung up among their subjects. The vices masquerade as virtues, until they are suppressed and brought to order by Justice. In fact there is no action in the play, which consists of three acts of dialogue among the personifications. (Pathomachia strongly resembles closet drama, and many critics would probably classify it as such; though if it was acted on stage as Love's Lodestone it would not qualify as a literal instance of closet drama.) The text is rich with classical allusions and cultural references. In the opening scene of Act II, for example, Justice tells Love that Heroical Virtue \\"is gone to the Antipodes, unto Japonia\\" [that is, Japan] and that \\"I have not heard of him since the time of Judas Maccabeus....\\" The drama also displays many references to then-recent historical events, including the Gunpowder Plot and Fran√ßois Ravaillac's assassination of Henri IV among others. (These contemporaneous references are consistent with a date of authorship c. 1616; none of them are to events of the 1620s that would contradict that dating.) The one passage in the play most often cited in the critical literature is probably the catalogue of torture devices in Act III, scene iv: \\"the Russian Shiners, the Scottish Boots, the Dutch Wheel, the Spanish strappado, linen ball, and pearl of confession shall torment thee...,\\" etc. Despite the play's references to contemporary events, it gives no sense that it is in any way a commentary on the specific English political situation of its time. It is hard to see how either set of English rulers in its era ‚Äî King James I and Queen Anne, or King Charles I and Queen Henrietta Maria ‚Äî could be allegorised as Love and Hatred. Though the morality-play genre was definitely old-fashioned by 1630, it had not yet died out entirely. Apart from the earlier Lingua, Pathomachia can be classed with a roster of similar plays in its generation, including Dekker and Ford's The Sun's Darling, Nabbes's Microcosmus, Randolph's The Muses' Looking Glass, Barten Holyday's Technogamia, and William Strode's The Floating Island, among others. In the view of one critic, Pathomachia has \\"a significance for the historian of ethics and psychological theory.\\"Alfred Harbage, \\"Materials for the Study of English Renaissance Drama,\\" Modern Language Notes Vol. 59 No. 2 (February 1944), p. 131.

He spent months trying to clear himself of the charges. 68.4% of the shareholders of the bank where he was the chief executive officer (\\"amministratore delegato\\"), voted to sue him in a class action.  Mismanagement and fraud at the Banca Popolare di Lodi  As a result of the official investigations by the Italian prosecutors' office (Procura Nazionale) and by the Italian National Bank Banca d'Italia it became clear that for years, Fiorani and his hidden associates had become the total controllers of the Banca Popolare di Lodi, using it to gain control of other small banks such as Popolare di Crema, but also for their own personal advantage, such as getting real estate properties for themselves and for third parties, operating arbitrarily, with absolute internal, external and institutional control. Among other things, the official investigations established that in order to cover its losses, the bank charged its unsuspecting customers increasing bank fees. Thus, according to the (GIP) magistrate Clementina Forleo, many small account holders suffered huge losses. It was also confirmed that if an account holder died and the relatives did not close the account quickly, it was illegally seized by the bank.  Advice to victims  In an interview given on July 14, 2007 to the Italian newspaper La Repubblica Fiorani released a statement that affirmed, \\"With all my experience and competence, I find myself in a broadcast to explain to Italians how not to get cheated by banks and insurance companies.\\" References Category:Italian bankers Category:1959 births Category:Living people ","title":"Gianpiero Fiorani"},{"id":"14894021","title":"Pennsylvania Senate, District 40"},{"id":"14894029","text":":For the school district in Saratoga, California, see Saratoga Union School District Saratoga Elementary School is located at 2504 Meredith Avenue in the Saratoga neighborhood of North Omaha, Nebraska, United States.

The fortified structure, which was finished in the 14th century, was used to observe the land south of the town and across River Severn. It is under the care of the National Trust.  History  Shrewsbury town walls were completed in stone in the 13th century replacing earlier ramparts. Work to fortify the settlement had started immediately after the Angles, under King Offa of Mercia, took possession in CE778. A century later the Anglo-Saxons had strengthened the town earthworks with a wide ditch and rampart that was topped with a wooden stockade. Most of the early defences were adjacent to the river because its size, depth and limited crossing points provided a substantial defence to direct attack. In 1070 the Normans started Shrewsbury Castle at the north end of the settlement but did not alter the settlement's outer defences. However, by early 13th century, military action was increasing between the Welsh and the English. In 1215 Llywelyn ap Iorwerth overran the Anglo-Saxon earthworks and ramparts sacking and burning Shrewsbury. This prompted Henry III in 1218 to command the town's aldermen to improve its defences. Through murage, the town walls were extended, upgraded and repaired, watch towers were added and new gates with towers were also installed (the North Gate was given a drawbridge). The walls, which were thick, were constructed from sandstone; a plinth was built into the base of its outer face and there was an external ditch. By 1242, further work had added an outer earthen bank that was high and wide. During this period the Town Walls Tower would have been used by the town garrison to watch the surrounding area for Welsh incursions and raids. However, after the pacification of the Welsh by Edward I, Shrewsbury's strategic importance declined on the Welsh Marches. By the mid 14th century, the diminished military importance of the walls and towers no longer justified their upkeep, although this tower was remodelled (to its final size) during the reign of Henry IV. By the 15th century, wooden houses were being built behind and on the wall by townspeople. Some sections behind Pride Hill and Castle Street were demolished. The stone was reused in town house foundations. By 1580, the tower had become known as Waring's Tower after the Waring family who leased it from the town corporation. It was later called Wingfield's Tower after another occupant. Throughout the late 18th century the remaining parts of Shrewsbury town walls were demolished and the gateways removed. The Town Walls Towers survived because it remained in use. In 1816 the tower was the workshop of a watch maker named John Massey. In the 1860s, it was converted into a dwelling for the coachmen of John Humphreys, who lived opposite the tower in of Swan Hill Court. His daughter Rachel Humphreys donated the tower to the National Trust in 1930. Between 1930 and 1937 her gardener and his wife lived in the tower. From 1937 to 1954 it was occupied by Mrs. Janet Mitchell. From 1954 to 1967 it was occupied by Mrs. B Curtis. From 1968 to 2012 it was leased by Mr and Mrs Hector. It is now leased by Shrewsbury High School and conserved by the National Trust.

Gulbranssen is best known for writing the Bj√∏rndal Trilogy ‚Äì Og bakom synger skogene (1933), published in English as Beyond Sing the Woods; and Det bl√•ser fra Dauingfjell (1934) and Ingen vei g√•r utenom (1935), collectively translated under the English title The Wind from the Mountains.Twentieth Century Authors: A Biographical Dictionary of Modern Literature, edited by Stanley J. Kunitz and Howard Haycraft, New York, The H. W. Wilson Company, 1942. His books were well received by critics and readers alike, and they have been translated into over 30 languages and sold more than 12 million copies. At one point prior to the outbreak of World War II, the popularity of the Trilogy made Gulbranssen the fourth-bestselling author worldwide, and the success of the American editions of his work secured for him the distinction of being the only Scandinavian author of fiction to be included in the prestigious List of Books Chosen for the White House ‚Äì a collection of works of literature selected by U.S. publishers and presented to the White House in order to provide the president with a library of the very best in contemporary literature.Hoel, 1997, p. 134-135 His novels were later adapted for film, though he was disappointed with the results. He was also well known as a sports journalist, writing primarily for the magazine Idr√¶tsliv (Sports Life), which he produced together with Peder Christian Andersen and Einar Staff. He wrote many of his most famous and characteristic articles as a correspondent for Idr√¶tsliv and Aftenposten during the Summer Olympics in the years between 1920 and 1936. He took a particular interest in track and field and sought to promote it as a sports manager for many years. He is also regarded ‚Äì together with Nils Dahl ‚Äì as the first person to have introduced orienteering to Norway.Hoel, 1997, p. 59 Gulbranssen's primary profession was tobacconist; in association with his business partners he imported tobacco, cigars, cigarettes, pipes, and other items. The wholesale business he was a member of became the largest of its type in Norway under his leadership.Hoel, 1997, p. 48 He was a respected business man both inside and outside of Norway's borders, and he established many lifelong friendships during the course of his business trips around Europe. In 1940, Gulbranssen moved with his family to a farm in Eidsberg, allowing him to realize his dream of being a farmer, and even though he did not personally participate in the daily chores, he invested a great deal of effort in the planning and management of the enterprise. Although he was a newcomer to the district, he did not isolate himself on the farm, and he maintained a good relationship with his neighbors. In 1955 he helped found the Mysen Rotary Club, where he actively participated as a charter member until his death in 1962.Hoel, 1997, p. 253 Background and childhood Trygve Gulbranssen was born on Molstad Farm on Enebakk Road in the V√•lerenga neighborhood of Kristiania (now Oslo) in 1894. His parents were Christen Gulbrandsen (1863‚Äì1943) and Alette Gulbrandsen, born Alette Antonsdatter Dahl (1863‚Äì1941). He had two older brothers, Birger and Alfred, as well as tree younger sisters, Camilla, Ragnhild Margrethe and Tora Elvira. His father Christen was the son of a farmer and master carpenter named Johan Gulbrandsen (1826‚Äì1871) and Petrine Pedersdatter N√∏klebye (1828‚Äì1909), both of whom descended from farmer families in Tr√∏gstad, √òstfold County. His mother Alette grew up on Vestre Dahl Farm in Skogbygda in Frogn, Akershus County. Her father was a farmer and freighter captain named Johan Anton J√∏rgensen Strandengen (died 1899) and mother Bolette Olsdatter, born Skau. Through relatives on his mother's side, Gulbranssen was connected with the villages in the Follo district. Christen Gulbrandsen, a carpenter and master builder, provided a good living for his family by buying and renovating townhouses before reselling them. A shortage of housing led to rising prices in Kristiania, but in 1899 the housing bubble burst in what has subsequently become known as the Kristiania Crash. Gulbrandsen had attempted to spread out the risk by placing his fortune in multiple banks and by purchasing Solberg Farm in Tr√∏gstad, but this strategy failed as bank after bank closed its doors. The lack of new renovation projects and the loss of all property and savings came as a hard blow for him. He went on to try his hand as a real estate broker, but never fully recovered from the sudden change in his fortunes. The family rapidly went from being relatively wealthy to struggling to make both ends meet. Paradoxically, they kept on moving to gradually \\"nicer\\" addresses as the economy deteriorated, which probably resulted from the family taking up residence in some of the father's renovation projects.Hoel, 1997, p. 27-28. This source mentions that the family lived in the \\"regular\\" area above the National Hospital before the recession, but moved into addresses such as Frogner Road og Thomas Heftyes Street after the economy had gone into decline. On account of the father's business, there were many changes of residence, which caused the young Gulbranssen to lose contact with his friends and grow lonely. He wrote about this period of his life: Gulbranssen wrote this and many other notes about childhood with the intent of writing a book about the trials of growing up in Kristiania around 1900, but those plans never came to fruition. In 1901 Gulbranssen lost his two-year-old sister Ragnhild Margrethe to dysentery, which she had contracted through contaminated well water. When his maternal father's farm was sold in 1906, Gulbranssen lost the only constant in his family's otherwise unpredictable city life. Both Gulbranssen and the other children took it hard. From an early age, he nurtured an interest for the agrarian life of Eastern Norway. But it wasn't until he came across the prayer book D. Jens Dinnys√∏n Jersins Tvende Opbyggelige Skrifter during one of the family's many moves that his interest in family history and the ideas that would mature in his later works really started to take hold. The prayer book, which had belonged to his great-great- grandfather Ole Christophersen Bi√∏rnebecks got him to ask his mother about their family origin. His mother was a good storyteller, and the stories she relayed were conscientiously noted by the young Gulbranssen, and later provided inspiration for many of the stories in his books. Into adolescence and out into the workforce Gulbranssen had a tough childhood where the family often struggled to get enough money to put food on the table, and he went to work early on to help support his family. As a nine-year-old, he started out as a courier and ran errands, initially for private individuals and family, and later for haberdashers, butchers, cobblers, dairies, fishmongers, coal merchants, and many types of businesses and stores in Kristiania. During an errand in 1906, he was supposed to deliver food from a delicatessen to Henrik Ibsen's home on Arbins Street. While he was there, he was asked whether he would like to see the deceased writer on his deathbed, but he became frightened and ran down the stairs.Hoel, 1997, p. 33. In spite of his difficult work as a courier, Gulbranssen still did rather well in school. He attended Uranienborg School in Briskeby, worked hard earning good grades, did well on his examinations, and completed vocational school with top marks.Hoel, 1997, p. 34 The difficult life as a courier made it so that school work, and especially reading, became a haven allowing him to escape into his imagination. He seized every opportunity to read ‚Äì surreptitiously under the desk at school, walking in the street, and while chopping wood or running errands.Hoel, 1997, p. 35 Drawing Gulbranssen demonstrated a talent for drawing at an early age, and attended a number of drawing schools starting at age twelve. At age fifteen he produced a series of humorous drawings which he sent to a Danish joke magazine, securing for himself a small amount of supplementary income in the process. He enrolled in the Royal Norwegian Art and Handicraft School in the fall of 1909. This was a night school, where, with the exception of a hiatus in 1911, he continued his studies until 1916. In 1914, a drawing of a horse that he had made was selected for the 1914 Jubilee Exhibition.Hoel, 1997, p. 38 One of his professors once said to him while Gulbranssen was enlarging a drawing: ‚ÄúTake life in its true proportions; it is hard enough as it is. By reshaping it, one is apt to find small joys and large sorrows. Follow it exactly as it is, take hold of what is important, remain simple. I am showing you an essential truth: simplicity is life‚Äôs greatest art.‚Äù Gulbranssen found good use for this advice in the course of writing his books.Hoel, 1997, s. 39 The famous artist Trygve M. Davidsen, who attended art school together with Gulbranssen, remarked that he had heard that Gulbranssen did not have a diploma: ‚ÄúThat is strange; you got better grades than me!‚Äù Later, in February 1955, Gulbranssen was presented with a diploma that Davidsen had made with Gulbranssen's grades attested by school chancellor Jacob Tostrup Prytz.Hoel, 1997, p. 40 Gulbranssen had, among other things, received perfect or near-perfect marks in free-hand drawing. Steady work at the Excelsior glue factory Since the family could not afford to send him on to secondary school, Gulbranssen was obliged to discontinue his formal education after seven years of elementary school. On 31 March 1908, just one month after graduating and barely fourteen years old, he was already employed as a clerk at the Excelsior Glue Factory, Inc. He started our as an assistant ‚Äì a position he would continue to hold for the first five years. While working at Excelsior, Gulbranssen took several courses and night schools, including a two-year business course at the Christiania Municipal School of Continuing Education for boys during the period 1910‚Äì1913, as well as additional courses in bookkeeping and English. He completed the classes with flying colors and received the highest marks in all subjects.Hoel, 1997, p. 41 He also got promoted to bookkeeper and cashier, continuing in these positions for the next three and a half years. In all, Gulbranssen worked eight years at Excelsior before leaving the company with the highest recommendations and without any absences for illness.Hoel, 1997, p. 41 This is related in a letter of recommendation from Excelsior signed by J. Gullichsen. The time spent at Excelsior provided Gulbranssen with experience and life lessons in addition to all the knowledge he gained. The factory was engaged in the production of animal glue, where the raw materials were carcasses and animal skeletons, and there were several ugly accidents and tragedies that certainly made an impression on the young Trygve Gulbranssen. He spent most of the time in the office, but would often visit the shop floor to learn about the tiresome conditions of regular workers ‚Äì an experience which may have been important later on when he sought to describe the toil of the very same kind of people in his novels.Hoel, 1997, p. 43 Daily life in Brugata No. 1 The Gulbranssen family moved to Brugata No. 1 in the fall of 1908. Several farmers‚Äô markets were located in the area, and a majority of Kristiania's tanners and leather workers resided nearby. The place was hardly one of the best neighborhoods,Hoel, 1997, p. 54 but Gulbranssen had a good view from the apartment on the fifth floor and was able to observe life in the marketplace at Brugata No. 6 on the opposite side of the street. The sight of farmers coming into the city to buy and sell goods enabled him to paint a realistic picture of commerce between town and country in his fiction.Hoel, 1997, p. 51 He continued to live with the family in Brugata until he married in 1928. Gulbranssen often visited the Deichman Library, but the family had to subscribe to the newly published books that the library did not have. They received one chapter at a time and bound the books themselves. Gulbranssen's sister was able to attend secondary school and stood for her examinations in 1913, the same year her brother was promoted to bookkeeper. This was possible because the family's financial situation had gradually improved as the boys grew up and entered the workforce. So as not to be a burden to her brothers, she chose not to study medicine (which one of her teachers had encouraged her to do), but instead took a position at an insurance company, where she remained until she married in 1921. His brother Alfred died in 1913 at age 23. The loss of Alfred had a profound impact on the young Gulbranssen, to which he gave expression through compiling a memorial album containing all of the photographs taken of his brother. Gulbranssen spent the evenings after long days at work conversing with his mother, entreating her to tell stories about life in the old days, which he carefully recorded. His notes would later serve as the basis for drafts of what became the Bj√∏rndal Trilogy.Hoel, 1997, p. 56 From \\"Gulbrandsen\\" to \\"Gulbranssen\\" Gulbranssen was born \\"Trygve Emanuel Gulbrandsen\\" and spelled his name \\"Gulbrandsen\\" in the usual manner with a \\"d,\\" consisting of the given name \\"Gulbrand\\" and the suffix \\"-sen,\\" which means \\"son\\". The name therefore means \\"son of Gulbrand\\", and most likely derives from one of Gulbranssen's paternal ancestors having carried the name Gulbrand. As was common around the turn of the twentieth century in Norway, the family elected to keep using this surname instead of continuing to take the father's given name as the surname for the next generation, as had previously been traditional in Norway. As a sign of his growing self- confidence, Gulbranssen undertook a name change in 1912 in order to assert his own identity, and continued thereafter to sign his name with double-\\"s‚Äù and no \\"d.\\"Hoel, 1997, p. 45 This was an individual decision that Gulbranssen made after turning eighteen, and the rest of the family continued to write their name using the customary spelling. The name change has been carried on by Gulbranssen's two children. A family and home of his own Trygve Gulbranssen married Lilly Ragna Haneborg on 30 November 1928 in Trinity Church in Oslo ‚Äì the same church in which he had been confirmed in 1909. The reception was held at the Hotel Bristol. Lilly Haneborg came from Lie Farm in √òymark, √òstfold, and was the daughter of landowner Petter Asbj√∏rn Aarnes Haneborg (1873‚Äì1955) and Ragna Slang (1879‚Äì1965). At age 34, Gulbranssen moved out of his parents‚Äô residence and into a two-room apartment at Damplassen near Ullev√•l Hageby. The following spring, they moved on to a three-room apartment located at Tyrihans Road No. 22 in Vestre Aker, so as to have more room to raise a family. It was here that he began to gather all of the notes from his youth into three books. The work was time-consuming, and with time he resigned from all his commitments related to sports and journalism. In 1930 the couple welcomed their firstborn, Ragna, and three years later their son Per was born. With two small children to take care of and a business to run, Gulbranssen had to use evenings and nights to write. This habit of working at night would last the rest of his life. In 1935, as the sales of his books began to pick up, Gulbranssen moved his family to a villa at Eventyr Road No. 40 in Blindern.Gulbranssen, 1997, p. 207 in the caption to a photograph it says: ‚ÄúAt age 41, Trygve Gulbranssen finally has the workroom he always wanted.‚Äù Gulbranssen was 41 in 1935. Here, Gulbranssen was finally able to realize the dream he had nurtured for many years of having his own workroom; a room that was locked and that no one else had access to.Gulbranssen, 1997, p. 206 The outbreak of World War II After the German invasion on 9 April 1940, Gulbranssen evacuated with his family to his father-in-law's farm at Lie in Marker, Norway. On 13 April they travelled on by horse to a hunting cabin by Fr√∏ne Lake before returning to Lie on 18 April. After the situation had stabilized down, they returned to Oslo. Gulbranssen sold his stake in the tobacco business as quickly as possible, realizing that the blockade accompanying the war would make it difficult to continue as a tobacconist.Gulbranssen, 1997, p. 219 Purchasing a farm Spending time on his grandfather's farm had been Gulbranssen's version of paradise as a child, and he had been looking for many years for a farmstead where he could recreate the life of his forefathers. Now he intensified his search, in the end settling on the estate at Hob√∏l in Eidsberg parish, where he moved his family during Christmas of 1940. Gulbranssen invested heavily in running a model farm ‚Äì something his wealth of notes dealing with purchases and general management bear witness to. The farm was in need of renovation; particularly the farmhouse dating from 1910 was inadequate for the harsh winters. For this purpose, Gulbranssen hired architects and craftsmen, and employed them in overhauling practically every room in the house for quite some time.Gulbranssen, 1997, p. 220 The source reads: ‚Äú[...] we had craftsmen about for a long time and lived in a mess, surrounded by materials.\\" There is also a quote from a poem that Gulbranssen wrote when he had \\"[...] brought his room into order [...].\\" The poem is dated 5 February 1941. Even though Gulbranssen was active in the management of the farm, he never participated directly in the daily labor, so in order to implement all of the plans he had for Hob√∏l, he employed a welder, an agronomist, a housekeeper, a cook, a maid and two farmhands. Requests for help from many quarters Although he has settled in the country, the capital was nevertheless nearby. On several occasions he received letters, telephone calls, and visits from the German occupation authorities, who wanted him to appear at various public events, give lectures, or consent to having his books used to put the average German soldier in touch with the \\"Norwegian mindset,\\"Hoel, 1997, p. 230 as they put it. He declined as best he could, although it became more difficult each time, and it became a source of strain for Gulbranssen, who had no patience for National Socialism.Gulbranssen, 1997, p. 229-230 \\"Father had wiggled out of it one more time, but this time they knew where he stood [...]\\"Hoel, 1997, p. 177 \\"...] a movement that he despised.\\" In addition to these repeated inquiries, Gulbranssen also received a steady stream of appeals from individuals who were suffering under the Germans or who otherwise sought his help; Gulbranssen rendered what assistance he could.Hoel, 1997, p. 177 Among other things, he was asked for money, tobacco, and animals.Gulbranssen, 1997, p. 271-272 He also aided the Home Front.Hoel, 1994, p. 159 Gulbranssen and Max Tau In 1939 when the humanist and writer Max Tau fled from Nazi Germany to Norway with the help of Tore Hamsun, Trygve Gulbranssen was one of the first to open his home to him,Gulbranssen, 1997, p. 255 inaugurating a lifelong friendship. After Tau became the first winner of the Peace Prize of the German Book Trade in 1950, he elected to use the prize money to endow a Peace Library. The Peace Library's first publication, The Future in Your Hands by A. den Doolaard and photographer Cas Oorthuys, came out in Norway and the Netherlands at the same time. But when the time came to take the first step out into the world ‚Äì the publication of the German version ‚Äì the process ground to a halt. Tau contacted publisher after publisher without any luck, and finally turned to Gulbranssen for help. Gulbranssen took advantage of his fame and wrote a review of The Future in Your Hands. The review went over well in Germany and Tau was finally able to sign a contract with a German publisher. After the War During the war, Gulbranssen lived under constant pressure from the authorities, as well as receiving requests for new books from his publisher, Aschehoug. In spite of all this, the lack of contact with the outside world and his foreign publishers, in addition to the absence of radio and uncensored newspapers, left him with a sense of isolation. The liberation of the country on 8 May 1945 released a flood of emotions for Gulbranssen, which found expression among other places in his poem 17 May 1945. Since Gulbranssen was a farmer, he had at his disposal resources which were at that time in short supply, but he was willing to share, such as when he gave the Authors‚Äô Union an entire ox so that they could hold their planned peace and anniversary celebration.Gulbranssen, 1997, p. 235 After the war, Gulbranssen spent a great deal of time reestablishing contact with his publishers and transacting business with booksellers, from whom he had been cut off during the war. A number of issues needed to be worked out; for example instances where his novels had been printed abroad without his consent, and without any royalties having been paid.Gulbranssen, 1997, p. 239 In order to resolve some of these issues, he took a trip with his daughter in 1950 where he paid visits to several of the European publishers. In 1958, all of the farm's animals were sold at auction and Gulbranssen, like many other farmers in √òstfold, was forced to rely entirely on the production of grain.Hoel, 1997, p. 171-172 Gulbranssen had worked hard to create a model farm, and the animals, which had been bred to be among the best in Eidsberg, included several prize-winning cows. The sense of disappointment over having to give up animal husbandry and milk production was considerable.Hoel, 1997, p. 172Gulbranssen, 1997, p. 222 Along with the herds, the sounds of life disappeared from the farm. Since one of the motivations for purchasing the farm in the first place had been to relive childhood memories from his grandfather's farm, it is no wonder that the day silence overtook the farm was one of the saddest in Gulbranssen's life.Hoel, 1997, p. 172-173 Towards the end of his life, his health went into decline; his hearing began to fail,Gulbranssen, 1997, p. 253 and he suffered from frequent nosebleeds.Gulbranssen, 1997, p. 263. Ragna Gulbranssen mentions a menu that her father had made where he comments humoristically on the nosebleeds. She writes: ‚ÄúTherefore the bothersome nosebleeds were already taking place in March.‚Äù On 10 October 1962 Trygve Gulbranssen died in Eidsberg at 68 years of age. The attending physician diagnosed pneumonia and wanted to admit him to the hospital. Gulbranssen wanted to speak with his children first, and was given an injection of penicillin before he went to bed. His daughter Ragna was away, but his son Per came as quickly as possible, only to find his father dead in his bed.

He has been the organization PKK's acting leader since its original founder and leader, Abdullah √ñcalan, was captured in 1999 by Turkish intelligence agents. On 2014, he left the PKK leader position and was assigned as the new commander-in-chief of the PKK's armed wing, the People's Defence Forces. Born in Birecik, ≈ûanlƒ±urfa, Karayƒ±lan finished his studies at a vocational college of machinery and joined the organization PKK in 1979. He was active in his native province of ≈ûanlƒ±urfa until he fled to Syria at the time of the 1980 Turkish coup d'√©tat. He has called on Kurds to stop serving in the military of Turkey, stop paying taxes and stop using the Turkish language. On 13 December 2016, the Chief Prosecutor of Mardin issued a detention warrant for Karayƒ±lan and Duran Kalkan, another PKK commander, as part of an investigation into the killing of the Kaymakam of Derik, Muhammet Fatih Safit√ºrk. In March 2017, there were reports of a failed assassination attempt against Karayƒ±lan, but it was unclear as to whether the attempt was made by Turkish forces or a group within the PKK. Murat Karayƒ±lan and two other PKK leaders are wanted by the United States Department of the Treasury and the Government of Turkey for recruiting child soldiers, targeting Turkish government officials, police and security forces, and injuring and killing civilians within the Rewards for Justice Program. For information leading to the apprehension of Murat Karayƒ±lan are offered up to 5 Mio.$. Murat Karayilan is also the author of a book called Bir Sava≈üƒ±n Anatomisi (Anatomy of War). Suspicions of drug trafficking On 14 October 2009, the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) designated senior leaders of the organisation PKK as significant foreign narcotics traffickers: Murat Karayƒ±lan, the head of the PKK, and high-ranking members Ali Rƒ±za Altun and Z√ºbeyir Aydar. Pursuant to the Kingpin Act, the designation freezes any assets the three designees may have under U.S. jurisdiction and prohibits U.S. persons from conducting financial or commercial transactions with these individuals. As of 2011, Karayƒ±lan still has this designation. The German Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution stated in the same year, that it has no evidence that the organisational structures of the PKK are directly involved in drug trafficking in Germany.

Some papers also assess the infectious disease threat from international sources to the United States; to U.S. military personnel overseas; and to regions in which the United States has or may develop significant equities.

These assessments are summarized on the National Intelligence Assessments on Infectious Diseases page. Using public aid for information Some of the humanitarian efforts by the CIA have been accused of being false, or merely as a means to get information using the aid workers. A CIA polio vaccination program in Abbottabad, Pakistan came under fire in 2011 after it was revealed the CIA used the program to get information about Osama bin Laden. Shakil Afridi, the man who helped the CIA orchestrate the campaign, was sentenced to jail by Pakistani officials. A number of relief workers were also killed while trying to hand out polio vaccines after mistrust about the workers being CIA spies grew. This caused a weakening in U.S/Pakistan relations and set the campaign to eradicate polio back since the vaccinations were never completed. Congress also cut aid to Pakistan 58 percent in the following year. Using intelligence for humanitarian aid The CIA has used the intelligence it has gathered to help countries with natural disasters. On their website, the CIA writes: \\"To support global and humanitarian issues, INR worked with the rest of the IC on imagery support in response to natural disasters, such as forest fires in Southeast Asia, hurricanes, and earthquakes. Declassified U-2 imagery helped regional planners in Latin America during the clean-up from Hurricane Mitch.\\" They are also credited with helping earthquake relief efforts. The CIA display on their website that: \\"CIA supported USAID's humanitarian relief efforts following the earthquakes in Turkey and Taiwan by quickly assembling map packages of the affected regions and, in each case, delivering the packages to a representative of USAID's Office of Foreign Disaster literally on their way to the airport for an outbound flight.

It consisted of the following products: Synthesizer 101 A monophonic synthesizer with built-in keyboard, oscillator, filter, ADSR envelope generator and attenuator. Expander 102 The same synthesizer again, without the keyboard, to be stood up behind the 101 and patched into it in order to double its features. In addition, a ring modulator and sample and hold are included. Mixer 103 A four-channel stereo mixer with built-in spring reverb, stereo panning, and mono FX send/return. Sequencer 104 A two-channel, 12-step sequencer to automate playing looped bars of notes. Monitor speaker 109 A pair of 16cm speakers. PCS-10 20cm, 40cm, 60cm, 80cm and 1m patch cables. While the System 100 was not fully modular, unlike the later Roland System-100M and the Roland System 700, a complete system nevertheless formed an expandable two-oscillator monosynth with sequencing, monitoring and effects capabilities. Each unit was independently powered, so complex patches wouldn't cause either oscillator to drop in pitch. Uniquely for the time, the System 100 didn't \\"lock in\\" the oscillators to fixed footages or pitches, allowing greater flexibility for sound design. It uses the 1V/oct standard, so can be used with a MIDI-to-CV converter. The System 100 is still sought-after due to its filter, sequencer and patching capabilities, though the oscillators can be unstable at the lower frequencies, and the keyboard is prone to mis-triggering and double-triggering if not used regularly. Generally, however, it is a robust and reliable system. The SH-5 and SH-7 are similar in styling, but both have fixed signal paths, as opposed to the semi-modular System 100. Notable users The system was notably used by Mute Records label head Daniel Miller, who helped produce Depeche Mode's A Broken Frame; and by The Human League (MK1 incarnation). Specifically, the albums Reproduction and Travelogue used a large System 100 (1 x 101, 2 x 102, 2 x 104, 1 x 103) multitracked to provide nearly all the arrangements, including drums and percussion. The K2 Plan (Shekhar Raj Dhain) used it extensively in a similar vein, multitracked and with the sequencer providing odd syncopations and effects. Joy Electric's The White Songbook album (2001) was created by using a System 100 exclusively. Another notable user was Martyn Ware,Rudi Esch, Electri_City: The D√ºsseldorf School of Electronic Music, page 257, Omnibus Press a founding member of The Human League and Heaven 17.

Biography  Margaret MacArthur was born in Chicago. As a youngster, she moved around with her family - in California, Louisiana, and Arizona. She remembered that at the age of five she heard cowboys on the timber crew singing folk songs in the Tonto National Forest. She studied at Hutchins College of the University of Chicago. In 1948 she married John MacArthur and moved to Newfane, Vermont. She remained in Vermont for the rest of her life. In 1951 the couple moved into a 200-year-old farmhouse in Marlboro, Vermont. For the first 6 years there was no electricity or running water. In preparation for the move, she bought \\"Country Songs of Vermont\\" (1937) by Helen Hartness Flanders. It became the model for her future folk-song collecting. MacArthur volunteered to teach music at the school her children attended. She found old ballads appealing and she sought out traditional singers in the Vermont area. By 1951 she had performed several times on local radio. In 1960 an 80-year-old neighbor gave her an old harp- zither. Her husband repaired it and customized it. Margaret became an expert player. An instrument manufacturer was impressed and obtained permission to manufacture copies of it, calling it the \\"MacArthur Harp\\". This had originally been manufactured in 1900 under the trade name \\"Harp-O-Chord\\". There are photographs of the original harp-O-chord, the harp zither, and the modern reproduction on this page: Fretless zithers. In 1962 she signed to Folkways Records. Her first album, \\"Folksongs of Vermont\\", was recorded in her kitchen. \\"On the Mountains High\\" (1972) contains 8 songs that she collected in Vermont. Her 1976 album \\"The Old Songs\\" features vocal and guitar accompaniment from Gordon Bok. Members of her family appear on most of her albums. In 1990 and 1991 she was artist-in-residence with the Vermont Council of the Arts. She was a teacher of the lap dulcimer, and frequently appeared at festivals, coffee houses, and community events. In 1985 at the New England arts biennial, officials named MacArthur as one of seven \\"living art treasures of New England.\\" In 1997 she represented Vermont at the Kennedy Center in a national celebration of the arts. In 2001 \\"Yankee Magazine\\" voted \\"Vermont Ballads and Broadsides\\" as one of \\"The Yankee Top 40\\" of all time. In 2003 she performed at the Brattleboro Free Folk Festival. Margaret MacArthur died in the Spring of 2006. After her death, a series of tribute concerts was given. Performers included The Boys of the Lough and Gordon Bok. She appears briefly in the video \\"The West Virginia Hills: A Tribute to the Mountain Dulcimer\\". The Margaret MacArthur Collection, consisting of personal papers, books, her field recordings of traditional singers in Vermont, and materials gifted to her by Helen Hartness Flanders, resides in the archive of the Vermont Folklife Center in Middlebury, VT.

University Road Methodist Church. Built in 1864-65 to the Italianate design of W J Barre, this church is now disused. Barre had a colourful history when it came to architectural competitions. By the time he was thirty he had beaten numerous rivals to win the task of designing the Ulster Hall. His design for the Methodist Church on University Road (originally the Wesleyan Church, on what was then Botanic Road) took first place in a competition of 1864, the work being completed the following year. But he was not so lucky in the competition in 1856, to design the monument for the 3rd Marquess of Londonderry, which resulted in the building of the Scrabo Tower. Although his design took first place, the decision was overturned on grounds of cost, the commission instead going to Charles Lanyon, whose design had come fourth. Lanyon, notes Barre's biographer, was County Surveyor at the time. History came close to repeating itself in 1865: the selection committee charged with choosing a design for the monument to Prince Albert picked Barre's clock; the General Committee, of which Lanyon was a member, chose to overrule in favour of Lanyon's design. This time, however, public outcry was sufficient to restore the original decision, leaving us with Belfast's best known, if somewhat skewed (it is out by over a metre at the top), clock tower. Barre built several other monuments, perhaps the most unusual being that to the Banbridge-born arctic explorer Francis Crozier, featuring polar bears poised on top of flying buttresses. Barre died of tuberculosis at the age of 37, having completed several dozen major buildings, including private houses, schools, factories, and, above all, churches. Works Barre's best known work is the Albert Memorial Clock, in the centre of Belfast, built 1865-1870. He also designed: * Ulster Hall, Bedford Street, Belfast, 1859-62.

In the first incident, a zookeeper was bitten on the arm during a public feeding. In the second incident, one person was killed and two others were injured before police shot and killed Tatiana. Background Tatiana was born at the Denver Zoo on June 25, 2003, and was brought to the San Francisco Zoo on December 16, 2005, to provide the 14-year-old Siberian tiger, Tony, with a mate. Tatiana had no prior record of aggression towards humans. First attack On December 22, 2006, as veteran zookeeper Lori Komejan was feeding Tatiana through the enclosure's grill, Tatiana clawed and pulled Komejan's right arm through the grill and bit it. The California Occupational Safety and Health Administration later determined that the zoo had inadequate safety precautions and staff training and fined it $18,000. Komejanwho underwent several surgeries and skin grafts and whose arm was severely scarred and permanently impaired sued the zoo, settling in 2008SF Settles with Zoo Keeper Mauled by Tiger, January 17, 2009, Bay City News. on undisclosed terms.SF zookeeper mauled by tiger settles lawsuit, San Diego Union-Tribune, January 16, 2009. The tiger cage was remodeled and re-opened in September 2007. Second attack  Shortly after closing time on December 25, 2007, Tatiana escaped from her open-air enclosure,ABC News: Tiger Attack Sparks Crime Scene Photos killing 17-year-old Carlos Eduardo Sousa Jr. and injuring brothers Amritpal \\"Paul\\" Dhaliwal and Kulbir Dhaliwal (19 and 23 years old, respectively). The brothers fled to the zoo cafe away, which was locked. An employee heard their screams and called 911 at 5:07 pm. The emergency response was delayed, first because cafe employees said in their call that they suspected that the screaming person was mentally ill and that there was no actual animal attack, and later because zoo security guards were enforcing a lockdown to prevent Tatiana from escaping the zoo grounds. Armed officials found Tatiana with Kulbir Dhaliwal, but held fire at first for fear of hitting Dhaliwal. They created a distraction which caused the tiger to turn towards the officers, who shot her through the forehead.Read Tiger Attack Autopsy, June 2, 2008. KGO-TV San Francisco, ABC News. The Dhaliwal brothers received deep bites and claw wounds on their heads, necks, arms, and hands. They left the hospital on December 29. Sousa was found near the tiger grotto with blunt-force injuries to his head and neck; many punctures and scratches to his head, neck and chest; skull and spinal fractures; and a cut to his jugular vein. The Association of Zoos and Aquariums said the attack was the first time a visitor had been killed by an escaped animal at a member zoo since the Association's founding in 1924. The zoo was closed until January 3, 2008. = Investigation = It was not immediately apparent how Tatiana had escaped, but police said that Tatiana may have \\"leaped\\" or \\"climbed\\" the walls of her enclosure. Police undertook an investigation to determine whether one of the victims climbed over a waist- high fence and then dangled a leg or other body part over the edge of a moat around the tiger enclosure. Two days after the attack, on December 27, 2007, the zoo reported that while the moat, at 33 feet wide, was sufficient by national standards, its claim that the grotto's moat wall was tall was incorrect; officials measured it at tall, substantially lower than their initial report, and substantially lower than the AZA-recommended for such enclosures. Tatiana's rear paws were embedded with concrete chips, suggesting that she had pushed against the moat wall during her escape. In the days immediately following the attack, the director of the zoo stated that Tatiana was probably provoked. He said, \\"Somebody created a situation that really agitated her and gave her some sort of a method to break out. There is no possible way the cat could have made it out of there in a single leap. I would surmise that there was help. A couple of feet dangling over the edge could possibly have done it.\\" Sources told the San Francisco Chronicle that pine cones and sticks that might have been thrown at Tatiana had been found and which could not have landed in the vicinity naturally. Paul Dhaliwal later said that the three had yelled and waved at the tiger. According to early news sources, the Dhaliwal brothers had slingshots on them at the time of the attack. In later reports, the police denied that slingshots were found in the victims' car or at the zoo. Zoo visitor Jennifer Miller and her family allegedly saw the group of men, including an unidentified fourth person, taunting lions less than an hour before the tiger attack. She later identified Carlos Sousa as being part of the group but said Sousa did not join in the taunting. An attorney representing the Dhaliwal brothers stated that they had not taunted the tiger. In early January 2008, the lead investigator for the city said that the men may have harassed Tatiana, but no charges were filed against them for such behavior. Taunting a zoo animal is a misdemeanor in San Francisco. Toxicology reports disclosed in mid-January indicated a blood alcohol level of 0.16 for 19 year old Amritpal Dhaliwal, twice the legal limit for operating a motor vehicle, and that alcohol was also present but under the legal limits for Kulbir Dhaliwal, 23, and for Carlos Sousa, 17. There was also evidence of cannabis use amongst all three. Reporters also noted that \\"[p]olice found a small amount of marijuana in Kulbir Dhaliwal's 2002 BMW, which the victims drove to the zoo, as well as a partially filled bottle of vodka, according to court documents.\\" The San Francisco Chronicle described the attitude of the Dhaliwals as \\"hostile\\" to the police following the attack, reporting that they initially refused to identify themselves or Carlos Sousa to the police, refused to give interviews to the police until two days after the attack, and would not speak publicly about the details of what happened to them.Tiger survivor told dead youth's mother \\"We didn't do nothing\\", San Francisco Chronicle =Changes= The updated tiger enclosures On February 16, 2008, the zoo re-opened the exterior tiger exhibit which was extensively renovated to meet the extension of the concrete moat wall up to the minimum height of 16 feet 4 inches from the bottom of the moat, installation of glass fencing on the top of the wall to extend the height to 19 feet, and installation of electrified \\"hotwire\\".S.F.

Contrasted with the original open form of the surgery, it does not make a large incision but instead uses fiber optics and miniaturization. The laparoscopic and open forms of radical prostatectomy physically remove the entire prostate and reconstruct the urethra directly to the bladder. Laparoscopic radical prostatectomy and open radical prostatectomy differ in how they access the deep pelvis and generate operative views. In contrast to open radical prostatectomy, the laparoscopic radical prostatectomy makes no use of retractors and does not require that the abdominal wall be parted and stretched for the duration of the operation. __TOC__ Medical uses A few good studies exist looking at open versus laparoscopic versus laparoscopic and robotic radical prostatectomy in cancer as of 2011. There is a robotic and non robotic version. These two versions have unclear differences in cancer related outcomes The American Cancer Society states that success with laparoscopic technique is determined by surgeon experience and focus. There is a long learning curve for the robotic procedure. It is estimated that about 60 cases need to be performed by a surgeon to be comfortable with the procedure and about 250 cases to be an expert. The procedure takes at least five hours and as long as eight hours for the average urologist, without a bilateral lymph node dissection, compared to 2.5‚Äì3 hours when done by an open technique with an incision, with a completed lymph node dissection. There is a greater risk of accidentally incising into the prostate, resulting in \\"margin positivity,\\" i.e. leaving cancer within the patient, in otherwise organ confined disease, even in the hands of experts. This is presumed to happen as a result of the lack of tactile sensation. Margin positivity is strongly correlated with PSA recurrences and a fourfold annual increase in cancer recurrence compared to men with negative surgical margins. There was a recent study from the University of Michigan by Hollenbeck et al. (Urology 2007; 70: 96-100) after their first 200 cases that they were able to eliminate extensive positive margins (12% in their first 15 cases versus 2% after performing 81 cases) but they continued to have a positive surgical margin rate of 22%. Their conclusion was \\"It seems that cumulative surgeon volume beyond that which can be obtained in the typical urology practice may be needed to obtain ideal margin rates with this new technology.\\"Patrick C. Walsh M.D in an editorial comment in the Journal of Urology, commenting on this article, compared his own experience at Johns Hopkins with organ confined disease with a positive surgical margin rate of only 1.8%. Another problem in higher-risk cases is that many surgeons using the robotic technique do not perform a lymph node dissection, as it is difficult to perform this adequately, robotically. The rationale usually given is that patient selection is such that most patients with Gleason score 6 on pathology do not need a lymphadenectomy. However, a small number of patients with Gleason 6 adenocarcinoma of the prostate are upgraded to Gleason 7 on final pathology. Any micrometastases in lymph nodes would not be detected, not be removed and would increase the risk of recurrences. There has not been any evidence in the urologic literature showing a benefit in regard to continence, potency or cure rates with the robotic procedure. Interest in the procedure is often patient driven, by patients who have been led to believe by the extensive advertising, that there are significant benefits to be obtained from the procedure. The open radical prostatectomy is still the \\"gold standard.\\" 2008 studies There was a study in the Journal of Clinical Oncology from Harvard\\"Utilization and Outcomes of Minimally Invasive Radical Prostatectomy.\\" Jim C.Hu et al. Volume 26. Number 14. May 10, 2008. Page 2278-2284 using a national random sample of Medicare patients, showing that patients who had a laparoscopic/robotic radical prostatectomy underwent hormonal therapy in more than 25% of cases after the procedure compared to an open radical prostatectomy [this is usually not necessary with open radical prostatectomy if all the cancer has been removed and is usually less than 10% of cases], with a high risk of secondary procedures for bladder neck contracture [40% greater risk] which can result in poorer continence. In an accompanying editorial in the journal commenting on this article\\"Radical Prostatectomy by Open or Laparoscopic/Robotic Techniques: an Issue of Surgical Device or Surgical Expertise?\\" Journal of Clinical Oncology. Volume 26. Number 14. May 10, 2008. Page 2248-2249 (Note: over 9 years ago) Michael L.Blute, M.D. of the Mayo Clinic wrote that \\"Patient interest in robotic assisted radical prostatectomy has been the result of a highly successful marketing campaign with the resultant consumer demand. Patients have been led to believe that hospital and recovery times are shorter and outcomes are better, a study has shown this expectation not to be the case.\\" He also wrote \\"Currently, open technique is the state-of-the-art procedure in experienced hands, as the long-term results for laparoscopic/robotic assisted radical prostatectomy do not exist.

However, dental anxiety is indicative of a state of apprehension that something dreadful is going to happen in relation to dental treatment, and it is usually coupled with a sense of losing control. Similarly, dental phobia denotes a severe type of dental anxiety, and is characterised by marked and persistent anxiety in relation to either clearly discernible situations or objects (e.g. drilling, local anaesthetic injections) or to the dental setting in general. The term ‚Äòdental fear and anxiety‚Äô (DFA) is often used to refer to strong negative feelings associated with dental treatment among children, adolescents and adults, whether or not the criteria for a diagnosis of dental phobia are met. Dental phobia can include fear of dental procedures, dental environment or setting, fear of dental instruments or fear of the dentist as a person. People with dental phobia often avoid the dentist and neglect oral health, which may lead to painful dental problems and ultimately force a visit to the dentist. The emergency nature of this appointment may serve to worsen the phobia. This phenomenon may also be called the cycle of dental fear. Dental anxiety typically starts in childhood. There is the potential for this to place strains on relationships and negatively impact on employment. Signs and symptoms As with all types of fear and phobias, dental fear can manifest as single or combination of emotional, physiological, cognitive and behavioural symptoms. Emotional response * Feeling of fear * Feeling of anxiety * Apprehension * Panic Physiological response * Increased heart rate * Breathlessness * Sweating * Nausea * Shaking Cognitive response * \\"I don't like the feeling of this...\\" * \\"I am choking to death\\" * \\"I am having a heart attack\\" * \\"I am going to die\\" Behavioural response * Agitation * High vigilance  Cause  Research suggests that there is a complex set of factors that lead to the development and maintenance of significant dental anxiety or dental phobia, which can be grouped as genetic, behavioural and cognitive factors. In comparison to other phobias, literature on odontophobia is relatively limited. There are several theories been proposed, however a 2014 review describes 5 pathways which relate specifically to development dental fear and anxiety: Cognitive Conditioning, Vicarious, Verbal Threat, Informative, and Parental. It is important to note, however, that there may be a variety of background factors common to all general fear and anxiety conditions that may be at play and affect these more specific pathways. Conditioning Conditioning is defined as the process by which a person learns through personal experience that an event or stimulus will result in a detrimental outcome, e.g. \\"if I visit the dentist, it is going to be sore\\". As, expected dental fear is associated with previous traumatic experiences, especially their first one. It is believed to be the most commonly used pathway for patients to develop dental fear and anxiety. Informative This indirect pathway relates to fear acquisition through gaining information and becoming bias to the dental environment from dental phobic elders, negative connotations advertised by media (e.g. television, movies), and friends with personal negative experiences. Vicarious The vicarious pathway suggests that fear is acquired through imagination of the feelings, experience or actions of another person. Whether this pathway occurs on its own or in combination with others is still unknown. It has been suggested that dental fear in the very young is passed through this pathway through observation of expressions of fear by elders/parents at the dentist. Verbal threat This pathway can be seen as similar to the informative pathway, however it is more reliant on the emotion of fear elicited by \\"word of mouth\\" and is heavily modulated by the messenger. In essence the verbal threat pathway is the fear induced when an authority figure threatens an individual with a painful experience. In the case of dental fear, the painful and/or negative experiences linked to dental visits. Although, at a glance, the verbal threat and informative pathway are similar, in odontophobia the two pathways differ in that the verbal threat pathway occurs when a ‚Äúvisit to the dentist‚Äù is literally used as a form of punishment for bad behaviour. This does not occur in the informative pathway. Parental modelling There is a significant relationship between child and parental dental fear, especially that of the mothers. it has been suggested that this relationship is strongest in children 8 years or younger. However, it is important to note the parental modelling pathway may overlap with the informative or vicarious pathways are all linked in some way.  Diagnosis  Several methods have been developed to diagnose dental fear and anxiety. In addition to identifying the patients with dental fear, different categories of dental fear have been established. These include: *Dental fear survey (DFS) which incapsulates 20 items in relation to various situations, feelings and reaction to dental work which is used to diagnose dental fear. *Modified child dental anxiety scale (MCDAS), used for children and it has 8 items with a voting system from 1-5 where 1 is not worried and 5 is very worried. *The index of dental anxiety and fear (IDAF-4C+), used for adults and it is separated into 8 item module and then a further 10 item module. *Corahs dental anxiety scale 1-4 questions and then 1-26 question. This scale has a ranking system and the second section with 26 questions has 1-4 options ranging from 'low' to 'don't know' which is used to assess dental concern. The first section with 1-4 questions has 5 Likert scale options which are worth 1-5 points with the possible amount of maximum points is 20. Then depending on the result you rate the dental anxiety. 9-12 being moderate 13-14 being high, and 15-20 being severe. *Spielberger State Trait Anxiety Index (STA): an instrument for measuring anxiety in adults. It differentiates between temporary condition of ‚Äústate anxiety‚Äù and the more general and long-lasting quality of ‚Äútrait anxiety‚Äù. It can also help differentiate between anxiety and depression *Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI): a 16-item scale that focuses on apprehension about the symptoms of anxiety itself *Seattle System: consists of four diagnostic types in which such individuals are categorised according to the main source of their dear regarding dental treatment Type 1: simple conditioned phobia‚Äîfear of dental procedures Type 2: fear of catastrophe‚Äîanxiety about somatic reactions during dental treatment e.g. fainting, panic attack, heart attack Type 3: Generalized anxiety‚Äînervous person in general Type 4: distrust of dentists‚Äîfear of the dentist Management Dental fear varies across a continuum, from very mild fear to severe. Therefore, in a dental setting, it is also the case where the technique and management that works for one patient might not work for another. Some individuals may require a tailored management and treatment approach. The management of people with dental fear can be done using shorter term methods such as hypnosis and general anesthetic, or longer term methods such as cognitive behavioral therapy and the development of coping skills. Short term methods have been proven to be ineffective for long-term treatment of the phobia, since many return to a pattern of treatment avoidance afterwards. Psychological approaches are more effective at maintaining regular dental care, but demand more knowledge from the dentist and motivation from the patient Similarly, distraction techniques can also be utilised to divert the patient's attention to allow them to avoid supposed negativity and be more comfortable. This can be achieved through television or movies, or a physical distraction such as focusing on another body part such as wiggling the toes or fingers. = Psychocognitive = Modelling Modelling is a form of psycho-behavioural therapy used to alleviate dental fear. Commonly used in paediatric dentistry, it involves the showing of a procedure under a simulated environment. It allows the patient to observe the behaviour of a friend, family member, or other patient when put in a similar situation, therefore, accommodating for the learning of new coping mechanisms. Modelling can be presented live using a parent or actor as well as virtually through pre- recorded films.  Tell-Show-Do  Tell-show-do is a common non- pharmacological practice used to manage behaviour such as dental fear, especially in paediatric dentistry. The purpose of this intervention is to promote a positive attitude towards dentistry and to build a relationship with the patient to improve compliance. The patient is gradually introduced to the treatment. Firstly, the dentist ‚Äútells‚Äù the patient what the dental procedure will be using words. In ‚Äòshow‚Äô phase, the patient is familiarized with dental treatment using demonstrations. Lastly, in ‚Äòdo‚Äô phase, the dentist proceeds with the treatment following the same procedure and demonstrations illustrated to the patient. Behavioural techniques A technique known as behavioral control involves the person giving a signal to the clinician when to stop the procedure. This could be simply raising a hand to let the clinician know, however, the signal that is chosen will be discussed prior. This technique provides the people with a sense of control over the appointment and as so, instills trust in the dentist. Cognitive behavioural therapy Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) appears to decrease dental fear and improve the frequency people go to the dentist. Other measures that may be useful include distraction, guided imagery, relaxation techniques, and music therapy. Behavior techniques are believed to be sufficient for the majority of people with mild anxiety.Department of Health. Salaried Primary Dental Care Services: Toolkit for Commissioners. p9. London: Department of Health, 2009 The quality of the evidence to support this, however, is low.  Environment changes  It has been suggested that the ambience created by the dental practice can play a significant role in initiating dental fear and anxiety by triggering sensory stimuli. It has been suggested that the front of house staff, e.g. receptionist and dental nurses contribute to elicit a better cognitive and emotional experience for anxious patients by showing a positive and caring attitude and by adopting good communication techniques. Anxious patients should not be made to wait too long in waiting rooms, so that they have less time to recall and absorb negative feelings. There is some small evidence that the waiting areas with soft music playing and dimmer lights and cooler in temperature produces a more calming effect. It as also been stipulated that masking strong clinical smells like eugenol with more pleasant smells can help to reduce anxiety, however this is more likely to be effective in moderate rather than severe anxiety. Hypnosis Hypnosis may be useful in certain people. Hypnosis may improve a person's level of cooperation and decrease gagging. Progressive muscle relaxation Ideally done in a sitting position, this relaxation technique for certain muscle groups can be implemented in the waiting room. The major muscles groups include *feet, calves, thighs, and buttocks *hands, forearms, and biceps *chest, stomach, and lower back; and *head, face, throat, and shoulders The steps according to Edmund Jacobson are as follows: # Gently inhale, hold and exhale, being aware of the rise and fall of the chest. # Slightly extend and stretch toes towards knees, hold briefly and then let go. Recognize the difference in sensation. # Press heels of feet into the floor, hold and let go. # Press knees together hold briefly before letting them drift apart. Be aware of the change. # Squeeze buttocks together, hold before letting go. # Pull in stomach muscles towards the spine, hold briefly before releasing. Feel the difference. # Gently pull shoulders towards ears, enough to feel some tension in them, hold briefly before letting go. # Press upper arms and elbows into sides of the body, hold and then let go. Recognize a difference in feeling. # Gently clench hands, hold and let go. # Extend head forward slightly, hold briefly before releasing the tension and allowing for the head to return to the resting position. # Press the lips together before letting go until they are barely touching. Purse lips and let go, feeling the tension being let go. # Push the tongue to the roof of the mouth, hold briefly before letting it drop loosely.  Systematic desensitisation  Desensitisation in dentistry refers to the gradual exposure of a new procedure to the patient in order to calm their anxiety. It is based on the principle that a patient can overcome their anxiety if they are gradually exposed to the feared stimuli, whether imagined or real, in a controlled and systematic way. Exposure to the feared stimuli or situation is recognised as a central treatment component for specific phobias. =Medication = Pharmacological techniques to manage dental fear range from conscious sedation to general anaesthesia; these are often used and work best in conjunction with behavioural (non-pharmacological) techniques.  Premedication  Premedication refers to medication given prior to initiation of dental treatment. Benzodiazepines, a class of sedative drugs, are commonly used as premedication, in the form of a tablet, to aid anxiety management before dental treatment. Benzodiazepines are however addictive and subject to abuse, therefore only the minimum number of tablets required should be prescribed. Patients may also be required to be accompanied to their dental appointment by an escort. In the UK, temazepam used to be the drug of choice however, lately, midazolam has become much more popular. In children, a recent meta-analysis comparing oral midazolam against placebo showed some improvement in co-operation in children using midazolam. One of the disadvantages of oral premedication is that it is not titratable (i.e. it is difficult to adjust the dose to control the level of sedation desired) and therefore this technique should be only be used when other titratable sedation techniques are inappropriate.  Conscious sedation  Conscious sedation refers to the use of a single or combination of drugs to help relax and reduce pain during a medical or dental procedure. There are a range of techniques and drugs that can be used ; these need to be tailored to the individual need of the patient taking into account the medical history, the skill and training of the dentist/sedationist and the facilities and equipment available.  General anaesthesia  General anaesthesia for dentistry can only be carried out in a hospital setting. The use of general anaesthesia to reduce the pain and anxiety associated with dental treatment should be discouraged and general anaesthesia should be undertaken only when absolutely necessary.  Epidemiology  Individuals who are highly anxious about undergoing dental treatment comprise approximately one in six of the population. Middle aged women appear to have higher rates of dental anxiety compared to men.

Early life and education Kenessey (full name in Hungarian: kenesei Kenessey Albert L√°szl√≥; in English: Albert L√°szl√≥ Kenessey de Kenese) was born on 27 April 1889 in Budapest as the second child, first son of B√©la Kenessey and Ilona V√°gfalvy. When he was 5 years old his father was appointed rector of the Theological University in the then-Hungarian city of Kolozsv√°r (after 1918 Cluj in Romania, since 1974 Cluj-Napoca), so the family moved to Transylvania (in 1910 Kenessey's father was to become bishop of Transylvania). In 1900 Kenessey's mother died, and he and his sister were raised by their grandmother, an exceptionally strict and demanding woman. After gymnasium Albert Kenessey began his study of medicine at the University of Kolozsv√°r. He wrote his doctoral thesis on animal studies of vascular surgery with Prof. K√°lm√°n Buday as supervisor. On May 2, 1913, he was awarded his doctorate, \\"sub auspicis regis\\", under the patronage of the king. This indicated that from the first year of elementary school until the last examination at the university he always received the best possible marks. In recognition of this, the minister of culture and sciences, B√©la Jankovics, presented him with a ring showing the letters FJ and a crown set in diamonds on blue enamel and surrounded with diamonds (FJ stood for Franz Joseph, Emperor of Austria and King of Hungary in the Austro-Hungarian monarchy). In connection with this, the young Kenessey was expected to request an audition with the King in order to thank for the ring, a request that was usually granted, but in this case, possibly due to the tense political situation and/or the advanced age of the monarch, the occasion did not materialize, to Kenessey's later regret. Kenessey had decided to become a surgeon and he started working as assistant- in-training at the surgical clinic of Budapest. When in 1914 the First World War broke out he had to go to the front. He soon earned the Signum Laudis award for bravery but in 1915 he contracted typhoid fever. He was sent home to Kolozsv√°r where for weeks he fought a life-and-death struggle against the disease in an era without antibiotics. He survived, but barely. He lost half of his weight and developed thrombosis in his right leg, the consequences of which plagued him for the rest of his life. After his recovery he worked for some time in a hospital at the Italian front. After the war he went to Budapest and worked in the Rokus Hospital where he finished his surgical training. Life and work After working as a surgeon for several years in Budapest, in 1925 Kenessey moved to the city of Balassagyarmat in the north of Hungary (on the border with Slovakia) as the director and Surgeon-in-Chief of the hospital in that city.V√°rosi √öjs√°g Balassagyarmat In 1926 he married Ida Gizella Koltai (1906-1988), daughter of a well-to-do lawyer in that city. The couple soon had three children: Ilona (1927-2015), B√©la (1929-2018), and Mikl√≥s (1933-2017). In the 19 years between 1925 and 1944 he transformed the rather decrepit, small hospital to one of the best-known, most respected hospitals of the country with 1000 beds. In 1935, he became Medical Counsellor (Eg√©szs√©g√ºgyi F√∂tan√°csos) to the Hungarian government. During the final year of World War II, with Sovjet and German troops battling along a front line that ran close to Balassagyarmat, the hospital was severely damaged and Kenessey had to work under very primitive conditions. In the following years, while no longer director of the hospital, he continued to work as chief of the surgical unit and contributed in a major way to the rebuilding of the hospital. Kenessey retired as Surgeon-in-Chief in 1960, when he was 71 years old, but continued to work in the outpatients clinic until 1971, when he was 82 years old. In the last years of his life he became almost blind. He spent his days listening to classical music. On the 31st of January 1973 he died of heart failure. Honours and awards; politics; standing in society Kenessey received several major honours, and his stature was notably neutral to politics: the Horthy administration called him the incarnation of their ideals, while the communist regime gave him the title Merited Physician of the Hungarian People‚Äôs Republic. He was never a member of a political party and was never known to have attended a political meeting. However, in 1944 he publicly protested the treatment of the Jews at the hands of the German war- time administration in occupied Hungary, citing unacceptable hygienic conditions in the ghetto. During his whole career he was very much loved and respected, by patients and colleagues alike. He was said to have exquisite bedside manners. In 1971 Kenessey became Honorary Freeman of the city of Balassagyarmat. In 1969, for his 80th birthday, Kenessey was bestowed the Gold Medal of the Order of Labour. Post-humously, the hospital in Balassagyarmat was named after him, and one of the streets in Balassagyarmat bears his name. A small exhibit in the local museum, and a plaque on the house where he lived, also pay tribute to him.

It has also been called the Forest Rights Act, the Tribal Rights Act, the Tribal Bill, and the Tribal Land Act. The law concerns the rights of forest-dwelling communities to land and other resources, denied to them over decades as a result of the continuance of colonial forest laws in India. Supporters of the Act claim that it will redress the \\"historical injustice\\" committed against forest dwellers, while including provisions for making conservation more effective and more transparent. The demand for the law has seen massive national demonstrations involving hundreds of thousands of people. However, the law has also been the subject of considerable controversy in the English press in India. Opponents of the law claim it will lead to massive forest destruction and should be repealed (see below). A little over one year after it was passed, the Act was notified into force on 31 December 2007. On 1 January 2008, this was followed by the notification of the Rules framed by the Ministry of Tribal Affairs to supplement the procedural aspects of the Act.Ministry of Tribal Affairs  Background  India's forests are home to hundreds of millions of people, including many Scheduled Tribes, who live in or near the forest areas of the country. Nearly 250 million people live in and around forests in India, of which the estimated indigenous Adivasi or tribal population stands at about 100 million. To put these numbers in perspective, if considered a nation by themselves, they would form the 13th largest country in the world, even though they cannot be depicted as representing any singular, monolithic culture. Forests provide sustenance in the form of minor forest produce, water, grazing grounds and habitat for shifting cultivation. Moreover, vast areas of land that may or may not be forests are classified as \\"forest\\" under India's forest laws, and those cultivating these lands are technically cultivating \\"forest land\\". Forest Rights Act is also known as Community Forest Management (CFM) in Telangana. Since time immemorial, the tribal communities of India have had an integral and close-knit relationship with the forests and have been dependent on the forests for livelihoods and existence. The relationship was mutually beneficial and not one-sided. However, rights were rarely recognized by the authorities and in the absence of real ownership of the land, the already marginalized local dwellers suffered.http://greencleanguide.com/2012/12/16/forest-rights-act-part-1-2/ The reason for this latter phenomenon is India's forest laws. India's forests are governed by two main laws, the Indian Forest Act, 1927 and the Wild life (Protection) Act, 1972. The former empowers the government to declare any area to be a reserved forest, protected forest or village forest. The latter allows any area to be constituted as a \\"protected area\\", namely a national park, wildlife sanctuary, tiger reserve or community conservation area.Legislations on Environment, Forests and Wildlife, from Ministry of Environment and Forests, Under these laws, the rights of people living in or depending on the area to be declared as a forest or protected area are to be \\"settled\\" by a \\"forest settlement officer.\\" This basically requires that officer to enquire into the claims of people to the land, minor forest produce, etc., and, in the case of claims found to be valid, to allow them to continue or to extinguish them by paying compensation. Studies have shown that in many areas this process either did not take place at all or took place in a highly faulty manner. Thus 82.9% of the forest blocks in undivided Madhya Pradesh had not been settled as of December 2003, while all the hilly tracts of Odisha were declared government forests without any survey.\\"Bad in Law\\", Madhu Sarin, World Bank website In Odisha, around 40% of the government forests are \\"deemed reserved forests\\" which have not been surveyed.\\"Dispossessed and displaced: A brief paper on tribal issues in Orissa\\", Kundan Kumar, Vasundhara Those whose rights are not recorded during the settlement process are susceptible to eviction at any time. This \\"legal twilight zone\\" leads to harassment, evictions, extortion of money and sexual molestation of forest dwellers by forest officials, who wield absolute authority over forest dwellers' livelihoods and daily lives. The Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Forest Rights Act describes it as a law intended to correct the \\"historical injustice\\" done to forest dwellers by the failure to recognise their rights.The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers Act, 2006 \\"The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006\\" was enacted by the Parliament of India in December 2006.  Provisions  The Act as passed in 2006 has the following basic points. = Types of rights = The rights which are included in section 3(1) of the Act are: # Right to hold and live in the forest land under the individual or common occupation for habitation or for self-cultivation for livelihood by a member or members of a forest dwelling Scheduled Tribe or other traditional forest dwellers; # Community rights such as nistar, by whatever name called, including those used in erstwhile Princely states, Zamindari or such intermediary regimes; # Right of ownership, access to collect, use, and dispose of minor forest produce( includes all non-timber forest produce of plant origin) which has been traditionally collected within or outside village boundaries; # Other community rights of uses of entitlements such as fish and other products of water bodies, grazing (both settled or transhumant) and traditional seasonal resource access of nomadic or pastoralist communities; # Rights including community tenures of habitat and habitation for primitive tribal groups and pre-agriculture communities; # Rights in or over disputed lands under any nomenclature in any State where claims are disputed; # Rights for conversion of Pattas or leases or grants issued by any local council or any State Govt. on forest lands to titles; # Rights of settlement and conversion of all forest villages, old habitation, unsurveyed villages and other villages in forest, whether recorded, notified or not into revenue villages; # Right to protect, regenerate or conserve or manage any community forest resource which they have been traditionally protecting and conserving for sustainable use; # Rights which are recognised under any State law or laws of any Autonomous Dist. Council or Autonomous Regional Council or which are accepted as rights of tribals under any traditional or customary law of the concerned tribes of any State; # Right of access to biodiversity and community right to intellectual property and traditional knowledge related to biodiversity and cultural diversity; # Any other traditional right customarily enjoyed by the forest dwelling Scheduled Tribes or other traditional forest dwellers, as the case may be, which are not mentioned in clauses-1 to 11, but excluding the traditional right of hunting or trapping extracting a part of the body of any species of wild animal These can be summarised as: * Title rights - i.e. ownership - to land that is being farmed by tribals or forest dwellers as on 13 December 2005, subject to a maximum of 4 hectares; ownership is only for land that is actually being cultivated by the concerned family as on that date, meaning that no new lands are grantedSection 3(1) of the Act * Use rights - to minor forest produce (also including ownership), to grazing areas, to pastoralist routes, etc.Section 3(1) of the Act * Relief and development rights - to rehabilitation in case of illegal eviction or forced displacement;Section 3(1) of the Act and to basic amenities, subject to restrictions for forest protectionSection 3(2) of the Act * Forest management rights - to protect forests and wildlifeSections 3(1) and 5 of the Act = Eligibility criteria = According to Section 2(c) of Forest Rights Act (FRA), to qualify as Forest Dwelling Scheduled Tribe (FDST) and be eligible for recognition of rights under FRA, three conditions must be satisfied by the applicant/s, who could be ‚Äúmembers or community‚Äù: 1\\\\. Must be a Scheduled Tribe in the area where the right is claimed; and 2\\\\. Primarily resided in forest or forests land prior to 13-12-2005; and 3\\\\. Depend on the forest or forests land for bonafide livelihood needs. According to Section 2(o) of Forest Rights Act (FRA), to qualify as Other Traditional Forest Dweller (OTFD) and be eligible for recognition of rights under FRA, two conditions need to be fulfilled: 1\\\\. Primarily resided in forest or forests land for three generations (75 years) prior to 13-12-2005, and 2\\\\. Depend on the forest or forests land for bonafide livelihood needs. Section 2(o) refers to ‚Äúany member or community‚Äù for this purpose, and hence if an OTFD village establishes its eligibility under the Act, there is no need for every individual to do so separately.Sections 2(c) and 2(o) of the Act = Process of recognition of rights = Section 6(1) of the Act provides that the gram sabha, or village assembly, will initially pass a resolution recommending whose rights to which resources should be recognised (i.e. which lands belong to whom, how much land was under the cultivation of each person as on 13 Dec 2005, etc.). This resolution is then screened and approved at the level of the sub-division (or taluka) and subsequently at the district level. The screening committees consist of three government officials (Forest, Revenue and Tribal Welfare departments) and three elected members of the local body at that level. These committees also hear appeals.Sections 6(2)-6(6) of the Act = Resettlement for wildlife conservation = Section 4(2) of the Act lays out a procedure by which people can be resettled from areas if it is found to be necessary for wildlife conservation. The first step is to show that relocation is scientifically necessary and no other alternative is available; this has to be done through a process of public consultation. The second step is that the local community must consent to the resettlement. Finally, the resettlement must provide not only compensation but a secure livelihood.Section 4(2) of the Act  Misunderstanding the Act as a land distribution scheme  A great deal of the debate is fuelled by misunderstandings of the purpose of the Act. The most common is that the purpose of the law is to distribute forest land to forest dwellers or tribals, often claimed to be at the rate of 4 hectares per family. The Act is intended to recognise lands that are already under cultivation as on 13 December 2005, not to grant title to any new lands.  Opposition  The Act has been met with much concern and opposition from environmentalists and wildlife conservationists. Some of this opposition has been motivated by those who see the law as a land distribution scheme that will lead to the handing over of forests to tribals and forest dwellers (see Vanashakti, a group opposed to the Act, as an example). But the strongest opposition to the Act has come from wildlife conservationists who fear that the law will make it impossible to create \\"inviolate spaces\\", or areas free of human presence, for the purposes of wildlife conservation.Thapar, Valmik (23 December 2007). \\"Conflict will go up by 10000 per cent\\", Daily News and Analysis Tiger conservation in particular has been an object of concern. Interpretation regarding Deadline cut-off-date: M.Sai Sampath, Founder-President ECO FAWN Society had actively engaged in environment and wildlife conservation who also appeared before Hon'ble Parliamentary Committee suggested for incorporation of \\"Deadline cut- off-date\\" to complete whole process of identification, verification and recognition of Forest Rights to genuine tribals and other traditional forest dwellers in the country. Also importantly Mr.M.Sai Sampath had correlated decline/encroachment of forest land with the implementation of FRA 2006 in the country where the Hon'ble Parliamentary Committee has agreed the submission made and pointed an extent of 16.21 Lakh Ha of forest land encroached after implementation of the Forest Rights Act 2006, subsequently various measures were suggested by the Parliamentary Committee. (9th and 18th Report of the Parliamentary Committee on Petitions, 16th Lok Sabha). Supporters of the Act take the position that the Act is not a land distribution measure, and further that the Act is more transparent than existing law and so can help stop land grabbing.\\"The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act\\" Regarding wildlife conservation, they have argued that the Act actually provides a clear and explicit procedure for resettling people where necessary for wildlife protection, but also provides safeguards to prevent this being done arbitrarily.Truths and Falsehoods About the Forest Rights ActSection 4(2) of the Act Indeed, while concerned at some of the provisions, some environmentalists have also argued that \\"Conservationists who have stated that the Forest Bill will be the death-knell of India's forests are indulging in unsubstantiated exaggeration\\". Supporters of the Act and others also argue that the provisions in the Act for community conservation will in fact strengthen forest protection in the country. This is said to be because it will provide a legal right for communities themselves to protect the forest, as thousands of villages are already doing in the face of official opposition.\\"Understanding the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act\\" =Television advertisements= In October 2003, Vanashakti, a group based in Mumbai, ran television advertisements against the Act. This is the first time any Indian legislation has been attacked through a television campaign.Sethi, Nitin. \\"Activists Come Out With Ads to Slam Forest Act\\", Times of India, 23 October 2007. Six advertisements were run by the organisation across major Indian news and television channels, ads which continue to be available on their website. The group criticised the Forest Rights Act as having the potential to cause huge floods, droughts, and to increase global warming.Vanashakti.com They also decried it as an effort to keep \\"tribals in the forest\\" instead of assisting their \\"development.\\" In response to questions from a newspaper, Vanashakti claimed to have been formed over \\"a dinner table conversation\\" as a result of deep concern about the Forest Rights Act and the lack of media attention to it.Sethi, Nitin. \\"Activists Come Out With Ads to Slam Forest Act\\", Times of India, 23 October 2007. The television ad campaign was met with angry responses from forest rights organisations. The Campaign for Survival and Dignity, a federation of tribal and forest dwellers' organisations from several States of India, wrote an Open Letter to Vanashakti, criticising them for \\"attacking the Forest Rights Act through distortions and untruths that do nothing to reinforce forest protection, and a great deal to undermine it.\\" The Campaign also put up a website entitled \\"Vanashakti's Distortions and Untruths\\". An exchange of correspondence followed, which can be found both at the Vanashakti website and at the website on the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act\\" put up by the Campaign .  Criticism by forest rights supporters  While supporting the principles of the law, forest rights supporters are not entirely satisfied with the law as finally passed. The recommendations of a Joint Parliamentary Committee on the law were partly rejected, and supporters of forest rights have claimed that some of the rejected clauses were important. In particular, the final form of the law is said to make it easier to exclude some categories of both tribal and non-tribal forest dwellers, to have undermined the democratic nature of the processes in the Act and to have placed additional hindrances and bureaucratic restrictions on people's rights. The Campaign for Survival and Dignity described the final form of the law as \\"both a victory and a betrayal\\" in their official statement on the occasion.  Notification  The one-year delay in the notification of the Act and the Rules was the subject of considerable Parliamentary and political uproar in the winter session of the Indian Parliament in 2007.\\"Notify Rules of Forest Act, says Brinda Karat\\", The Hindu, 28 November 2007 There was also mass protests across India demanding that the Act be notified in October 2007, and in November 2007 a week-long sit down protest took place in Delhi with the same demand.Press releases on the Forest Rights Act by the Campaign for Survival and Dignity On 31 December, the Act was notified into force, and on 1 January the Rules for the Act - which provide the procedures for implementing its provisions - were also notified.Sethi, Nitin and Mukul, Askhaya, (2 January 2008). \\"Forest Act Notified, Tribals Unhappy\\". Times of India. The Campaign for Survival and Dignity welcomed the notification but sharply criticised a number of provisions in the Rules, claiming that they undermined democracy and the spirit of the Act.  Implementation  There have been numerous complaints regarding the manner in which the Act has been implemented after its notification. For instance, in September 2010, the Council for Social Development, a New Delhi-based think tank, released a \\"Summary Report on Implementation of the Forest Rights Act\\" which stated that: > All of the key features of this legislation have been undermined by a > combination of apathy and sabotage during the process of implementation. In > the current situation the rights of the majority of tribals and other > traditional forest dwellers are being denied and the purpose of the > legislation is being defeated. Unless immediate remedial measures are taken, > instead of undoing the historical injustice to tribal and other traditional > forest dwellers, the Act will have the opposite outcome of making them even > more vulnerable to eviction and denial of their customary access to > forests... both the Central and the State governments have actively pursued > policies that are in direct violation of the spirit and letter of the Act.\\" The Ministry of Tribal Affairs releases monthly reports on the status of implementation of the Act. These can be obtained from the Ministry's website.  Judgements  Recently, Sc in Wildlife first vs Moefcc has ordered eviction of encroachers on forest land, in which majority of tribal and forest dwellers were also ordered to be evicted. This order invited challenges from various quarters as in many cases request was cancelled on non availability of documents by district level committee under the act. Therefore, court agreed to review its judgement and give time of 4 months to state governments to complete the process again.

The main character is Hor√°cio, a baby Tyrannosaurus rex, created in 1961.http://www.guiadosquadrinhos.com/personagem/horacio/2020 He debuted as one of the supporting characters of Pitheco's comics in The Cavern Clan, but their solo stories started in 1963. Other minor characters appear occasionally, but Horacio's strips mostly consist of monologues and self- reflections (some of them are even entirely pantomimic), thus making him Mauricios's alter-ego. Also, all his stories are written by Mauricio himself. Some comics have also been published in Japan before between 1975 and 1982, but recently have been published again by the Sanrio's magazine Ichigo Shinbun.http://heroisnopapel.com/mauricio-de-sousa-voltara-a-publicar-horacio- no-japao/  Characters  Hor√°cio ‚Äì Of this group of characters, Hor√°cio (or Horacio in English) is the main one. He is the only character whose comic strips are still drawn and written exclusively by Mauricio, who sees him as his alter ego. Mauricio describes him as having an always optimistic view, as someone who likes to help his friends and, \\"sometimes, even the enemies. And he's got this calm, confident attitude.\\" He is kind, friendly and concerned to help people around him. He has several friends. Horacio is also a carnivore, but insists on having a vegetarian diet. Horacio has a golden heart, is cheerful, wise, and eats only \\"alfacinhas\\" (small lettuce leaves) and is one of Mauricio de Sousa's most philosophical characters. He is very disputed by the dinosaurs Simone and Lucinda, who are both in love with him. Although he doesn't have an interest in either of them, he keeps them as good friends. His biggest dream is to meet his mother. In his first stories, Hor√°cio was described as a dinosaur who lived among the humans of The Cavern Clan. He was banned from the village for eating all their food and started to search for his mother, who abandoned him while he was in his egg. In most of his comic strips, he is reflecting about existence, or similar subjects. He does it mostly alone, but he also enjoys speaking to his few friends. Unlike common Tyrannosaurus stereotypes, he is very kind and friendly. He is also a vegetarian, having his very own lettuce crop near his cave. He is also constantly running away from Lucinda. ;Supporting characters * Lucinda ‚Äì Lucinda is a natural dreamer and is constantly trying to date Horacio, who is definitely not interested in any relationship at the moment. She usually ends up angry at Hor√°cio because of his flees, but she won't stop her attempts to date him. * Theco (Tecodonte) ‚Äì Horacio best friend, a baby thecodont. * Mack Mammoth (Ant√£o) ‚Äì A baby mammoth. * Terry Pterodactyl (Alfredo) ‚Äì Terry is a Pterodactyl who looked after Hor√°cio when he was a baby, but now, he is treated more like a friend than like a father. Horacio sometimes sits on his back to fly. * Simone ‚Äì Simone is Lucinda's best friend, but at the same time her main rival, because she is also in love with Horacio. However, Lucinda's attempts to date Horacio are much more frequent than Simone's. * Brontson (Brontossauro, often abbreviated to Bronto) ‚Äì Brontson is a big and strong Brontosaurus.

History Stalybridge Rovers joined The Combination in 1894, staying for one season, finishing fifth. In 1895 they joined the Lancashire League and played there for eight seasons; they were League champions in 1900‚Äì01. They left the League in 1903 to join the Second Division of the Lancashire Combination, winning promotion to the First Division in their inaugural season. However they finished bottom of the division in 1906‚Äì07 and left the Combination soon after. Stalybridge first entered the FA Cup in 1894, enjoying their best run in 1899-00, beating South Liverpool, Stockport County and then Burslem Port Vale 1‚Äì0 in the Fifth Qualifying Round before losing to Bristol City 2‚Äì1 in the First Round proper. The club made two attempts at entry to the Football League, in 1900 and 1901. The first attempt only gained one vote. The second attempt saw them gaining the same number of votes as rejected League members Walsall, seven, but they lost out to first time applicants Bristol City, who gained election with 23 votes. Rovers folded in April, 1908, when the club became unable to pay its players. Failure to fulfil a fixture at Clitheroe Central led to expulsion from the Lancashire Combination second division. Players Famous players for Stalybridge Rovers include Herbert Chapman, who later led Huddersfield Town and Arsenal to the First Division title as manager, who played for the club circa 1897; and Arthur Wharton, Britain's first black professional footballer, who played for Stalybridge Rovers from 1896 to 1897, and again from 1899 to 1900. It is not clear if the two ever played together. Other players included former Blackburn Rovers and Woolwich Arsenal star Tommy Briercliffe, and John Johnston and Frank Thorpe, who both went on to play for Bury, where they won the FA Cup in 1903, and later for Southampton.

He helped develop the staples thesis, which holds that Canada's culture, political history and economy have been decisively influenced by the exploitation and export of a series of staples such as fur, fish, wood, wheat, mined metals and fossil fuels.Easterbrook, W.T. and Watkins, M.H. (1984) \\"The Staple Approach.\\" In Approaches to Canadian Economic History. Ottawa: Carleton Library Series, Carleton University Press, pp. 1‚Äì98.

(2000) \\"The Communication Thought of Harold Adams Innis.\\" In Canadian Communication Thought: Ten Foundational Writers. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, pp. 51‚Äì88. He argued, for example, that a balance between oral and written forms of communication contributed to the flourishing of Greek civilization in the 5th century BC.Heyer, Paul. (2003) Harold Innis. Lanham, MD: Rowman & Littlefield Publishers Inc., p. 66. But he warned that Western civilization is now imperiled by powerful, advertising- driven media obsessed by \\"present-mindedness\\" and the \\"continuous, systematic, ruthless destruction of elements of permanence essential to cultural activity.\\"Innis, Harold. (1952) Changing Concepts of Time. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, p.15. Communications theories =Time and space= One of Harold Innis's primary contributions to the field of communications was to apply the dimensions of time and space to various media. He divided media into time-biased and space-biased types. Time-biased media include clay or stone tablets, hand-copied manuscripts on parchment or vellum and oral sources such as Homer's epic poems. These are intended to carry stories and messages that last for many generations, but tend to reach limited audiences. Space-biased media are more ephemeral. They include modern media such as radio, television, and mass circulation newspapers that convey information to many people over long distances, but have short exposure times. While time-biased media favour stability, community, tradition and religion, space-biased media facilitate rapid change, materialism, secularism and empire. Innis elaborated on his distinctions between time-biased and space-biased media in Empire and Communications: > The concepts of time and space reflect the significance of media to > civilization. Media that emphasize time are those durable in character such > as parchment, clay and stone. The heavy materials are suited to the > development of architecture and sculpture. Media that emphasize space are > apt to be less durable and light in character such as papyrus and paper. The > latter are suited to wide areas in administration and trade. The conquest of > Egypt by Rome gave access to supplies of papyrus, which became the basis of > a large administrative empire. Materials that emphasize time favour > decentralization and hierarchical types of institutions, while those that > emphasize space favour centralization and systems of government less > hierarchical in character.Innis, Harold. (1950) Empire and Communications. > Oxford: Oxford University Press, p.7. The encounter of European traders from a space-bound print culture with aboriginal hunters from a time-bound oral culture. Innovation meets tradition with disastrous, long-term results. Societies that depend solely on time- biased media are oral and tribal. Although leadership tends to be hierarchical, time-bound societies may also operate by consensus. Since, in their purest form, time-bound cultures do not rely on written records, they must preserve their traditions in story, song and myth handed down unchanged from one generation to the next. For them memory is of crucial importance; they revere the wisdom of elders and favour concrete over abstract forms of thought. On the other hand, societies that depend on space-biased media such as printed newspapers and books tend to favour abstract thought and control over space. They have little regard for tradition and when compared with oral societies, their ways of thinking are apt to be more rational, linear and impersonal.See Babe, pp.72‚Äì73. The encounter of European traders from the imperial centres of France and Britain with the aboriginal tribes of North America that Innis chronicled in The Fur Trade in Canada is a poignant example of what can happen when two different civilizations meet --- one traditional and oriented to preserving its tribal culture in time and the other bent on spreading its influence over long distances. European guns used in war and conquest, for example, enabled the indigenous peoples to hunt more efficiently, but led to the rapid destruction of their food supply and of the beaver they depended on to obtain European goods. Conflicts over hunting territories led to warfare, made more deadly by European bullets.Watson, Alexander, John. (2006). Marginal Man: The Dark Vision of Harold Innis. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, pp.150‚Äì153. \\"The apocalypse of culture disorientation that Innis would come to believe followed the introduction of writing and printing, and still later followed the application of power to print reproduction, has its prototype in the collapse of the traditional Indian civilization after the introduction of iron trade goods.\\" And all this, Innis argued, disturbed the balance that \\"...had grown up previous to the coming of the European.\\" Innis (Fur Trade) pp.388‚Äì389. =Balance, bias and empire= Harold Innis examined the rise and fall of ancient empires as a way of tracing the effects of communications media. He looked at media that led to the growth of an empire; those that sustained it during its periods of success, and then, the communications changes that hastened an empire's collapse. He tried to show that media 'biases' toward time or space affected the complex interrelationships needed to sustain an empire. These interrelationships included the partnership between the knowledge (and ideas) necessary to create and maintain the empire, and the power (or force) required to expand and defend it. Innis wrote that the interplay between knowledge and power was always a crucial factor in understanding empire: \\"The sword and pen worked together. Power was increased by concentration in a few hands, specialization of function was enforced, and scribes with leisure to keep and study records contributed to the advancement of knowledge and thought. The written record, signed, sealed and swiftly transmitted was essential to military power and the extension of government.\\"Innis, (Empire and Communications) pp.10‚Äì13. Innis warned however, that such generalizations tended to obscure the differences between empires. So, he embarked on specific studies of the civilizations of ancient Egypt, Babylonia and Mesopotamia; as well as of the effects of the oral tradition on Greek civilization and the written tradition on the Roman Empire. His reflections appear in separate chapters in his book Empire and Communications along with additional chapters on the combined effects of parchment and paper in the Middle Ages, and paper and the printing press in the development of modern societies.Heyer, p.52: Heyer writes that Empire and Communications received few reviews and they ranged from \\"lukewarm to negative\\". Yet, many now see it as a Canadian classic because it \\"has sufficient detail in its analysis and originality to be regarded as a landmark book.\\" Symposium. Using the flexible Greek alphabet, Plato preserved the power of spoken dialogue in written prose. Innis thought this balancing of time and space-oriented media contributed to the cultural and intellectual vitality of ancient Greece. Biographer John Watson warns against the tendency to apply Innis's concept of media 'bias' in a mechanical or deterministic way. He writes that Innis \\"emphasizes, in dealing with concrete historical cases, the necessity of a balance of various media whose predispositions [or biases] complement each other to make for a successful imperial project.\\" Watson points out that for Innis, balance was crucial in sustaining an empire. Innis examined each empire to discover how time-binding and space-binding media contributed to the necessary balance between power and knowledge and among ruling groups ‚Äì religious, political and military.Watson, pp.312‚Äì319. As Innis himself wrote: > Concentration on a medium of communication implies a bias in the cultural > development of the civilization concerned either towards an emphasis on > space and political organization or towards an emphasis on time and > religious organization. Introduction of a second medium tends to check the > bias of the first and to create conditions suited to the growth of empire. > The Byzantine empire emerged from a fusion of a bias incidental to papyrus > in relation to political organization and of parchment in relation to > ecclesiastical organization. Innis, (Empire and Communications). p.216. Innis argued that a balance between the spoken word and writing contributed to the flourishing of ancient Greece in the time of Plato. Plato conveyed his ideas by recording the conversations of Socrates. His philosophy thus preserved \\"the power of the spoken word on the written page.\\" Plato's method of using poetic dialogues cast in prose enabled him to arrive at new philosophical positions.Innis, pp.68‚Äì69. This balance between the time-biased medium of speech and the space-biased medium of writing was eventually upset, Innis argued, as the oral tradition gave way to the dominance of writing. The torch of empire then passed from Greece to Rome.Innis, pp.99‚Äì100. See also, Heyer, pp.49‚Äì50. =Monopolies of knowledge= In his 1947 presidential address to the Royal Society of Canada, Innis remarked: \\"I have attempted to suggest that Western civilization has been profoundly influenced by communication and that marked changes in communications have had important implications.\\" He went on to mention the evolution of communications media from the cuneiform script inscribed on clay tablets in ancient Mesopotamia to the advent of radio in the 20th century. \\"In each period I have attempted to trace the implications of the media of communication for the character of knowledge and to suggest that a monopoly or oligopoly of knowledge is built up to the point that equilibrium is disturbed.\\"Innis, Harold. (1951) The Bias of Communication. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, pp.3‚Äì4. Innis argued, for example, that a \\"complex system of writing\\" such as cuneiform script resulted in the growth of a \\"special class\\" of scribes.Innis, (Bias) p.4. The long training required to master such writing ensured that relatively few people would belong to this privileged and aristocratic class. As Paul Heyer explains: The Sphinx and the Great Pyramid at Giza. Innis wrote that the monarchs who built the pyramids had to relinquish their absolute power when papyrus replaced stone as the dominant medium of communication. > In the beginning, which for Innis means Mesopotamia, there was clay, the > reed stylus used to write on it, and the wedge-shaped cuneiform script. Thus > did civilization arise, along with an elite group of scribe priests who > eventually codified laws. Egypt followed suit, using papyrus, the brush, and > hieroglyphic writing.Heyer, p.43. In Empire and Communications, Innis wrote that the ebb and flow of Egypt's ancient empire partly reflected weaknesses or limitations imposed by \\"the inflexibility of religious institutions supported by a monopoly over a complex system of writing\\": > Writing was a difficult and specialized art requiring long apprenticeship, > and reading implied a long period of instruction. The god of writing was > closely related to the leading deities and reflected the power of the scribe > over religion. The scribe had the full qualifications of a special > profession and was included in the upper classes of kings, priests, nobles > and generals, in contrast with peasants, fishermen, artisans and labourers. > Complexity favoured increasing control under a monopoly of priests and the > confinement of knowledge to special classes.Innis, (Empire) p.28. Innis argued that this priestly or scribal monopoly disturbed the necessary balance between the religious bias toward time and continuity, and the political bias toward space and power. \\"A successful empire,\\" he wrote, \\"required adequate appreciation of the problems of space, which were in part military and political, and of problems of time, which were in part dynastic and biological and in part religious.\\" He ended his essay on ancient Egypt by pointing to the imbalance that arose because the priestly monopoly over writing and knowledge supported an emphasis on time and religion, but neglected the political problems inherent in ruling over an empire extended in space.Innis, (Empire) p.29. According to Harold Innis, monopolies of knowledge eventually face challenges to their power, especially with the arrival of new media. He pointed for example, to the monasteries that spread throughout Europe after the fall of the Roman Empire. Their monopoly of knowledge depended on their control over the production of the time-binding medium of parchment useful for preserving hand-copied manuscripts written in Latin. Power was vested therefore, in a scribal and literate, religious elite. The largely illiterate laity depended on priests to interpret the scriptures and on image-driven media such as paintings and statues that depicted the central figures in Biblical stories. Geoffrey Chaucer (c. 1343 ‚Äì 1400). Innis pointed out that Chaucer wrote in vernacular English instead of Latin or Norman French hastening the growth of English nationalism. Portrait of Chaucer by Thomas Hoccleve. But the space-binding medium of paper imported from China, Innis wrote, facilitated challenges from Islam and later from a rising commercial class. \\"Paper supported the growth of trade and cities and of education beyond the control of the monasteries, and in turn of the Church and the cathedrals.\\"Innis, (Empire) pp.165‚Äì166. Paper also supported the rise of vernacular languages reducing Latin's cultural sway. Innis wrote that the Catholic Church fought to preserve its time-oriented monopoly of knowledge with the Inquisition, but eventually paper achieved even greater power with the invention of the printing press around the middle of the 15th century. Now, the balance shifted decisively in favour of space over time. The Protestant Reformation followed, along with European exploration and empire, the rise of science and the evolution of the nation-state. Characteristically, Innis summarizes the far-reaching implications of the new medium of paper in a single paragraph that starts with the Middle Ages and ends with the modern United States: > The dominance of parchment in the West gave a bias toward ecclesiastical > organization, which led to the introduction of paper, with its bias toward > political organization. With printing, paper facilitated an effective > development of the vernaculars and gave expression to their vitality in the > growth of nationalism. The adaptability of the alphabet to large-scale > machine industry became the basis of literacy, advertising and trade. The > book as a specialized product of printing and, in turn, the newspaper > strengthened the position of language as a basis of nationalism. In the > United States, the dominance of the newspaper led to large-scale development > of monopolies of communication in terms of space and implied a neglect of > problems of time. Innis, (Empire) p.216. Innis traces the histories of > parchment, paper and printing in his book's final chapters, pp. 140‚Äì217. =Western civilization in peril= Harold Innis's analysis of the effects of communications on the rise and fall of empires led him, in the end, to warn grimly that Western civilization was now facing its own profound crisis. The development of \\"mechanized\\" communications media such as mass-circulation newspapers had shifted the balance decisively in favour of space and power, over time, continuity and knowledge. Industrial societies cut time into precise fragments suitable to engineers and accountantsInnis, (Bias), p.140. and Western civilization suffered from an \\"obsession with present-mindedness\\" that eliminated concerns about past or future.Innis (Bias), p.87 Communications media that transmit information quickly over long distances had upset the balance required for cultural survival. \\"The overwhelming pressure of mechanization evident in the newspaper and the magazine,\\" Innis wrote, \\"has led to the creation of vast monopolies of communication. Their entrenched positions involve a continuous, systematic, ruthless destruction of elements of permanence essential to cultural activity. The emphasis on change is the only permanent characteristic.\\"Innis, Harold. (1952) Changing Concepts of Time. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, p.15. A B-2 Stealth Bomber leads an aerial flight formation during exercise Valiant Shield in 2006. Innis believed that advanced U.S. military technologies reinforced the American obsession with space, empire and force at the expense of time, tradition and knowledge. The crisis facing the West was worsened, Innis argued, because communications monopolies that ran the media were largely immune from outside challenge. They literally spoke the language of the masses, effectively penetrating popular consciousness and shaping public opinion.Watson, p.385. American media, with their dependence on advertising and therefore mass appeal, were extremely effective at mobilizing large audiences. Not only were Americans exhorted to buy the newest \\"improved\\" products, they were also exposed to a barrage of propaganda from political elites. Theodore Roosevelt mastered the newspaper as a communications device, just as his fifth cousin, Franklin D. Roosevelt mastered radio.Innis (Bias) p.81 The news media were also influenced by a large public relations industry that shaped public opinion on behalf of powerful interests.Innis, (Changing Concepts), pp. 102‚Äì103. Innis believed that the overwhelming spatial bias of modern media was heightened in the United States by the development of powerful military technologies, including atomic weapons. The advent of the Cold War led to such an emphasis on military preparedness that the U.S. was placed on a permanent war footing, its economy increasingly dependent on the manufacture of weapons. As Canadian scholar Arthur Kroker writes, \\"Innis's political lesson was clear: the United States was now a fully 'space-oriented' society, with no inner coordinating principle and with no organic conception of 'lived tradition,' time, succession or duration which might act as an inner check against the politics of imperialism.\\"Kroker, Arthur. (1984). Technology and the Canadian Mind: Innis/McLuhan/Grant. Montreal: New World Perspectives, p.123. Biographer John Watson writes that \\"the United States represents to Innis something akin to cultural apocalypse.\\"Watson, p.386. In an essay entitled, \\"Technology and Public Opinion in U.S.A,\\" Innis concluded that the United States depended on a foreign policy shaped by military power. \\"Dependence on organized power and a traditional antipathy to coloured peoples weakens political sensitivity, and lack of experience with problems of continuity and empire threatens the Western world with uncertainty and war.\\"Innis (Bias), p.189. Innis was among the first to suggest that the U.S. had lost the balance between power and knowledge essential to its long-term survival.Watson, pp.381 and 387. Western civilization could only be saved, Innis argued, by recovering the balance between space and time. For him, that meant reinvigorating the oral tradition within universities while freeing institutions of higher learning from political and commercial pressures. In his essay, A Plea for Time, he suggested that genuine dialogue within universities could produce the critical thinking necessary to restore the balance between power and knowledge. Then, universities could muster the courage to attack the monopolies that always imperil civilization.Innis (Bias) A Plea for Time, pp.61‚Äì91. The comment about universities mustering their courage appears in \\"The upside of ivory towers\\" by Rick Salutin. Globe and Mail, Sept. 7/07. Influence of Innis's theories Influenced by Innis's communications theories, historian Marshall Poe proposed a theory on the genesis of new media. He proposed that new media are \\"pulled\\" into existence by organized interests after inventors have already developed the technology, or prototypes of the technology, necessary to support the media. Poe's theory also predicts the effects the media will have on society by considering eight attributes of a medium: accessibility, privacy, fidelity, volume, velocity, range, persistence, and searchability. Marshall McLuhan, Canadian philosopher, public intellectual and former colleague of Innis at the University of Toronto, also acknowledged Innis's impact on his own works, including \\"The Gutenberg Galaxy\\", and \\"Understanding Media\\".

Many object manipulation skills are recognised circus skills. Other object manipulation skills are linked to sport, magic, and everyday objects or practices. Many object manipulation skills use special props made for that purpose: examples include the varied circus props such as balls, clubs, hoops, rings, poi, staff, and devil sticks; magic props such as cards and coins; sports equipment such as nunchaku and footballs. Any other object can also be used for manipulation skills. Object manipulation with ordinary items may be considered to be object manipulation when the object is used out of its socially acknowledged context and used differently from its original purpose. Object manipulators may also be practitioners of fire performance, which is essentially object manipulation where specially designed props are soaked in fuel and lit on fire. Types A man juggling five balls There are a very wide range of types of object manipulation. Each type of object manipulation has often been grouped together in a category of object manipulation skills. These categories are shown below. However many types of object manipulation do not fit these common categories while others can be seen to belong to more than one category. =Juggling and tossing= Juggling is a physical skill involving the manipulation of objects for recreation, entertainment or sport. The most recognizable form of juggling is toss juggling. Juggling can be the manipulation of one object or many objects at the same time, using one or many hands. Jugglers often refer to the objects they juggle as props. The most common props are balls, clubs, or rings. Some jugglers use more dramatic objects such as knives, fire torches or chainsaws. The term juggling can also commonly refer to other prop-based manipulation skills such as diabolo, devil sticks, poi, cigar boxes, shaker cups, contact juggling, hooping, and hat manipulation. * Juggling  Contact juggling  Toss juggling * Chinlone * Cigar box (juggling) * Devil Sticks * Diabolo * Flair bartending * Footbag * Hat manipulation =Spinning and twirling= A boy with a diabolo Spinning and twirling are any of several activities performing spinning, twirling or rotating the spun object for exercise, play or performance. The object twirled can be done directly by one or two hands, the fingers or by other parts of the body. It can also be done indirectly, as in the case of devil or flower sticks, using another object or objects. The origin of twirling can be found in manipulation skills developed for armed combat and in traditional dance. The various twirling skills have become increasingly popular with many associated with circus skills. * Chinese yo-yo * Club swinging * Devil sticks * Diabolo * Eskimo yo-yo * Fanning * Fire staff * Flagging * Freestyle nunchaku * Glowsticking * Hooping  Hula hooping *Padiddling *Plate spinning * Poi spinning * Rhythmic gymnastics * Trick roping * Twirling  Baton twirling  Color guard and winter guard * Yo-yo =Skill toys= A combination of pen spinning tricks. Skill toys are manipulative objects that is more like toys than juggling skill toys usually are toys that requires a sort of skill with a variety of tricks. Also often used as a fidget toy examples are: * Astrojax * Begleri * Kendama * Rolling pin * The Jammer * Pen spinning * Butterfly knife * Knucklebone =Dexterity= Dexterity skills are here seen to be skills which are not usually associated with other categories of object manipulation. Many of these skills use items not usually associated with object manipulation. Examples are dice, cups, lighters. * Cardistry * Card manipulation * Clackers * Coin manipulation * Dice stacking * Isolation * Knife throwing * Shuffling * Sport stacking, a.k.a. cup stacking * Whipcracking See also * Burning Man, an annual event that attracts object manipulators * Chinese jump rope * Modern juggling culture External links *Ministry of Manipulation - a large resource for object manipulation references (video and articles) Category:Sleight of hand Category:Motor control ","title":"Object manipulation"},{"id":"14894502","text":"Regional Air Services may refer to: * Regional Air Services (Romania) * Regional Air Services (Tanzania) ","title":"Regional Air Services"},{"id":"14894517","text":"≈ûaban Erden who was born in Kƒ±rklareli in 1949, is the Deputy Secretary General of the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality.

It is universal among all living organisms. Pain and fear are integral parts of this mechanism. Pain motivates the individual to withdraw from damaging situations, to protect a damaged body part while it heals, and to avoid similar experiences in the future. Most pain resolves promptly once the painful stimulus is removed and the body has healed, but sometimes pain persists despite removal of the stimulus and apparent healing of the body; and sometimes pain arises in the absence of any detectable stimulus, damage or disease. Fear causes the organism to seek safety and may cause a release of adrenaline, which has the effect of increased strength and heightened senses such as hearing, smell, and sight. Self-preservation may also be interpreted figuratively, in regard to the coping mechanisms one needs to prevent emotional trauma from distorting the mind (see Defence mechanisms). Even the most simple of living organisms (for example, the single-celled bacteria) are typically under intense selective pressure to evolve a response that would help avoid a damaging environment, if such an environment exists. Organisms also evolve while adapting - even thriving - in a benign environment (for example, a marine sponge modifies its structure in response to current changes, in order to better absorb and process nutrients). Self-preservation is therefore an almost universal hallmark of life. However, when introduced to a novel threat, many species will have a self-preservation response either too specialised, or not specialised enough, to cope with that particular threat. An example is the dodo, which evolved in the absence of natural predators and hence lacked an appropriate, general self-preservation response to heavy predation by humans and rats, showing no fear of them. Self-preservation is essentially the process of an organism preventing itself from being harmed or killed and is considered a basic instinct in most organisms. Most call it a \\"survival instinct\\". Self-preservation is thought to be tied to an organism's reproductive fitness and can be more or less present according to perceived reproduction potential. If perceived reproductive potential is low enough, self-destructive behavior (i.e., the opposite) is not uncommon in social species. Self-preservation is also thought by some to be the basis of rational and logical thought and behavior.  Overview  An organism's fitness is measured by its ability to pass on its genes. The most straightforward way to accomplish this is to survive to a reproductive age, mate, and then have offspring. These offspring will hold at least a portion of their parent's genes, up to all of the parent's genes in asexual organisms. But in order for this to happen, an organism must first survive long enough to reproduce, and this would mainly consist of adopting selfish behaviors that would allow organisms to maximize their own chances for survival.  Self-destructive behavior  An interesting phenomenon sometimes occurs in social animals. Animals in a social group (of kin) often work cooperatively in order to survive, but when one member perceives itself as a burden for an extended period of time, it may commit self-destructive behavior. This allows its relatives to have a better chance at survival, and if enough close relatives survive, then its genes get indirectly passed on. This behavior works in the exact opposite direction of the survival instinct and could be considered a highly altruistic behavior evolved from a cooperative group. Self-destructive behavior is not the same as risk-taking behavior (see below in Social implications), although risk taking behavior could turn into destructive behavior.  Social implications  The desire for self-preservation has led to countless laws and regulations surrounding a culture of safety in society. Seat belt laws, speed limits, texting regulations, and the \\"stranger danger\\" campaign are examples of societal guides and regulations to enhance survival, and these laws are heavily influenced by the pursuit of self-preservation.  Economic impacts  Self-preservation urges animals to collect energy and resources required to prolong life as well as resources that increase chances of survival. Basic needs are available to most humans (roughly 7 out of 8 people), and usually rather cheaply. The instinct that drives us to gather resources now drives us to over-consumption or to patterns of collection and possession that essentially make hoarding resources the priority.  Cellular self preservation  Self-preservation is not just limited to individual organisms, this can be scaled up or down to other levels of life. Narula and Young indicate that cardiac myocytes have an acute sense of self-preservation. They are able to duck, dart, and dodge foreign substances that may harm the cell. In addition, when a myocardiac arrest - a heart attack - occurs, it is actually the cardiac myocytes entering a state of hibernation in an attempt to wait out a lack of resources. While this is ultimately deadly to the organism, it prolongs the cell's survival as long as possible for hopeful resuscitation.  Group self preservation  When scaled in the opposite direction, Hughes- Jones makes the argument that \\"social groups that fight each other are self‚Äêsustaining, self‚Äêreplicating wholes containing interdependent parts\\" indicating that the group as a whole can have self-preservation with the individuals acting as the cells. He makes an analogy between the survival practices such as hygiene and the ritual nature of within small human groups or the nations that engage in religious warfare with the complex survival mechanisms of multi-cellular organisms that evolved from the cooperative association of single cell organisms in order to better protect themselves.

First published in 1929 by Vanguard Press, after parts of it had appeared in the Freie Arbeiter Stimme, Now and After has been reprinted many times, often under the title What Is Communist Anarchism? or What Is Anarchism?.Berkman, p. viii (Introduction by Barry Pateman). Because of its presentation of anarchist philosophy in plain language, Now and After has become one of the best-known introductions to anarchism in print. Anarchist Stuart Christie wrote that Now and After is \\"among the best introductions to the ideas of anarchism in the English language\\". Historian Paul Avrich described it as \\"a classic\\" and wrote that it was \\"the clearest exposition of communist anarchism in English or any other language\\".Avrich, p. 206.  History  The anarchist movement was under siege during the 1920s. The United States had deported hundreds of anarchists, including Berkman and Emma Goldman, in 1919. In the newly created Soviet Union, Russian anarchists were being arrested by the Cheka and imprisoned or executed.Raleigh, p. 169. In Ukraine, an anarchist army led by Nestor Makhno had been defeated by the Red Army.Kenez, p. 45. Hundreds of Russian anarchists were fleeing to exile in Germany and France. In an effort to revive the movement, the Jewish Anarchist Federation in New York asked Berkman in 1926 to write an introduction to anarchism intended for the general public. By presenting the principles of anarchism in plain language, the New York anarchists hoped that readers might be swayed to support the movement or, at a minimum, that the book might improve the image of anarchism and anarchists in the public's eyes.  The book  Berkman's work explains anarchist philosophy in terms that uninitiated readers can understand. The book's chapters are brief, and many of them begin with questions (e.g., \\"Is Anarchism Violence?\\", \\"Will Communist Anarchism Work?\\"). A number of the ideas he discusses are similar to those proposed in The Conquest of Bread by Peter Kropotkin, whom Berkman cites throughout. Berkman avoids the sort of jargon and technical language that is often used by political writers in favor of plain language. As he writes in his foreword: In 1929, Now and After was published by Vanguard Press in New York. In 1937, a year after Berkman's death, a second edition was published with a preface by Emma Goldman. A British edition was published in 1942 by Freedom Press in London. Since then, the book has been reprinted many times.  References  =Footnotes= =Works cited= *Avrich, Paul. Anarchist Portraits.

Many times these major components contain dates, casting numbers, model numbers, Vehicle Identification Numbers (VIN), stamped numbers, or codes that can match the original components that were on the car when it was new.http://www.numbermatching.com#1 Motor Mart - Matching Numbers Definition The term \\"number matching\\" (or \\"matching numbers\\") is a term used in the collector car industry to describe the authenticity of collectible or investment quality cars. Number matching generally means that a particular car still contains its original major components or has major components that match exactly the major components the car had when it was new. These \\"major components\\" are not always agreed on.Camaro Model Identification and Numbers Decoding The appearance of a number matching car likely could not be distinguished from an original car. Major components These are parts such as the engine, transmission, rear-axle assembly, and frame of the car, with intake manifolds, exhaust manifolds, body panels, and carburettors sometimes also considered.Confirming a Matching Numbers Vehicle - Automedia.com Many times these components contain dates, casting numbers, model numbers, VIN, stamped numbers, or codes that can match the original components that were on the car when it was new. The definition can often vary from manufacturer to manufacturer, as well as from country to country. Often parts such as transmissions and rear-axles will be common across a range of models and as such do not carry any stamped link to the car it was originally installed in. It is widely accepted however that the minimum requirement for a vehicle to be Number matching (or matching numbers, depending on your local terminology) is for the original Chassis number and/or Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) to match to the engine block and the data tags. Minor components These are parts that are commonly replaced due to regular wear and tear. Parts such as the interior fabric, paint, chrome trim, brakes, instruments, electrical components and wiring are considered minor components and generally do not affect the value of the car. Verification The numbers or casting dates on the major components of a car would be present and fall in a particular order.Cars at Large: Numbers Matching: A definition and explanation (Part I). For example, an engine‚Äôs assembly date would be before the build date of the car, and the casting dates would be before the assembly date of the engine because an engine assembly date (the date the engine was assembled, usually at a different location) could not be after the assembly date of the whole car. Engines are assembled prior to being installed in the car at the factory. Therefore, the assembly date of the car would have to be after the assembly date of the engine. Casting dates (the dates formed in the metal of a component at the foundry) could not be after the assembly date of the engine. And casting dates would be well in advance of the assembly date of the engine. Numbers and dates track an accurate history of how a car was built and when and where the car and the parts used to create the car were made. If a car has number matching major components it helps define how collectible a car is. Number matching cars typically will have a much greater value than non-number matching cars, because they are much rarer than non-number matching cars,Determining Matching Numbers and are seen as a more accurate description of how the car was built.What is a \\"Numbers Matching\\" Classic Car References Category:Motor vehicle maintenance ","title":"Number matching"},{"id":"14894611","text":"Vacaria is a municipality in the northeast of the southern Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul.

The Swedish Army under Charles XII unsuccessfully dislodged the Saxon Army under Johann Matthias von der Schulenburg through several cavalry charges. The Saxons had deployed in a massive square formation near the village of Janiszewo, west of Poniec. Background In August 1704, Charles XII of Sweden marched to Lw√≥w, Poland, which was taken after a brief siege. Augustus II the Strong, who camped in Sandomierz, took advantage of this by marching to Warsaw, where he occupied the city and captured 1,500 Swedes. When Charles XII returned to the city in October, Augustus II fell back to Krak√≥w. General Schulenburg tried to cross the river Oder and flee to Saxony with 4,000 infantry and 900 cavalry, but these were chased by Charles XII, who with 3,000 cavalry pursued them to the city of Poniec on October 28. The battle Schulenberg had twelve battalions of infantry and four squadrons of cavalry, a total of 4,900 soldiers whom he was in a hurry to mobilize. He took position on a field in front of the village of Janiszewo west of Poniec. The Saxons' left wing was protected by Poniec and the right wing was protected by an impassable swamp. The center was protected by a ditch with a wagon fort behind it by which Schulenburg placed his cannons. Charles XII had four dragoon regiments. Five additional regiments could not reach the battlefield in time, which meant that the king could only command 3,000 out of the 7,000 cavalry in his army. The battle began when the Swedes attacked the Saxon cavalry, which was quickly chased away. The Saxon infantry managed to hold back the Swedes' initial attack, thanks to Schulenburg lining up his soldiers in a large square formation. When the five Swedish regiments arrived in the battlefield during the evening, the Swedes attacked again. The Saxons were attacked from all directions, and the Swedes concentrated on attacking the gaps in enemy lines. The Swedes broke up the Saxon division, but the Saxons answered this with their powerful musket volleys. On this occasion, the Swedes retreated to Poniec in the protection of the darkness. The Saxons were then able to successfully withdraw from the battle.

It was formed by redesignating the 13th Support Battalion 16 May 1987 and organized into three companies: HQ, A, and B. The lettered companies were formed as forward support units. On 8 December 2008 it was redesignated as the 528th Special Troops Battalion (Special Operations) (Airborne) under the 528th Sustainment Brigade (SO) (A). Overview As part of Army Special Operations Command the unit, along with the 112th Signal Battalion, is tasked to provide full logistical support to Army Special Operations Forces forming along with several other units what was known as Special Operations Support Command, later reorganized as the 528th Sustainment Command. The Brigade Troops Battalion includes a wide variety of military occupation specialists: riggers, drivers, medics, mechanics, engineers, fuelers, cooks, etc.  History  = Operation Iraqi Freedom= Bravo Forward Support Company (BFSC), 528th Special Operations Support Battalion, supported the Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force -North (CJSOTF-N) Task Force Viking located in Mihail KogƒÉlniceanu International Airport Romania and Irbil, Iraq. The Company's meritorious achievements in connection with operations in support of the Global War on Terrorism and OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM were simply outstanding. Leading Direct Support (DS) vehicle and equipment maintenance, Supply Support Activity, medical support, sick call operations, water purification and distribution, Laundry and Bath, DS aviation refueling operations, Bare Base Engineering and power distribution, movement control operations and tasking management are just some of the notable accomplishments of the company. Upon arrival in Iraq, there were no fixed facilities available for the JSOTF BFSC RSOI and Bare Base elements rapidly established an entire working and living infrastructure for 2400 personnel in a matter of days. Once the unit landed in Irbil Iraq, BFSC's Base Support Platoon immediately began clearing land, erecting tents, building floors and multiple other construction projects. The units' Base Support Platoon proved to be a critical combat multiplier for the entire operation. By the end of the deployment, BFSC Engineers, electricians, carpenters, and ECU and Generator mechanics completed over 250 separate Jobs. On D-Day minus four, the company Supply and Service Platoon infilled two Fuel System Supply Points into northern Iraq vicinity Bashur and As Sulaymaniyah. This mission marked the first Combat Service Support Unit to enter the Iraqi theater of operations. Establishing this contingency bulk fuel storage site deep inside Northern Iraq was instrumental in the accomplishment of Combat Search and Rescue missions and Special Reconnaissance Infils. Later in the conflict, these fuel farms established a critical re-supply point for the 352nd Special Operations Group, the 26th Marine Expeditionary Force, and the 101st Airborne division. On one critical mission, the Al Sulaymaniyah operation fueled a beleaguered MC-130 so it could exfil from the theater of operations. The Bashur fuel team had already pumped 33,000 gallons to Special Operation Helicopters when the 173rd Airborne Brigade parachuted onto the airfield. By the end of the war, BFSC had received and issued over 350,000 gallons of JP-8 fuel from every conceivable source, including Air Force C-17, SOG MC-130 Wet wing, and GLOC fuel from Turkey. Supply support was especially critical during the initial phases of OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM. Initially, all available sustainment airlift was consumed with building a basic stockage level of rations and bottled water for the task force. BFSC played a critical role in advising the CJSOTF Commander and his staff on which quantities and types of supplies should be prioritized. Once the necessary communications systems were in place, the company quickly established links to the theater army material management center. This enabled the JSOTF units to order supplies using the automated supply system (SARSS). By the end of the conflict, over 6.4 million dollars of supply requests had been processed and the supply support activity had processed over 200 pallets of equipment and supplies for issue. In February 2003, Bravo 528th deployed a movement control team to Fort Carson, CO to provide movement expertise to the 10th Special Forces Group as it prepared to deploy to Operation IRAQI FREEDOM. The Transportation platoon coordinated the movement of 18 chalks of C17s and prepared BFSC 528th SOSB for deployment to Turkey. Subsequently, a team deployed to an ISB in Stuttgart, Germany where they rapidly established an MCT from an ad hoc group of soldiers. Bravo 528th demonstrated great flexibility in redirecting cargo from Turkey to Romania after the Turkish Parliament declined a U.S. request to use its bases for operations. While managing the airfield in Stuttgart, the MCT uploaded more than 35 Air Force aircraft, exceeding 400 short tons of mission critical equipment needed for combat operations. Upon completing the mission in Germany, Bravo 528th deployed to Constanta, Romania, where it established an A/DACG and became the key player in airfield operations. The company formed a logistical bridge between the Air Force TALCE and supported units of CJSOTF-N. Using the seasoned organic MCT, they trained 10 additional soldiers who then flawlessly operated an A/DACG that normally requires an entire company to run. Through long hours and hard work, the transportation platoon managed the reception of 73 C17s, 32 C130s, 10 C5s and 4 L100s, as well as a variety of commercial aircraft. The MCT supervised the off load of over 3250 short tons: 460 pallets and ISU containers, 500 pieces of rolling stock and over 1000 passengers. From Romania, Bravo 528th masterfully orchestrated CJSOTF-N's movement to Iraq as the lead element of a Joint Movement Control Center. The MCC assessed the situation, took charge, established the standard, and managed 59 chalks of C17s destined for combat. The MCC moved 2300 short tons of combat equipment and sustainment packages to Bashur, Iraq in its role as the only DS transportation executor available to CJSOTF-N, BFSC led and planned the strategic movement for three Special Forces battalions, an Air Force Special Operations group, a coalition Special Forces squadron, a light infantry battalion and multiple support assets in areas outside US control under combat conditions. Once in the enemy's backyard, the transportation platoon was the single link between the CJSOTF-N and its logistical lifeline. Bravo 528th truck squads acted as the critical link from the ports of debarkation to the CJSOTF-N for both ALOCs and GLOCs. BFSC trucks made countless convoys to Bashur, Mosul, Kirkuk, and Al Sulaymaniah, Iraq. Current Status When it redesignated into the 528th Special Troops Battalion (SO) (A) it reorganized to contain the Headquarters and Headquarters Company (HHC) and the Special Operations Medical Detachment (SOMEDD). The SOMEDD is currently aligned to contain three Special Operations Resuscitation Teams (SORT), the teams consist of a flight surgeon, an emergency nurse, three special operations combat medics, a laboratory technician, a radiology technician and a patient administration clerk. The SORT is a robust medical team that is capable of providing expeditionary, combat health support along with prolonged field care through CASEVAC of opportunity and also offering advanced trauma and resuscitative care with holding and CASEVAC management. The SORT is conceived as being adaptive and modular to provide forward support for SOF in austere locations. The SOMEDD also contains medical logistic, medical maintenance and dental assets. Important dates Throughout its short history the battalion was inactivated, reactivated, and redesignated numerous times. Officially it was constituted on 4 December 1942 in the US Army as Headquarters and Headquarters Detachment (HHD), 528th Quartermaster Service Battalion and then activated on the 15th of same month at Camp McCain, MS.

A pair of Saddle Butterflyfish found in the coral reef of nearshore water of Northeast Coast, TAIWAN It is a large butterflyfish, at up to 30 cm (nearly 12 in) long together with the Lined Butterflyfish (C. lineolatus) the giant among its genus. In shape it resembles certain angelfishes more than most of its relatives. The overall color is yellowish grey, with a large black spot bordered below by a broad white band on the back and wavy blue lines on the lower sides. The throat and the outline of the hind parts is bright yellow. Adults have a filament extending posteriorly from the upper part of the soft portion of the dorsal fin. The Saddle Butterflyfish is found at depths between 0 and 30 m in coral reefs. It feeds on filamentous algae, small invertebrates, coral polyps, and fish eggs. It belongs to the large subgenus Rabdophorus which might warrant recognition as a distinct genus. In this group, it appears to represent a distinct lineage, with the Dotted Butterflyfish (C. semeion) perhaps the only somewhat closely related species. Next closest seems to be a group including the Black-backed Butterflyfish (C. melannotus), Spot-tailed Butterflyfish (C. ocellicaudus) and Yellow-dotted Butterflyfish (C. selene), but these are already so distant that their ancestors must have diverged from the Saddle Butterflyfish's soon after the Rabdophorus lineage started to diversify.

He represented Charlottetown in the Legislative Assembly of Prince Edward Island from 1806 to 1818. He was born in Dublin, the son of Joseph Palmer. Palmer was admitted to practice as a solicitor in Ireland in 1791. He left for London sometime before 1800. Unsuccessful there, he arrived on Prince Edward Island in August 1802 as a land agent for the Reverend Raphael Walsh of Dublin, who owned Lot 11. Palmer was admitted to the Prince Edward Island bar in November 1802. In 1803, he married Millicent Jones. Palmer was named to the Legislative Council in June 1806. He resigned from the council in October that year and ran successfully for a seat in the legislative assembly. Palmer was associated with a group known as the Loyal Electors, a group critical of the island's ruling elite. He resigned from his seat in 1809, and in October of that year, was again named to the legislative council. He served as adjutant general for the militia, inspector of public accounts, master and registrar in Chancery and inspector of roads for the colony. After the death of Peter Magowan, the attorney general, in 1810, Palmer was considered as a possible successor but Charles Stewart was chosen instead. In 1812, Palmer resigned from his seat on the council and again ran successfully for a seat in the legislative assembly. Palmer was removed as a barrister in November 1816 after charges of professional misconduct were brought against him by John Hill; Palmer had been bringing forward charges of concealment of assets against Hill, who had declared bankruptcy in 1807. Palmer was reinstated as a barrister in 1819. He served as acting attorney general in 1824 while William Johnston was temporarily removed from that post. He was elected to the assembly again in an 1827 by-election but his election was overturned by the assembly. He ran again unsuccessfully in 1829 and 1830. With others, he helped establish a newspaper, the Phenix, which pressed for reforms in the administration of the colony. He died in Charlottetown following a stroke in 1833. His son Edward Palmer served in the province's assembly and, although opposed to Confederation, is considered one of the Fathers of Confederation.

History =Halifax Graving Dock Company 1889‚Äì1918= Halifax Graving Dock, 1900 with HMS Crescent HMS Fantome in Halifax dry dock, 1903 The Halifax Graving Dock Company was formed by English investors who constructed the graving dock for $1 million, opening on September 21, 1889 on the western shore of Halifax Harbour in the community of Richmond. The following year on August 22, 1890 the Halifax Graving Dock Company purchased the Chebucto Marine Railway Company Limited located in Dartmouth Cove, at the mouth of the former Shubenacadie Canal in Dartmouth. The yard built a small steam tug for its own use in 1915, the tug Sambro. Barque Noel, Halifax Graving Yard, Halifax, Nova Scotia (1890), Barque made in the Osmond O'Brien Shipyard, Noel, Nova Scotia During World War I, the Halifax Graving Dock Company's facilities on the Halifax side of the harbour were badly damaged by the December 6, 1917 Halifax Explosion, which occurred north of the graving dock. Many yard workers were killed and Sambro was sunk.History of the Halifax Shipyard and Canadian Auto Workers Union Local 1Irving Shipbuilding ‚Äì Our History The graving dock was quickly repaired and planning began to add building slips and plating shops for a modern ship yard to construct the first steel-hulled ships in Atlantic Canada. Sambro was raised and renamed . =Halifax Shipyards Limited 1918‚Äì1978= Halifax Shipyard cranes and gantries, 1942 In 1918 the Halifax Graving Dock Company's assets were purchased by Montreal investors who organized them into the Halifax Shipyards Limited, completing the shipyard and beginning ship construction in the final stages of World War I. In 1920 Halifax Shipyards Limited was acquired by the conglomerate British Empire Steel Corporation (BESCO). In 1930 Halifax Shipyards Limited was acquired by the conglomerate Dominion Steel and Coal Corporation (DOSCO).Wall Street Journal, February 21, 1921. During World War II, the company's facilities were critical to the war effort as Halifax Shipyards Limited constructed four s for the Royal Canadian Navy ‚Äì the first all-Canadian built destroyers ‚Äì and was vital in repairing more than 7,200 ships damaged in the Battle of the Atlantic.History of the Halifax Shipyard and Canadian Auto Workers Union Local 1Irving Shipbuilding ‚Äì Our History From the early 1950s to the mid-1960s the shipyard won contracts with the Royal Canadian Navy to construct four destroyers as part of the RCN's post-war fleet modernization program. In 1957 Halifax Shipyards Limited was acquired by the conglomerate A.V. Roe Canada Ltd., which had purchased DOSCO and its subsidiary companies. In 1962 Halifax Shipyards Limited was acquired by the conglomerate Hawker Siddeley Canada which had purchased A.V. Roe Canada Ltd. and its subsidiary companies. Under Hawker Siddeley ownership, the company began to diversify its contracts in the 1960s and 1970s, constructing ferries and other government contracts, as well as oil drilling rigs and drill ships for Atlantic Canada's nascent offshore oil and gas industry. Various repairs and smaller builds filled out the order sheet during this period. =Halifax Industries Limited 1978‚Äì1985= In 1978 the parent company Hawker Siddeley was placed in receivership and the shipyard's assets were held by the primary creditor, the Government of Nova Scotia. A consortium named Halifax Industries Limited was organized and reached an agreement with the provincial government to operate the shipyard. A modernization program began in 1979 with a $7.5 million mill upgrading as well as a replacement program for yard infrastructure. The floating dry dock Prins Hendrik Dok No. 4 (RDM-173), built in Rotterdam in 1933 (by and for NV De Rotterdamsche Droogdok Maatschappijhttp://www.rdm-archief.nl/RDM-NB/RDM-173.html) was purchased and rebuilt by the shipyard in 1979. It was renamed Scotiadock and complemented the existing graving dock for ship repair and construction. In 1983 a new Panamax floating dry dock was purchased, having been built in 1982 by Marine Industries Limited in Sorel, Quebec. It was named Novadock and gave the shipyard the ability to repair the largest-sized ships on the eastern seaboard. =Halifax-Dartmouth Industries Limited 1985‚Äì1994= In 1985 the shipyard declared bankruptcy and was purchased by a group of Nova Scotia investors who organized it as Halifax-Dartmouth Industries Limited (HDIL). In 1992, Quebec-based engineering firm SNC-Lavalin was the successful bidder for the Maritime Coastal Defence Vessel Project which would build what is today known as the . SNC-Lavalin sub-contracted HDIL for the ship design and construction of the twelve vessels. =Halifax Shipyard Limited 1994 ‚Äì Present= A Hero-class patrol vessel is readied for launch at Halifax Shipyard, 2013 In 1994, midway through the MCDV project, the shipyard's owners sold HDIL to Irving Shipbuilding Inc. of Saint John, New Brunswick who renamed the yard Halifax Shipyard Limited. In 1998, the shipyard purchased a replacement floating dry dock for the Scotiadock. The floating dry dock General Georges P Vanier was built by Canadian Vickers Ltd. in 1964. Upon purchase by Irving Shipbuilding, the dry dock was renamed Scotia Dock II. The original dry dock was later scrapped. Halifax Shipyard viewed from the Macdonald Bridge in 2013, before expansion Like all Canadian shipyards, Halifax Shipyard Limited underwent a dramatic slowdown in new construction and refit business during the late 1990s and throughout the 2000s due to changes in Government of Canada tax and tariff policies for ship owners, as well as a reduction in federal government construction for warships, icebreakers, ferries and scientific vessels. On June 27, 2003 Irving Shipbuilding announced it had an agreement with the federal government to permanently close the country's largest shipyard, Saint John Shipbuilding in Saint John. The competing Davie Yards Incorporated in Lauzon, Quebec experienced similar financial difficulty and spent much of the decade in mothball status. This left Halifax Shipyard Limited as the largest full-service shipyard left on Canada's Atlantic coast and the flagship facility for Irving Shipbuilding Inc. A handful of new-build contracts for oil rig supply vessels, a cruise ship, as well as repair and maintenance contracts for Royal Canadian Navy warships and Canadian Coast Guard icebreakers and scientific vessels, public and privately owned ferries, commercial ships, and oil rigs has kept Halifax Shipyard Limited moderately busy in recent years. In September 2009 Irving Shipbuilding was awarded a contract to build the project for the Canadian Coast Guard. The nine vessels were scheduled to be delivered by 2014‚Äì2015. In October 2011 Irving Shipbuilding was deemed the successful proponent for constructing 23 warships for the Royal Canadian Navy under the $35 billion National Shipbuilding Procurement Strategy. This merit-based competition will see the federal government enter into an exclusive contract with Irving Shipbuilding to supply the vessels over the next 20 years.Irving Shipbuilding ‚Äì Our History Scotia Dock II sunk in May 2010 while preparing to allow a tugboat to enter. Although it was subsequently raised, it was determined to be damaged beyond repair, so it was sold for scrap in 2012.

A filament originating from the soft portions of the dorsal fin rays trails posteriorly. The Dotted Butterflyfish belongs to the large subgenus Rabdophorus which might warrant recognition as a distinct genus. In this group, it appears to represent a distinct lineage, with the Saddle Butterflyfish (C. ephippium) perhaps the only somewhat closely related species. Next closest seems to be a group including the Black-backed Butterflyfish (C. melannotus), Spot-tailed Butterflyfish (C. ocellicaudus) and Yellow-dotted Butterflyfish (C. selene), but these are already so distant that their ancestors must have diverged from the Saddle Butterflyfish's soon after the Rabdophorus lineage started to diversify.

See also Old Style and New Style dates.) was a 17th-century American soldier, politician, merchant, and sailor. He was a well-known public figure in his time but is now chiefly remembered as a survivor of the Salem witch trials, of which he wrote a much quoted and studied account. Personal life John Alden Jr. was the son of John Alden and Priscilla Alden (n√©e Mullins), who settled in Plymouth Colony (present-day Plymouth, Massachusetts) in 1620, arriving on the Pilgrim ship Mayflower. He was born in Plymouth in about 1626 or 1627. He and his older sister Elizabeth are listed in the records of the division of cattle among the residents of Plymouth, which occurred on . The family later moved across the harbor to form Duxbury when John was very small, as the terms of settlement set by the financial backers of Plymouth Colony in London had changed and the settlers were free to spread out as they wished. He was a sea captain, a merchant in Boston, and a charter member of Rev. Samuel Willard's Old South Meeting House and Third Church in Boston, and held a military command during King William's War and was involved in the Naval battle off St. John (1691). He married Elizabeth Phillips Everill in 1660 and they had twelve children: * John Alden III, born 20 November 1660, died young * Elizabeth Alden, born 9 May 1662, died 14 July 1662 * John Alden IV, born 12 March 1663, had issue * William Alden I, born 10 March 1664, died young * Elizabeth Alden, born 9 April 1665, had issue * William Alden II, born 5 March 1666, died young * Zachariah Alden, born 8 March 1667, died young * William Alden III, born 10 September 1669, had issue * Nathaniel Alden, born 1670, had issue * Zachariah Alden, born 18 February 1673, had issue * Nathan Alden, born 17 October 1677, died young * Sarah Alden, born 27 September 1681, died young Alden Jr. died on in what was then the Province of Massachusetts Bay. His gravestone reads \\"Here lyeth ye body of John Alden Senior aged 75 years deceased March ye 14 1701‚àï2\\" (\\"Senior\\" in this context indicates that he was himself father of a third John Alden). The stone is preserved at the portico of the present Old South Church in Boston after having been discovered during excavations where it had been dumped after the removal of the graves. Scandals and Salem Witch Trials Aside from the witch trials, Alden was involved in a number of scandals and controversies, which featured heavily in the accusations against him for witchcraft. The only one to bring much modern attention, however, occurred in Salem when he stopped there on his return home from Quebec, where he had gone in February 1692 to ransom British prisoners captured in the Candlemas attack on York, Maine. According to the Massachusetts state archives, he had been involved in several exchanges of this type over the years; this fed mightily into controversies about the man as another piece of gossip that surrounded him was that he sold weapons to the enemy for personal profit, including Native American tribes like the Wabanaki, allies of the French in 1692. This was a time period in which colonization of Northern New England was a battlefield between Puritans, the French, and their Native American allies with high casualties, violent skirmishes, and several raids on each other. It began with King Philip's War and would not be completely over until the French and Indian War, when Britain defeated France in battle and conquered most of her Native American allies in the process of absorbing what is now Canada; the French and Indian War removed France as a threat to the New Englanders and made the French alliance with the existing tribes less necessary. Upon arriving in Salem Village, Alden knew nothing of the troubles of Salem but rather had the misfortune of having his son, also named John, taken as part of the prisoner exchange. Due to his father having been accused of witchcraft, and thus unable to return to Quebec to bargain, John Alden IV was taken to the Bastille in France, from whence he would not return for almost a decade.Baker, Emerson W. A Storm of Witchcraft: The Salem Trials and the American Experience. Oxford University Press 2014, p. 146 Alden also didn't know that one of the accusers, one of the \\"afflicted\\", was Mercy Lewis. She was orphaned in the latter half of 1689 in Casco Bay, Maine, during a raid on her village. Historians have speculated that she had an ulterior motive in accusing Alden, a desire for revenge on those she felt had failed to protect her family. Alden's second wife, Elizabeth, had ties to Maine as her father was a wealthy lumber merchant, a business he inherited through marriage. He was a perfect target. He was subsequently accused and convicted of witchcraft during the Salem witch trials in May 1692. At the time of his trial, Salem jail was already full and so he was carted off to Boston. In the coming weeks of incarceration he had been inclined not to make much of the matter, but was prevailed upon by some friends and broke out of jail, fleeing in the night on horseback. It was mid-September and his decision to run away proved wise, as evidenced by the fact that Giles Corey was crushed to death within a few days of his departure. Per some sources it is said he escaped to New York, but more likely Alden escaped south to Duxbury, his hometown in his youth and the location of many of his relatives, namely his younger brothers David and Jonathan and a very large amount of nieces and nephews still living in the town. According to the oldest traditions, when, having awakened his family in the dead of night and causing much alarm, he said in a terrified voice that he was \\"flying from the Devil, and the Devil was after him!!\\" Alden remained hidden with friends and family, until, as he later said, \\"the public had reclaimed the use of its reason\\".Starkey, Marion L. The Devil in Massachusetts, 1949 Doubleday Edition p. 180 When he returned, he was cleared by proclamation. The authorities do not seem to have searched for him with any diligence; one of the judges, Samuel Sewall, an old friend, is known to have expressed doubts about his guilt, and attended a prayer service at Alden's house in the hope of receiving guidance.Francis, Richard Judge Sewell's Apology: The Salem Witch Trials and the Formation of a Conscience. Harper Perennial 2006 p.118 As with many other accused and hanged, other judges remained unrepentant to the last, and John Hathornewho was one of the three judges that presided over Alden's casewent down in history as the \\"Hanging Judge\\" because so few escaped the noose when he presided, which makes Alden's story all the more valuable. =Narrative= His vivid first-hand narrative of the witchcraft trials was later published by Robert Calef in More Wonders of the Invisible World, and the transcript from his trial still survives. During the crisis in Salem, Alden would have been a man in his sixties. He had been a prominent member of Boston society for many years and as far as can be determined was an honest tradesman who bent but did not break the rules. He had no contact with any of the girls prior to late May of 1692 and most of his personal life was centered in Boston, not Salem. Alden recounts the bizarre behavior of the girls where they would at one moment be catatonic and then another moment would go into fits simply because he had looked at them. He questioned the judges why it was that whenever he looked at them in the eyes, nothing happened. He had his sword taken from him, because the girls said it was an object for witchcraft. He was at some point asked to go outside in the sunlight so the girls could see his face better, and the girls were perfectly capable of walking out before convulsing. The overall tone of the text suggests Alden's thoughts on the matter were that the town had gone mad: two of the three judges on the court were completely convinced by the girls' antics. He relates how he appealed to his friend Bartholomew Gedney, the third judge, to clear his character; Gedney replied coldly that he had always looked on Alden as an honest man, but now must alter his opinion.Starkey, p. 145 Alden said that he hoped in time to change Gedney's opinion again: unlike another socially prominent eyewitness, Nathaniel Cary, Alden never cast doubt on the judges' integrity, although he referred to the afflicted girls with contempt as \\"juggling wenches\\". As he noted, much of their alleged evidence against himsuch as claims that he sold whiskey to the Indians and had Indian wives and childrenwas simply gossip which they had presumably picked up from their parents.

The Italian Banca Popolare Italiana (BPI), in competition with Holland's ABN AMRO for control of Banca Antonveneta, was given an unfair advantage by Banca d'Italia's (Italy's central bank) president, Antonio Fazio. Fazio was forced to resign and BPI Managing Director, Gianpiero Fiorani, was arrested on a number of charges in connection with the attempted takeover, having been accused of using illegal procedures. Giovanni Consorte, head of the Italian insurance company Unipol, was also forced to resign due to implications that he was connected with the Antonveneta scheme and another attempted takeover of the Italian Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL). Ultimately, ABN AMRO gained control of Antonveneta and the French BNP Paribas attained control of BNL.  Italian and Foreign Interest in Antonveneta and BNL  =Antonveneta= During the summer of 2004, ABN AMRO sought authorization from the Banca d'Italia to increase its ownership share of the Antonveneta bank from 12.6% to 20%, thereby making it the largest single shareholder. On February 14, 2005, the Italian bank BPI, (known at the time as Banca Popolare di Lodi (BPL)) received permission from the Banca d'Italia to raise its holdings in Antonveneta to 15%. On March 30, 2005, ABN AMRO launched a bid for Antonveneta and a month later, on April 29, BPL proposed a merger with Antonveneta. =BNL= On March 29, 2005, the Spanish bank, BBVA, launched a bid to increase its controlling share of 15% in order to become the majority shareholder of BNL. In the same year, on July 19, the Italian insurance company, Unipol, launched a takeover bid for a controlling interest in BNL. Unipol's bid created competition between two Italian companies and two foreign banks for ownership of the domestically- owned banks in Italy. Scandal The scandal became public on July 25, 2005 when the public prosecutor's office in Milan ordered judicial seizure of any Antonveneta bank shares owned by BPL (at this time named Banca Popolare Italiana (BPI)) following an investigation that began on May 2. This case was investigated by public prosecutors Eugenio Fusco and Giulia Perrotta. Close personal ties between BPL Managing Director Gianpiero Fiorani and Banca d'Italia Governor Antonio Fazio ensured prompt authorization of BPL's requests, while those of ABN Amro were stalled. According to the Italian markets regulator Commissione Nazionale per le Societ√† e la Borsa (CONSoB), BPL had been purchasing Antonveneta stocks since November 2004 through a secret shareholder agreement and as late as January 17, 2005, but only declared a little over 2% ownership. On February 14, 2005, BPL assumed control of Antonveneta with 52% in aggregate shares of the bank. BPL had direct control of 15% of the stock and the rest was controlled through other associated companies: Fingruppo, Gp Finanziaria, Unipol, and Magiste. Fiorani revealed under questioning in December 2005, that the operation was financed by amassing money through illegal bank charges and by taking it from accounts of deceased people. = Preliminary investigation = On May 2, 2005 the prosecutor in Milan began putting together a case against unidentified persons who had infiltrated Antonveneta. The allegations were of stock manipulation, specifically attempting to influence the price of Antonveneta stock through an active misinformation campaign. Fifteen days later the prosecutor released the initial group of names being investigated. Fiorani and Emilio Gnutti were among the twenty three personnel identified. They were key shareholders of Fingruppo, Gp Finanziaria, and Hopa. The Italian Prime Minister also had these companies in his portfolio, managed by Mediaset and Fininvest, already co- authors of the inflation of Telecom Italia. Also identified was Roberto Colaninno of Olivetti, Vice President of Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena previously convicted for insider trading. On June 8 the tribunal of Padua suspended the Antonveneta Board of Directors as a result of the investigations. Meanwhile, prosecutors in Rome decided to open a case on banking sector developments and Fiorani was added to the list of names being investigated as of July 12. It was immediately clear that this was a major scandal. Three days later on July 15, Francesco Frasca the head of the Banca d'Italia's investigator's office working with prosecutors Perla Lori and Achille Toro, released the list of persons under investigation in Rome. Adding to public indignation was the publication of transcripts of intercepted telephone calls between the central characters involved in the scandal. In particular, the call in which Fazio gave Fiorani Banca d'Italia's permission to conduct the transactions was considered astonishing as it displayed such familiarity between the two banks and gave the public a greater appreciation of the full extent of the scandal. = The scandal explodes = On July 25, the lead investigators for the Milan inquiry, Fusco and Perrotti, had all Antonveneta stock held by BPI and its allies seized. Among those identified were Emilio Gnutti; Stefano Ricucci, owner of Magiste previously implicated in the murky inflation of RCS; the Lonatis; and Danilo Coppola. The seizure notice also mentioned several wiretaps which implicated Fazio and Fiorani. The prosecutors used this as proof that the inflation was illegally planned. On August 2 the judge for the preliminary investigation Clementina Forleo validated the stock seizure and directed measures against Fiorani and Gianfranco Boni, the BPI financial director. On September 16 Fiorani resigned from the Board of BPI, amid new allegations against his office. He was charged with stock manipulation, insider trading, and obstruction of the CONSoB investigation. Fiorani was further more charged with making false statements to a public office and publishing false evaluations and prospectus. The allegations were that Fiorani had personally enriched himself through financing his own bank. = The inquiry widens = Meanwhile, the scandal was discussed in political circles, with Fazio singled out as the principal culprit and there were repeated calls for his resignation. After some deliberation, on September 22 finance minister Domenico Siniscalco resigned in protest against the government's failure to oust Fazio. On September 29 the news filtered down that the head of Banca d'Italia had been investigated since early August by the prosecutor in Rome for possible abuse of his office in relation to the Antonveneta inquiry. Summoned by the magistrates, Fazio was to be questioned October 10. On December 6 the entire Board of Directors, the executive committee, and auditors of BPI came under investigation for stock manipulation. This was a new threat of an inquiry and it rocked the economic world. On December 7 Giovanni Consorte, head of the insurance company Unipol, was added to the list of those being investigated for his participation in the buying of Antonveneta shares on behalf of Fiorani.  Gianpiero Fiorani arrested, Fazio and Consorte resign  On December 13 the major charge of association with criminal intent was added against Fiorani. The inquiry was now working on three primary accusations: association with criminal intent, stock manipulation, and embezzlement. The embezzlement stemmed from Fiorani taking money from current accounts of the clients in his own bank. Judge Forleo, at the request of the prosecutor, issued an order to take Fiorani into custody. The same day Vito Bonsignore came under investigation for stock manipulation, a Member of European Parliament from the Union of Christian and Centre Democrats (UDC) party and an entrepreneur. He owned Gefip, a company that was assumed to have participated in the stock inflation orchestrated by Fiorani. However, the assumptions turned out to be groundless as, during the investigation, it was found that nor Gefip nor Bonsignore participated to such stock manipulation so no charge or imputation was carried out. On December 15 Giovanni Consorte, Unipol's chairman and chief executive, came under investigation by the prosecutor of Rome for stock manipulation, market manipulation, and obstruction relating to an inquiry into the inflation of BNL. CONSoB asserted that a pact existed between Unipol and Deutsche Bank. Fiorani, questioned on December 17, made several admissions to accumulating 70 million euros at the expense of his clients. The Governor of Banca d'Italia, by now implicated in the inquiry and under a great deal of pressure from Italian parliament, resigned his commission on December 19. His resignation was accepted by the high council of the central bank the next day. On December 28 Consorte was forced to relinquish control of Unipol as the list of allegations lengthened. According to the magistrates, Unipol would have aided Fiorani in the illegal inflation of Antonveneta and potentially received benefits from the intricate web of relationships woven with the other so- called furbetti del quartierino (?) for acquiring BNL.  The resignation of Achille Toro and the victory of ABN Amro bank  On Tuesday January 3, 2006, the prosecutor of Perugia added the name of Achille Toro, special prosecutor of Rome, to the list of people being investigated based on the accusation that he revealed official secrets. Notwithstanding his receiving a declaration of good faith from his office, Toro resigned. Meanwhile, declaring his innocence, from any allegations of involvement with the takeovers of BNL and Antonveneta and related stock activities. The official secret that Toro was thought to have revealed would have been related to those individuals under an ongoing investigation. The same day, following the acquisition of 25.9% of capital previously controlled by BPI, the Dutch ABN Amro definitively gained control of Antonveneta with 55.8% of the capital. They prepared to launch a takeover bid by the end of the month with the same terms offered the previous July, terms that had been abandoned thanks to the opposition of BPI and its allies.  The victory by BNP Paribas  On January 10, 2006, Banca d'Italia blocked the takeover bid of Unipol on BNL. On February 3, 2006, BNP Paribas acquired the 48% control of BNL that had belonged to Unipol and its associates. They launched a takeover bid of all of the stock holdings. The Spanish BBVA later sold the shares in its possession.  The publishing by Berlusconi's newspaper \\"Il Giornale\\" and his testimony  On January 2, Il Giornale publicized part of the telephone wiretaps of calls between Consorte and the secretary of the Democratici di Sinistra (DS) party member Piero Fassino and amplified the political scandal. Il Giornale is owned by Paolo Berlusconi the brother of Silvio Berlusconi, then Prime Minister of Italy. The published wiretaps, going back to July 2005, turned out to be irrelevant to the judicial issues and were not even transcribed by the magistrate. However, their publication had a significant effect in politics and the media and was exploited by most of the right wing politicians in the campaign up to the April 9 elections. On January 12, during an episode of Porta a Porta hosted by Bruno Vespa, Silvio Berlusconi revealed that he was aware of the facts regarding the implication of the DS in the issues surrounding Unipol. After repeated requests by the supporters of l'Unione (a centre-left political party) to make an immediate statement to the magistrates, the next day he presented himself to the prosecutor of Rome. He spent 30 minutes in conversation with the magistrates and Berlusconi clarified that he only told the magistrates that he was made aware by Tarak Ben Ammar of an encounter between the heads of the insurance company Assicurazioni Generali and those of Unione, in which Generali was pressured to sell Unipol their own share of BNL, equivalent to 8.7%. On January 18 the president of Generali, Antoine Bernheim, testified before the magistrate and categorically denied having been pressured to sale by members of the left party, only by Fazio. Ben Ammar confirmed having spoken of these meetings, but he also denied the allegation by Berlusconi, \\"Bernheim and me never told the president of the Council that political representatives of the left or right applied pressure.\\" On January 25 the Prosecutor of Rome requested the filing of the brief regarding Berlusconi's deposition, the relevant criminal facts did not correspond to the case and grounds for opening a libel case did not exist. No information related to the source that allowed the journalist from il Giornale to access the wiretaps. After an investigation ordered by the Ministry of Justice, the diskette containing the original wiretaps was found still in its envelope sealed the previous August. During the parliamentary hearing of one section of the Italian secret service, members of DS called upon the service to abstain from any intervention that might influence the outcome of the electoral campaign.  Gianpiero Fiorani questioned by PM judge  Gianpiero Fiorani, former president of the BPI, admitted to the public prosecutor under questioning that he made loans to certain center-right politicians under favorable conditions in order to rescue Antonio Fazio, director of Banca d'Italia. Among the measures used to gain this outcome was the rescue of Credieuronord, an allied bank on the brink of bankruptcy. It emerged during questioning that there had been cash transactions with the center-right politicians, including Roberto Calderoli of the Lega Nord and Aldo Brancher of Forza Italia. The investigation is pending documentary confirmation of these statements.

History  The club opened in January 1994 at its original location, at 63rd Street and Central Park West, with a minimal cover charge. That first location, known as the \\"Iridium Room Jazz Club\\", was a basement room below the Merlot restaurant across from Lincoln Center; it initially booked \\"traditional, swinging jazz musicians of the second or third level\\"; Ronald Sturm, the club's manager and booker, told The New York Times his goal was to \\"hire people like the trumpeter Marcus Printup, or Cyrus Chestnut or Carl Allen\\"‚Äî the goal was to give a chance to \\"younger, mainstream musicians while still booking the legends.\\" In the opening months of its existence, local, unknown jazz groups and solo artists were given the opportunity to perform in front of an audienceHistory from the Iridium Jazz Club website The original location underwent three renovations, then in August 2001 the club moved to its current location at 1650 Broadway on 51st Street. Unlike many of New York City's jazz clubs, it has remained open to the present day, with the help of some major renovations to keep up with the number of attendees. There have been many major releases recorded live at Iridium, from artists like Kenny Garrett, Jacky Terrasson, Charlie Haden, Kenny Barron, Benny Carter, The Jazz Messengers, Sweets Edison, and Clark Terry. Beginning in 1995 and continuing until his death at age 94, guitar legend Les Paul performed weekly at the club.  Critical response  According to New York magazine, \\"the Iridium does its best to recreate the halcyon days of the 1920s and 1930s. Sure, the air‚Äôs no longer smoky, the d√©cor‚Äôs a shadow of what it was and you‚Äôre sitting knee-to-knee with the European tourists at the next table, but true jazz aficionados overlook those minor details to hear sets played by some of the best-known names in the biz: vocalist Jimmy Scott, guitarist Mike Stern, saxophonist Pharoah Sanders, and the Mingus Legacy bands, to name a few.\\" See also * List of jazz clubs References External links * Official site Category:Jazz clubs in New York City Category:Music venues in Manhattan Category:Drinking establishments in Manhattan Category:New York City nightlife Category:1994 establishments in New York (state) Category:Midtown Manhattan Category:Music venues completed in 1994 Category:Broadway (Manhattan) ","title":"Iridium Jazz Club"},{"id":"14895162","text":"Victoria Public Hall Victoria Public Hall, or the Town Hall, is a historical building in Chennai, named after Victoria, Empress of India. It is one of the finest examples of British architecture in Chennai and was built to commemorate the golden jubilee of Queen Victoria. It served as a theatre and public assembly room in the late 19th century and the early 20th century. It now houses the South Indian Athletic Association Club. History In a meeting held in March 1882 at the Pachaiyappa's Hall in George Town by some leading citizens, the decision to construct a town hall for Madras was taken. This resulted in the mobilisation of a sum of 16,425 from around 30 persons who attended the meeting, and a 12-member trust was formed for the execution of the project. The municipal corporation leased a 57-ground (3.14 acres) site in the People's Park to the Victoria Public Hall Trust for 99 years effective from 1 April 1886 at a lease rent of eight annas a ground or 28 for the property. The then Maharajah of Vizianagaram, Sir Pusapati Ananda Gajapati Raju, laid the foundation stone for the new building on 17 December 1883, who also led a list of 35 donors for the construction work with a contribution of 10,000. The list included the Travancore Maharajah ( 8,000), Mysore Maharajah, Pudukottai Rajah and former Madras High Court Judge Muthuswamy Iyer (all 1,000 each) and P.Orr and Sons, a city-based watch company ( 1,400). Other contributors included Ramnad Raja Bhaskara Setupati, Zamindar of Ettiapuram and Hadji Abdul Batcha Sahib. It took about five years to complete the construction. The hall, an example of the Indo-Saracenic architecture, was designed by Robert Fellowes Chisholm (1840-1915) in the Romanesque style and was built by Namperumal Chetty between 1888 and 1890. It was opened to public by Lord Connemara in 1887, although another version suggests that Sir Mountstuart Elphinstone Grant Duff, the governor of Madras during 1886‚Äì1890, declared open the hall. In January 1888, a citizens' meeting decided to name the hall after Queen Victoria. The then Municipal Corporation President Sir A.T. Arundale took the initiative. The hall soon become a venue of important public and social events. Several eminent personalities, including Mahatma Gandhi and Swami Vivekananda, have visited the hall. National leaders like Swami Vivekananda, Gopal Krishna Gokhale,and Sardar Vallabhai Patel have addressed meetings in the hall. The pioneers of Tamil play, such as Sankaradoss Swamigal and Pammal Sambanda Mudaliar, have staged their plays at the hall. The Suguna Vilasa Sabha (SVS), founded in 1891, was most closely associated with the hall. It conducted the first evening drama shows in Madras. In October 1906, the play Kaadalar Kangal was staged at the hall. For the next 30 years, the Sabha remained at the hall and later, built its own theatre on acquisition of 36 grounds next to Christ Church on Anna Salai and now functions only as a social club. It was here that the first cinema show was held in Chennai. T. Stevenson, proprietor of the Madras Photographic Store, ran some shows that consisted of ten short films. As the city grew southward and the medium of cinema acquired greater popularity, the building gradually went out of public attention. The lease expired in 1985 and a legal battle ensued as the Corporation did not want to extend the lease. With a compromise being reached in the matter, a petition to that effect was submitted in the court and decision was taken to take action against sub- leases. The land of the hall was occupied by several organisations before the 2010 renovation. The Andhra Mahila Sabha was functioning from a building behind the hall. The building occupied 5.25 grounds of land belonging to Victoria Public Hall. The building was demolished as part of the 2010 renovation. Hotel Picnic, a private hotel, had acquired 13 grounds from the Victoria Public Hall Trust through a sub-lease that expired on 30 April 1985. The hotel has been paying a monthly rent of 4,000 to the corporation. In 2010, the Supreme Court ordered the hotel to handover the land to the Corporation of Chennai. About 32 shops that had encroached upon the land belonging to the hall were also removed as part of the renovation. The building The building is located on EVR Periyar Salai near Moore Market and between Ripon Building and Chennai Central Railway Station. Constructed with red brick and painted with lime mortar, the rectangular building has an Italianate tower capped by a Travancore-style roof. The ground floor of the building has a built-up area of 13,342 sq ft and the first floor has a built-up area of 12,541 sq ft. The two large halls in the ground and the first floors were built to accommodate 600 persons each, while a wooden gallery in the eastern end has seating arrangement for more than 200 persons. The structure consists of arcaded verandahs along the northern and southern sides in the hall on the first floor supported on sleek Corinthian stone columns, a square tower that is three storeys high, and a carved pyramidal roof. There is also an intricately carved terracotta cornice, which resembles Islamic calligraphy, atop the tower. The hall has four staircases, of which three lead to the hall on the first floor and one to the balcony, and four turrets. The Trevelyan Fountain, a memorial fountain in the grounds of the hall, was raised to mark the contribution of Charles Trevelyan, Governor of Madras during 1859-1860 and the developer of the People's Park, towards providing the city with adequate drinking water. On one side of the fountain is a bas relief of Trevelyan's head. Renovation Renovation work of the hall was first carried out in October 1967 and the then Chief Minister C.N.Annadurai dedicated it for public use. After a few years, the building remained closed for over 40 years. In early 1990s, Suresh Krishna, the then Sheriff of Madras, took some efforts in salvaging a part of the building, and restored the Trevelyan Fountain. The former Maharashtra Governor C. Subramaniam rededicated the building in December 1993. The Corporation of Chennai started renovating the hall in April 2009 at a cost of 39.6 million under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission. The restoration work includes replacement of damaged roof and work on the wooden flooring and staircase. The roofing is complete with teak wood, while Mangalore tiles embellish the building. The dilapidated cuddapah stones were recently replaced with semi-polished stones. Once the work is finished, sound and light show would be conducted on the ground floor. The first floor would be used to conduct cultural programmes. The hall would have a seating capacity of 600 persons. the work has been completed.

Political donations In 2010, Mellon donated $1.5 million to Arizona's defense fund to help cover the costs of legal challenges against Arizona SB 1070, the broadest and strictest anti-illegal immigration measure in the United States at the time of its passage. It has received national and international attention and has spurred considerable controversy. In the 2018 election cycle, Mellon was a major political donor, especially to the Republican-aligned Congressional Leadership Fund. In April 2020, Mellon donated $10,000,000 to America First Action, Inc. Super PAC.

The largess is funded by the hardworking folks, fewer and fewer in number, who are too honest or too proud to allow themselves to sink into this morass.‚Äù Mellon wrote that as of 1984 (Reagan's re-election campaign), ‚ÄúSomething had obviously gone dreadfully wrong with the Great Society and the Liberal onslaught.

Mellon filed a racketeering lawsuit against TIGHAR in 2013, alleging that the non-profit organization engaged in deceit in soliciting his money to search for Amelia Earhart's missing plane.Wyoming Man Denies Plot Against Amelia Earhart Plane Recovery Group, Casper Star Tribune (Aug. 11, 2013) Mellon claimed that the plane was already found in 2010.https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/the-obsessed-feuding-searchers- still-looking-for-amelia-earhart The Obsessed, Feuding Searchers Still Looking For Amelia Earhart], Atlas Obscura (Dec. 12, 2016) U.S. District Judge Skavdahl granted TIGHAR's motion for summary judgment in 2014, after recognizing that even Mellon's own experts were unable to confirm Mellon's allegations regarding the 2010 photographs that Mellon claimed showed the presence of the plane. Judge Skavdahl concluded that: \\"Defendants represented to Plaintiff they were planning another expedition in their continued quest to find the wreckage of Amelia Earhart's airplane. Upon reading about Defendants' efforts, Plaintiff contacted Defendants and expressed his interest in supporting the expedition with a monetary contribution. That's exactly what the parties then did. No false representations were made. The lost had not been found ... or maybe it had. Regardless, no rational trier of fact could find Defendants falsely represented they had not found Earhart's plane by embarking on another expedition in hopes of finding conclusive evidence to prove it. No matter how convinced or sincere Plaintiff is in his subjective belief and opinion that Amelia Earhart's airplane was or should have been discovered prior to the making of his donation, that belief and opinion is insufficient to create a genuine dispute of material fact.\\"Mellon v. International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery, 33 F. Supp. 3d 1277 (D.

His many students include the composer and conductor Giuseppe Sinopoli (1946‚Äì2001); the composer and teacher Marino Baratello (born 1953); the composer Claudio Ambrosini (born 1948); and the Amsterdam-based, English composer Geoffrey King (born 1949). Although not directly influenced by the legacy of Rubin de Cervin and the above-listed lineage, other Venetian composers were influential in the development of new music in Venice, namely Bruno Maderna (1920‚Äì1973) and Luigi Nono(1924‚Äì1990). Style There is no specific musical style that characterizes the music of the New Venice movement: their musics are varied and include influences from serialism (e.g., the music of Rubin de Cervin and his disciple, Sinopoli); and musical elements from jazz are evident (e.g. the music of Baratello) with a strong emphasis on modern polyphony. Certainly, their influences include the indigenous history of Venetian music, including the influence of Arnold Schoenberg and the Second Viennese School; and experimental serial and post-serial developments at Darmstadt, specifically the music of Karlheinz Stockhausen.

The grape is a variety in the Refosco family (which also includes e.g. Terrano) and derives its name from its red stems. It is found in the Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) of Colli Orientali del Friuli, Friuli Aquileia, Friuli Grave and Friuli Latisana. It is also found in the Veneto portion of the Lison Pramaggiore and in the Slovenian wine region of Koper. J. Robinson (ed) \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\" Third Edition pg 564-565 Oxford University Press 2006 In Slovenia, Refosco dal Peduncolo Rosso and Refosco are both called Terrano and are commonly used in a field blend. J. Robinson Vines, Grapes & Wines pg 201 Mitchell Beazley 1986 History Like the other Refosco grapes, the origins of Refosco dal Peduncolo Rosso are not completely known but current evidence suggest that it is indigenous to Italy. The grape was well known in antiquity and it or a similar variety was praised by the Roman writer Pliny the Elder in the first century for the quality of wine it produced. In 1390, the Italian writer Francesco di Manzano noted that wine made from Refosco dal Peduncolo Rosso was the favorite of Augustus's wife Livia. ItalianMade Vinotizie Volume 10, Number 3 pg 6 December 2004 Beginning in the 1980s, the grape experienced a revival in interest along with other Friuli-Venezia Giulia grapes, and more wines made from the grape were exported internationally. Ampelographers have long thought Refosco dal Peduncolo Rosso was related to the Marzemino grape of the San Michele all'Adige region of Trentino. In the early 21st century, DNA profiling confirmed that Refosco dal Peduncolo Rosso was a parent of Marzemino. Viticulture and wine A bottle of Refosco dal Peduncolo Rosso from Friuli Aquileia DOC. In Friuli, Refosco dal Peduncolo Rosso vines are planted in both hillside and level terrain. Ripening is a concern and the grape requires sufficient access to warmth and sunlight, which play a major role in deciding where to plant the grape. Despite being a slow ripener, the grape does have good resistance to rot that can develop during autumn rains. The deeply colored wine produced from the grape tends to be full-bodied with high acidity levels and flavors of plum & almond notes. Since the renewed interest in the grape of the 1980s, winemakers have experimented with producing more internationally recognizable styles of the grape with techniques like malolactic fermentation and new oak aging to mix results. Synonyms Refosco dal Peduncolo Rosso is also known under the synonyms Peteljcice, Refosc dal Pecol Rosso, Refosco, Refosco Nostrano, Refosco Penduncolo Rosso, Rifosc, Rifosco, Teran Crvene, and Teran Crvene Peteljcice.Refosco dal Peduncolo Rosso, Vitis International Variety Catalogue, accessed 2010-10-23 References Category:Red wine grape varieties Category:Wine grapes of Italy ","title":"Refosco dal Peduncolo Rosso"},{"id":"14895284","text":"Karpens Airport is a private airport located 9 miles east of Astoria in Clatsop County, Oregon, USA.

Ideologies held by patriot movement groups often focus on anti-government conspiracy theories, with the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) describing a common belief that \\"government has been infiltrated and subverted\\" and is no longer legitimate. The movement first emerged in 1994 in response to what members saw as \\"violent government repression\\" of dissenting groups, along with improved gun control and the Clinton government. Several groups within the patriot movement have committed or endorsed violence, with U.S. law enforcement agencies labelling some groups \\"dangerous, delusional and sometimes violent.\\"Right-wing Counterculture Uses Waco as Rallying Cry Herald-Journal April 24, 1995 The ADL and The American Scientific Affiliation has noted that groups often have connections to white supremacy, however, their connections to it have shrunk over time due to their recent inclusion of non-white members.AMERICAN MILITIAS: Rebellion, Racism & Religion by Richard Abanes, review by Dennis L. Feucht in American Scientific Affiliation. Major events in America which alarm or inspire the patriot movement include the 1992 Ruby Ridge siege, the 1993 Waco siege and the 1995 Oklahoma City Bombing.Report: 'Explosive' Growth Of 'Patriot Movement' And Militias Continues by Mark Memmott npr.org March 13, 2012 After declining from 1996 to 2000, sinking to less than 150 groups from 800, the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) found that the economic decline and nomination of Barack Obama in 2008 caused the movement to \\"come roaring back\\". History Historians of the patriot movement identify its origins in the 1980s American farm crisis. As various policies combined to drive farmers deeply into debt, groups on the margins of American politics engaged rural communities with a range of conspiracy theory literature that drew on existing traditions of antisemitism, nativism and paleoconservatism. Posse Comitatus, the Liberty Lobby and Lyndon LaRouche were prominent in these campaigns which informed and shaped the ideology of the movement that emerged. In the early 1990s, the patriot movement saw a surge of growth spurred by the confrontations at Ruby Ridge and Waco. The 1995 Oklahoma City bombing was carried out by two patriot movement members, Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols.Michel, Lou. \\"American Terrorist\\", 2001. During the 1990s the movement organized using \\"gun shows and the Internet\\". The movement was highly active in the mid-1990s, and at a peak in 1996 contained around 800 separate groups. It saw decline in the late 1990s. In 2009, the SPLC expressed concern about a resurgent patriot movement,Militia movement on the rise - 22 August 2009 - MiamiHerald.com and the Department of Homeland Security issued a report warning of heightened \\"Rightwing Extremism\\". The SPLC attributed this growth to \\"an angry backlash against non-white immigration and ... the economic meltdown and the Presidency of Barack Obama. It reported the growth of patriot groups with an increase from 149 in 2008, to 824 in 2010, to 1,274 in 2011Right-wing 'patriot' groups girding for actual class warfare, report says By Patrik Jonsson  csmonitor.com  8 March 2012 and 1,360 in 2012. According to the SPLC, the \\"explosive growth seems to have been driven by the election of our first black president and the approaching loss of a white majority in the U.S. that he represents. Another driver is the crash of the economy, which coincided neatly with the rise to national power of President Obama.\\" The SPLC found that while \\"there are many people\\" in the patriot movement \\"that aren't engaged in illegal activity,\\" the \\"normalizing of conspiracy theories\\"‚Äîsuch as the belief that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is building concentration camps; rumors of covert plans by Mexico to repatriate parts of the Southwestern United States; and the anxiety Muslim Sharia law might become part of the US court system‚Äîhas played into the growth of the groups. An extremist member of the patriot movement carried out the 2009 anti-abortion murder of George Tiller, and some extremists within the movement also have expressed support for Joseph Stack's 2010 plane crash into an Internal Revenue Service office. The movement was connected to, and received a boost in profile from, the 2014 Bundy standoff and 2016 Occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge. Two members of the movement, Jerad Miller and Amanda Miller, killed two police officers and a civilian during a violent shooting rampage in Las Vegas after leaving the Bundy standoff; they pinned a note to one of their victims saying \\"This is the beginning of the revolution.\\" Views Various patriot movement aligned groups have frequently been described as racist, xenophobic, extremist, anti-semitic, anti-Islam, anti-immigrant, and violent by groups such as the SPLC, ADL, and the FBI.

Multiple record charts have been inaugurated in Romania since the 1990s. The Romanian Top 100 was the country's national chart until 2012. Founded in 1995, it was a ranking based on the compilation of charts submitted by local Romanian radio stations. The Romanian Top 100 was published weekly and was also announced during a radio show starting in 1998. Compilation of the list was first handled by Body M Production A-V, followed by Media Forest. In the 2010s, the chart was announced during a podcast on Kiss FM, but the broadcast ended in February 2012. Later that month, the Airplay 100‚Äîwhich is also broadcast by Kiss FM and compiled by Media Forest‚Äîreplaced the Romanian Top 100 as a national chart. It measures the airplay of songs on radio stations and television channels throughout the country. For a short period of time during the late 2000s and early 2010s, Nielsen Music Control and Uniunea ProducƒÉtorilor de Fonograme din Rom√¢nia (UPFR) jointly published airplay charts. Media Forest has also been issuing weekly radio and television airplay charts since 2009. Charts and history \\"You Are Not Alone\\" by Michael Jackson (pictured in 1988) was the first number-one single in Romania, topping the Romanian Top 100 in 1995. The Romanian Top 100 was founded in 1995 as the country's first national chart; however, it had another name until 1996. The first year-end chart was published in 1997. From 1998 onwards, the chart was announced during a two-hour radio show called Romanian Top 100 Radio Show hosted by disc jockey Adi Simion and created by VentoStudio. Aired by 57 radio stations in Romania, it was originally titled Romanian Top 100 Bravo Show due to a partnership with Bravo. From 1999, the Romanian Top 100 was compiled by Body M Production A-V with the help of a \\"special software\\". At the time, over 110 independent radio stations in Romania were considered when compiling the chart, with each submitting their own airplay statistics. The compiling process was similar to the Eurochart Hot 100. The results were sent to music specialists in Romania, among others. As of April 2001, the Romanian Top 100 had reached over 250 editions. In 2005, the number of radio stations involved in the making of the chart rose to 120, with 500 editions produced by then. The chart was included in Billboard Music & Media until that magazine's cancellation in 2003. The Romanian Top 100 significantly lacks archives for the late 2000s; at that time, Nielsen Music Control and Uniunea ProducƒÉtorilor de Fonograme din Rom√¢nia (UPFR) began publishing charts which reflected the most-broadcast songs on radio stations and television channels throughout Romania. However, it is unknown whether the two were affiliated with the Romanian Top 100, and whether their rankings can be used to substitute the missing Romanian Top 100 archives. In the 2010s, the Romanian Top 100‚Äîcompiled by Media Forest‚Äîwas announced during a weekly podcast on Kiss FM by disc jockey Andreea Berghea. Media Forest had previously begun publishing weekly radio and television airplay charts on their website starting with July 2009. Note: Navigate through the chart archives by selecting items from the far right drop down menu. The Romanian Top 100 ceased publication in February 2012, with its last edition on 19 February. The chart was replaced with the Airplay 100 on 26 February as Romania's national chart, also compiled by Media Forest and aired as a radio show on Kiss FM hosted by Cristi Nitzu. It measures the airplay of songs on radio stations and television channels across the country.

His wartime diaries were published posthumously as Am I a Murderer? (?) in 1995 by the Karta Centre of Warsaw. Biography As a child, Perechodnik lived in this wooden building in Otwock. The former Oaza cinema in Otwock, run by the Perechodnik family, later rebuilt as a theater and now undergoing renovation. =Pre-war life= A secular Jew, Perechodnik was born in 1916 to an Orthodox Jewish family in Otwock, south east of Warsaw. He earned a degree in agronomy at the Warsaw University of Life Sciences and a master's degree at a university in Toulouse, France. Perechodnik's wife Anka (Chana) n√©e Nusfeld was also from Otwock; she ran a cinema named Oasis with her two brothers. Calek and Anka's only daughter Alinka (Athalie), was born on 19 August 1940, a year after the German invasion of Poland.Sebastian Chosi≈Ñski, \\"Przez siedem krƒôg√≥w Piek≈Ça.\\" Review of Calel Perechodnik Czy ja jestem mordercƒÖ? Magazyn Esensja, nr 7 (XXXIX) September 2004 issue. Retrieved 9 October 2011. =Jewish Ghetto Police= In 1940, Perechodnik and his family, along with the 8,000 other Jews of Otwock, were forced to relocate to the Otwock Ghetto. To provide for himself, his wife, and their daughter, in February 1941 Perechodnik joined the Jewish Ghetto Police organized by the Judenrat on German orders. In early 1942, the German authorities began the Ghetto liquidation action. The Jewish police were ordered to assist in the rounding up of Jews who were taken to the station and loaded onto freight trains heading for the Treblinka extermination camp. Assured by the commandant of the Ghetto Police that his family would be protected, on 19 August 1942, Perechodnik brought his own wife and daughter to the ghetto's main square. But he was betrayed: Anka and Alinka were among the 8,000 Otwock Jews sent to their deaths at Treblinka. Subsequently, he was sent to a labour camp. Perechodnik constantly blamed himself for the death of his wife and daughter. Prior to their shipping to Treblinka, Anka asked Calek on several occasions to obtain a false kennkarte for her, identifying her as an ethnic Pole since she did not have the typical Jewish looks. Calel later wrote that she could easily pass for a Pole if she dyed her hair. Perechodnik failed to obtain the kennkarte for his wife in time, partly due to his laziness and partly due to his \\"lack of trust in such things\\". =In hiding= On 20 August 1942, Calel Perechodnik escaped to Warsaw. His father, Aryan in appearance, remained at large to support the family until he was captured by the Gestapo and executed. Calel spent 105 days in hiding with his mother and other Jews in the apartment of a Polish woman risking her own life to save them. While in hiding, he spent the time writing. The last entry in his memoir concerns his last will and is dated 23 October 1943. He then joined the Polish Underground; it was during this time that he contracted typhus. On 1 August 1944, the Warsaw Uprising began as part of a nationwide Operation Tempest. Perechodnik participated in the uprising as part of the Chrobry II Battalion.Barbara Engelking, Dariusz Libionka, ≈ªydzi w Powstanczej Warszawie (Jews in the Warsaw Uprising), Polish Center for Holocaust Research Association, 2009, pgs 184‚Äì190 There are several theories as to how he died. One states that he committed suicide by swallowing cyanide after the Uprising failed. Another claims that he was killed by pillagers after the uprising. Another account (stated in the letter of Henryk Romanowski to his brother Pesach Perechodnik, following the memoirs in the book) claims he was burned alive in the bunker, unable to get out because of the typhus. He was aged 27. Am I a Murderer? Clandestine photo showing layover yard in Otwock on 19 August 1942. In the distance, Jews sit on the ground overnight, while awaiting transport to Treblinka extermination camp. Perechodnik wrote his memoir between 7 May and 19 August 1943 in Warsaw, during his stay at the home of his Polish rescuer. When describing the German occupation of Poland he attempts to explain his own actions which were inspired by fear, but also, blames the Jews for claiming to have been a chosen people, thus encouraging anti-Semitism among the gentile population. He expresses his outrage at the refusal by some Orthodox Jews to send their children to Polish orphanages which would have saved them from the Holocaust. Perechodnik expressed his anguish and astonishment at the savagery of war. It was, he wrote, \\"the greatest disillusionment that I have endured in my life.\\" The Jewish Ghetto Police which he joined, was not a benevolent force by any means. Emanuel Ringelblum referred to it as 'the direct instrument of extermination'.Emanuel Ringelblum, Joseph Kermish, Shmuel Krakowski, Polish- Jewish Relations During the Second World War. Page 62.

Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 1998. . Retrieved Perechodnik's account therefore, needs to be seen in its proper perspective. His memoir describes such events as his and his father‚Äôs compliance with the Polish radio broadcast command to go eastward to fight in 1939, the formation of the Judenrat in Otwock, Himmler‚Äôs visit to Warsaw, the death of Czerniakow, the rounding up of Jews in the ghettos; life in, and escape from, a work camp; the experience of being hidden in Warsaw, the beginning of understanding of what was happening in the death camps, the 1943 Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, and the 1944 Warsaw Uprising. His information is now considered by various researchers and experts on the Holocaust to be remarkably accurate, and according to these researchers, the notes show proof that the Jews at that time knew what was happening. Shortly before Perechodnik died in 1944, he entrusted his manuscript to a Polish friend. After the war ended, the memoir was given to Perechodnik‚Äôs brother, Pesach Perechodnik, who had survived the war in the Soviet Union. The original copy of the memoir was presented to the Yad Vashem Archives, and a copy was given to the Central Jewish Historical Commission in Poland, which today is the Jewish Historical Institute. This document was first published as a complete book in 1995 by the Karta Centre of Warsaw. It remained virtually unknown in English-speaking countries until Frank Fox's translation in 1996. It was released in Polish and Hebrew prior to its translation into English in 1996. Since then, it has been translated into many languages. Its original title was A History of a Jewish Family During German Occupation, but its title was later changed to Am I a Murderer?: Testament of a Jewish Ghetto Policeman. It was recently republished in Poland in an unabridged version, with comprehensive sidenotes and references, under the title Spowied≈∫ (Confession). In his final years, Perechodnik completely changed his attitude towards the Jews and the Jewish faith and traditions. In his memoir, he rejected belief in God and the religious traditions of his Orthodox Jewish family. He became very bitter toward the Jews and frequently criticised them, even blaming them for bringing these events on themselves because of their insistence on cultural and religious isolation. He was sarcastic about others, as well as self-deprecating about his own Jewishness. References Further reading *Calel Perechodnik, Czy ja jestem mordercƒÖ?. Ed.

Long more popular abroad than in South Korea, Song was the first Korean filmmaker to win an award at the Cannes Film Festival. Life and career Song Il-gon was born in Seoul on January 1, 1971. He studied Fine Arts at the Seoul Institute of the Arts. After graduation he applied to study film in the United States. His visa application was rejected by that country, and Song instead attended the National Academy of Film in ≈Å√≥d≈∫, Poland. He was only the second Korean student to study at this institution which is known for prominent alumni such as Roman Polanski and Krzysztof Kie≈õlowski. Unable to deal with specifically Korean themes or history while in Poland, Song turned to themes influenced by psychology and Western mythology. Beginning in 1998, Song's short films began attracting international attention. Liver and Potato (1998) took its inspiration from the biblical story of Cain and Abel. The Dream of the Clowns (also 1998) was filmed at a Polish circus. Both of these films were shown at international film festivals, and both were released at short-film specialty theaters in South Korea. Song became the first Korean to win an award at the Cannes Film Festival with his short film Picnic (Sopoong, 1999), which was given the Jury Prize for Best Short Film. This film was also given the Grand Prix at the Melbourne International Film Festival. Back in Korea, Song was asked by the Seoul International Media Art Biennale (Media City Seoul) to make a 50-second video clip to be screened on electronic billboards for one month. He made Flush, about a teenage girl committing abortion in a public toilet. Even though Song had actually shown the screenplay to the government before filming, the authorities censored and removed the short after one day for its taboo subject. Song's first feature film was Flower Island (2001), a story about three women with psychological wounds travelling together to an island which is said to have magical healing powers. The film was successful internationally, winning prizes at the Venice Film Festival and the Fribourg International Film Festival among others. Afterwards Song took an acting role in director Park Kyung-hee's debut film, A Smile (Miso, 2004). Spider Forest (2004), Song's second feature film, was not successful in the South Korean domestic market, either with audiences or critics. But it was Song's first film to be given a region-1 DVD release in the U.S. Song's next feature film, Feathers in the Wind was originally planned as a 30-minute short as part of omnibus film 1.3.6, but major South Korean production studio CJ Entertainment gave Song funds to make the work into a feature for individual release. The resulting film was Song's first domestic success, with some Korean critics acclaiming it as the best romance ever filmed in Korea. The Magicians (2005) also began as a 40-minute short, one- third of the 2005 Jeonju Digital Project Talk to Her. Song expanded the experimental digitally shot film into a 96-minute feature done entirely in one tracking shot. In February 2007, Song was reported to be working on a film with the working title of Telephone Girl. An adaptation of the stage play Telephone Modern Girl, the film was to deal with Korea during the 1920s and 1930s, when the country was modernizing under Japanese occupation. However in January 2008, Song was reportedly in pre-production for a period horror film set during the Joseon Dynasty entitled Sahwa (\\"Royal Massacre\\"). This film was scheduled to begin shooting in March 2008. Celebrated 1990s actor Moon Sung- keun was reported to be playing the lead role as a king dealing with murder as well as problems of a supernatural nature. These projects did not push through. In 2009 Song turned to documentaries, telling the story of the Korean diaspora in Cuba in Dance of Time. He also contributed the titular short film to Sorry, Thanks, an omnibus film dealing with the profound relationships people establish with their pets. Always, which opened the 2011 Busan International Film Festival, was his first mainstream film. Inspired by Charlie Chaplin's City Lights, Song said he wanted to make a \\"conventional love story which takes place in today's urban city.\\" Song shot the documentary Forest of Time in Yakushima, Japan, a UNESCO World Heritage Site that is said to have inspired Hayao Miyazaki's animated film Princess Mononoke.

The brigade was one of two such units in Poland (the other being the 10th Motorized Cavalry Brigade (Poland); several more were planned). Not fully formed by September 1, it was nonetheless partially combat ready and immediately rushed into battle during the Polish September Campaign. Following heavy losses during the Battle of Tomasz√≥w Lubelski, it was disbanded on September 20, 1939. History The Brigade was formed in early June 1939, when the Polish Minister of Military Affairs, General Tadeusz Kasprzycki, gave order to transform the 1st Regiment of Mounted Rifles from the Garwolin garrison into a motorized unit. On June 10, 1939, Colonel Stefan Rowecki was appointed brigade commander (later, under the pseudonym \\"Grot\\" (spearhead), he became the first commander of the Home Army, and was killed by the Germans). The new unit was also based on other regiments, such as the 1st Rifle Regiment from Rembert√≥w, the sapper battalion from Pu≈Çawy and the 2nd Motorised Artillery Battalion from Stryj (8√ó75mm guns), which joined it on September 6. The unit was equipped with Polish-made TKS tankettes (13 tankettes, 2 of them with 20mm guns, 11th Recce Tank Company), and British-made light tanks Vickers E (17 machines, 12th Light Tank Company). The tankettes(except for the tankettes equipped with 20mm AT MG 38FK), were no match even to German PzKpfw II, and the Vickers E were outclassed by PzKpfw III and PzKpfw IV. On September 1, 1939, the Brigade left the barracks and concentrated its forces around Garwolin. It stayed there until September 3 as a reserve of the Commander-in-Chief of the Polish Army, then was ordered to prepare the defence of the Vistula river line between Dƒôblin and Solec. On September 5, it became part of freshly created Army Lublin, under General Tadeusz Piskor. The first contact with the enemy took place on September 8: the Brigade delayed the German advance and covered the retreat of the Polish forces. In the course of time, it absorbed remains of other Polish armoured units. On September 10 Brigade's positions were attacked by the 4th and 14th Infantry Divisions of the Wehrmacht. The Poles defended themselves, three days later counterattacked and the Germans retreated towards the Vistula river. However, the Polish offensive was stopped by the Army Headquarters and the Brigade began withdrawal towards Lw√≥w (Lviv). On September 15, Rowecki ordered to destroy all unnecessary equipment and divided the Brigade into two columns. On September 16, the Brigade, together with other Polish units, was surrounded in the area of Tomasz√≥w Lubelski (see: Battle of Tomasz√≥w Lubelski). The Polish forces decided to attack the town of Tomasz√≥w Lubelski; the offensive was carried out in the morning of September 17 by Warsaw Armoured Motorized Brigade, which managed to catch the German XXII Corps by surprise. However, the Germans quickly organized a defence and the Polish attack failed, with the Brigade losing half of the equipment. On September 19, another Polish attack did not succeed, and one day later, after fierce fighting and destruction of large part of equipment, General Piskor decided to surrender. Rowecki ordered the destruction of remaining heavy equipment and all soldiers to try to break through the German encirclement on his own. He himself was not caught by the Germans, also hundreds of Brigade's soldiers managed to escape to Hungary and later to Great Britain, where they joined the Polish 1st Armoured Division of General Stanis≈Çaw Maczek.

Plot summary Claude Pierce is an aristocratic and well-bred boy from England, whose parents have received a divorce. According to a child custody agreement signed by his parents, Claude will spend six months living with his father. Jay Pierce, the father in question, has settled in New York City, where he works as an architect. Claude starts attending a public school in New York City. Claude's \\"polished\\" manners make him stand out among his schoolmates, and the other kids start playing pranks on him. He soon gets on the bad side of two lower-class kids, Robert \\"Buck\\" Murphy and James \\"Gig\\" Stevens. Gig is in a dark mood at the time, because his father is about to be executed for murder. Finding himself the target of the other boys' anger, Claude decides to learn self-defense. Claude takes boxing lessons, which help him beat Buck in a street fight. He wins his opponent's grudging respect and starts befriending his former tormentors. At a later point, Gig's father has already been executed at the electric chair, and Gig lacks the money to provide a headstone for his father's grave. He really wants to buy that headstone and starts seeking ways to earn enough money for it. Gig initially tries to get money from his aunt Rose Hawley, who is a kept woman and financially secure. He fails to explain what he intends to do with the money, so Rose refuses to help him. Gig decides to raise the money by stealing, and convinces his friend Buck to help him. However, their initial attempts at crime fail. Claude learns of the problem, and instructs his new friends to start \\"stealing from the rich\\" and to emulate a fictional role model, gentleman thief A. J. Raffles. Claude personally orchestrates a robbery at a house that is vacant and unguarded. The trio steal toys which they can sell at a pawn shop to raise money. The robbery and visit to the pawn shop go as planned, but the three juvenile delinquents are then arrested by a police officer who finds their activities suspicious. The boys appear at court, where it is noted that nobody has reported the robbery. Claude explains that it was a fake robbery to begin with. He led his friends into looting his own house, and those toys belonged to Claude himself. He was just trying to help them out. The judge finds Claude innocent of any actual crime, but still finds that Buck and Gig acted with criminal intent. He places the two boys on probation, and they now have to make regular reports to a probation officer. Buck and Gig blame Claude for their fate and angrily severe ties with him. Buck and Gig decide to become runaways and flee from their families and their probation officer. Claude learns of their plans and decides to follow them, in hopes of convincing them to return home. Claude shows symptoms of illness at this point, but he attributes them to a common cold and pays no attention to them. The three boys meet at the local cemetery, under heavy rain. They check the recently-erected gravestone for Gig's father. The boys hitch-hike and are picked by a passing vehicle. The vehicle belongs to a trio of criminals trying to escape the authorities, and the boys distrust their intentions. The six of them stop for a meal at a diner, where Claude covertly alerts the police. While the criminals face the police in a shootout, the boys escape. Claude's symptoms are getting worse, and he has both fever and delirium. Buck and Gig are getting worried and decide to take Claude to a hospital. Claude is diagnosed with pneumonia. As Buck and Gig decide to get in contact with their probation officer, Claude is visited by his mother Hilda Pierce. Hilda wants to transfer Claude to a better hospital, but her plan seems to backfire. Claude's condition gets worse following the transport. Buck and Gig decide to tell their seemingly dying friend how much they care for him. The encouragement apparently helps in Claude's recovery. The film ends with the three boys happily going on a bicycle ride.

The name of the film's cinematographer, George Schneiderman, is spelled with two ns in the credits. A 1936 review of the film by the magazine Variety contains an error in the description of the film's duration. The review claims that the film lasts for 131 minutes. Most other sources report that the film only lasts for 92 minutes. The film is apparently based on a screenplay called The Devil Is a Sissie, which screenwriters Rowland Brown and Frank Frenton were working on in 1935. Brown is the one credited as the main writer of the film, with the extent of Fenton's contribution unclear. Other screenwriters were responsible for the final form of the screenplay. Publicity for the film focused on the change in directors in mid-production. Initially Rowland Brown was announced as the sole director of the film. During filming, came news reports that director W. S. Van Dyke was hired to \\"assist\\" Brown. A few days later, it was announced that Van Dyke had replaced Brown as the sole director of the film. The reasons of the replacement were not explained. According to the American Film Institute, this was the fourth time that Brown had started directing a film, only to be replaced by another director in mid-production. While Rowland Brown is still credited as co-director of the film in several sources, apparently only one or two scenes of the film were directed by him. According to 1936 news reports, most of the scenes that Brown had filmed were discarded and had to be reshot by W. S. Van Dyke. The official credits of the film name Van Dyke as sole director.

In the afterword to later editions, Williams compares the King Alfred Plan to intelligence programs devised by J. Edgar Hoover in the 1960s to monitor the movements of black militants. It also bears similarities to rumors in the early 1950s surrounding the McCarran Act, an anti-Communist law, in which political subversives were to be rounded up and placed in concentrations camps during a national emergency. When his novel was first published, Williams photocopied portions of the book detailing the King Alfred Plan and left copies in subway car seats around Manhattan.Boyd, Herbert. \\"The man and the plan: conspiracy theories and paranoia in our culture\\", Black Issues Book Review, March-April 2002. = Cultural dissemination = As a result, word of the King Alfred Plan spread throughout the black community.

According to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, the town had a population of 5,623 inhabitants in 2007.2007 PCBS Census. Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics. p.109. Awarta's built-up area consists of 540 dunams and it is governed by a village council.Awarta Health Work Committees. Etymology According to Palestinian historian Mustafa Dabbagh, the name \\"'Awarta\\" derives from the Syriac word 'awra, meaning \\"windowless\\" or \\"hidden\\". According to E. H. Palmer, \\"Awarta\\" is a personal name or unknown word.Palmer, 1881, p. 225 In Samaritan text, the town was called \\"Caphar Abearthah\\". An earlier Arabic name for the village was \\"'Awert\\".Conder, 1876, p. 196 History Awarta has been inhabited since Biblical times and throughout Palestine's rule by the Byzantine Empire, the Islamic Caliphate and during Ottoman rule. Between the 4th and 12th centuries, the town was an important Samaritan center, being the location of one of their main synagogues.Biblical Holy Places: An Illustrated Guide (2000) Gonen, Rikva. Paulist Press. pp.44-45. The Hill of Phinehas related in the Bible is associated with the location of the town of Awarta. Three large monuments in the town are attributed to the priestly family of Aaron. According to tradition, they are the burial sites of his sons Ithamar and Eleazar. His grandson Phinehas is believed to be buried at the site alongside his son Abishua ‚Äî the latter is especially revered by the Samaritans, who believe that he wrote the Torah. The seventy Elders are believed to be buried in a cave near Phinehas' tomb. On the western side of Awarta lies the tomb Muslims attribute to Nabi Uzeir, Ezra the scribe. Arab geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi records in 1226, while Awarta was under Ayyubid rule, that it was a \\"village or small town, on the road from Nablus to Jerusalem. According to the Samaritan Chronicle, in Kefr Ghuweirah (now called Awarta) is found the tomb of Yusha (Joshua) ibn Nun. Mufaddal, the son of Aaron's uncle, is also said to be buried here. These lie in a cave, where the seventy prophets are also buried.\\"Le Strange, 1890, p. 404 Conder and Kitchener, citing another Samaritan tradition, say rather that it was Eleazer the priest who was buried a \\"little way west of Awarta (at al 'Azeir),\\" while Joshua bin Nun was buried at Kefr Haris.Conder and Kitchener, 1882, pp. 218 - 219 =Ottoman era= Awarta was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517 with all of Palestine, and in 1596 it appeared in the tax registers as being in the Nahiya of Jabal Qubal, part of Nablus Sanjak. It had a population of 50 households, all Muslim.

The Palestinian National Authority agreed to ensure free access to these sites as specified in the 1995 Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.

According to Applied Research Institute‚ÄìJerusalem, much of the land of Awarta has been confiscated by the Israelis, including 2,450 dunums of land which was used for construction of the Israeli settlement of Itamar.‚ÄòAwarta Village Profile, ARIJ, p. 15 There are frequent reports of violence by Israeli settlers towards Palestinian farmers during the annual olive harvest. However, from 2007, when a group of Israeli activists ‚Äî Rabbis for Human Rights ‚Äî agreed to protect the farmers during the harvest, attacks temporarily came to an end.Harvesting Unlikely Allies MSNBC. 2007-11-14. According to Ghassan Daghlas, who monitors West Bank settlements, on 10 July 2013 Israelis from the Itamar settlement used chainsaws to cut down thousands of the villagers' olive trees in a 600-dunam olive grove maintained by 25 Awarta families in an area north of their town.Settlers cut down 1,150 olive trees in Nablus Sami, Iyad N‚Äôam ‚ÄòAwwad, a local teacher, stated that the affected area has been isolated from the rest of the village by the erection of two Itamar security fences.Israeli Setters Chop Down Some 1,155 Palestinian Olive Trees in ‚ÄòAwarta, 18ÿå Jul 2013, Al-Haq In 2010, two cousins from Awarta, Salah Qawariq, 18, and Muhammad Qawariq, 19, were killed by an Israeli (IDF) soldier who emptied his magazine, shooting them 29 times.

Israeli accounts varied over time: they were on their land when Avri Ran noted them on the property and forced them to sit down, called up a settlement security coordinator, who in turn called the IDF in. After two hours of communications between the soldiers and headquarters, the men were shot: on interrogation the other soldiers said they had not witnessed the shooting. The IDF announced that a terrorist attempt involving an attempt to attack soldiers with a pitchfork had been foiled. This was subsequently revised to an assault with a bottle and a syringe. It emerged later that they had not got IDF clearance to work their land.PA accuses Israel of killing Palestinian teens 'in cold blood', Haaretz 21 March 2010.John Brown and Noam Rotem, 'License to Kill: Why did the IDF shoot the Qawarik cousins 29 times?,' +972 magazine 19 May 2015. Israeli soldiers patrolling Awarta on the day after the Itamar attack Awarta made international headlines after the Itamar attack of 11 March 2011, when five members of the same family were killed in the nearby Israeli settlement of Itamar. Awarta was subsequently declared a closed military zone, due to suspicions that the perpetrators were residents of the village. Praise for Itamar massacre desecrates tombstones According to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, Palestinian sources reported that Israeli military forces took all of Awarta's men in for questioning, including two officers of the Palestinian security forces, making \\"wholesale arrests\\".Amos Harel and Avi Issacharoff: ‚ÄúIDF continues mass West Bank arrests in wake of Itamar massacre‚Äù. Haaretz, 15 March 2011 As a reaction to the attack, masked Israeli settlers infiltrated the village and threw stones at homes, before being dispersed by the Israel Defense Forces. Two young Awarta residents, Hakim Maazan Niad Awad and Amjad Mahmud Fauzi Awad were arrested on 5 and 10 April 2011 and confessed to the killings. The village council chief condemned the murder, however he voiced doubts over the Israeli findings and claimed that the two suspects confessed under duress. The two were sentenced to five consecutive life sentences and another five and seven years respectively in prison. Economy Awarta has about sixty businesses, most of them active in the fields of trade and small recycling industries. Approximately 40% of the labor force used to work in Israel before the Second Intifada, while 15% worked in the agriculture and animal husbandry sectors. The rate of unemployment is almost 35%. The town does not have a water or sewage utility system. There is a public well that is under the control of the Nablus Municipality. Road networks have been hampered by the IDF due to the area being a militant stronghold. Awarta has three schools - a secondary school for boys, a secondary school for girls and a coeducational primary school.

Background  Pelican was originally constructed as the passenger fishing vessel Bellboy III in 1940 in Brooklyn, New York. The vessel was constructed with an enclosed cabin. At 14 gross register tons, she was not subject to United States Coast Guard regulations and annual inspection, which were required only of vessels more than 15 gross register tons. She was powered by twin Chrysler engines. At the time of the accident, Pelican was owned by Eddie Carroll, who held a U.S. Coast Guard captain's license. She operated as a party boat from the Fishangrila Dock at Fort Pond Bay in Montauk, New York, taking customers fishing for the day in the waters around Montauk. The Fishangrila Dock was within walking distance of the Montauk station of the Long Island Railroad. On weekends, the railroad ran \\"Fisherman's Special\\" trains from New York City to Montauk; passengers would exit the train and climb aboard one of the waiting party boats and pay their fare for a day of fishing.  September 1, 1951  On September 1, 1951, as the Fisherman's Special emptied its passengers, 62 fares climbed aboard Pelican, as did her captain, Eddie Carroll, and mate. Pelican left Fishangrila Dock at 7:30 AM, carrying 64 passengers and crew, which was grossly in excess of her safe carrying capacity. Weather forecasts posted at Fishangrila Dock called for a line of approaching storms and changing winds. After rounding Montauk Point and fishing on the south side of Montauk in the Atlantic Ocean for several hours, Pelican began to return to Fishangrila Dock, due to rough seas, at approximately 11:30 AM. Encountering engine trouble on the way, which lengthened the trip, Pelican began to have difficulty making way against the conditions, with only one working engine. The weather changed suddenly as the squall line approached, with a strong northeast wind developing against an outgoing tide. The wind has been estimated at and the waves as high as in the rip tides near Montauk Point. While rounding Montauk Point at approximately 2:00 PM, Pelican was hit by two successive waves on the starboard quarter and capsized to port, spilling most of her passengers and crew into the water while trapping others inside the cabin. The vessel then foundered. The accident occurred within sight of Montauk Lighthouse, approximately north off the point in the area known as Endeavor Shoals. Two private fishing boats, Betty Ann and Bingo II, were the first to respond and rescue passengers. The U.S. Coast Guard picket boat that responded approximately one hour later was only able to rescue one passenger found clinging to Pelicans hull. In all, 45 passengers and crew, including Captain Carroll were killed.Dark Noon, Tom Clavin, Ragged Mountain Press, 2005.  Aftermath  The hull, foundering beneath the waves, was first secured near Montauk Point by legendary Montauk fisherman Captain Frank Mundus on his vessel Cricket II and Carl Forsberg, founder of the Viking Fleet, the largest fishing fleet in Montauk, on his Viking V, and was later transferred to the Coast Guard picket boat, which towed it into Lake Montauk. As a result, several additional bodies were recovered which otherwise might have been lost if Pelican had been allowed to sink.Pelican Disaster, 1951 Following the disaster, a U.S. Coast Guard investigation was conducted.http://www.uscg.mil/hq/g-m/moa/boards/pelican.pdf The investigating board estimated that Pelican could not have safely carried more than 30 passengers and that her overloaded condition contributed to the capsize and loss of life by causing her to ride low in the water and exaggerating the rolling motion caused by the waves. The failure of Carroll to keep himself aware of the weather conditions and to properly distribute his passengers on the vessel were also cited as reasons for the capsize. The investigation concluded that more stringent safety regulations were necessary for such boats. The \\"T-boat\\" regulations, 46 CFR, subchapter T, which included routine inspections of all vessels for hire carrying seven or more people and strict regulation of passenger capacity went into effect in 1957. In popular culture The Long Island band Brand New wrote the song \\"Play Crack The Sky\\" about Pelicans demise and included it on the 2003 album Deja Entendu.

August Biehle, Kokoon Club Ball, Private Collection Early life Biehle was born in Cleveland, the son of Christina (Mussler) and August Frederick Biehle, Sr., German immigrants.http://ech.case.edu/cgi/article.pl?id=BF8 Biehle trained as an apprentice decorator with his father for the firm of Rorimer Brooks. He went to Europe in 1903 to study painting in Paris and at the Kunstgeverbeschule in Munich. Upon his return to Cleveland in 1905 Biehle went to work for the Sherwin-Williams Company. Later career Biehle was a lithographer for Otis Lithography and Continental Lithography Corporation where he remained from 1913-52. Around 1919 he began painting with Henry Keller at Berlin Heights, Ohio, an artist's colony near Sandusky, Ohio. Biehle contributed paintings of both urban and rural Ohio to the American Scene movement of the 1920s and 1930s. Biehle was a member of the Kokoon Arts Club in Cleveland, Ohio, which was founded in 1911 by a group of young Cleveland artists including William Sommer, Carl Moellmann, Morris Grossman, Elmer Brubeck, and Harry Stebner. He was married in 1921 to the former Mary Theresa Wessler. Assessment According to art historian William H. Robinson, \\"What is perhaps most surprising about modernism in northeast Ohio is the diversity of artists involved. The new art entered the region from many different sources, often bypassing the New York groups normally associated with early modernism in America. August Biehle (1885‚Äì1979), an artist almost completely forgotten today, played a pivotal role in this process. The son of a German immigrant painter, Biehle traveled abroad several times seeking artistic training, visiting Germany in 1903 and again in 1910. In 1912, after seeing the first exhibition of the Blue Rider group in Munich, he returned to Cleveland and showed his colleagues his copy of The Blue Rider Almanach containing prints by Kandinsky and discussions of avant-garde art, music, and aesthetic theory. Biehle's own paintings, containing explosive distortions of form and color, established a link between Cleveland artists and the German Expressionists. Yet, like many artists in the region, Biehle worked throughout his long career in a variety of styles, moving with remarkable facility between modernist and more traditional methods of pictorial construction.\\" The Canton Museum of Art Exhibition Archives describe August Biehle as one of northeast Ohio's most prolific and distinguished artists, with masterful draftsmanship and a superior sense of design. He assimilated aspects of German Expressionism, Fauvism, and Cubism, and moved skillfully between a range of styles, from Jugendstil (a German modernist style) to American Scene painting. He also displayed his versatility by mastering a variety of media and techniques, from graphite drawing to painting in oil, gouache, pastel, and tempera. Exhibitions His paintings have previously appeared in numerous exhibitions, including shows at the Cleveland Museum of Art, the Butler Institute of American Art in Youngstown, the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts in Philadelphia, and the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City.

The monastery served as a historic Princely residency of Rurik dynasty during the Medieval times located just to the north of Vyshhorod. Today, the territory is part of the Vyshhorod Raion, Kyiv Oblast (province) in northern Ukraine. The location is situated in the Mezhyhirya ravine, on the right bank of the Dnieper River in close proximity to the Kyiv Reservoir. Founded in 988 AD, the Mezhyhirya Monastery was one of the first monasteries established in the East Slavic state of Kievan Rus'. Throughout its existence, it was destroyed, and then restored numerous times, yet it was not spared destruction by Soviet authorities in 1935. At the time of its height, the Mezhyhirya Monastery was considered a spiritual center of Rus royal Rurikid house and later Cossacks. Currently, the area of the former monastery is located on a fenced-in woodland territory next to Novi Petrivtsi village and is directly connected with a private residence for Ukrainian government officials. As an important monastery of the Zaporozhian Host, the Mezhyhirya Monastery left a rich legacy behind it. The monastery was mentioned in one of Taras Shevchenko's poems, \\"Chernets,\\" written in 1847, and was the subject of a drawing by him. Nikolai Gogol's novel, \\"Taras Bulba,\\" published in 1835, also mentions the monastery. History =Foundation and early history= The monastery is mentioned for the first time in the early 14th century, although Yevgeniy Bolkhovitinov claimed that it had been founded by the first Metropolitan of Kiev, Michael, along with Greek monks arriving from Byzantium in 988 AD. The claim is likely spurious, since Mezhyhirya is not listed by modern authors among the monasteries of Kievan Rus.http://www.russiancity.ru/books/b55.htm In 1154, the Prince of Vladimir- Suzdal Yuri Dolgoruki divided the territory surrounding the monastery's grounds amongst his sons. His son Andrei I Bogolyubsky received the lands nearest to the monastery, now the city of Vyshhorod. Not too long afterwards, he is alleged to have moved the monastery to its current location in the hills of the Dnieper, giving the monastery its name, \\"Mezhyhirya.\\" Bogolyubsky despised the city of Kiev, therefore moving to Suzdal, in modern-day Russia. On his trip, he took with him the \\"Theotokos of Vladimir\\" icon, a gift from Constantinople Patriarch Luke Chrysoberges to Dolgoruki. The icon is one of the most venerated Orthodox icons, now located in the Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow. With the Mongol invasion of Rus' by Batu Khan in 1237-40, the monastery is supposed to have been completely destroyed. These legends were written down much later. The monastery is known to have existed in the 14th century, though. In 1482, it was attacked by the Crimean Tatars under Me√±li I Giray. Reconstruction on the monastery began only 40 years later. In 1523, the monastery was transferred to the King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania Sigismund I. In addition, the monastery was given a full reign over its territory. In 1555, the complex consisted of four churches, including and one cave church. =Cossack monastery= The Mezhyhirya Monastery as drawn by Abraham van Westerveld during the 1650s. A drawing of the monastery by Ukrainian poet and artist Taras Shevchenko, 1843. During the 16th century, the monastery frequently lost and regained its ownership rights. On the funds of the monastery's new hegumen Afanasiy (a prot√©g√© of prince Konstanty Wasyl Ostrogski), the monastery's old buildings were demolished, and new ones were built in their place. In 1604, the Gate Church of Ss. Peter and Paul was constructed, in 1609 - the Mykilska Refectory, and the Transfiguration Cathedral in 1609-1611. Under his rule, the monastery was considered as the second lavra (cave monastery) in Ukraine. After its reconstruction, the Mezhyhirya Monastery became a regional center of the Zaporozhian Host, serving the host as a military monastery. In 1610, the monastery received the status of a stauropegic monastery (orthodox church autonomy), under the Patriarch of Constantinople. The universal (act) of Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky issued on May 21, 1656 transferred the neighboring settlements of Vyshhorod, Novi Petrivtsi, and Moshchany under control of the Mezhyhirya Monastery. In effect, the universal made Khmelnytsky the monastery's ktitor. After the destruction of the Trakhtemyrivskyi Monastery by a Polish szlachta army, the Mezhyhirya Monastery replaced it as the main cossack military monastery. As a military monastery, retired and elderly cossacks from the Zaporozhian Host would now come to the monastery to retire and live in until the end of their lives. At that time, the monastery's expenses were paid off with the help of the cossack's Sich Host. In 1676, the area was burned down after a fire started in the wooden Transfiguration Cathedral. With the help of Ivan Savelov, a monk who lived in the monastery and later became a Patriarch of Moscow, the complex was reconstructed. Two years later, with the help of the cossack community, the Annunciation Church was constructed near the monastery's hospital. In 1683, the Sich Rada voted that the ministers in the Sich's Pokrovskyi Cathedral (the main cathedral of the sich) should be only from the Mezhyhirya Monastery. In 1691, monasteries located near the Sich were placed under the Mezhyhirya Monastery's authority. Under hegumen Feodosiy at the end of the 17th century, considered as a period of prosperity, the Mezhyhirya Monastery became one of the largest monastery's in Ukraine. At the request of Peter I of Russia, the stauropegic status of the monastery was revoked; it was later reinstated in 1710. In 1717, a large fire destroyed a large portion of the monastery's buildings. The monastery's \\"military\\" status was reconfirmed by cossacks in 1735. In 1774, with the funds of the last Koshovyi Otaman Petro Kalnyshevsky, the Ss. Peter and Paul Church was reconstructed. Ukrainian architect Ivan Hryhorovych-Barskyi designed some of the buildings, including the monk's residence. The monastery as seen on an early 20th-century postcard. = Decline and Soviet demolition = A period of decline began with the abolition of the Zaporozhian Host by Catherine II of Russia. In 1786 the Russian Imperial government closed the monastery and confiscated its valuable treasures. The remaining Zaporozhian Cossacks soon afterwards left Zaporizhia, and moved to the Kuban region. There they founded the Kuban Cossack Host, which still exists to this day. The cossacks were able to leave with some of the monastery's manuscripts, some of which are now kept in the Krasnodar Krai Archive. In 1787, Catherine II of Russia came to Kyiv for a visit and wished to see the Mezhyhirya Monastery. She never got to see it, because the monastery mysteriously burned down the night before her arrival. The Transfiguration Cathedral seen shortly before its demolition, 1934. In 1796, a German engineer found that the area had suitable clay for the making of faience, and two years later, founded the Mezhyhirya Faience Factory, the first one in Ukraine, at the site of the unused monastery. By 1852, the faience factory had become the largest industrial complex in Kyiv. During its existence, the factory produced a variety of crockery and ornamental vases and figurines. In 1884, the faience factory was closed down after it failed to bring any profit. In 1894, the Mezhyhirya Monastery was rebuilt and transformed into a women's monastery. After its reconstruction, the monastery was transferred to the authority of the Intercession of the Saints Monastery in Kyiv. After the Russian Revolution, the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic's capital moved from Kharkiv to Kyiv in 1934, and the city was in need of a suburban residence for government officials. Mezhyhirya was chosen as the site of the new government residence. The decision of the Politburo in April 1935 ordered the demolition of the whole complex. Before the scheduled demolition in 1936, the architecture and buildings of the monastic complex were photographed. During the demolition, an underground library was discovered, full of handwritten manuscripts. There are speculations that the discovered books belonged to the lost library of Yaroslav the Wise, or perhaps of a later period, during the times of the Zaporozhian Host. The only thing that remains now of the monastic complex is a water well. During Soviet times, the area served as a residence for Leonid Brezhnev and Volodymyr Shcherbytsky, who worked in the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic's government at the time. During this period, its location was concealed from the public. Ownership controversy In 2008 the Mezhyhirya residence was amid an ownership controversy between the former Ukrainian Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych and the new Ukrainian government, led by Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko. The transfer of the 1.4 km¬≤ Mezhyhirya official residence in Novi Petrivtsi, Vyshhorod Raion (district) to the \\"Nadra Ukraine\\" firm on July 11, 2007 by Viktor Yanukovych pulled the territory from under government ownership. Mezhyhirya residence. =Private residence of Viktor Yanukovych= On July 9, 2007, President Viktor Yushchenko signed a secret presidential decree #148, according to the local business newspaper Delo which referred to the information of the State Directorate of Affairs. The document states: \\"The government dacha on the territory of the recreational complex \\"Pushcha-Vodytsia\\" is presented for a use to the head of Kabmin, Viktor Yanukovych.\\" Later the document has never appeared on the website of the head of state nor in any other open source of information. A single official confirmation of it was given to the newspaper by the State Directorate of Affairs. The directorate explained that the recreational complex \\"Pushcha- Vodytsia\\" includes the recreational resort \\"Pushcha-Vodytsia\\" and the Mezhyhirya residency. The residency that is located in the village of Novi Petrivtsi was occupied by Yanukovych in the last several years. The newspaper notes that at the same time, July 9, at the website of the President appeared another document - an order in which he obliged the prime-minister to execute the decision of the RNBO and secure the financing of early elections. The newspaper speculated that it was a trade exchange of power for the state dacha. In the late February 2008 Yanukovych confirmed that he indeed possesses a dacha in the Mezhyhirya residency awarded by a presidential decree. According to the data of the State Directorate of Affairs, the territory of residency occupies . It is enclosed in perimeter by a five-meter [tall] iron fence and inside it is secured by operatives of \\"Titan\\". Yanukovych claimed that he only uses one of the houses which has an area of and after which is secured of land. Yanukovych also stated that with help of the State Directorate of Affairs he was able to conduct a substantial renovations of the property and confirms that in 2007 some area was bought by some private entity after which he had to pay monthly 11,000 hryvnias for rent. In interview to BBC he acknowledged that lives at the Mezhyhirya's cottage sometime since 1999 or 2000. =Further developments= View of former President Yanukovych's \\"Honka\\" club house on the territory of the former monastery. On July 11, 2007, Yanukovych issued a government order #521, according to which the National Joint-Stock Company \\"Nadra Ukrainy\\" received the state residency and a territory of 137 ha in Mezhyhirya. Soon \\"Nadra Ukrainy\\" concluded a barter with another company \\"Medinvesttreid\\" (Medinvesttrade) after which the above- mentioned government assigned residence was exchanged for two properties at Parkova alleya (Park alley) in Kyiv. \\"Medinvesttreid\\", in its turn, sold the newly acquired property of \\"Nadra Ukrainy\\" to some other company \\"Tantalit\\". Since May 2008 the Ministry of the Interior was conducting a search for the director of \\"Medinvesttreid\\", Hennadiy Herasymenko, who in their opinion was involved in a scheme to get the former state residence out of state property. On February 12, 2008 Yushchenko signed a decree for relieving a state property security personnel from duties at the State cottages area in Mezhyhirya. His decree canceled the previous presidential decree of January 12, 2006 where the security personnel was assigned to properties at Zalissya, instead of Zalissya and Mezhyhirya. Subsequently, Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych privatized the complex, already residing there while prime minister. At the time, the property's price was estimated at around 1 billion hryvnias ($200 million). After Yulia Tymoshenko's election, her cabinet annulled the decree which transferred the property to the \\"Nadra Ukraine\\" firm, and again placed the territory under government control. However, on July 28, 2008, the Economic Court of Kyiv City annulled the Cabinet's decision and returned the Mezhyhirya residence back under Yanukovych's ownership.

It is assigned to the Fourth Air Force, Air Force Reserve Command, stationed at McConnell Air Force Base, Kansas. The 931st ARW is an associate unit with the 22d Air Refueling Wing, Air Mobility Command (AMC) and if mobilized the wing is gained by AMC. Overview The 931st ARW is an associate unit with the active-duty 22d Air Refueling Wing and currently has about 485 personnel. The host unit and the 931st ARW share responsibilities for maintenance, with flying operations conducted by both units, using the inventory of 24 KC-135R Stratotankers and Boeing KC-46 Pegasus. The group consists of the following units: 931st Operations Group *18th Air Refueling Squadron *905th Air Refueling Squadron *924th Air Refueling Squadron *931st Operations Support Squadron 931st Maintenance Group * 931st Aircraft Maintenance Squadron * 931st Maintenance Squadron * 931st Maintenance Operations Flight 931st Mission Support Group * 931st Civil Engineer Squadron * 931st Force Support Squadron * 931st Security Forces Squadron * 931st Aerospace Medicine Squadron History =Need for reserve troop carrier groups= After May 1959, the reserve flying force consisted of 45 troop carrier squadrons assigned to 15 troop carrier wings.There were an additional four rescue squadrons not assigned to the wings. Cantwell, p. 156 The squadrons were not all located with their parent wings, but were spread over thirty-five Air Force, Navy and civilian airfields under what was called the Detached Squadron Concept. The concept offered several advantages. Communities were more likely to accept the smaller squadrons than the large wings and the location of separate squadrons in smaller population centers would facilitate recruiting and manning.Cantwell, pp. 156, 169 However, under this concept, all support organizations were located with the wing headquarters.Cantwell, p. 156 Although this was not a problem when the entire wing was called to active service, mobilizing a single flying squadron and elements to support it proved difficult. This weakness was demonstrated in the partial mobilization of reserve units during the Berlin Crisis of 1961. To resolve this, at the start of 1962, Continental Air Command, (ConAC) determined to reorganize its reserve wings by establishing groups with support elements for each of its troop carrier squadrons. This reorganization would facilitate mobilization of elements of wings in various combinations when needed.Cantwell, pp. 189‚Äì191 =Activation of the 931st Troop Carrier Group= As a result, the 931st Troop Carrier Group was activated at Atterbury Air Force Base, Indiana on 11 February 1963 as the headquarters for the 72d Troop Carrier Squadron, which had been stationed there since February 1953.Maurer, pp. 267‚Äì268 Along with group headquarters, a Combat Support Squadron, Materiel Squadron and a Tactical Infirmary were organized to support the 72d. If mobilized, the group was gained by Tactical Air Command (TAC), which was also responsible for its training. Its mission was to organize, recruit and train Air Force reservists with Fairchild C-119 Flying Boxcars in the tactical airlift of airborne forces, their equipment and supplies and delivery of these forces and materials by airdrop, landing or cargo extraction systems. The group was one of three C-119 groups assigned to the 434th Troop Carrier Wing in 1963, the others being the 930th Troop Carrier Group, also at Atterbury and the 932d Troop Carrier Group at Scott Air Force Base, Illinois. =Tactical Air Support/Special Operations= The 931st performed routine reserve airlift operations until July 1969 when the Flying Boxcars were retired, and the unit was redesignated as a Tactical Air Support unit. The 72d became the 72d Tactical Air Support Squadron and was re-equipped with Cessna U-3 Blue Canoe and Cessna O-2 Skymaster observation and close air support aircraft. On 31 December 1969, in connection with the closing of Bakalar, the group and its squadron moved to Grissom Air Force Base, Indiana. First reassigned to the 403d Composite Wing on 1 June 1970 and then on 15 January 1971 to the 434th Special Operations Wing, on 1 March 1971, group and squadron converted to Cessna A-37B Dragonfly counter-insurgency aircraft being returned from South Vietnam. The A-37s were primarily an export aircraft used for foreign military sales and the unit trained personnel from other Air Force Reserve squadrons and Latin American Air Forces in the use of the aircraft. The 72d was inactivated on 1 October 1973 and replaced by the 46th Tactical Fighter Squadron in a reorganization. The 46th was assigned directly to the 434th Tactical Fighter Wing and the 931st was inactivated on 1 July 1975. =Air Refueling= In May 1977 the group became a Strategic Air Command (SAC) Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker air refueling unit, and activated at Grissom as part of the 452d Air Refueling Wing. The 931st was the third Air Force Reserve unit formed to provide air refueling support for SAC. On 1 October 1978, the \\"Flying Hoosiers\\" achieved operational status 72 days ahead of schedule. That was the shortest time period ever recorded for an air refueling unit from activation to combat readiness. In the ensuing years, the 931st established more records of achievement including the Carl Spaatz Memorial Trophy, the Rousher Memorial Trophy for two consecutive years, the Golden Tanker Trophy and the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award. The unit flew the KC-135 from 1978 until its inactivation in 1987. Reactivated in 1995 under Air Mobility Command at McConnell Air Force Base, Kansas. This activation brought with it the unique distinction of being the first associate tanker unit in the Air Force. The 931st began flying operations in May 1995, refueling the B-2 Spirit christened \\"Spirit of Kansas\\". With the activation, the 18th Air Refueling Squadron provided air operations for the group. The 18th was redesignated a \\"super squadron\\" on 1 October 1997, doubling its size to 32 flying crews. The 931st was awarded the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award for meritorious service from 1 November 1995 to 31 October 1997. The 931st also won the Kansas Award for Excellence on 21 October 1997, becoming the first military unit to win this quality award. And, in recognition of meritorious service, the 931st received its third Air Force Outstanding Unit Award, for its performance between 1 November 1997, and 31 October 1999. From April to July 1999, more than 70 members of the 931st were activated under a Presidential Selected Reserve Call-Up. In support of Operation Allied Force, members deployed to Mor√≥n Air Base, Spain and Naval Air Facility Souda Bay, Crete. In support of Operation Northern Watch, members deployed to Incirlik Air Base, Turkey. In March 2003, more than 100 members of the 931st were mobilized in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Most of the mobilized individuals were KC-135 aircrew members. During Operation Iraqi Freedom, the Unit's security forces deployed a team to Kirkuk Air Base, Iraq (Forward Operating Base Warrior). This was the first \\"boots on the ground\\" combat mission since the unit's stand-up. The security forces team was integrated with various active-duty units, which formed the 506th Expeditionary Security Forces Squadron. The squadron was tasked with providing base perimeter security, entry-control and exterior/interior mobile patrols.

He published his first book of text and pictures, Ghost Towns of the West, in 1971 ‚Äì an in-depth study of the boom-to-bust mining towns preserved in the high-dry climate zones of the American West. His second book, Middle West Country, appeared in 1975 ‚Äì a poignant historical study of the Midwest from the earliest settlements by European farmers to the present era of mechanized agriculture. In 1991 Carter‚Äôs lifelong interest in New Orleans jazz led him to create his third book of text and photographs, Preservation Hall. Increasingly drawn to classic fine-art photography, in 1996 he published Illuminations, a book of nudes. Then came Carter‚Äôs fifth book, Causes and Spirits: Photographs from Five Decades.

He was born in Bradford. He began his rallying career as a club rally driver in a Mini. He was considerably better than his peers, however, and was soon spotted by the BMC team; this led to a drive in their works team alongside Paddy Hopkirk, Timo M√§kinen and Rauno Aaltonen. His first major international victory in the Mini was the 1966 Circuit of Ireland, where his co-driver was Henry Liddon. Fall worked as Salesman for Appleyards Bradford, a BMC dealership which sold Austin and Morris Mini Coopers. At that time, Appleyards supported the privateer rally drivers and employed ex BMC Competitions Manager Marcus Chambers in their Service Department. Fall gained permission from Appleyards to use one of their Cooper 'S' demonstrator cars AAK 500C to use as his rally car in the 1965 season. It was at this time that Fall was discovered by the BMC Competitions Department in Abingdon. The Competitions Manager at the time was Stuart Turner and he offered Fall a drive with the BMC Team. Fall accepted and became one of the most celebrated BMC Works drivers. Fall drove a Leyland (Austin) 1800, with co-driver Denis Johnson, in the 1968 Canadian Shell 4000 Rally, which ran from Calgary to Halifax, finishing 7th overall. Fall also drove for British Leyland Cars in an Austin 1800 in the 1968 London to Sydney Rally. In the 1970 London to Mexico World Cup Rally, he participated with a celebrity co-driver, the footballer Jimmy Greaves - they finished 6th overall. He also won the famous Peruvian Rally \\"Caminos del Inca\\", in 1969, driving a Ford Escort. After he stopped driving, he became founder of the British Dealer Opel Team (DOT) as well as the self-willed but successful director of the Opel Motorsport Team in Germany, for which Walter R√∂hrl won the World Rally Championship for Drivers in 1982 with an Opel Ascona 400. Returning to England in the late 1980s, Fall formed the company Opel Classics, with Steve Thompson Cars (UK Irmscher Car Dealership) and Tom May (Director of Irmscher UK). The company became responsible for restoring and maintaining ex Opel competition cars and they also built a small number of fully re-commissioned classics Opels's using the Opel GT model, cars being from California and also an Opel GT purchased by Fall from an Opel Dealership during the 1982 San Remo Rally. After this venture, Fall became first the manager and later the owner/director of the Safety Devices company. Fall's last major outing was the 2003 Historic Rally Championship with co-driver Jonathan Hall-Smith, where he competed with his Datsun 240Z. Fall died after a heart attack on 1 December 2007 while a member of the organisation team of the East African Safari Classic Rally in his hotel room at Ngurdoto Mountain Lodge in Tanzania, leaving his wife Pat and two sons from a previous marriage.

With nearly $30 billion under management, the company offers U.S., International, Global, and sector-focused equity portfolios in a range of vehicles including mutual funds, separate accounts, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), variable annuities and off-shore funds. The Davis family, Davis Advisors, employees of the firm and fund directors have more than $2 billion invested alongside clients. Since its founding nearly half a century ago, Davis has offered the same, time-tested investment discipline which seeks to buy durable businesses at value prices and hold them for the long term with the goal of building wealth for shareholders through long-term compounding. Davis believes stocks represent ownership interests in real businesses and therefore devotes significant time and resources to rigorous fundamental analysis of companies, all while maintaining a strict valuation discipline based on a concept known as ‚Äúowner earnings‚Äù (i.e., the normalized cash earnings power of a business). Under the leadership of Christopher C. Davis, Davis Advisors is widely recognized as a premier investment manager serving individual and institutional investors world-wide. The firm traces its roots to investor Shelby Cullom Davis, a leading financial advisor to governors and presidents, who parlayed an initial investment of $100,000 in the late 1940s into more than $800 million by the end of his career in the early 1990s. In 1969, Shelby Cullom Davis‚Äôs son, Shelby M.C. Davis, founded Davis Advisors after serving as the head of equity research at The Bank of New York in order to offer the Davis investment approach to outside clients.

The battalion was formed in March 1941 as the 3rd Infantry Division Provisional Antitank Battalion, and on 14 December was redesignated as the 603rd Tank Destroyer Battalion, in line with the reorganisation of the anti-tank force. It remained in the United States until 1944, when it was moved to the United Kingdom, deploying into Normandy in late July equipped with M18 Hellcats. The battalion was attached to the 6th Armored Division, with which it would serve for the duration of the campaign in North-West Europe. It first saw action on 28 July during Operation Cobra, and advanced west into Brittany during the breakout from the Normandy bridgehead, arriving at Brest and moving south to Lorient; it was then ordered east to join Third Army, on the Moselle during the Lorraine Campaign. It fought near Nancy in October, moving up to the Saar in November. It moved north during the Battle of the Bulge, and fought in the counterattack in January 1945, where Corporal Arthur Beyer of C Company won the Medal of Honor for a solitary action on 15 January, near Arloncourt. The battalion crossed the Siegfried Line in February, reached the Rhine on 21 March, and crossed it on the 25th, moving into Germany through the Fulda Gap.

By vehicle type  Bus mounted bike carriers are usually attached to the front of the bus. They may flip up against the bus, out of the way, when not carrying any bikes. Automobile mounted bike carriers can be attached to the roof, rear trunk, or rear tow hitch, depending on the vehicle. Bikes may be mounted in the carriers by clamping both wheels and providing some additional vertical support, by clamping the rear wheel and the front dropouts (necessitating the removal of the front wheel, which may be mounted separately on blades), or by clamping the top tube (usually in the case of rear hitch mounted carriers). There is a device available that connects from the stem to the seat post, to provide a top tube equivalent suitable for mounting in these carriers for step-through frame bicycles that do not have a top tube. Carriers that clamp on the front dropouts may also provide a built-in locking mechanism. Carriers have been developed especially for the rear of pickup trucks that attach either to the bed or its sides. Special long carriers have been developed to support long-wheelbase recumbents and tandems. At least one manufacturer offers bicycle carriers for use on motorcycles.

Located in the northern Jordan Valley near the Sea of Galilee, it falls under the jurisdiction of Emek HaYarden Regional Council. In it had a population of . Although stll called a kibbutz, it has privatised itself in 2006. Etymology The name of the kibbutz was taken from the epic poem \\"Masada\\" by Yitzhak Lamdan, itself named after the fortress of Masada by the Dead Sea. It has nothing to do with the Hebrew word for base or foundation, \\"massad\\". The fortress of Masada is called in Hebrew \\"Metzad√°\\", but Yitzhak Lamdan, although writing in Hebrew, used the name as it is known from the works of Josephus, \\"Masada\\". Lamdan's poem was extremely influential among Zionist Jews at the time the kibbutz was founded. History The kibbutz was founded in 1937 as part of the tower and stockade program by immigrants from Romania and members of kibbutz Sha'ar HaGolan. As with Sha'ar HaGolan, the kibbutz's defenders retreated during the Battles of the Kinarot Valley of the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War after holding on for four days of fighting. The two kibbutzim were captured and briefly held by the Syrian Army, during which time they were looted and burned down. Although the members made every reasonable effort to defend their kibbutz and returned soon after the events, a stigma was attached to them, and vindication in the form of released military records only arrived in recent years, decades too late. Masada, like dozens of the kibbutzim near the Sea of Galilee, existed under the threat from both the Syrian Golan Heights towering from the east, and the Jordanians across the Yarmouk River. On 29 March 1968 a tractor from Masada hit a landmine, killing the driver and three passengers. Israeli forces came to evacuate the casualties, and Jordanian forces opened fire on them. In retaliation, the Israel Air Force attacked Jordanian targets east of Beit She'an. Several planes were damaged by anti-aircraft fire yet returned safely to base. Masada suffered greatly under the economic collapse of the 1980s which affected it more harshly than other kibbutzim. In 2006 the kibbutz was privatised.

A luggage carrier, also commonly called a rack, is a device attached to a bicycle to which cargo or panniers can be attached. This is popular with utility bicycles and touring bicycles. Bicycle luggage carriers may be mounted on the front or rear of a bicycle. The rear mount is more common. Racks on the front are mostly reserved for utility and freight bicycles. A special type of front rack is a low rider which is mainly used for bicycle touring. The term luggage carrier can also refer to a device with two wheels used to wheel luggage or something of similar weight from one place to another, similar to a dolly (hand truck) but lighter and usually able to be folded up.  Mounting  Bicycles may have eyelets, tapped with a standard thread, at the dropouts on the rear chainstays, and on the front fork blades. Mounting a bike rack is possible without these eyelets, but requires additional hardware. A style of rack clamps only to the seatpost, does not require eyelets or additional hardware, but has a limited capacity. Luggage carriers can be mounted on recumbents and on folding bicycles, but may require customization or additional hardware. Additionally, specialized or customized luggage carriers are often required on bicycles with (rear) disc brakes or full suspension. A common type of child seat designed for carrying an infant on a bicycle mounts to a rear luggage carrier. Some models of child seat are not attached to a luggage carrier but are fixed to the seat tube. Some luggage carriers come in more than one size to accommodate different sized frames. A common variation is for there to be a different model for road bicycles and mountain bikes.  Capacity  Rear-mounted luggage carriers are typically designed and tested for a maximum load of 25 kg (55lb), some models even for up to 40 kg (90lb). For front-mounted carriers, a typical design load limit might be 2√ó10 kg (2 x 20lb). Most luggage carriers are not designed to withstand the weight of an adult person.  Construction  Luggage carriers are commonly constructed from aluminum, steel, or some combination of the two. Components may consist of tubing, extrusions, or castings. They may be welded, riveted, or bolted together. Panniers may be mounted to front and rear luggage carriers. Removable panniers hook onto the top edge of the carrier and then are held in place by a spring or elastic cord that hooks near the wheel axle at the bottom. Some luggage carriers have an extra, lower, rail to hang panniers on, this provides better stability and more space on the platform. Some bikes, such as longtail bicycles, porteur bicycles, or the Dutch typical transportfiet, may be built with an integrated front or rear luggage carrier. These are usually tested to a higher weight capacity. In Europe, it is common for rear racks to have a mounting point for a reflector or rear light. It is common for the mounting point to have 2 holes which fits M5 bolts, spaced 50 or 80 mm (2\\" or 3\\") apart.

To the south of the village there were old olive trees. The villagers cultivated the soil as far east as Wady Maleh, and had also good land near Yarza.Conder and Kitchener, 1882, p. 228 Conder and Kitchener speculated that this village may have been the ancient site of the biblical Tirzah. In 1900 landlord Hassan Hamad obtained the majority of Tayasir's lands due to the village residents' monetary debt to him. Thirty years later, most of the land was purchased by al-Batriyarkia al- Latinyah (Latin Patriarchate). Israel attempted to purchase the land following their occupation of the West Bank in 1967 but the Patriarchate refused the offer. =British Mandate of Palestine= In the 1922 census of Palestine, conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Tayasir (called: Tiasir\\") had a population of 146 MuslimsBarron, 1923, Table IX, Sub-district of Nablus, p. 24 increasing in the 1931 census to 192 inhabitants, all Muslim, except for 5 Christians, with 36 occupied houses.Mills, 1932, p. 65.

Demographics In the 1922 census of Palestine, conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Tayasir (called: Tiasir\\") had a population of 146, all Muslim. That rose to 192 inhabitants, all Muslim, except for 5 Christians, with 36 occupied houses at the time of the 1931 census. In Sami Hadawi's land and population survey in 1945, Tayasir's population was 260 and this figure nearly doubled in 1961, reaching 487. The Israel Central Bureau of Statistics, projected a population of 1,200 in 1987.Welcome to Tayasir: Town Statistics and Facts Various sources via PalestineRemembered. In the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics' (PCBS) first official census in 1997, Tayasir had a population of 1,753 inhabitants. According to the 2007 census by the PCBS, the village's population was 2,489. In the 1997 census, males constituted 50.6% of the population while females comprised 49.4%. Tayasir represents 5% of the Tubas Governorate's total population. Seven families make-up the majority of the village residents: Debik (17%), Abu Muhsen (15%), Wahdan (15%), Sbah (15%), Jabir (11%), Taleb (8%) and Abd al-Rasaq (7%). Other smaller families comprise 14% of the population. Economy and land use Tayasir's total land area amounts to about 26,000 dunams, of which roughly 500 make up the village's \\"built-up\\" area. About 5,000 dunams are classified as arable land, of which 3,545 are cultivated, mostly with field crops and fruit trees. The Israeli authorities have confiscated 15,875 dunams for security reasons and military use. Agriculture is the largest economic sector, accounting for 82% of the active labor force. The second largest sector is the Israeli labor market accounting for 10% of workers. Between 2002 and 2006, the average household income dropped by 60% largely due to measures implemented by Israel as a result of the Second Intifada which began in 2000. In 2007 the PCBS recorded that there were 49 business establishments in Tayasir. According to ARIJ, these included 22 retail and grocery stores, two restaurants and one government-run health clinic. Most services are provided by nearby Tubas.

Known for its large deep cluster of loose, deep-yellow berries and golden colored wine, Moscato Giallo is grown mostly in northern Italy where it is most often used to produce passito style dessert wines.J. Robinson, J. Harding and J. Vouillamoz Wine Grapes - A complete guide to 1,368 vine varieties, including their origins and flavours pgs 667-668, 683 Allen Lane 2012 The grape is also planted in Croatia where it is known as Mu≈°kat ≈æuti. History and relationship with other grapes Muscat blanc √† Petits Grains, one of the likely parent varieties of Moscato Giallo. Like many Muscat varieties, Moscato Giallo was long thought to be of Middle-Eastern origin, with Syria being the birthplace most commonly cited. However, in the early 21st century DNA analysis showed that Moscato Giallo shared a parent-offspring relationship with Muscat blanc √† Petits Grains (also known as Moscato bianco). As the first documented mention of Muscat blanc √† Petits Grains (under the synonym of Muscatellus) could be dated to the early 14th century, it is likely that the seemingly more recent Moscato Giallo is the offspring in the relationship. Through this relationship with Muscat blanc √† Petits Grains, Moscato is a half-sibling to several other grape varieties including Aleatico, Moscato di Scanzo, Moscato Rosa del Trentino, Muscat of Alexandria and Muscat rouge de Mad√®re. As the vast majority of plantings of Moscato Giallo and its proliferation of siblings are found in northern Italy, ampelographers believe that the grape more likely originated in Italy than in the Middle East. Similarities in name and morphology often lead to Moscato Giallo being confused with other Muscat varieties such as with the Moscato bianco in Sicily and with Muscat Fleur d'Oranger (Orange Muscat) in the Euganean Hills of the Veneto wine region. Viticulture Moscato Giallo is an early to mid-ripening variety that can be very vigorous, producing a large leafy canopy that needs to be kept in check with pruning and canopy management. Its large, loose bunches of deep yellow, thick-skinned berries have some resistance to botrytis bunch rot, though its resistance to other fungal infections such as downy and powdery mildew is considered only \\"moderate\\". However, the vine is very susceptible to chlorosis, which is often seen in vineyard soils with low limestone content. This hazard can be managed with nutrient adjustments, particularly of iron, and Master of Wine Jancis Robinson notes that Moscato Giallo is often well suited for wine production when planted on calcareous slopes that by their nature have high lime and chalk content. Moscato Giallo is also susceptible to dead-arm, a fungal infection caused by members of the Phomopsis family. Wine regions Like many Muscat varieties, Moscato Giallo are often left to dry after harvest to produce sweet passito-style dessert wines. A bottle of Yellow muscat, halfsweet superior quality wine, produced in Meƒëimurje County, northern Croatia In 2000, there were of Moscato Giallo planted in Italy, most of it in the Lagarina Valley which includes the province of Trento. Here the grape is known as Goldmuskateller. It is also found in the nearby province of Bolzano and can be used to make varietal style wine in the Denominazione di Origine Controllata (DOC) zones of Trentino-Alto Adige/S√ºdtirol. In the Veneto and Friuli-Venezia Giulia, the grape is used to make both sparkling and passito-style dessert wines for the Corti Benedettine del Padovano and Friuli Isonzo DOCs, respectively. Outside of Italy, Moscato Giallo can be found in the Valais region of Switzerland, where the grape is known as Muscat du Pays. Here the grape is often found in field blends from vineyards inter-planted with Muscat blanc √† Petits Grains. Styles According to Jancis Robinson, Moscato Giallo tends to produce deeply colored, golden wines that have moderate acidity levels but are highly aromatic. The grape is often used to produce sweet dessert wines, often by the passito or \\"straw wine\\" method. The wine can be produced as a varietal but is sometimes blended with other Muscat varieties. Synonyms Over the years, Moscato Giallo has been known under a variety of synonyms including: Fior d'Arancio (in Padova), Goldenmuskateller (in Bolzano), Goldmuskateller, Moscat, Moscatel (in Trentino), Moscato Cipro, Moscato dalla Siria, Moscato Sirio, Moscato Siro, Muscat du Pays (in the Valais region of Switzerland), Muscat Italien, Muscat vert (in Valais), Muscatedda (in Sicily), Muscato de Goloio, Muskat Dzhiallo and Mu≈°kat ≈æuti.Vitis International Variety Catalogue (VIVC) Moscato Giallo Accessed: May 27th, 2014 References Category:White wine grape varieties ","title":"Moscato Giallo"},{"id":"14896070","text":"Prosper Bernard, S.J.

Nearly identical to the Black-backed Butterflyfish (C. melannotus), it differs only in the shape of the black mark on the caudal peduncle, in lacking a black mark on the chest, a lighter back, and in having an average of 14 rather than 15 pectoral fin rays. C. ocellicaudus belongs to the large subgenus Rabdophorus which might warrant recognition as a distinct genus. In this group, it appears to be a close relative of the Black-backed Butterflyfish and somewhat less close to the Yellow-dotted Butterflyfish (C. selene). These are all of oval shape, silvery with yellow fins and snout, ascending diagonal stripes, and black markings around the eyes, on the caudal peduncle, and sometimes on the back. Next closest seem the Saddle Butterflyfish (C. ephippium) and the Dotted Butterflyfish (C. semeion), but these are already so distant that their ancestors must have diverged from those soon after the Rabdophorus lineage started to diversify.Fessler & Westneat (2007), Hsu et al.

He was a People's Artist of the USSR, an academic at the Soviet Academy of Arts, and director of the Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts from 1944 to 1949. Merkurov was considered the greatest Soviet master of post-mortem masks.Vladica, Viorica (27 June 2003) Art of the Departed: Gyumri museum houses rare, if creepy, death masks. armenianow.com He was the sculptor of the three biggest monuments of Joseph Stalin in the USSR. He was the cousin of George Gurdjieff, a mystic and spiritual teacher. Biography 2006 Armenian stamp featuring Sergey Merkurov and his 1907 work Sergey Merkurov was born in Alexandrapol (modern Gyumri, Armenia). He left the Kiev Polytechnic Institute after a political scandal and moved to Switzerland, where he became a student of the Swiss sculptor Adolf Meyer. He attended art college in Germany (1902‚Äì05) and then entered the Auguste Rodin studio in Paris. Merkurov had met Vladimir Lenin when the revolutionary leader was living abroad, and listened to his speeches. Among many others, the statue of Lenin that stood in Lenin Square, Yerevan during Soviet times also was the work of Merkurov. Merkurov returned to the Russian Empire in 1907 as he was called by the Armenian Apostolic Church authorities to execute a post-mortem mask of Catholicos Mkrtich Khrimian. It was his first work of this kind. Then he lived in Tbilisi, Yalta, Moscow, and made post-mortem (death) masks of Leo Tolstoy, Hovhannes Tumanyan, Vladimir Lenin and his wife, Maxim Gorky, Vladimir Mayakovsky and other famous persons. The technique itself is not an easy process. The author pours plaster on the body's face and puts a thread in the middle of it. Then, another material like bronze or plaster is poured inside the mask and this is how an actual-size face of the deceased results. Merkurov was an outstanding representative of academic modern style, employing the themes of death and stone blocks. As a philosopher of the arts, Merkurov also used motifs of thought (Monument of Dostoevsky, 1911‚Äì1913; The figure- portrait of Thought, 1918). Merkurov was known as a free-thinker and an extraordinary person. He was a member of the \\"United Workers' Brotherhood\\", the Association of Painters of Revolutionary Russia and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. As director of the Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts, he saved the monument of Catherine the Great and secretly sent it to Yerevan, where it was hidden for decades and finally returned to Russia in 2006. For Joseph Stalin's 70th birthday, Merkurov made a special gift, a costly granite monument called \\"Death of the Leader\\". Stalin refused to accept it and a difficult period in the sculptor's life began. Merkurov was honored with burial at the Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow. In 1953 his Notes of a Sculptor was published. Merkurov Museum in Gyumri In 1984 the Merkurov Museum was opened in his family house in Gyumri. The post-mortem masks of 59 Soviet leaders and famous people are displayed in the museum, including the only original death mask of Lenin.

Attendance consists of both newly commissioned USAF officers (i.e., second lieutenants) and more senior commissioned USAF officers (e.g., first lieutenants or captains and, in very rare instances, majors) who previously served in non-rated non-flying assignments. IFT replaced three earlier programs at separate locations, known as: * Pilot Indoctrination Program (PIP), Initial Flight Training (IFT) or Academy Flight Training (AFT) for USAF Academy cadets, said program being conducted by military and civilian instructors at the USAF Academy Airfield; * Flight Indoctrination Program (FIP) for college/university Air Force ROTC cadets, said program being conducted by contracted civilian flight instructors at nearby civilian airports adjacent to those academic institutions, and; * Flight Screening Program Officer Training (FSPOT) at Hondo Municipal Airport, Texas for USAF Officer Training School graduates All three programs were originally for pilot candidates only, versus the current pilots and navigators-cum-CSOs, and only applied to pilot candidates who did not already hold at least an FAA Private Pilot Certificate. These programs were consolidated into the single current program, a civilian contractor operation under direct USAF auspices and oversight of the 12th Flying Training Wing (12 FTW) at Randolph AFB, Texas, and its subordinate 306th Flying Training Group (306 FTG) at the USAF Academy, Colorado. IFT is conducted at Pueblo Memorial Airport, Colorado and has the greatest similarity to the former FSPOT employed for OTS graduates, since it is conducted at a single site and all students are already commissioned USAF officers. IFT students must be undergraduate flying training (UFT) candidates and be medically qualified with a Federal Aviation Administration Class III airman medical certificate and a USAF Flying Class 1 or 1A flight physical, as appropriate. The IFT curriculum is highly structured and very fast-paced. The IFT program is under the direct cognizance of U.S. Air Force's 306th Flying Training Group (306 FTG) of the Air Education and Training Command (AETC), and began operations on 1 October 2006. Doss Aviation, under contract with United States Air Force (USAF), conducts flight screening for 1,300 to 1,700 USAF officers annually. As the gateway to USAF aviation, IFT provides initial flying training allowing students to successfully transition to the Euro-NATO Joint Jet Pilot Training Program (ENJJPT), Specialized Undergraduate Pilot Training (SUPT), Undergraduate Helicopter Pilot Training (UHT), and Undergraduate Combat Systems Officer Training (UCSOT) at one of several air force bases, naval air stations, and one army air field throughout the United States. The IFT campus is located immediately adjacent to the Pueblo Memorial Airport, Pueblo, Colorado. Students are paired up into hotel-style rooms. They share a bathroom, and are provided a desk and dresser for their personal belongings. A single building encompasses all the facilities the students need; students never need to step outside the facility except to access their aircraft. The large building houses the gym, which includes a workout gym with volleyball and basketball courts, weightlifting equipment and treadmills, as well as a cafeteria and a small communal room known as the Tiger Den. A large auditorium is used during the first week of training to teach students the basics of aviation. A second floor houses all the classrooms where students study and meet with their instructor pilots before performing their graded flights.

The MAOP is less than the MAWP (maximum allowable working pressure). MAWP is defined as the maximum pressure based on the design codes that the weakest component of a pressure vessel can handle. Commonly standard wall thickness components are used in fabricating pressurized equipment, and hence are able to withstand pressures above their design pressure. The MAWP is the pressure stamped on the pressure equipment, and the pressure that must not be exceeded in operation. Design pressure is the pressure a pressurized item is designed to, and is higher than any expected operating pressures. Due to the availability of standard wall thickness materials, many components will have a MAWP higher than the required design pressure. For pressure vessels, all pressures are defined as being at highest point of the unit in the operating position, and do not include static head pressure. The equipment designer needs to account for the higher pressures occurring at some components due to static head pressure. Relief valves are set at the design pressure of the pressurized item and sized to prevent the item under pressure from being over- pressurized. Depending on the design code that the pressurized item is designed, an over-pressure allowance can be used when sizing the relief valve. This is +10% for PD 5500, and ASME Section VIII div 1 & 2 (with an additional +10% allowance in ASME Section VIII for a fire relief case). ASME has different criteria for steam boilers. Maximum expected operating pressure (MEOP) is the highest expected operating pressure.

Schwartz (1947 ‚Äì December 31, 2018)Longtime ECE Faculty Member Eric Schwartz Mourned was Professor of Cognitive and Neural Systems, Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering,Boston University - ECE Department and Professor of Anatomy and Neurobiology at Boston University. Previously, he was Associate Professor of Psychiatry at New York University Medical Center and Associate Professor of Computer Science at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at New York University. He introduced the term Computational Neuroscience through the organization of a conference with this title which took place in Carmel California in 1985, under the sponsorship of the Systems Development Foundation. Encouraged by program director Charles Smith, this conference, whose proceedings were later published by MIT Press(1990), provided a summary of progress in the related fields which were till then referred to as neural networks, neural modeling, brain theory, theoretical neuroscience and a variety of other terms. Organizing these fields along the dimensions of spatial and temporal measurement, the conference, and its later publication in book form, introduced the use of the term \\"Computational Neuroscience\\". In the subsequent decades, dozens of University Departments and Programs have adopted this umbrella title. He founded Vision Applications, Inc. in 1990, with support from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), for the purpose of developing actuators, sensors and algorithms for miniaturized space-variant vision systems. Patents developed at Vision Applications included a novel spherically actuated motor , a CMOS VLSI log-plar sensor prototype and algorithms for real-time synthesis of space- variant images . This work culminated in the construction of a miniature autonomous vehicle which was the first vehicle to drive, unassisted by human backup, on the streets of Boston (1992) . Biography Eric Schwartz was born in New York City in 1947 to Jack and Edith Schwartz. He attended the Bronx High School of Science, Columbia College (majoring in Chemistry and Physics), where he was a member of the 1965 Ivy League, ECAC, and NCAA Championship Fencing Team (Saber), and Columbia University (PhD, High Energy Physics, spon. J. Steinberger [22]). Following completion of his physics degree, he joined the laboratory of E. Roy John as a post-doctoral fellow in neurophysiology, and moved with John's laboratory to New York University as a Research Associate Professor of Psychiatry in 1979 and was promoted to Associate Professor of Psychiatry and Computer Science in 1990, leaving for Boston University in 1992 to assume the positions of Professor of Cognitive and Neural Systems, Electrical and Computer Engineering, and Anatomy and Neurobiology. He lived in Brookline, Massachusetts with wife Helen and daughter Anna. Research =Visuotopic mapping in monkey and human visual cortex= Although it has been known since the turn of the century that the visual image recorded by the retina is relayed to visual cortex in the form of an orderly two dimensional pattern of neural firing (visuotopy, topographic mapping, retinotopy), the first two dimensional mathematical description of this mapping in primates was provided by Schwartz in 1976 and 1977 , and together with collaborators Al Wolf and Dave Christman he provided the first direct visualization of human cortical retinotopy via positron tomography . These theoretical papers demonstrated that the complex logarithmic mapping, the log-polar mapping, or the monopole mapping, was a good approximation to the retinotopy of monkey visual cortex, and was later extended to include a second logarithmic singularity to represent the peripheral visual representation, the dipole model This description, which is the current de facto standard model for the large scale functional architecture of visual cortex, was extended recently(2002‚Äì2006), with graduate students Mukund Balasubramanian and Jonathan Polimeni, to describe multiple areas of human and monkey visual cortex‚Äîthe wedge dipole mapping . This model has been verified for human visual cortex , together with Jon Polimeni, Oliver Hinds, Mukund Balasubramanian and colleagues Bruce Fischl and Larry Wald, using high resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging, establishing the wedge- dipole model as one of the very few mathematical models of neuroantaomical structure with a detailed experimental verification. =Computerized brain flattening= A critical aspect of this work was the development of methods of brain flattening. The first fully accurate method of cortical flattening was developed by Schwartz in 1986, based on the computation of exact minimal geodesic distances on a polyhedral mesh representing the cortical surface , together with metric multidimensional scaling . Variants of this algorithm, especially the recent improvements contributed in the thesis work of Mukund Balasubramanian (see ) underlie most current quantitatively accurate approaches to cortical flattening. =Cortical columnar structure= Orientation vortices In 1977, Schwartz pointed out that the hypercolumn model of Hubel and Weisel implied the existence of a periodic vortex like pattern of orientation singularities across the surface of visual cortex. Specifically, the angular part of the complex logarithm function, viewed as a spatial map provided a possible explanation of the hypercolumn structure, which in current language is termed the \\"pinwheel\\" structure of visual cortex . In 1990, together with Alan Rojer, Schwartz showed that such \\"vortex\\" or \\"pinwheel\\" structures, together with the associated ocular dominance column pattern in cortex, could be caused by spatial filtering of random vector or scalar spatial noise, respectively. Prior to this work, most modeling of cortical columns was in terms of somewhat opaque and clumsy \\"neural network\\" models‚Äîbandpass-filtered noise quickly became a standard modeling technique for cortical columnar structure. In 1992, Rojer and Schwartz demonstrated that the formation of cortical orientation vortices was a topological consequence of the definition of orientation‚Äîany local correlation, including low-pass filtering, would cause apparent \\"vortex\\" formation . This observation was later used, via monte-carlo simulation of photon scattering in brain tissue, to demonstrate that much of modern optical recording \\"pin-wheel\\" structure is significantly contaminated by artifact due to the topological production and annihilation of spurious cortical pin- wheels, due to the low-pass nature of current optical recording, which has an intrinsic physical smoothing in the range of 300 micrometres . =Space variant active computer vision= In addition to this work in brain imaging and functional neuroanatomy, Schwartz has developed a number of algorithms and robotic devices, related to the field of space-variant computer vision. The key motivation for this work is the observations of detailed spatial structure in biological visual systems, related to the strongly space-variant (i.e. foveal) architecture. Algorithms for space-variant computer vision and non- linear diffusion have been developed together with students Giorgio Bonmassar[20], Bruce Fischl [19], and Leo Grady [21]. Unpublished work by George Kierstein was completed during their doctoral degree program before completion upon graduating with a Masters [See External Links for Bio].

In the horse, it is most commonly caused by pain, but can be due to neurologic or mechanical dysfunction. Lameness is a common veterinary problem in racehorses, sport horses, and pleasure horses. It is one of the most costly health problems for the equine industry, both monetarily for the cost of diagnosis and treatment, and for the cost of time off resulting in loss-of-use.Seitzinger AH, Traub-Dargatz JL, Kane AJ, Kopral CA, Morley PS, Garber LP, Losinger WC, & Hill GW. \\"Comparison of the Economic Costs of Equine Lameness, Colic, and Equine Protozoal Myeloencephalitis (EPM)\\". Proc. ISVEE, 2000, Vol. 9. Causes of lameness Lameness is most commonly caused by pain, but may also be the result of neuromuscular disease or mechanical restriction. Lameness itself is a clinical sign, and not a diagnosis. Trauma is a common cause of lameness in horses. =Pain= Pain is the most common cause of lameness in the horse. It is usually the result of trauma or orthopedic disease, but other causes such as metabolic dysfunction, circulatory disease, and infection can also cause pain and subsequent lameness. Orthopedic causes of lameness are very common and may be the result of damage to the hoof, bone, joints, or soft tissue. Horses are predisposed to orthopedic lameness by conformational flaws, poor hoof balance, working on poor footing, repetitive movements, poor conditioning for a given activity, and competing at a very high athletic level. Metabolic causes of lameness include hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (HYPP) and polysaccharide storage myopathy, which directly affect muscular function. Circulatory causes of lameness occur when blood flow to an area is compromised. This may be due to abnormal blood clotting, as in the case of aortic-iliac thrombosis, or decreased blood flow (ischemia) to an area, such as is sometimes seen in laminitis. Infectious causes of lameness are the result of inflammation and damage to tissue. These include problems such as cellulitis, hoof abscesses, and septic arthritis. =Mechanical lameness= Mechanical lameness is caused by a physical abnormality, such as scar tissue, that prevents normal motion of a limb. Mechanical lameness does not cause pain. Classic examples of mechanical lameness include upward fixation of the patella and fibrotic myopathy, but any type of adhesion (often secondary to scarring during healing post-injury) or fibrosis can cause mechanical lameness. * Upward fixation of the patella occurs when the normal locking mechanism of the stifle, which allows the horse to \\"lock\\" its hind legs into a fixed position so it may stand with minimal effort, engages at inappropriate times such as when the horse is walking. It results in an inability to flex the stifle, so the horse must walk with an extended hind leg. It is associated with straight hind limb conformation (post leg), poor muscling of the hind limb, stifle trauma, and genetics. * Fibrotic myopathy is caused by damage to the hamstring muscles, usually from trauma or intramuscular injection. It results in the formation of scar tissue and produces a characteristic gait where the horse prematurely \\"slaps\\" the ground with its hind foot, shortening the stride length in the damaged leg. =Neurological lameness= Neurologic lameness may be the result of infection, trauma, toxicities, or congenital disease. Neurological evaluation of a lame horse may be warranted if the cause of the lameness is not obvious. Signs more commonly associated with a neurologic cause include unilateral muscle atrophy, paresis, paralysis, or dysmetria. Neurologic causes of lameness include: * Cervical vertebral stenotic myopathy (Wobbler disease): compression of the spinal cord in the cervical (neck) region results in lameness, ataxia, and change in gait, especially in the hind legs, and neck stiffness or pain. * Stringhalt: caused by damage to the long digital extensor muscle, or from eating the weed Hypochaeris radicata; it produces a gait characterized by rapid, spasmodic hyperflexion of the hind limbs. * Shivers: a rare neuromuscular disorder characterized by muscle tremors, difficulty picking up the hind feet when asked to lift for farriery work, hyperflexion or hyperextension of the hind limbs, and abduction of the hind limbs. Normal athletic function is often maintained, at least initially. * Cerebellar abiotrophy: a rare genetic disorder that occurs in Arabian horses, producing ataxia, a base-wide stance, proprioceptive deficits, and high-stepping gait. * Damage to individual nerves will affect the muscles they innervate and subsequently alter gait. Radial nerve paralysis will cause a dropped elbow and make it difficult to extend the affected limb. Suprascapular nerve damage will lead to atrophy of the main muscles of the shoulder (sweeny). Femoral nerve paralysis causes hyperflexion of the stifles, hocks, and fetlocks and the horse usually walks on the toe of the hind foot. * Infectious causes affecting the nervous system may be bacterial, viral, protozoal, or rickettsial. Those that commonly alter gait include tetanus, botulism, Lyme disease, equine protozoal myeloencephalitis (EPM), rabies, West Nile virus, equine encephalitis virus, and equine herpesvirus 1. * Neoplasic (cancerous) changes in the brain or around the spinal cord may also cause alterations in gait. Signs of lameness Manifestations of lameness include any alteration in gait from what is normal for the horse. In general, it is harder to detect hind limb lameness when compared to lameness in a front limb when using visual cues. =Identifying a front limb lameness= The classic sign of lameness in a front leg is a prominent \\"head bob.\\" Viewed from the side, the horse raises its head and neck when the lame leg hits the ground, which helps to unload the lame leg. This is sometimes remembered by the adage \\"down on sound.\\" A head bob is usually easy to see when one leg is lame, but can be subtle in very mild unilateral lameness, or in the case of bilateral front limb lameness. A horse may also try to reduce impact on a lame front leg by tensing of the muscles of the shoulder. In this case, it will stiffen the limb just before it hits the ground, a sign that may be noticed by an astute observer. =Identifying a hind limb lameness= Evaluation of hind limb lameness can be difficult. Generally, the viewer watches the hip, sacrum, gluteal muscles, or hemi-pelvis (pelvis of one side of the body) when examining lameness in the hind end. Examination should be performed both watching the horse from behind while trotting away from the examiner, and from the side as the horse passes. When watching from behind, the viewer often looks for a \\"hip hike\\" or \\"pelvic hike.\\" This occurs when the horse raises the pelvis on the lame side as it is bearing weight, trying to shift weight off of the painful leg in a manner similar to raising of the head in front limb lameness. This is a sudden, short upward motion of the hemi-pelvis or gluteal muscles. The hip of the lame leg does not always rise above the level of the hip of the sound leg, which can be confusing to those looking for a \\"hip hike.\\" Instead, it is an exaggerated upward movement that is watched for during weight bearing. Additionally, horses with a hind limb lameness will tend to reduce the degree of leg use. To do so, some horses will reduce the contraction time of the gluteals on the side of the lame leg, leading to a \\"hip roll\\" or \\"hip dip\\" and appearance that the hip drops a greater degree on the side of the lame leg. These apparently contradictory statements (\\"hip hike\\" vs \\"hip drop\\" on the lame leg) can be explained by when the horse perceives pain during the stride. If the pain is perceived during the early stance phase of the stride, the horse will try to unweight the leg and produce a \\"hip hike.\\" If the pain is perceived during the pushoff phase of the stride, the horse does not push with as much force, subsequently reducing the height the pelvis is raised, and leading to a \\"dipping\\" motion during the swing phase of the stride as the horse brings the limb forward. In some cases, both a hip hike and a hip drop can be seen in the same horse.Keegan KG. Head Nods and Hip Hikes. Western Veterinary Conference 2013. Some practitioners simply look for the side with the greater overall deviation, which occurs in the lame leg Another method to detecting hind limb lameness requires watching the pelvis from the side. The entire pelvis is evaluated, and its relative position vertically (relative to the ground) is compared at various points in the stride. The pelvis normally rises and falls with each step. Horses with pain during the early stance phase of the trot will not allow the pelvis to drop as much when the lame leg is weighted, trying to avoid extra weight on the painful leg. Subsequently, the pelvis will not fall as much downward when the lame leg is bearing weight as when the sound leg is bearing weight. When viewed from behind, this is seen as a \\"hip hike.\\" If the horse is more painful as it is pushing off a limb, it will not push off with as much force, and the pelvis will rise less on the lame side relative to the same point of the stride when the sound leg is on the ground. This is seen as the \\"hip roll\\" when viewed from behind. Other signs that indicate hind limb lameness include \\"plaiting\\" with the hind feet, which can be seen in cases of sacro-iliac pain, carrying the hindquarters to one side or drifting in one direction,Dyson SJ. \\"Lameness Associated with the Stifle and Pelvic Regions. Proc. AAEP, 2002; Vol. 48; 387-411. decreased impulsion, and the saddle slip to one side. =Other signs of lameness= Several other signs are applicable to both front and hind limb lameness. One method is to look at the relative time a leg spends in the cranial (forward) phase of the stride. For a front leg, this is when the lower leg is in front of the horse, i.e. angled forward, while the caudal phase is when the leg is underneath the horse, i.e. angled backward. For a hind leg, the cranial phase occurs when the lower leg is under the body of the horse, and the caudal phase is when the limb is out behind the body of the horse. A normal horse with have a cranial phase and a caudal phase of equal length: the horse will bring the leg as far forward as it does backward. In a lame horse, the cranial phase will be shorter when compared to the caudal phase, so it appears to spend more time with the leg backward than it does forward. A shortened cranial phase is most commonly seen in cases of bilateral lameness, lameness of the upper limb (such as shoulder or hip pain), and osteoarthritis of the hocks. Decreased fetlock drop during the stance phase of the stride may be seen in cases of lameness, with the lamer leg producing less drop than the sound leg as the horse tries to relieve weight on the painful limb. Decreased height to the stride (flight arc), or dragging of the toes, also indicates lameness, as the horse avoids bending its joints.Clayton, Hillary. Cinematographic analysis of the gait of lame horses IV: Degenerative joint disease of the distal intertarsal joint. . J Equin Vet. Sc. 1986; 7(5): 274‚Äì278. In the front limb, decreased flight arc is usually seen in cases of shoulder, knee, or fetlock joint pain, and is often associated with reduced cranial phase and lengthened caudal phase of the stride. At times, lameness may be heard. Usually the horse has a stronger, louder sound on the beat where the sound hooves hits the ground, but a softer, less resonate sound occurring on the beat where the lame leg is hitting the ground. Again, this is because the horse is landing with less force as it tries to avoid weighting the painful leg. Lastly, behavioral changes and decreased performance may indicate pain, even if obvious clinical lameness is not evident. The lameness evaluation A lameness exam is used to try to pinpoint the cause of lameness in the horse, which subsequently guides treatment. It is the first step to evaluate decreased performance in an equine athlete, even if the horse does not appear overtly lame, to rule out any pain- associated cause. Lameness exams are also a key component of the pre-purchase examination. These examinations evaluate the horse to give the potential buyer information regarding present soundness of the horse. Veterinarians may comment on aspects that could inhibit the use of the horse for the buyer's intended activity, such as subclinical osteoarthritis or conformational defects. However, the veterinarian is not there to \\"pass\\" or \\"fail\\" a horse, but only to give their impression of the horse on that day. Therefore, pre- purchase examinations make no guarantees of the future health or soundness of the horse. The pre-purchase exam may range in scope depending on the desire of the buyer, from a simple examination with hoof and flexion tests, to multiple radiographs, ultrasound, and advanced imaging techniques including MRI. =History= A detailed history is the first step of a lameness exam. #Age: Foals are more likely to have infectious causes of lameness (septic arthritis). Horses just starting training may be lame due to a developmental orthopedic disease, such as osteochondrosis. Older animals are more likely to experience osteoarthritis. #Breed: Breed-specific diseases, such as hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (HYPP), can be ruled out. Additionally, some breeds or types are more prone to certain types of lameness. #Discipline: Certain lamenesses are associated with certain uses. For example, racehorses are more likely to have fatigue-related injuries such as stress fractures and injury to the flexor tendons, while western show horses are more likely to suffer from navicular syndrome and English sport horses are more likely to have osteoarthritis or injury to the suspensory ligament. #Past history of lameness: An old injury may be re-injured. In the case of progressive disease, such as osteoarthritis, a horse will often experience recurrent lameness that must be managed. Shifting lameness may suggest a bilateral injury or infectious cause of lameness. #Duration and progression the lameness: Acute injury is more common with soft tissue injury. Chronic, progressive disease is more common in cases such as osteoarthritis and navicular disease. #Recent changes in management: such as turn-out, exercise level, diet, or shoeing. #Effect of exercise on degree of lameness. #Any treatment implemented, including rest. =Physical examination and palpation= Splints can be palpated on physical examination. One of the first steps of the lameness examination is to evaluate the horse at rest. A good evaluation of conformation, including overall body type, can help the practitioner determine the potential cause of lameness. Certain conformational defects can predispose a horse to injury, and knowledge of correct conformation can help narrow down possible causes of injury, especially when combined with the horse's history. The horse's stance is also evaluated. Frequently resting a particular leg, \\"pointing\\" a foot (holding a leg out in front of the body), or standing in an abnormal position can indicate compensation for an injury. Shifting of weight is normal in the hind legs, but frequent shifting of weight in the front legs, or placing both front feet in front of the body, can indicate bilateral forelimb lameness. Stifle pain sometimes causes a horse to stand with the stifles rotated out. Hip and pelvic pain can produce a toe-out, stifle out, hock-in stance and that remains present at the walk. Asymmetry of the muscular structure, due to muscle atrophy, usually occurs on the side of the lame limb. Hind limb lameness or pelvic fracture can cause unilateral atrophy of the middle gluteal or gracilis muscles. Damage to the suprascapular nerve can lead to atrophy of the muscles of the shoulder (supraspinatus and infraspinatus). Neck muscle atrophy can be seen with cervical vertebral malformation (Wobbler's disease), articular facet osteoarthritis, and neurologic causes of lameness. Asymmetry in a limb can also occur due to swelling of a joint or soft tissue. For this reason, each leg should be compared to its partner. After a visual exam, the practitioner palpates the horse, feeling for heat, swelling, and sensitivity to pressure indicating pain. Palpation is usually most thoroughly performed in the lower limb, but a comprehensive exam will include palpation of the back, pelvis, and neck. Joints should be palpated for pain, effusion of joint pouches, thickening of the joint capsule, and checked for range of motion. Major ligaments and tendons, such as the superficial and deep digital flexor tendons, inferior check ligament, suspensory ligament, and distal sesamoidean ligaments, should also be palpated along their entire length. Individual bones may be palpated if injury is suspected, such as a fracture, bucked shins in racehorses (cannon bones), or splints (splint bones). Specialized manipulative tests can be used to help identify specific areas of pain: * The Churchill test: pressure is applied to the plantar surface of the head of the medial splint bone. A painful horse will flex and abduct the limb, indicating hock pain. * Peroneus tertius rupture: The hock is pulled into extension while the stifle is flexed. A positive test (the ability to extend the hock) indicates a ruptured peroneus tertius muscle. * Patella displacement: the patella is pushed laterally and proximally, to test for upward fixation of the patella. * Cruciate test: the examiner moves the tibia sharply caudally, to feel for movement away from the femur or crepitus. Excessive movement can indicate cruciate rupture. * Test for stifle collateral ligament damage: the stifle is held still, while the distal limb is abducted (to test for damage to the medial collateral ligament) or adducted (to test for lateral collateral ligament damage). Excessive movement by the distal limb relative to the stifle suggests rupture of the collateral ligament. Sprain of these ligaments can be evaluated by repeating this test multiple times, before trotting the horse off an looking for lameness. =Evaluation of the hoof= The majority of lameness originates in the hoof. For this reason, the hoof is closely scrutinized in shape, balance, shoeing, wear pattern, and for the presence of cracks, and contracted or sheared heels. Chronic lameness often causes an upright hoof capsule. Chronic lameness will change the shape of the hoof capsule, since the lame limb is not weighted as much as its partner, making the capsule more upright, narrow, with a higher heel on the lame limb and more flattened on the sound one. Hoof or horseshoe wear can indicate breakover and if the horse is dragging its toes. Change in shape of the hoof wall is also common in horses suffering from laminitis. \\"Founder rings,\\" or thickened concentric rings in the hoof wall, indicate a past episode of laminitis. Concavity of the dorsal (front) surface of the hoof can indicate chronic laminitis. The sole may become convex if the coffin bone begins to push through the bottom of the hoof.Lucas, Don (1963) \\"Laminitis,\\" Iowa State University Veterinarian: Vol. 26: Iss. 3, Article 7. Available at: http://lib.dr.iastate.edu/iowastate_veterinarian/vol26/iss3/7 Correct hoof balance allows for even distribution of forces through the leg and hoof. Poor hoof balance, due to conformational flaws or poor trimming, can cause lameness from musculoskeletal injury, and poor hoof balance has been associated with increased risk of catastrophic injury in racehorses. Side-to-side (mediolateral) imbalance can cause sheared heals and hoof cracks. The hoof angle, or the angle of the hoof wall relative to the pastern, has been associated with health of the soft tissues of the lower leg. Long toes force the horse to pivot (break over) further forward over the toe. The toe acts as a lever arm, and its increased length makes it harder for the heels to rotate off the ground. This increases strain on the deep digital flexor tendon and the ligaments of the navicular bone. An abscess has ruptured out of the coronary band of this horse. The bottom of the hoof should also be examined. The shape of the sole, size of the frog, and shape of the bars can indicate overall health of the hoof. Holes in heel bulb usually indicate a hoof abscess that has ruptured. The horse's shoeing can also provide clues to the examiner. The application of corrective shoes or pads may indicate past problems requiring special shoeing. This can be especially helpful during the pre- purchase exam, when the lameness history of the horse may not be readily available. Digital pulse evaluation is important when addressing the hoof. An increased digital pulse often indicates that the lesion is in the foot, and are usually most significantly increased in horses with laminitis. The coronary band may also be palpated. Cool swelling can indicate coffin joint effusion, swelling with an increase in temperature can indicate laminitis, firm swelling can occur with ringbone, and a localized swelling with pain can indicate an abscess. Examiners will also \\"hoof test\\" each foot by applying a metal instrument that squeezes the foot to test for deep pain. Diffuse sensitivity occurs with fracture or infection of the coffin bone, and laminitis. More localized sensitivity can be found with sole bruises, puncture wounds, hoof abscesses, and hot nails. Sensitivity over the middle third of the frog is consistent with navicular syndrome, but can also occur with sheared heels. To distinguish these two, the hoof testers may be applied over the heels, which will be sensitive in the case of any heel-related pain, such as sheared, contracted, or bruised heels. The hoof wall may also be percussed (struck with a hammer), which will produce a positive response in cases of hoof cracks that are causing the horse pain, laminitis, or a gravel (hoof abscess travelling up the hoof wall towards the coronary band). =Evaluation in motion= Horses are usually trotted on a straight line to evaluate lameness. The horse is evaluated in motion, usually at the walk and trot, but occasionally also in the canter. The walk is often the best gait to evaluate foot placement. The trot is generally the best gait to localize the lameness to a particular leg, because it is a symmetrical gait where the front half of the horse and the back half move in unison. The canter may also be used for lameness evaluation. Resistance to picking up the canter or to engage the hind end can suggest pain in the sacro-iliac joint, pelvis, or hind leg. Lameness may be accentuated under certain conditions. Therefore, the moving examination is often performed both in a straight line and on a circle, and may be repeated on different footings. Hard footing tends to make joint and bone injury more apparent, while soft, deep footings tend to accentuate soft tissue injury. Circles may accentuate a lameness when the lame leg is on the inside or outside of the circle.Starke, Sandra D., et al. \\"Vertical head and trunk movement adaptations of sound horses trotting in a circle on a hard surface.\\" The Veterinary Journal 2012; 193(1): 73‚Äì-80. At times, it may be helpful to evaluate the horse under saddle, since the weight of the rider can accentuate lameness. In cases of decreased performance, it can be useful to watch a horse performing certain discipline-specific movements, which may be the only time the rider notices a change in the horse's abilities. Gait is evaluated for symmetry. This includes the overall fluidity of the horse's motion, length of stride, loading of a leg, how the hoof lands on the ground (flat, toe, or heel-first), range of motion of the joints, deviations in body position, and position of the head and neck. The first evaluation of the horse is used to determine the severity of lameness and to help pinpoint which part of the body may be affected. The process of watching a horse move is repeated after each additional flexion test or nerve block to determine its effect on the animal. =Grading lameness= Lameness is graded on a scale. This allows the practitioner to help quantify a lameness in order to determine relative severity, assess the degree of change after flexion tests or nerve blocks, and to determine the improvement of lameness over time once treatment has been implemented. The most commonly used scale in the United States is a 1‚Äì-5 scale of the American Association of Equine Practitioners (AAEP). Other scales are more commonly used outside of the United States, including a 1‚Äì10 scale in the United Kingdom. AAEP Lameness Grading Scale Non-weight bearing lameness (grade 5) is most commonly the result of a hoof abscess. While very painful, most hoof abscesses are quite treatable and do not cause long-term lameness. However, fractures and septic synovial structures (such as an infected joint pouch or tendon sheath) can also cause non-weight bearing lameness, and require emergency evaluation and treatment by a veterinarian. Therefore, non- weight bearing lameness should be assessed by an equine professional in a timely manner, especially if it is associated with trauma, laceration, or recent joint injection. =Flexion tests= Flexion tests are a diagnostic tool involving the application of sustained pressure on a particular set of joints. The limb is forcibly flexed for between 30 seconds and 3 minutes, depending on the joint and practitioner preference, and the horse is immediately trotted off. An increase in lameness following a flexion test suggests that those joints or surrounding soft tissue structures may be a source of pain for the horse. Flexion tests help narrow down the source of lameness to a certain part of the leg, but they are non-specific because they almost always affect more than one joint and because they also affect the soft tissue structures around the joint, not just the joint itself. Additionally, they must be interpreted carefully due to the risk of false negatives and false positives. =Regional limb anesthesia (nerve blocks)= Nerve blocks involve injecting a small amount of local anesthetic around a nerve or into a synovial structure (such as a joint or tendon sheath) in order to block the perception of pain in a specific area. After the substance is injected, it is given a few minutes to take effect. The block is then tested by pushing a blunt object, such as a ballpoint pen, into the area that is supposed to be desensitized. If the horse does not react to this pressure, the area is desensitized, and the horse is trotted to see if the lameness has improved. Improvement indicates that the cause of lameness was from a structure desensitized by the nerve block. Nerve blocks are performed in a step-wise fashion, beginning at the most distal (lower) part of the limb and moving upward. This is due to the fact that blocking a nerve higher up will desensitize everything it innervates distal to the blocking location. For example, blocking the leg at the level of the fetlock will also block the entire foot, since the nerve fibers that innervate the foot are inhibited when they travel through the fetlock area. A positive result from this block will not be able to differentiate foot pain from pain in the pastern or fetlock region. More information may be gained from blocking the foot first, then the fetlock, since it allows for greater specificity in determining the cause of lameness. The duration of the anesthetic varies depending on the substance used. Lidocaine is especially short acting, and is therefore usually not used for lameness evaluations. The longer-acting anesthetic mepivacaine is most- commonly used for nerve blocks,Andreen, D.S., Trumble, T.N., Caron, J.P., Decamp, C.E., Hauptman, J. and Stick, J.A. (1994) Onset and duration of action of intra-articular mepivacaine in the horse. Proc. Am. Ass. equine Practnrs. 40, 151. because ideally the block should last throughout the lameness exam to avoid false positives with subsequent blocks as they are performed up the leg. Bupivicaine is very long-lasting (up to 4‚Äì6 hours), and is most commonly used for analgesia following surgery rather than for nerve blocks. Although nerve blocks are very important to the lameness examination, they are not foolproof. Multiple studies have shown that the anesthetic can migrate, especially if the horse is evaluated long after blocking or if a large amount of anesthetic is used. If the anesthetic migrates to the structure that is causing the horse pain, the horse will have a positive block, and the examiner will conclude that the lameness originates in an area that is not actually causing the horse discomfort. False results can also be secondary to practitioner error if the anesthetic is accidentally administered into a location that was unintended, such as a synovial structure rather than around a nerve. Additionally, individual horses have variation in their neural anatomy, and if atypical patterns are present, a given block may block an area unintended by the examiner, leading to false positives. Joints present additional problems. A large volume of anesthetic placed into a joint can diffuse out over time, blocking the surrounding structures.Pleaseant RS, Moll HD, Ley WB, et al. Intra-articular analgesia of the DIP joint alleviates lameness associated with the navicular bursa in horses. Vet Surg 1997; 26:137-\`140. Additionally, there are some cases where joint pain can respond better to perineural blocking rather than blocking of the joint. =Objective Lameness Detection and Localization = There is relatively low agreement between practitioners trying to identify a lame leg when lameness is mild using subjective visual cues. Additional methods of detection and quantification of lameness can therefore be helpful. Several systems are in use and under development for this purpose, both in research and clinical practice. Among these are the Lameness Locator system based on uniaxial accelerometers, the Equigate system based on six degrees of freedom inertial measurement units, the Equinalysis system, and the motion capture based Qhorse system http://qfl.qualisys.com/#/project/qhorse-straight-line-lameness-analysis Diagnostic tests =Radiographs and Ultrasound= Radiographs are commonly used to evaluate lameness in the lower limb. The most common forms of diagnostic imaging for use during a lameness exam are radiographs (\\"x-rays\\"), to evaluate bone and joint lesions, and ultrasound, to evaluate soft tissue lesions. These modalities are best applied if the general location of lameness is known from flexion tests and nerve blocks. These methods are both non- invasive and relatively cheap. Radiographs (\\"x-rays\\") are made by photons, produced by a generator, that have hit a piece of x-ray film. This film is then exposed to produce an image. The photons that hit the film are actually those that have been reflected, rather than absorbed, by the animal's body. Different tissue types absorb photons to varying degrees, leading to differing levels of darkness (radiodensity) on the x-ray film. An anatomical structure is delineated by comparing its radiodensity those tissues surrounding it. Interpretation of a radiograph therefore requires the surrounding structures to have enough of a difference in radiodensity to allow it to stand out. While this is obvious in tissue such as bone, soft tissues of the leg do not stand out well on radiographs. Therefore, radiographs are best used to evaluate boney changes rather than soft tissue damage. One exception of this rule is the use of contrast, injected into synovial structures, which allows these structures to stand out on radiographs. Common uses for radiographs are to evaluate for suspected fractures, bone chips, laminitis, and navicular changes. Ultrasound measures the reflection of high frequency sound waves off of tissues. Different tissues absorb or reflect ultrasonic waves to different degrees, which may be picked up by the machine and turned into an image. Because ultrasound does not easily cross bone or air, it is best used for the evaluation of soft-tissue structures. It is therefore a complementary imaging modality to radiographs, and is most commonly used to look for injury to ligaments and tendons, and the navicular bursa, although muscle damage and arterial blood flow have also been evaluated with ultrasound in cases of lameness.Genovese RL, Rantanen NW, Hauser ML, Simpson BS. The Veterinary Clinics of North America. Equine Practice [1986, 2(1):145-226] Ultrasound is especially useful for determining the size and shape of lesions within structures, allowing quantification of an injury. Ultrasound may be used after diagnosis, to monitor the progression of healing of a lesion. It is also used to guide injections of treatments (steroids, stems cells, platelet rich plasma) directly into a lesion.Fortier LA, Smith RK. Regenerative medicine for tendinous and ligamentous injuries of sport horses. Vet Clin North Am Equine Pract. 2008 Apr;24(1):191-201. =Nuclear Scintigraphy= Nuclear scintigraphy, or the \\"bone scan,\\" involves injecting a radioactive substance, often technetium-99, into the horse and then measuring uptake, which is strongest in the areas of rapid bone remodeling. The bone scan is often useful for lameness that can't be easily localized to one area, that affects multiple limbs, or lameness that is thought to originate in areas not easily imaged by other means, such as the vertebral column. Although it provides localization for lameness, it does not give a definitive diagnosis.Winter MD, Berry CR, Reese DJ. Nuclear scintigraphy in horses. Compend Contin Educ Vet. 2010 Dec; 32 (12):E5. The availability of this modality is more limited relative to radiographs and ultrasound, and usually requires referral to a secondary care facility. Additionally, the horse must stay for a short period of time until it is no longer radioactive. It is relatively non-invasive, requiring an initial injection of the radioisotope, and sedation throughout the procedure. The bone scan offers several advantages over traditional radiographs. In some cases, it may be more sensitive due to the fact that some lesions are only apparent on radiographs after they have become chronic. The bone scan allows imaging of the pelvis, vertebral column, and upper limbs, which are areas that are usually poorly imaged by radiographs on the adult horse, due to their size. It also allows some evaluation of soft tissue, which is generally not imaged well by radiographs. =Computed Tomography= Computed tomography (CT) is an imaging modality that produces a 3-dimensional radiograph. A series of plain radiographs are taken in a spiral around the site of interest, and the individual 2-D radiographs are converted into a 3-D image by a computer. The image may be manipulated to view in different planes, such as cross-section, making it possible to see an injury from multiple perspectives and improving diagnostic capabilities when compared to plain radiographs. Like plain radiographs, CT is not as useful for soft tissue lesions when compared to boney lesions. However, CT requires general anesthesia, and is more costly and less available than plain radiographs, limiting its use in general practice. CT provides a large amount of data with exceptional speed, taking only seconds to minutes to complete. When compared to MRI, it is not only significantly faster (MRI takes 1‚Äì2 hours to produce an image), but also less expensive. Its combination of speed and imaging capabilities makes it beneficial for use prior to orthopedic surgery, especially in the case of complicated fractures, as it allows for visualization from all sides so that the surgeon may determine the best approach and method of correction prior to cutting. Upon completion of the CT, the horse may be rolled straight into the surgery suite for immediate surgical treatment. Advances in technology now also allows for a robotic scanner to rapidly image different parts the standing horse without the need for general anesthesia. =Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)= Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) produces a 3-dimensional image that allows for exceptional evaluation of soft tissue structures, as well as the detection of boney change and the presence of excessive fluid accumulation associated with inflammation. Like CT, an MRI image may be viewed in various planes of orientation, improving visualization of anatomic structures and any associated pathologic change. MRI is considered the gold standard for diagnosing soft tissue injury within the foot. While it can provide a definitive diagnosis in cases where other imaging modalities have failed, it does have several limitations. Available magnet size restricts imaging to the level of the stifle or elbow, or below. MRI takes a significant amount of time acquire an image, which translates to long anesthesia times and therefore reduces the size of the area that may be imaged in a single session. The area thought to be associated with lameness must be placed in the MRI. MRI is therefore inappropriate for any lameness that can not be localized to a specific region of the limb. Additionally, MRI has limited availability and high cost compared to the other imaging modalities. Horses may undergo standing MRI, where the horse is sedated and imaged with a low-field magnet (0.27 Tesla), or it may be placed in a high-field magnet (1.5 or 3 Tesla) while under general anesthesia. Low-field magnets produce less resolutionMitchell RD, Edwards RB, Makkreel LD, Oliveira TD. \\"Standing MRI Lesions Identified in Jumping and Dressage Horses With Lameness Isolated to the Foot. Proc. AAEP 2006; Vol. 52; 422-426. and the subtle swaying of the standing horse leads to motion artifact (blurring of the image), especially in the case of the knee or hock, leading to reduced image quality. However, standing MRI tends to be cheaper, and it eliminates the risks of general anesthesia, such as further damage to the injured area or additional injury that may occur during anesthetic recovery. =Thermography = Thermography, or thermal imaging, measures the heat gradient of skin by detection of infrared radiation. Because heat is a cardinal sign of inflammation, thermal imaging can be used to detect inflammation that may be the cause of lameness, and at times discover a subclinical injury. When used, horses must be placed in an area free of sunlight exposure, drafts, or other sources of outside heat, and hair length should be uniform in the area imaged. Benefits include non-invasiveness and the potential for early identification of injury, and detection of early contralateral limb injury in the case of orthopedic patients. =Blood or synovial fluid testing= Infection of synovial structures, such as in fistulous withers, should be cultured. Blood and synovial fluid may be tested for pathogens in the case of infected synovial structures. Both cytology and bacterial culture can be used to help identify the cause of infection. In adult horses, septic arthritis or tenosynovitis are most commonly seen secondary to joint injection, penetrating injury, or following surgery, and are often from Staphylococcus infection. Foals often develop septic arthritis secondary to systemic infection and hematogenous spread to the joints. =Arthroscopy= Arthroscopy involves placing a small camera through a hole into a joint or other synovial structure. It requires general anesthesia, but allows thorough visualization of the synovial membrane and articular cartilage. Treatment may often be performed at the same time. Arthroscopy is most commonly used for chip fractures of the knee and fetlock joints, osteochondritis dessecans lesions, and proliferative synovitis. =Body-Mounted Inertial Sensor Systems= Inertial Sensor Systems (ISS) generally refer to wireless inertial sensors (accelerometers and gyroscopes) transmitting precision movement data back to a computer. Asymmetry of motion can be measured using ISS attached to the horse's body. A computer application then quantifies lameness by measuring the asymmetry of movement between left and right sides of the body. Some more sophisticated computer applications are able to determine the limb or limbs involved and the point in the stride cycle that the horse is differentially unloading the limb. Treatment Appropriate treatment for lameness depends on the condition diagnosed, but at a minimum it usually includes rest or decreased activity and anti-inflammatory medications. Other treatment options, such as corrective shoeing, joint injections, and regenerative therapies, are pursued based on the cause of lameness and the financial limits of the owner. Consultation with a veterinarian is generally recommended, even for mild cases, as some types of lameness may worsen if not properly diagnosed and treated. Horseman‚Äôs terms for lameness or blemishes Various horseman's terms have evolved over the years to describe common lamenesses or blemishes (defects that do not cause lameness) in horses. *Bog spavin: excessive synovial fluid in the tarsocrural joint, which leads to a large, soft, cool distention on the dorsal surface of the hock. *Bone spavin: osteoarthritis of the distal hock joints, which produces lameness and is sometimes seen as a visible, hard swelling on the inside of the hock joint. A horse with bowed tendons. * Bowed tendon: tendinitis of the superficial or deep digital flexor tendons, which leads to a \\"bowed\\" appearance when the tendon is seen in profile. Considered a lameness when acute, and a blemish once healed, although the tendon is at greater risk for re-injury. *Bucked shins: pain, heat, and swelling over the dorsal surface of the cannon bone most commonly seen in racehorses. This complex disease process, called \\"dorsal metacarpal disease,\\" involves inflammation of the periosteum, subperiosteal hematoma, and microfractures to the cortex of the underlying bone. Capped hocks. *Capped joint: Inflammation leading to the development of a \\"false\\" or acquired bursa over the point of the elbow (capped elbow, also known as a \\"shoe boil\\"), point of the hock (capped hock), or knee (capped knee, or carpal hygroma) which causes an obvious swelling in the area. These are generally considered blemishes. *Curb: a thickening or bowing on the caudal surface of the calcaneous. Classically associated with damage to the long plantar tarsal ligament of the hock, it is actually most commonly due to injury to the superficial digital flexor tendon, but may also involve the deep digital flexor tendon, or the surrounding soft tissue structures.Ross M, Genovese R, Reef V. Curb: A Collection of Plantar Tarsal Soft Tissue Injuries. Proc. AAEP, 2002, Vol. 48; 337-342. *Founder (laminitis): a very painful condition resulting from the inflammation of the laminae within the hoof, leading to rotation of the coffin bone. *Navicular disease or navicular syndrome: a catch-all phrase used to describe pain in the palmar hoof which was originally attributed to damage to the navicular bone. MRI has since shown that navicular syndrome may be caused by damage to any of the structures within the hoof, including the navicular bone, the navicular bursa, the coffin joint, the deep digital flexor tendon, and various ligamentous supportive structures. *Osselets: swelling on the front surface of the fetlock joints of the front legs, caused by traumatic arthritis of the fetlock joints. *Ringbone: boney proliferation around the pastern. May be articular (osteoarthritis) or non- articular. The articular forms can affect the pastern or coffin joints, and can cause lameness. *Shoe boil: see \\"capped joint\\" *Sidebone: ossification of the collateral cartilages of the hoof secondary to chronic concussion, may be palpated on just above the coronary band on either side of the hoof. Rarely causes lameness, therefore considered a blemish. *Splints: bony enlargements in the area of the splint bone, most commonly on the inside of the front leg, but sometimes on the outside of the front leg or on a hind leg. They are caused by trauma to the split bone itself or the ligament between the splint bone and cannon bone. Acutely, there may be no visible swelling but the horse will be painful on palpation, and lame. Once healed, the boney swelling is cool to the touch and considered a blemish. *Stocking up: Edema (fluid) retained in the lower legs due to reduced lymphatic drainage, often because the horse is sedentary for long periods (such as when stalled) but occasionally due to pathology. It is cool to the touch, and usually decreases or resolves with exercise. It is considered a blemish. *Sweeney (shoulder sweeny): a loss of muscle of the shoulder. It is due to atrophy of the supraspinatous and infraspinatus muscles, secondary to damage to the suprascapular nerve, which innervates these muscles. It is usually caused by trauma, and is relatively rare in present day. *Thoroughpin: effusion in the deep digital flexor tendon sheath, producing a small fluid swelling in the depression just front of the calcaneous. It is proximal to the tarsocrural joint, which helps distinguish it from bog spavin. *Windpuffs (wind galls): cool, soft effusions in the area of the fetlock joint. May be \\"articular windgalls,\\" which are the result of excessive synovial fluid in the fetlock joint capsule and located on the inside and outside of the fetlock, just behind the bones of the joint. Swelling towards the back of the joint are \\"tendonous windgalls,\\" and are the result of effusion in the deep digital flexor tendon sheath. Windgalls are considered blemishes.

History One of the first fully enclosed, roofed market halls St. John's Market opened to the public in 1822. It was the largest in the nineteenth century. It was designed by John Foster, Junior with \\"136 stone-trimmed classical arched window bays, supported by 116 interior cast-iron pillars\\". In 1964 it was demolished. =Shopping Centre= St John's Shopping Centre, which was designed by architect James A. Roberts, opened in 1969. A subway with direct access to Lime Street station was open before being boarded up some years later. There were two major fires in the Centre, on 26 September 1977 and 17/18 December 1979. Considerations were made by Liverpool City Council in relation to a possible relocation of the shopping market as part of a larger redevelopment proposal for the centre. Land Securities, the then owner of the shopping centre, was aiming to start the refurbishment in early 2009 with the market moving in 2010 if the proposals went ahead.St John's Market to move as part of a revamp Liverpool Echo, 15 November 2007Shopping centre refurbishment Liverpool F.C..gov.uk, 15 November 2007 In March 2013 St John's shopping centre was acquired by InfraRed Capital Partners for ¬£76.5 million.

The ¬£1.6 million refurbishment, which was carried out by Graham Interior Fitout, dramatically modernised the lower-ground area as well as the atria around the escalators and the first floor balustrading. Work took until November 2013 to complete. In June 2016, St John's Market closed for a ¬£2 million refurbishment. Following the completion of the refurbishment, the market is now spread over two floors around a central atrium with a number of enhancements, such as the installation of WiFi and new public toilets. The refurbishment has also seen an increase in the number of stalls in the market from 90 to approximately 120. The market reopened after the completion of the refurbishment on 25 November 2016.
