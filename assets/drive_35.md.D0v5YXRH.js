Life and artistic career  Elmur's painting style can be defined as slightly random and abstract, but not to the point of incomprehensibility. His use of color favors bold tones in thick paint strokes complemented with occasional shades of lighter hues. \\"The colours in my paintings are very strong because of the sun in my country and also because of the people there, who love to wear colourful clothes\\", says Salah Elmur. The subjects express unreserved emotional capacities; although the paintings do not include significant events or action, each face appears to have a story behind it. Elmur is a painter, filmmaker, photographer, and illustrator. His works can be found in public and private collections in Africa, the Middle East, Europe and North America, including The Museum of African Contemporary Art Al Maaden (MACAAL), The Sharjah Art Museum and the Sharjah Art Foundation (SAF). His paintings have been exhibited in Egypt, the UAE, Sudan, Syria, Jordan, France, Washington D.C., Uganda, and Kenya among other locations. His work has even been shown in a group exhibition at the British Museum in London, a rare honor for a contemporary artist from Sudan. In 2013, Elmur's exhibition \\"Eyes Stream\\" drew inspiration from the name of an ancient wall in Cairo, \\"Wall of Hungarian Eyes.\\" He meditated on the label, and decided to explore the human eye in a recent series of paintings. His 2011 series called \\"Circus\\" features strong colours, as well as Elmur's distinctive figurative, yet abstract style. There is the brown horse with the bright-orange roller skates under his hooves or the man with his tongue sticking out, ready to bite into a ripe slice of watermelon – a reference to the people who came to the circus with their picnics, when he was a child growing up in Sudan. Fruits are a preferred subject of Salah Elmur. They can be found again and again in his paintings, just like people and animals. His latest works from 2006 featured insects, fruits and people, as well as a series from 2007 entitled \\"Guards\\". Time and again, it is the bird in various forms and colours that he depicts in those paintings -‐ sitting on the head of a person or on an arm, rocking on a rope or flying high above the other images. The exhibition at the residence of the European Commission in Cairo, organised and arranged by Stefania Angarano from Mashrabia Gallery in Cairo was Salah Elmur's third exhibition in the Egyptian capital. After closing its doors at the end of May, a collection of the paintings traveled to Washington, DC, where they were shown at the African Cultural Centre for a month. Using traditional elements in a contemporary way is what distinguishes El Mur's style. \\"His paintings are full of symbols and rituals, but it is never clear what they really are – that makes them very mysterious and attractive.\\" A Monkey and an Artichoke, Acrylic on canvas, 185 x 185 cm, 2017 In February 2018, an exhibition inspired by the childhood and early life of Salah Elmur, called ‘Fragrances of the Forest and Photos’ was a collection of more than 70 artworks exhibited at the Sharajah Art Museum. Here, Elmur's paintings lead the viewer through a personal voyage of discovery, showing some of his experiences of growing up in Khartoum. The works show his exploration of the city's streets and the surrounding countryside as a child.http://gulftoday.ae/portal/e669b991-0e23-4e34-8be3-7dece90794f7.aspx In September 2018, Salah Elmur took part in a group show with Kamala Ishaq and Ibrahim El-Salahi, at Saatchi Gallery in London, entitled \\"Forests and Spirits: Figurative art from the Khartoum School\\". This exhibition intended to bring wider attention to contemporary African art, and in particular the enduring influence of the Khartoum School, an art movement centred around the city's College of Fine and Applied Arts. As a filmmaker, Elmur has directed and produced six short films, stylistically situated between documentary and fantasy film. He won the Jury Prize (special acknowledgement) for his film \\"Heaven's Bird\\" at the International Short Film festival \\"Images that matter\\" in Ethiopia in 2010. Elmur also has been active as composer and illustrator of children's books, published in Arabic, French, Italian, and Spanish by Grandir Publishing and Syros. In particular, he has published the following titles: “ Chacodile” (Grandir, 2002), \\"Jameil et Jamila: Conte Baggara du Soudan\\" text by Patricia Musa (Grandir, 2003), \\"Diakhere, la Cadette: Contes de Mauritanie\\" text by Mamadou Sall (Lirabelle, 2006), “Sous Le Soleil” text by Badr Eddine Arodaky (Syros, 2007), “Une Famille d’Artiste” (Grandir, 2007), “Le Soudan” with Patricia Musa (Grandir, 2010), and “A Qui est cet Oeuf?” with Camille Pilet (Grandir, 2013).

Ronconi lived a life of penitence and dedicated all his works to the poor through the construction of chapels and hospitals – one such hospital still exists in his home of Rimini. His good deeds never went unnoticed for the townspeople hailed Ronconi as a saint in their midst even in the face of a slanderous accusation a jealous sister-in- law spread. The confirmation of his popular local \\"cultus\\" – or enduring veneration – allowed for Pope Pius VI to celebrate his beatification on 17 April 1776 while Pope Francis canonized Ronconi centuries later on 23 November 2014 in Saint Peter's Square. Life Amato Ronconi was born in 1225 in Rimini to a noble and wealthy household. He was orphaned in childhood and cared for by his older brother Giacomo and he spent his childhood and adolescence growing up in his brother's home. He had at least one sister named Chiara. Ronconi's sister-in-law urged him to find a woman to wed but Ronconi had other ideas for his life and decided to serve the Lord as a hermit. His sister-in-law Lansberga came to dislike him as a result of this for she wanted him to wed her little sister so as to keep her estate intact among familial relations and not amongst outsiders. She first asked Giacomo to have Ronconi change his mind but to keep the peace her husband gave his brother a piece of their land and told him to do with it what he pleased; Ronconi dedicated it to the poor which further infuriated his sister-in-law. Lansberga wanted revenge and so began a slanderous rumor – knowing how close he was with his sister Chiara – that both brother and sister were engaging in incestuous relations which was proven false after an investigation. Feeling a call to serve God he devoted his life to catering to the needs of the poor and assisting pilgrims and in doing so gave up all his possessions which he passed on to the poor people of the area. He joined the Secular Franciscan Order and adopted a life of hermitage to follow the example of Saint Francis of Assisi. He later emerged from his hermitage and constructed various chapels and shelters for pilgrims; some of those places still exist at present including a hospital in Rimini. He also made four pilgrimages to Spain at Santiago de Compostela. He underwent such pilgrimages to grow in personal holiness and to visit the tomb of James the Apostle. Ronconi attempted to make a fifth pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela but never made it for an angel appeared to him and told him he would soon die so had to return to his home; he did so and stopped at the Benedictine convent of San Giuliano in Rimini where he gave them the remainder of his possessions on 10 January 1292. Ronconi died in 1292. His remains are in the church of San Biagio in his home town of Saledecio after being transferred in May 1330 after his original resting place was razed due to fire. Canonization Pope Pius VI beatified Ronconi on 17 April 1776 while waiving the requirement for two miracles attributed to his intercession. The cause reopened a long while later when the postulation sent the Positio dossier to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints in Rome in 2010 where the latter had historians discuss and approve the cause on 27 April 2010. Theologians approved the cause on 11 January 2013 as did the C.C.S. on 24 September 2013. Pope Francis confirmed his life of heroic virtue on 9 October 2013 which would allow for his canonization to take place (should a miracle be approved) while also giving him the title of Venerable. The miracle in question was investigated and received C.C.S. validation on 25 March 1994; a medical board approved it later on 5 December 2013 as did theologians on 4 February 2014 and the C.C.S. on 15 April 2014. Francis approved the miracle needed for sainthood on 15 April 2014 and canonized Ronconi on 23 November 2014 in Saint Peter's Square.Rite of canonization of blesseds: Giovanni Antonio Farina, Kuriakose Elias Chavare of the holy family, Ludovico of Casoria, Nicola of Longobardi, Euphrasia Eluvathingal of the sacred heart, Amato Ronconi References External links *Hagiography Circle: Amato Ronconi *Saints SQPN: Amato Ronconi *Santi e Beati: Amato Ronconi *Katolsk.no: Amato Ronconi Category:1225 births Category:1292 deaths Category:13th-century venerated Christians Category:13th-century Christian saints Category:13th- century Roman Catholics Category:13th-century Italian people Category:Canonizations by Pope Francis Category:Franciscan saints Category:Italian Franciscans Category:Italian Roman Catholic saints Category:People from Rimini Category:People from the Province of Rimini Category:Secular Franciscans ","title":"Amato Ronconi"},{"id":"44583537","text":"Japananus is a genus of leafhoppers of the subfamily Deltocephalinae.

It is named after Gilbert Strang. It is used to speed up calculation for problems involving operators on very different time scales, for example, chemical reactions in fluid dynamics, and to solve multidimensional partial differential equations by reducing them to a sum of one-dimensional problems.  Fractional step methods  As a precursor to Strang splitting, consider a differential equation of the form : \\\\frac{d{y}}{dt} = L_1 ({y}) + L_2 ({y}) where L_1, L_2 are differential operators. If L_1 and L_2 were constant coefficient matrices, then the exact solution to the associated initial value problem would be : y(t) = e^{(L_1 + L_2) t} y_0. If L_1 and L_2 commute, then by the exponential laws this is equivalent to : y(t) = e^{L_1 t} e^{L_2 t} y_0. If they do not, then by the Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula it is still possible to replace the exponential of the sum by a product of exponentials at the cost of a first order error: : e^{(L_1 + L_2) t} y_0 = e^{L_1 t} e^{L_2 t} y_0 + \\\\mathcal{O}(t). This gives rise to a numerical scheme where one, instead of solving the original initial problem, solves both subproblems alternating: : \\\\tilde y_1 = e^{L_1 \\\\Delta t} y_0 : y_1 = e^{L_2 \\\\Delta t} \\\\tilde y_1 : \\\\tilde y_2 = e^{L_1 \\\\Delta t} y_1 : y_2 = e^{L_2 \\\\Delta t} \\\\tilde y_2 : etc. In this context, e^{L_1 \\\\Delta t} is a numerical scheme solving the subproblem : \\\\frac{d{y}}{dt} = L_1 ({y}) to first order. The approach is not restricted to linear problems, that is, L_1 can be any differential operator.  Strang splitting  Strang splitting extends this approach to second order by choosing another order of operations. Instead of taking full time steps with each operator, instead, one performs time steps as follows: : \\\\tilde y_1 = e^{L_1 \\\\frac{\\\\Delta t}{2}} y_0 : \\\\bar y_1 = e^{L_2 \\\\Delta t} \\\\tilde y_1 : y_1 = e^{L_1 \\\\frac{\\\\Delta t}{2}} \\\\bar y_1 : \\\\tilde y_2 = e^{L_1 \\\\frac{\\\\Delta t}{2}} y_1 : \\\\bar y_2 = e^{L_2 \\\\Delta t} \\\\tilde y_2 : y_2 = e^{L_1 \\\\frac{\\\\Delta t}{2}} \\\\bar y_2 : etc. One can prove that Strang splitting is second order by using either the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula, Rooted tree analysis or a direct comparison of the error terms using Taylor expansion. For the scheme to be second order accurate, e^{\\\\cdots} must be a second order approximation to the solution operator as well.

He is recognized as a martyr in the Catholic church. Born and raised in Sardinia, he became an ordained priest in 1586. When Barbary pirates abducted and enslaved his cousin, Zirano raised funds over the course of several years to pay the ransom for his cousin's freedom. He traveled to Algiers in 1602 and helped four Christian slaves escape to freedom, but soldiers later targeted and imprisoned him. The Grand Council of Algiers sentenced him to death for his role in helping the slaves escape and for being a spy for the city's enemies, but his captors offered to spare his life if he would convert to Islam. He refused, and they executed him by flaying. Zirano's beatification cause commenced in 1731, and Pope Francis eventually approved him for beatification in 2014. Cardinal Angelo Amato presided over his beatification in Sassari on 12 October 2014. Biography =Early life= Zirano was born in about 1564 in Sassari, in the Kingdom of Sardinia (once part of Spain and today Italy) to a family of modest farmers. Historians have not been able to discover the name of his father, who they believe died in a plague epidemic that claimed twenty thousand victims in Sassari in 1582. His mother, Margherita, lived until 1598. He most likely had two sisters and one brother. At the age of about 33, official papers described him as \\"a man [...] of short stature, black eyes, and brown beard.\\" In an era where the majority of the population was illiterate, it was exceptional when he began receiving an education from the monastery of Santa Maria di Betlem at the age of 14. In 1580, Zirano became a professed member of the Order of Friars Minor Conventual, and received his ordination to the priesthood in 1586 at the Cathedral of San Nicola from the Archbishop of Sassari Alfonso de Lorca. At the friary, he served variously as beggar, bursar, and vicar. His younger cousin on his mother's side, Francesco Serra, also entered the priesthood. In 1590, Barbary pirates captured and enslaved Serra in one of their frequent raids on the Sardinian Coast, and transported him to Algiers. People who were abducted in one of these raids were sold as slaves in Arab lands, and sometimes allowed to communicate with relatives back home to notify them of a ransom amount that could be paid for their freedom, which price varied according to the importance of the person. Often the slaves would agree to convert to Islam in order to secure their own freedom. Zirano expressed fears that his cousin would renounce his Christian beliefs and wanted to travel to Algiers to arrange for his freedom before that could happen.Lenartowick, Kerri. \\"Sainthood causes of over 100 martyrs advanced by Pope\\", Catholic News Agency, February 8, 2014 In Sardinia, the right to arrange for the ransom of captives was reserved for members of the Order of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Mercy, so in late 1597 or early 1598, Zirano presented a petition to Pope Clement VIII in late 1597 to be granted the right to raise funds to pay the 200 scudi in ransom that Serra's master demanded in exchange for his freedom. Zirano also wanted to raise funds to free other Christian slaves in the area. The Pope granted permission to accomplish these tasks beginning in March 1599 for a period of up to three years. Zirano spent the next three years travelling around Sardinia soliciting donations to pay the ransoms of kidnapped Sardinians, and meeting and consoling the families of other abducted residents. =Algiers= Zirano departed on his journey to the Barbary Coast in the spring of 1602. Because it was not possible to travel directly to Algiers from Sardinia, he first went to Spain, where King Philip III offered him passage on a ship to the region with Friar Matteo de Aguirre, who was King Philip's ambassador to the Kingdom of Kuku (today part of northern Algeria). The Kingdom of Kuku, with military support from King Phillip, was about to embark on a war with the state of Algiers. Aguirre was himself a former slave in Algiers, and his familiarity with the language, local customs, and the habits of Christian slaves and their masters in the city was expected to be an asset, but Zicaro's association with Aquirre would eventually cause problems. The two left Spain and arrived in the port of Azeffoun on 28 July 1602. They traveled from the port to Kuku and Zirano later departed the city on 18 August, disguised as a travelling merchant selling linen fabrics, with a companion who could act as an interpreter. He arrived in Algiers three days later. In Algiers, the situation was tense due to the anticipated war with the Kingdom of Kuku. Word reached the city that a large number of Spanish warships had been spotted near the island of Ibiza east of Spain. When Algerian authorities arrested a smuggler from Kuku within the city, they discovered letters written by Matteo de Aguirre, addressed to Zirano as well as to other Christians in Algiers. Zirano was added to a list of people who were searched for to be captured in the city, but he remained safely on the outskirts of the city. He helped four Christian slaves escape from their masters, and returned to Kuku with them in September. He remained in Kuku for the rest of the year, providing spiritual guidance and comfort to freed and escaped captives from Algiers. On 1 January 1603, the conflict between the Algerian army and the Kingdom of Kuku, up until now limited to brief skirmishes, escalated, and a surprise attack by Kuku resulted in a decisive defeat to the army of Algiers. The King of Kuku, sid Amar ben Amar, wanting to communicate his success to King Phillip III of Spain, instructed Zirano to personally carry a letter back to Spain. However, on the way to the port city of Azeffoun, the soldiers who were escorting him through the mountains deserted him, possibly as part of a plot to betray him to Algerian soldiers. He was captured, stripped, beaten, and chained, and led to Algiers, where he arrived on 6 January 1603. His captors locked him away in the palace of the Pasha, or governor. They mistakenly believed that he was Friar Matteo de Aguirre,Marruncheddu, Francesco. \\"Beatification of the Franciscan father Francesco Zirano, over 12 thousand faithful\\", San Francisco, Basilica of San Francesco d'Assisi and he was held for a ransom of three thousand gold ducats, about seventeen times the normal price for a slave. Under penalty of death, nobody was permitted to speak with Zirano. Despite the high security, his enslaved cousin managed to visit him two Fridays in a row, while his jailers were praying in the mosque. He told Zirano that he should prepare to die, because he had heard that his captors intended to have him burned alive. On 22 January 1603, an English ship was about to depart for Constantinople, the capital city of the Ottoman Empire that ruled over Algiers. The Turkish soldiers that guarded the city, the Janissaries, wanted to send Zirano on that ship to the Grand Vizier of the empire since they believed him to be a valuable captive, to send a strong message that the city had not fallen to the Kingdom of Kuku and was still loyal to the Empire. However, the Pasha refused, hoping to receive the ransom for Zirano himself. After several days of disagreement, the Janissaries and the Pasha agreed to have the Grand Council of the city decide Zirano's fate. The Grand Council met on Friday, 24 January, with the soldiers advocating for the execution of Zirano, and the Pasha arguing to keep him alive in the hopes of receiving the ransom. The council failed to resolve the dispute that day, but the next morning, the Pasha changed his mind and agreed that Zirano should be executed. This change of heart was probably because Zirano's true identity had been discovered by the Council; he was not Friar Matteo de Aguirre, and was unlikely to receive such a high ransom. For his crime of helping four Christian slaves escape to Kuku and for being a spy, Zirano was sentenced to death by flaying. =Death= After being informed of the sentence, Zirano's captors offered him freedom if he converted to Islam, which he refused. They stripped him of his clothes and dressed him in a simple tunic with a chain around his neck, and paraded him down the main street of Algiers, where local residents insulted, beat, and spat upon him until he arrived at the place of execution outside the walls of the city. The executioners tied his hands to two poles driven into the ground. They told him once again that he would be spared if he would convert to Islam, and again he refused. They flayed him alive, and took his skin, removed from his body, and stuffed it with straw and publicly displayed it outside one of the gates to the city. Zirano's cousin, with the help of two Christian slaves, collected his remains and buried them in the Christian cemetery, outside the walls of the city. His cousin eventually earned his freedom and he returned to Sardinia some time prior to 1605. Beatification The first stated intent to propose church recognition of Zirano as a martyr was in 1606, when the depositions of two eyewitnesses of Zirano's death were published. The first serious steps toward beatification did not occur until 1731, when a request to the Congregation for Rites to begin the sainthood process was denied after a dispute between the Conventual Franciscans and the Order of Friars Minor who each claimed Zirano as their own member, thus throwing into question who the formal petitioner should be. In 1926, the postulator general, Father Giuseppe Vicari, requested all of the available information about Father Zirano from the provincial minister of Sardinia. After World War II, a new postulator, Antonio Ricciardi, attempted to advance the process, but was instructed to seek further documents. Starting In 1977, Sardinian historian Father Umberto Zucca spent six years researching Italian and Spanish archives to compile the completed set of documents required to advance the process of Beatification, and on 18 May 1984 the Congregation for the Causes of Saints decided that the cause can proceed. On 25 November 1984, the Archbishop of Sassari, Salvatore Isgrò, created a commission for the examination of the collected documentation, a process that continued until 15 August 1990, when the late priest became titled as a Servant of God. The postulation submitted the Positio to the C.C.S. for assessment in 2001. Historians assented to the cause on 4 March 2003 while theologians on 16 May 2013 endorsed the cause as did the members of the C.C.S. on 4 February 2014. On 7 February 2014, Pope Francis approved the petition that the late priest had been killed \\"in odium fidei\\" (\\"in hatred of the faith\\") and Zirano was then approved to be beatified. Cardinal Angelo Amato presided over the beatification on the pope's behalf in Sassari on 12 October 2014. In attendance was the Sassari Archbishop Paolo Maria Virgilio Atzei and the then-Archbishop of Algiers Ghaleb Moussa Abdalla Bader. The current postulator for this cause is the Conventual Franciscan priest Angelo Paleri.

He issued false documents to Jews during World War II in order for them to escape the Nazi regime but was arrested and sent to a concentration camp where he later died. Yad Vashem later recognized him as a Righteous Among the Nations in 1969 for his efforts. Focherini's beatification was held on 15 June 2013 in Modena under Pope Francis who had Cardinal Angelo Amato preside over the celebration on his behalf. Life Focherini and his wife at their wedding Odoardo Focherini was born on 6 June 1907 in Modena as the third son to Tobia Focherini and Maria Bertacchini; his father remarried to Teresa Merigi in 1909 after Focherini's mother died. He had three brothers. Focherini married Maria Marchesi (1909-1989) on 9 July 1930 and the couple had seven children together between 1931 and 1943. The children in order of birth were: Olga (b. 1931), Maddalena, Attilio (d. 1946), Rodolfo, Gianna, Carla and Paola (b. July 1943). The couple was to have an eighth child (Sandro or Sandra depending on the gender) but this could not happen because Focherini was arrested. The couple met while he was on vacation in Trento and the couple became engaged in 1925. On 1 January 1934 he gained work with the Società Assicurazione Cattolica di Verona, an insurance corporation, and worked as an agent for the Modena branch. In 1933 he left his line of work in order to become a journalist and he became the managing director of L'Avvenire d'Italia. A fellow friend and journalist was the Jewish-Italian Giacomo Lampronti. In 1936 he became the diocesan president of Catholic Action. Pope Pius XI commended Focherini for his work in 1937 and awarded him the Order of Saint Sylvester. In 1942 his activism in saving the lives of Jews during World War II and the Holocaust first manifested when the first he saved came from Poland on a train to Genoa. On 8 September 1943 he got in touch with people who provided him with blank identification cards with false data and took a group of Jews to the border. He issued this fake documentation to them in order for them to escape Nazi persecution to neutral Switzerland and with his priest friend Dante Sala provided documents on one occasion for his friend Lampronti and his relations. He was also a friend of Blessed Teresio Olivelli. The Nazis discovered this covert operation and arrested him at the Carpi Hospital on 11 March 1944 while he organized the escape of Enrico Donati. On 13 March 1944 he was taken to San Giovanni in Monte prison in Bologna and remained there until 5 July when he was moved to Fossoli. From there Focherini was sent to a labour camp in Bolzano and remained there until 4 August when he was deported to the German state; he was sent to Flossenbürg on 7 September. Focherini sent a total of 166 letters to his wife while in imprisonment. The Nazis then sent him to a concentration camp in Hersbruck where he later died on 27 December 1944 due to an untreated leg infection while confirmation of his death came later on 4 June 1945. His final words were reported as: \\"I declare that I die in the purest Roman Catholic faith and in full submission to the will of God\\". He had saved a total of 105 Jewish lives. =Posthumous recognition= In 1969 he received posthumous recognition from Yad Vashem for his heroic efforts during the war in saving the lives of countless Jews and awarded him the title of Righteous Among the Nations.Odoardo Focherini at Yad Vashem website In 2007 the then-President of the Italian Republic Giorgio Napolitano awarded him the Gold Medal for Civil Merit for his heroic actions during World War II. Beatification The Gold Medal for Civil Merit he received in 2007 The beatification cause commenced under Pope John Paul II on 12 February 1996 after he was titled a Servant of God after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued the official \\"nihil obstat\\" to the cause and allowed for it to commence on a diocesan level; Bishop Bassano Staffieri oversaw its opening on 30 March 1996 and its conclusion on 26 May 1998. The C.C.S. validated this process on 28 May 1999 in Rome. The postulation drafted and then submitted the Positio to the C.C.S. in 2003 and it allowed for a board of theologians to approve the cause on 16 October 2007 and for the C.C.S. to do so as well on 3 April 2012. Pope Benedict XVI - on 10 May 2012 - confirmed that Focherini had died \\"in odium fidei\\" (in hatred of the faith) and thus approved his beatification. Cardinal Angelo Amato presided over the beatification in Modena on 15 June 2013 on the behalf of Pope Francis. Focherini's friend Lampronti attended the beatification. The current postulator for this cause is the Franciscan priest Giovangiuseppe Califano.

Sheikh Muhammad of Shrigonde), and Sheikh (Shekh) Mahammad-baba, was a Muslim saint-poet who is venerated by Hindus. He is considered the most well-known Marathi Muslim poet. He is the author of the Yoga-samgrama (Yoga-sangrama).  Background  Sheikh Muhammad was born and lived his life in Shrigonda (Shrigonde), Maharashtra, India. He was the son of Raje Muhammad, a Qadiriyya (Kadri, Qadiri) Sufi. His guru was the Hindu Vaishnava (sect worshipping the Hindu god Vishnu) saint Changa Bodhale, who was also the guru of Janardan Swami, the guru of the saint-poet Eknath (1533–1599). Changa Bodhale, known as Said Changasaheb Kadri in Sufi traditions, is considered an avatar of the Hindu god Dattatreya and was a disciple of Sheikh Muhammad's father.  Works and teachings  Vithoba, the patron god of Sheikh Muhammad Sheikh Muhammad is the author of the Yoga- samgrama, the Pavana-vijaya, the Nishkalanka-prabodha, and the Jnanasagara, in addition to many songs and abhangas (devotional poems). His writings show the influence of both Hindu bhakti and Muslim Sufi traditions, and he was a follower of the Advaita Vedanta school of Hindu philosophy. These writings reveal his knowledge of the tenets of bhakti traditions, as well as his literary skills in \\"chaste idiomatic Marathi\\". The Yoga-samgrama, composed in 1645 and containing 2319 ovis (poems), is his magnum opus. The central theme of this philosophical work is \\"the soul's struggle to realize and experience God\\". It adopts a similar metaphor from the Dnyaneshwari by the saint-poet Dnyaneshwar (1275–1296), in which the atman (soul) is the warrior riding the horse of the Mind and battles the armies of Ego and other passions in its quest to attain glory as Brahman (\\"Supreme Reality\\"). Sheikh Muhammad cites examples from the Hindu scriptures such as the Puranas and other philosophical treatises to convey his ideas. The Yoga-samgrama has references to the Hindu gods Rama, Krishna (both forms of Vishnu), Vishnu, and Shiva. Each of the eighteen chapters of the treatise begins with a prayer to Ganesha, the god of beginnings, who is invoked at the start of a book in keeping with Hindu tradition. However, Sheik Muhammad's writings reveal his monotheistic beliefs, which are rooted in Islam. He describes Hindu gods as formless (Nirakari), unmanifest (Avyakta), without form or qualities (Nirguna), and invisible (alaksa) (see Hindu views on monotheism). Sheikh Muhammad preaches the Oneness of God: Even though Sheikh Muhammad identified himself as Muslim by birth, he had chosen the Hindu god Vithoba, a form of Krishna-Vishnu in Maharashtra, as his patron deity. His \\"socio-religious awareness\\" is evident in this poem dedicated to Vithoba as Krishna: > Through the grace of Gopala (a name of Krishna), I have transgressed all > notions of purity and impurity. The jack fruit has a thorny skin, but inside > it are lumps of sugar, The bee-hive with all its humming bees contains the > very nectar inside. (So also) Sheikh Muhammad may be an avindha (Muslim), > But in his heart he has the very Govinda (a name of Krishna). The Yoga-samgrama contains an account of the originating legend of Vithoba and his devotee Pundalik, based on the Hindu scripture Skanda Purana. Sheikh Muhammad also wrote abhangas in praise of Vithoba.Zelliot, Eleanor in According to Sontheimer and Kulke, the Yoga-samgrama is an \\"unusually frank critique\\" of Hindu Brahmanical ritualism and folk Hinduism. While Sheikh Muhammad accepts classical Hindu deities, he vilifies folk Hindu deities. He mocks the shrines of the Hindu mother goddess placed on roads and in fields: \\"If the deities were all that powerful, how come the dogs urinate on them?\\" He also criticizes self-torture rituals like hook-swinging, performed to appease folk deities. Sheikh Muhammad especially condemned the popular folk god Khandoba and the rituals of his cult. He criticized the practice of muralis, girls offered to Khandoba to serve the god, but who were forced into prostitution. Sheikh Muhammad does not spare Islam and criticizes some of its aspects.  Remembrance  The shrine of Sheikh Muhammad, containing his seat, in his hometown of Shrigonda Sheikh Muhammad is regarded as a saint-poet by Hindus due to his contributions to the bhakti movement in Maharashtra. The saint-poet Ramdas, a staunch Hindu , contemporary saint praises Sheikh Muhammad as a great saint. Sheikh Muhammad is considered an avatar of the Muslim saint-poet Kabir (c. 1440 – c. 1518). Kabir was a Muslim saint-poet whose patron deity was Rama, a form of Vishnu; while Sheikh Muhammad was a devotee of another form of Vishnu, Vithoba. A Marathi couplet says that the saints Tukaram and Sheikh Muhammad are spiritual successors of Kabir.

It was apparently assigned to the 227th Special Operations Flight, later redesignated the 150th Special Operations Squadron, 108th Wing, New Jersey Air National Guard, McGuire Air Force Base, New Jersey, but is currently assigned to the 46th Test Wing at Eglin, and operates a pair of Boeing C-32B or Boeing 757-23A aircraft, on stand-by alert for special operations and intelligence missions world-wide.

The P-1 Line Item Nomenclature on page 4-24 of the unclassified USAF Aircraft Procurement FY 2001 Amended Budget Request, Volume 1, dated February 2000, identifies these airframes as C-32B FEST/DEST Aircraft, and cites total procurement cost for one in FY 2000 as $73.000 million and $71.963 million for the second in FY 2002 for a total procurement cost $144.963 million. The test unit designation was probably selected to blend in with the type of operations that are conducted regularly at Eglin AFB by Air Force Material Command whose mission is the development, acquisition, testing, deployment and sustainment of all air-delivered non-nuclear weapons. The vast Eglin complex is also home to the headquarters of Air Force Special Operations Command at Hurlburt Field, as well as the United States Army's 7th Special Forces Group, which relocated from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, in 2011.

Accidents On 1 May 2003, a Boeing C-32B, marked as 00-9001, assigned to the 486th Flight Test Squadron suffered a ~0300 hrs. landing accident at North Auxiliary Airfield, South Carolina, when the nose gear collapsed in a heavy landing. Air Force spokeswoman Major Linda Pepin said that there were no serious injuries, \\"There was a crew of 10 on board. Two sustained minor injuries and were treated and released.\\" The nose gear on the plane collapsed and the plane's position on the ground is not parallel to the runway. Major Pepin stated that the incident will be investigated in days to come by an Air Force safety board, \\"In any case where there's an incident that involves aircraft safety to ensure that whatever happened in this incident we can avoid next time.\\" Pepin said that they don't know how long the aircraft will stay on the runway, \\"It's really too early to know when it will get it up and moving.\\" North Auxiliary Airfield is used for C-17 Globemaster III training by the 437th Airlift Wing at Charleston Air Force Base.

From 1989 to 1999 they lived in Johannesburg and from 1999 to 2003 in Athens, Greece. Since 2003 the couple has been living in Gordon's Bay village on False Bay outside Cape Town. In 2003 van Heerden started the South African chapter of the international Society of Children's Book Writers and Illustrators (SCBWI), based in Los Angeles.

He is best known as a researcher in marine biology who helped to establish Lough Hyne as a field station, and is one of the lead characters in Reflections on a Summer Sea, a history of this facility. He had a second research interest on sebaceous gland function and skin. This dominated in later life, and he was editor of the 3rd to 5th editions of the Textbook of Dermatology. He also authored and edited a number of other books on biology and endocrinology including The Glands Inside Us and Population Control by Social Behaviour. Early life John Ebling was educated at the Colston's School in Bristol, and completed undergraduate studies at the University of Bristol.  Career  John Ebling graduated in Zoology in 1940 at the University of Bristol, where his interest in marine biology was stimulated by Sir Maurice Yonge. Whilst studying for a PhD also at Bristol, his interest in Endocrinology was stimulated by Dr Max Reiss at the Burden Neurological Institute. His first academic appointment was at the University of Hull in 1948, but he moved to the University of Sheffield soon after to join a rapidly expanding group of comparative endocrinologists led by Ian Chester-Jones. He was a founding member of the Institute of Biology (later to become the Society of Biology) and of the Society for Endocrinology, and served as the treasurer (1961-1966). In 1968 he was appointed to a personal chair in the Department of Zoology which he held until 1982. On retirement he was appointed as an Emeritus Professor in the Department of Dermatology. Personal life John Ebling married Erika Graetzer (born 17 May 1925) on 5 September 1948 at St Mary Redcliffe Bristol. He had a daughter (Nicola, born 23 May 1955) and a son (Francis John Peter, born 7 November 1959).

These filters are only required for existing facilities as for new installations in urban or rural areas, antennas and amplifiers sold from the application of the new standard should already be configured to receive, with good signal gain, only TV channels from 21 to 60 of the UHF band, the other higher channels (former TV channels 61 to 69) being attenuated.  Interference between 4G LTE and DTT  4G LTE is the fourth generation mobile phone standard. In urban areas, the 4G uses a frequency band located between 2500 MHz and 2600 MHz, and therefore is quite far from the TV band for causing any type of interference problem. In rural areas, however, the major operators have asked to use part of the UHF band. Since the UHF frequency band is not expandable, it was agreed that television broadcasting should limit its number of channels. Thus, the frequency band dedicated to the TV will be between 470 MHz and 790 MHz (channels 21-60), and the 4G LTE will use the frequency band between 790 and 860 MHz (former TV channels 61 to 69) being the interval separating the two bands (DTT and 4G) of only 1 MHz, so that there is a risk of interferences in the areas close to the 4G-LTE transmitting towers. In practice, the band used (790 to 862 MHz), called Digital dividend, this will not become a real problem until 2015 (or the start of the 4G deployment in these areas). Tuesday, May 26, 2020  Digital dividend Graphic description of the Digital Dividend use Digital dividend to frequency 06 MHz (TV Channels 61 to 69) assigned by the plan for the New UHF Frequency Band distribution agreed in The World Radio Congress (WRC-07) which identified 108 MHz of Digital Dividend Spectrum from 698 to 806 MHz for ITU-R Regions 2-1 and nine countries in Regions 3-2, including China, India, Japan and Rep. of Korea. This Digital dividend is used to improve the coverage of the 4G-LTE new standard in rural areas, needed with the arrival of 4G-LTE and requires therefore the redistribution of UHF frequency band. Starting from January 2015 (in some countries), the main mobile operators will begin to deploy their networks of very high band width \\"True 4G\\" or LTE using the frequency previously attributed to TV Channels 61 to 69, which is known as \\"digital dividend\\".

The species was described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae from the Moluccas. Description Upperside: The antennae are about an inch (25 mm) long, slender, setaceous, and gradually diminishing from the base to the extremities. The head is small. The thorax is clothed with long soft hair, and, with the abdomen, is of a darkish brown. A remarkable straight narrow line, or bar, of a cream colour, arises from the middle of the anterior edge of each of the forewings, and, crossing both anterior and posterior wings, ends at the abdominal edges, about half an inch below the abdomen; so that, when the wings are extended, as in the figure, these lines, with the anterior edges, form an equilateral triangle. The space within the triangle is dark brown; but the parts, near the shoulders, are lighter, having a greyish cast or hue, and contain many small transverse curved streaks, extending to the anterior edges, where they are large, black, and very conspicuous, like stripes. Some transverse markings of this kind, are dispersed on the posterior edges of the superior wings, and also on the abdominal edges of the posterior. On the outside the triangle, both on the anterior and posterior wings, is a fascia, of light brown, about half an inch broad, which deepens into a dark brown. On the posterior wings, after becoming dark, it softens again into the same light colour, continuing to the external edges. Each of these wings is ornamented with two tails, the inner ones the longest and near an inch in length, the tips of which incline towards each other; the lesser or outer tails, are about half an inch long, strengthened by the tendons of the wings passing through the middle of them; all of them being bordered with a soft ray of dark brown. Ventral view Underside: The bars or lines, which form the triangle on the upperside, are not visible on this; but the inclosed triangular field appears of a light greyish brown, darker at the borders, and thickly beset with small brown streaks, parallel to each other, and surrounding the body. The costal nerve of the anterior wings composes an edging in each, about an eighth of an inch (3 mm) broad, which diminishes as it approaches the external angle, white, and beautifully marked with black streaks, but smaller than those seen on the upperside. Outside the triangle, both in the anterior and posterior wings, is a broad border of white, which softens into a brown, but lighter than that on the upperside. Both in the white, and in the brown, are some small dashes of black, very thinly dispersed. The internal margin of the posterior wings is furnished with a deep fringe, and the black marks situated below the abdomen, are larger and broader than those on the upperside. The tails are whitish, bordered with brown, and appear as on the upperside. Wingspan 6 inches (150 mm).

He was the ktitor of the Great Church of the Tvrdoš Monastery in Trebinje, where he was seated. Life =Rebel activity= The Banat Uprising (1594), in which the Serbs in Banat rose up against the Ottomans, had been aided by Visarion and Metropolitan Rufim Njeguš of Cetinje. The rebels' war flags with the icon of Saint Sava had been consecrated by Serbian Patriarch Jovan Kantul. Ottoman Grand Vizier Koca Sinan Pasha ordered the flag of Prophet Muhammad be brought to counter the Serb flag, as well as the sarcophagus and relics of Saint Sava located in the Mileševa monastery be brought by military convoy to Belgrade. Along the way, the Ottomans had people killed in their path so that the rebels in the woods would hear of it. The relics were publicly incinerated by the Ottomans on a pyre on the Vračar plateau, and the ashes scattered, on April 27, 1595. Among the Serbs, especially after the incineration of the relics of St. Sava, the liberation movement met a large response. The center of action for Herzegovina was since 1596 the Tvrdoš Monastery in Trebinje, where Metropolitan Visarion was seated. Many of the Orthodox bishops called to Austria for help in liberating their lands. In 1596 the liberation movement and fighting would spread into Ottoman Montenegro and the neighbouring tribes in Herzegovina, especially under influence of Metropolitan Visarion. A Ragusan document from the beginning of 1596 claimed that the metropolitan and many Herzegovinian chieftains gathered in the Trebinje Monastery where they swore oath \\"to give up and donate 20,000 heroes to the [Austrian] emperors' light.\\" The rebels sought help or at least, symbolically, the Austrian flag as a proof of connection with Austria. At the end of 1596, after the Himariote rebellion, the Serbs started to revolt. The uprising broke out in Bjelopavlići, then spread to Drobnjaci, Nikšić, Piva and Gacko, and was led by vojvoda Grdan of Nikšić. The uprising was short-lived, as the rebels were defeated at Gacko. The rebels were forced to capitulate due to lack of foreign support. After the failure of the uprising, many Herzegovinians moved to the Bay of Kotor and Dalmatia. Grdan and Patriarch Jovan would continue to plan revolts against the Ottomans in the coming years.

A modular smartphone is a smartphone made using components that can be independently upgraded or replaced as modules. This aims to reduce electronic waste, lower repair costs and increase user comfort. The most important component is the main board, to which others (such as cameras or batteries) are attached. These are packaged in easy-to-remove modules which can be replaced as needed without having to rework the soldering. Components could be obtained from open-source hardware stores.  History Desktop computers housed in tower cases can easily swap parts such as hard drives, memory, and graphics cards. Among early mobile devices, the Handspring Visor PDA had a Springboard Expansion Slot which could give it the capabilities such as a phone, GPS, a modem, or a camera - but only one at a time. The Israeli startup Modu in 2008 created a phone and screen core that could be added to various cases that gave the device features such as a keyboard or camera; the company failed and sold its patents to Google in 2011. In 2013, Phonebloks was the first modular smartphone concept to attract widespread attention. Later in 2013, Motorola Mobility, then a subsidiary of Google, unveiled Project Ara, a concept for a modular smartphone inspired by the Phonebloks concept. The project was retained by Google when it sold Motorola to Lenovo, and underwent further development. In late 2014, the Finnish tech startup Circular Devices Oy announced the PuzzlePhone project, with phones that can be personalized at both operating system and hardware levels. It has received the support of Fraunhofer IZM and was scheduled for release in 2015.http://www.puzzlephone.com/when However, the release was pushed to 2017 due to missing funding. During 2015, the Dutch social enterprise Fairphone developed the Fairphone 2, the first publicly available modular smartphone which was released to sale in December that year. In 2016, two manufacturers unveiled phone lines with modular accessory systems. LG Electronics unveiled its LG G5 smartphone, which allows add-on modules to be installed by removing its \\"chin\\" and battery, and attaching the battery to an accessory that is then re-inserted into the phone. LG unveiled camera grip and audio enhancement accessories as part of the launch of the device. Motorola later unveiled the Moto Z, which allows the installation of case-like accessories known as \\"MotoMods\\", mounted using magnets to the rear of the device and a pogo pin connector for communication. The Shiftphone 6m was developed by the German social enterprise SHIFT during 2015 and 2016. It is their latest high-end flagship model and the second easy repairable phone on the market since the Fairphone 2. At the Google I/O conference in May 2015, Google unveiled a \\"Developer Edition\\" of Project Ara meant for release later in the year, now consisting of a base phone with non-modular components, and extensible with modules for adding supplemental features. Google intended to launch Project Ara for consumers in 2017. Project Ara was ultimately shelved on September 2, 2016. On January 17, 2017, Facebook filed a patent for a modular smartphone design, which was published on July 20 that year.  Derivatives  Similar to modular smartphones, other devices such as modular smartwatches and functional (smart) cases have been envisioned. The modular smartwatch goes under the name Blocks and uses smart modules as links in the wristband. Two companies making smartphone cases Nexpaq and Moscase have designs similar to Project Ara (previously Phonebloks) and the Moto Z, respectively. As of September 18, 2017, Nexpaq rebranded to Moduware, and no longer produces phone cases. Their new derivative of the phoneblocks concept is a battery with the same modular components as their Nexpaq case.  Components  Component clusters listed by PuzzlePhone: Google isn't the only one making a modular smartphone, Engadget, December 1st 2014. Some example modules: * Spine (frame, screen and sometimes speakers) * Brain (processor) * Heart (battery and other modules). * Activity tracker * Altimeter * Antenna * Audio jack * Battery * Bluetooth * Camera * Fingerprint sensors * GPS * Gyroscope * Speaker * Storage (RAM and permanent storage) * Video jack (such as HDMI) * WiFi * Specialized modules for medical applications Challenges Critics point out that a modular phone would need to have connections durable enough that it would not fall apart when dropped, put in a pocket or sat upon. Project Ara used latches and electropermanent magnets to achieve this. Existing phones are highly optimized for physical space, making pluggable modules that are highly space-optimal difficult, and configuration and regulatory approval of the radio hardware becomes more complicated. Another concern is that consumers would be overwhelmed by too many choices, or prefer pre-packaged phones. It is unclear how viable the secondary component market would be, until products become available. Some critics worry about loss of control by the manufacturer over the full hardware platform, brand erosion, consumers who make poor choices, whether separately purchased components would cost more than a pre-packaged phone would, and whether modular phones would be more prone to breakage (and thus create more e-waste). Proponents hope that the technical challenges can be overcome and that a viable market ecosystem (the hardware version of an app store) will enable finer-grained competition that will benefit consumers with better and cheaper choices.

It replaced a Capuchin chapel built in 1941. In 1996 its parish was carved out of the existing parishes of Notre-Dame-d'Auteuil and Sainte Jeanne-de-Chantal. The church serves Sunday congregations of around 1,500 people, and aims to cater for a smaller parish than its predecessor. Among its principal activities is its chaplaincy to the Oiseaux Girls' School. The architects of this radically new and innovative structure were Corinne Cailles and Jean-Marie Duthilleul. Location The church is situated on the Rue Molitor, close to the Roland Garros tennis stadium and the Parc des Princes football stadium. The street is named for General Gabriel Jean Joseph Molitor. It is served by the Michel-Ange – Molitor metro station. History The church is dedicated to Saint Francis of Assisi. It was consecrated on by Monsignor André Vingt-Trois, the Archbishop of Paris. His predecessor, Cardinal Jean-Marie Lustiger had brought the project to fruition in accord with the Vatican II guidelines (1962 - 1965) for new places of worship, as he did for other Parisian churches built during his tenure. Architecture The church's bell tower acts as a landmark for itself and the parish. It is slightly higher than the façade and on the same alignment, which is a difference from other new churches in Paris such as Notre-Dame-de-l'Arche-d'Alliance in the 15th arrondissement and Notre-Dame-de- la-Sagesse in the 13th. On its southern side, the church fronts directly onto the street. It is entirely clad in semi-translucent white marble. This striking material demarks the religious character of the building and sets it apart from its neighbours. At night, because of the marble's translucence, the church's interior lighting illuminates the street outside. At the base of the bell tower there is a monumental sculpture of a young, dynamic St Francis of Assisi by Alain Courtaigne. Francis walks towards God, among reliefs evoking his life and spiritual quest. The piece was sculpted from a single block of white granite mined in Galicia, Spain. Its siting makes it appear to rise out of the ground at the entrance of the passageway between the church and its neighbour. A visitor entering through one of the three monumental doorways (of rare amazoué wood) will cross a narthex to get to the aisles and the nave. Its south-north orientation and elliptical form, by architects Corinne Callies and Jean-Marie Duthilleul, has 420 seating places; it is reminiscent of a barque, the symbol of evangelism. The floor slopes gently towards the altar. The baptismal font, altar, ambon and holy cross are all aligned along the major axis of the ellipse. The golden cross stands in front of a glass wall which separates it from the chancel. The church is thus constructed around its purpose of liturgical prayer: the altar, in the centre of the ellipse and thus of the whole building, is surrounded by two spaces for priests and laity, which come together like two hands in a prayer of collect. In the small chapel to the right of the entrance, there is a 14th-century cross and tabernacle.

The British Royal Navy purchased her at Port Jackson in 1817. The Navy then used her to survey the Australian coasts. In 1820 she grounded and in 1823 was condemned for survey work. The Navy sold her to the colonial government which used her to run errands until she was wrecked in 1829. Career Mermaid was launched at Howrah in 1816 and the Royal Navy purchased her at Port Jackson in 1817. Phillip Parker King used her between December 1817 and December 1820 to survey parts of the Australian coast that Matthew Flinders had not already surveyed. King circumnavigated the Australian mainland and conducted a survey of the Inner Route through the Great Barrier Reef. View of the encampment in Careening Bay where Mermaid was repaired in 1820 In 1820 Mermaid grounded at Careening Bay, Kimberley, Western Australia; gotten off, she only reached Sydney with difficulty. A survey resulted in her condemnation for survey work and her sale in 1823 to the colonial government. In September 1823 Mermaid carried John Oxley as he explored the Queensland coast south of Port Curtis, discovering the Brisbane and Tweed rivers. At Moreton Bay he rescued Thomas Pamphlett and John Finnegan, who had been ship-wrecked earlier in the year. In September 1825 Mermaid transported Edmund Lockyer to Moreton Bay so he could explore the upper reaches of the Brisbane River. In August 1826 John Richardson travelled on Mermaid from Port Essington, on Melville Island, to Timor to obtain seeds. Loss Captain Samuel Nolbrow and Mermaid departed Sydney on 16 May 1829, bound for Port Raffles with government dispatches and provisions for King George's Sound. She proceeded on the inner passage to Torres Straits. At 6 a.m. on 13 June she struck an uncharted reef on the southern side of Flora Reef, Queensland. (Nolbrow gave the location as at .)

He was a Labor Party member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly from 1910 to 1949, representing the electorate of Brunswick. He was the party whip from 1924 to 1949. Jewell railway station on the Upfield railway line was renamed in his honour. Jewell was born in Smithfield West, South Australia, the child of a miner father and schoolteacher mother. His family later moved to Melbourne. He was employed by a butcher from 1885 to 1888, was briefly a gold miner at Whittlesea, and then worked for the New Northcote Brick Company to 1891. He worked for a butchering firm from 1891 to 1894, as a steam engine driver for L. B. Coulsell from 1894 to 1895, spent two months working for a Bendigo smallgoodsman, and then worked as an agent for W. C. Angliss & Company to 1900. He later opened a butchers shop in Brunswick, expanding to three, but reducing to one after the Great Depression. He was elected to the City of Brunswick council in 1905, serving until 1914, and was mayor from 1908 to 1909. Jewell was elected to the Legislative Assembly at a 1910 by-election following the resignation of Frank Anstey to enter federal politics. He soundly defeated incumbent mayor and former MLA Frederick Hickford, who had stood for the conservative Ministerialists. In a 1914 speech reflecting on his early years, he spoke of his advocacy for reforming the state's treatment of neglected children, opposed the creation of the Country Roads Board, and mentioned that he had taken an active part in the opening of a technical school at Brunswick. Jewell opposed conscription during World War I. He appeared for the tramway workers in the industrial courts during the 1923 Melbourne tram strike. He was appointed party whip in 1924, and held that role both in government and in opposition until his death. Jewell was never seriously challenged for re-election throughout his 39-year career in the Assembly, although he was opposed a number of times. In 1946, he was presented with an inscribed whip as tribute for his service at a ceremony attended by members of all parties, but was too ill to attend. The Argus referred to attendees as referring to Jewell as \\"the man who has never been heard to say a hard word about anyone\\" and \\"the most popular man in the House.\\" Jewell died in office on 14 May 1949, after having reportedly been in \\"indifferent health\\" for several years.

Kedem is one of the leading auction houses in this field in Israel and worldwide. History Kedem was founded by Meron Eren (born 1963), a farmer by profession, Avishai Galer (born 1974) a rabbi and teacher who lives in Modi'in Illit, and Eran Reiss (born 1966). The owners dealt for many years with Hebrew ancient books and manuscripts related to the history of the Jewish people and their culture. While Galer specialized in religious books and rabbinical manuscripts, Eren specialized in Jewish and Modern Israeli culture. Reiss later left the auction house. At first the company's offices were located in the industrial park of Givat Shaul, the auctions taking place in Belgium House in the Givat Ram Campus of the Hebrew University. In 2012 an \\"Israeli art item auction\\" took place at the Nachum Gutman Museum. Later Kedem moved to Jerusalem's city center, to the cellar of Heichal Shlomo Building. For that purpose an area of 250 m2 was leased, and the place was renovated at the cost of almost 400,000 NIS. Today Kedem includes offices, an exhibition hall, storehouse for 300 items and a vault room. Since its opening, the auction house has developed and grown to be the first in its field, sustaining a big staff of trained workers and experts. Kedem also has a representative in North America. Kedem runs seven auctions a year, the last being dedicated to the \\"rare and important items\\" category. In the first auctions the sales circulation was US $60,000, but by 2012 had increased to US $750,000. In 2014 the \\"rare and important items\\" auction took place at the Leonardo Plaza Hotel in Jerusalem, and the opening prices' overall rate was set above USD1,000,000. Single items and whole collections in various fields connected with Judaism and the history of the Jews and the Land of Israel arrive at Kedem for evaluation and sale. Among the auction house customers are public institutions in Israel and worldwide, including national libraries and universities, public and private museums and archives, alongside private collectors. Among its permanent customers are the Library of Congress, Yale University and the British Library.Items in Kedem's Gallery In 2014 Kedem was mentioned as an optional buyer of the art collection of the IDB Group, estimated by millions of NIS worth. Etymology The name Kedem was chosen for the auction house because it combines meanings of past and origins ('kadum') with development and future ('kadima'). Also the auction house is active in the Middle East, known as \\"kedem\\" in ancient Hebrew. Expertise Kedem's expertise has broadened over the years, and it now specializes in four categories: # Religious books, manuscripts and rabbinical letters, especially rare books and paper items. # Israeli artifacts, numismatics and medallions – Kedem is the only auction house to hold auctions dedicated exclusively to Israeli collectibles, including items connected with Israeli history, Jewish History in Israel and in the diaspora, Zionism and Israeli and Jewish culture. Until Kedem was established there was no auction house specializing in Israeliana. # Judaica items – ancient Jewish ritual objects, amulets, Shabbat tablecloths, Havdallah towers, items from Jewish culture and the Jewish spiritual world # Israeli & international art – from early Bazalel masters through to contemporary Israeli artists, including artistic statues, posters, paintings and more. Works by well-known international artists are also for sale. Auctions of note Over the years Kedem sold some extraordinarily veritable and unique items, as can be studied by their price: * In 2009 the Hasidic book \\"Noam Elimelech\\" of rabbi Elimelech of Lizhensk was sold for $300,000. * In 2012 a rare Talmud book, having the Vilna Gaon's notes on it, was sold for $500,000. * In 2013 Kedem sold Arnie Druk's collection: tens of thousands of Israeli and Jewish art items, photographs, Herzl's and Rabin's documents, children's books in Yiddish, wines, anti-Semitic postcards, Kibbutz Haggadahs and more were exhibited publicly for the first time. * In 2014 documents of the Nuremberg trials were presented after having been found in the flea market in Jaffa. The collection included more than 2,000 printed papers, 500 Xerox copies and hand-written lists and newspapers shards documenting the trials. At the same year a copy of the Babylonian Talmud privately owned by rabbi Ovadiah Yosef from his time as the Jewish community's rabbi in Egypt was sold for $50,000, the sole copy of the lost book of the Holocaust's author, Yehiel De- Nur also known under the pen name of \\"Ka-Tsetnik\\", a private dedication of Herzl from 1900 sold for $67,000, a \\"private-secret\\" document sent by Shimon Peres to rabbi Ovadiah Yosef, then leader of Israeli party Shas, ensuring all kinds of political promises should the party join his coalition in the attempt of overthrowing incumbent Israeli prime minister Shamir – historically known by the name \\"The Dirty Trick\\" – and Eichmann's prosecution team's personal documents, partially found in trash, containing remarks about Eichmann's body language. * in 2015 a volume from Eliezer Ben-Yehuda's first edition of the first Hebrew dictionary was presented.

A poem using this metre is also called an ovee. Ovee is one of the \\"oldest Marathi song genres still performed today\\". It has been in use since the 13th century in written poetry; however, oral traditions of women's ovee pre-date the literary ovee. While literary ovee is used by the Varkari saints in bhakti (devotional) literature, women's ovee is passed via the oral tradition through generations of women, who sing them while working or for pleasure. Forms and origins Dnyaneshwaar was the first to use ovee in literature. Two forms of ovee are popular today: the granthik (literary) ovee and the women's ovee. The literary ovee is sung without tala (rhythm) by a kirtankar in a kirtan, a devotional call-and-response chanting form. This is generally used for ovees of saints like Dnyaneshwar, Eknath and Namdev. The women's ovee is sung with tala, when the women gather for work or pleasure. The ovee metre originated in literature with the Varkari saint, Dnyaneshwar (1275–1296). Both his magnum opuses Dnyaneshwari and Amrutanubhav are composed in ovee meter. It is one of the two popular poetry metres used by Varkari saints, the other being abhanga - contributed to the saint, Tukaram (1577–1650). While ovee is used for narrative poems, abhanga meter is used for lyrical poems and devotional poems. The ovee metre is believed to be existed in folk song tradition even before Dnyaneshwar, which the saint adopted for his literary works. Though the ovee tradition pre-dates the Varkari bhakti tradition, there is little record of contents of early ovees. Women's ovees have been passed from generation to generation only through oral means. Women's ovee ovee is thought to be in the rhythm of songs sung by women on the grinding stone (jata). The ovee is sung while women use the mortar and pestle or the rahat (a manual water wheel) to pull water from the well. The women's ovees are \\"protest songs more than work songs\\" — complaints about the hard work, unhappy marriages and \\"despotic husbands\\". They contain sarcasm of the patriarchal society. They also contain elements of bhakti (devotion), where the singer implores God to save her from these bondages. Literary ovee An ovee poem has couplets (called kadva or ovee itself). Each couplet is generally divided into four charan (parts/lines). The first three charans are rhymed and have same number of matras (instants) composed of six or eight letters (vary from eight to ten syllables), while the fourth is \\"open\\" (unrhymed with the rest), shorter with fewer matras and generally has four letters (vary from four to six syllables). For example, the Dnyaneshwari has eight matras in the first three charans and four to six in the last charan. It is thus called a couplet of three and a half charans. In contrast, an abhanga has four charans with eight letters each. Example of an ovee from Dnyaneshwari: Devā Tūchi Gaṇeshū  Sakalārthamatiprakāshū  Mhaṇe Nivṛtti Dāsū  Avadhārijojē 2 देवा तूंचि गणेशु  सकलमति प्रकाशु  म्हणे निवृत्ति दासु  अवधारिजो जी 2 The ovee was used by another saint, Eknath (1533–1599), too; however, while Dnyaneshwar's ovee has three and a half parts, Ekanath's ovee has four and a half parts. Dnyaneshwar's ovee is considered one of the foremost compositions in the ovee metre. The abhanga metre is said to have originated from Dnyaneshwar's ovee metre. The abhanga is often considered as a form of the ovee. Dilip Chitre considers the abhanga tradition is strongly influenced by the women's ovee. S. G. Tulpule says the abhanga \\"is nothing but a prolongation of the original ovee, its name signifying continuity of the essential ovee units\\". Janabai's abhangas borrow themes of women's household chores of grinding and pounding from the women's ovee tradition and asks Vithoba, the patron god of the Varkari tradition, to help her in her chores.

She began her ultra career in 2008 and is a two-time 100km World Champion, winning the title in 2010 and 2014. She holds numerous course records, including those for the Western States 100, the Canadian Death Race, the JFK 50 Mile Run and the Knee Knackering North Shore Trail Run. She is the first British woman to win the 90 km Comrades Marathon in South Africa. Greenwood was born in Dundee, Scotland, and spent most of her childhood in England. She moved to Canada after graduating from university to work for a ski tour operator and is now based in Vancouver. Early life Greenwood was born in Dundee, Scotland, on 14 March 1979. When she was 8 years old, her family moved to Norfolk, England. After graduating from university in 2001, she moved to Canada to work for a UK ski tour operator and has lived there ever since. Career Greenwood began her ultramarathon career in 2008, one of her first races being the 30-mile Knee Knackering North Shore Trail Run, a relatively short course known for its steep ascent and descent. That same year, Montrail, the footwear company, began sponsoring her. In her first attempt at the distance, Greenwood won the Elk-Beaver 100k on Vancouver Island in May 2010, setting a new course record of 7:36, and qualified to represent Great Britain at the 2010 IAU 100 km World Championships. There, after battling with the race leader, 2006 World Champion and compatriot Lizzy Hawker, she took gold in a time of 7:29:05, helping Great Britain to first place in the team event and also in the jointly held IAU 100 km European Championships. In 2010, she also set new course records for the 125-kilometre Canadian Death Race, coming second overall and beating the previous record by more than an hour, and for the Knee Knackering North Shore Trail Run. In 2011 Greenwood took on the Western States 100 in California and came first. She won the race again in 2012, when she set a new course record of 16:47:19, beating the previous best of 17:37:51 set by Ann Trason in 1994. In 2012, Greenwood also broke the women's course record for the JFK 50 Mile Run, coming in 10th overall, and was the winner of the Ultra-Trail du Mont- Blanc Courmayeur-Champex-Chamonix 101-km race. Greenwood has competed three times in South Africa's 90-km Comrades Marathon. Run on undulating road through KwaZulu-Natal, it is said to be the oldest and most competitive ultramarathon in the world. She came fourth in 2011 and managed second place in 2012, just 72 seconds behind the winner. Throughout 2013, Greenwood was plagued with injuries. She returned to running slowly, focussing on the 2014 Comrades Marathon to keep her motivated. In 2014, with 18 km to go, she was eight minutes behind the race leader but she managed to recover the deficit and win in a time of 6:18:15. She is the first British woman to win the race, which had been dominated for the previous 11 years by the Russian twins Elena and Olesya Nurgalieva. Elena Nurgalieva still holds the course record which she set in 2006. In November 2014, Greenwood lined up for the third time at the start of the IAU 100 km World Championships. Having won it in 2010, she led the British team in 2011 but pulled out at the 90 km mark, after suffering from vomiting for 40 km.

He changed his birth name to Manson-Bahr after marrying Edith Margaret Manson, daughter of the doyen of tropical medicine Sir Patrick Manson. Following his father-in-law, he devoted much of his career to tropical medicine. He was a Consulting Physician, and held high offices at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and at the London Hospital. He was knighted in 1941. Early life and education Manson-Bahr was born at Wavertree, Liverpool, to Louis Friedrich Bahr and Emily Louisa Blessig. He had two sisters, Caroline Louisa Sophia Bahr, who was a one-year senior, and Sophie Catharine Bahr, six years his junior. Originally from the Province of Hanover, Germany, his father moved to Liverpool as a business partner of Anthony & Bernard Schroeder & Co, merchants and brokers. His father eventually became a Vice-Consul for German Empire at Liverpool in 1874, a naturalised British citizen in 1877, and German Consul during 1883-1906. His family lived in a house called Rockville. He began his schooling at the Queenbank Preparatory School in Liverpool, and continued at Rugby School in Warwickshire. He entered Trinity College, Cambridge and studied the Natural Sciences Tripos, with zoology as his main course. Professor Alfred Newton became a major influence on his lifelong interest in ornithology. He was enrolled in the British Ornithologists’ Union in 1904. He took up undergraduate medical training at the London Hospital, and earned his degree in 1907. In 1908, he qualified the full MB BChir degree from Cambridge University. Career With his medical degree in 1907, Manson-Bahr earned membership of the Royal College of Surgeons, and was appointed house physician of the hospital. In 1909, he led Stanley Research Expedition to Fiji to investigate dysentery and filariasis. He worked out the transmission of a filarial worm (Wuchereria species), which he even demonstrated by infecting himself. He demonstrated that the mosquito Aedes pseudoscutellaris was the vector of the parasite in Fiji. He also identified Shigella shigae (now Shigella dysenteriae), a bacterium that causes severe dysentery called shigellosis. In 1912 he spent 14 months in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) upon an invitation by Tea Planter's Association to investigate tropical sprue. Other physicians had reported that the causative agent was bacterial species. But he correctly identified it as a pathogenic yeast Molinia candida (now Candida albicans). He served in the British Army in Egypt, Palestine and the Dardanelles during World War I. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order in 1917 for his service. He was much involved in eradication of cholera outbreak in Egypt in 1918 and pellagra among prisoners of war. After the war ended in 1919, he joined the Albert Dock Seamen's Hospital and then transferred to the Hospital for the London School of Tropical Medicine. He was also a lecturer at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. He remained as Consultant Physician to the Colonial Office and the Crown Agents from 1927 to 1947. Between 1937 and 1947 he also served as Director of the Department of Clinical Tropical Medicine. Snipe Manson-Bahr is credited with unravelling the mystery of how the Common snipe creates its drumming sound which is unlike other birdsong. He worked out that the sound was created by placing out two tail feathers at 90 degrees to the direction of flight. When diving these feathers create this unusual sound. He demonstrated this in front of the British Ornithologists Union by inserting two snipe feathers into a cork which he then whirled around his head on a string. Manson's Tropical Diseases and change of name Manson-Bahr edited Manson's Tropical Diseases from the seventh edition in 1921 through 15th edition in 1960. (Originally titled Tropical Diseases: A Manual of Diseases of Warm Climate, a standard textbook in tropical medicine, it is still in print, and as of 2014, running its 23rd edition.) It was from this contribution that he was asked by Sir Patrick Manson to change his name. Personal life Manson-Bahr married Edith Margaret Manson (1879–1948), daughter of Patrick Manson, from whom he adopted his surname. They met when he joined the London Hospital as house physician in 1907. They got married in 1909 in London. They had five children: #Patricia Emily Manson-Bahr (b. 1910) #Philip Edmund Clinton Manson-Bahr, MD, (b. 1911), a respected Specialist Physician in Colonial Medical Service, East Africa and Fiji; served as Lt. Col. of the Royal Army Medical Corps in World War II; and later Professor of Tropical Medicine at New Orleans Hospital, USA. #Elizabeth Mary Manson-Bahr (b. 1913) #David Hugh Manson-Bahr, MB, (b. 1916) #Mary Manson-Bahr (b. 1921) After the death of Edith Margaret, Manson-Bahr married Edith Mary Grossmith in 1950. They lived in Edenbridge in Kent, where he spent much of his last days hunting.

Production and release  Interplay entered into an $100,000 contract with Activision to produce three illustrated text adventure titles, of which this was one. The game's programmer Ayman Adham, hired by Brian Fargo, CEO of Interplay Productions, would later be the founder of Blizzard. Rebecca Heineman who worked on the game would later found Logicware. The game had the same gaming engine as The Tracer Sanction, and the art was drawn by QuickDraw. It was based loosely on the Robert Ludlum novel The Bourne Identity. Fargo would later say that the amnesiac storyline was unique for the time and set the game apart from its contemporaries. Mindshadow was a \\"middling success\\" and \\"solid seller\\". The game was included in the Interplay's 10 Year Anthology. Plot The player starts on a beach with no memory of his identity. The island is a self-contained area with beaches, rocky cliffs, a hut and a quicksand area, which serves as a maze for the player to reach another location of the game. The character's main objective is to gather objects necessary to assemble a bonfire as a signal for any passing ships. Once this is accomplished, the player finds himself on board a pirate ship pursued by the Royal Navy without a means to leave the ship or reach any destination. The player has to find a means to stop the ship and thus be rescued and dropped somewhere in London. At this point, the player will start having clues about his past, and has receive mysterious instructions and even evade attempts against his life. Buying a forged ticket, the player has to fly to Luxembourg where he will receive more clues, and finally confront his nemesis. If the player has uncovered enough clues (i.e. by reading a newspaper, or finding notes and messages on dead bodies) at the very end, the player will be able to regain his memory. It is revealed that the player is wealthy industrialist William Arcman, whose evil twin brother, Jared, having faked his own death, attempted to make William disappear and then steal his identity to take advantage of his wealth. The story started right after Jared hit William on the head and dropped him on a desert island. Gameplay The detective mystery is portrayed in an interactive fiction adventure game style. A window displays static graphics with the environment the character sees. An important command of the game is \`REMEMBER\` which is used with clues. (e.g. \`REMEMBER WILLIAM ARCMAN\`) which is obligatory for the player to regain his memory at the end. The game accepts also the phrase \`HELP CONDOR\`; a condor appears giving the player cryptic hints (when available). This can be employed only 3 times in each playthrough.Game documentation Reception Sinclair User awarded 2 stars out of 5, describing the game as \\"not very original\\" and \\"rather small.\\" Crash praised its distinct style. Aktueller Software Markt gave it 8.5 out of 10. Zzap!64 rated it 75 out of 100. Your Sinclair rated it 7 out of 10 and Tilt gave it 4 Stars. Info said it was a nice graphic adventure game. Amstrad Action felt the game was surprising. Lemon64 felt the title was merely adequate.

Accredo provides specialty drugs, drugs that cost more than $600 per month, with the average being $10,000 a month, which treat serious conditions such as multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, hemophilia and cancer. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of Express Scripts and is headquartered in Memphis. History Southern Health Systems (SHS), Accredo's predecessor, was founded in 1983. SHS distributed Protropin, a human growth hormone, and clotting factor. Accredo Health, Inc. was organized in 1996. The following year it acquired Southern Health Systems, Inc. (SHS) and its wholly owned subsidiary, Nova Factor, Inc. (NFI). Soon thereafter, Accredo acquired Hemophilia Health Services (HHS). In 1999, Accredo filed its IPO and became a public company, trading on NASDAQ under the ticker ACDO. In 2004, Medco Health Solutions Inc. allied with Accredo Health to form a specialty pharmacy. In June of that year, its wholly owned subsidiary, HHS acquired Hemophilia Resources of America. In August the following year, Medco acquired Accredo and it became a wholly owned subsidiary of the company. In 2012, Express Scripts acquired Medco, making Accredo a wholly owned subsidiary of Express Scripts. As a result, Accredo merged with CuraScript SP Specialty Pharmacy, operating under the name Accredo. Accredo offers over 300 specialty drugs which are offered in 30 pharmacies nationwide. Pharmaceuticals Accredo's pharmacy provides infused, injectable, and oral drugs that are used to treat complex, chronic and life-threatening diseases.

The conditions covered by Accredo's TRCs include bleeding disorders, cardiovascular, diabetes, Hepatitis C, HIV and Immunology, immune disorders, inflammatory conditions, Multiple Sclerosis, neuroscience, oncology, pulmonary, pulmonary hypertension and women's health. The purpose of the teams is to provide specialty drugs, ensure dosage is correct for each patient, and encourage drug compliance to reduce waste and costs for all parties. Side effect management is an important part of TRC, as side effects are a large contributor to patients not complying with their drug regimens. Pharmacists and nurses also provide patient counseling and education. The oncology TRC includes oncology decision support tools for physicians and patients in partnership with Eviti, Inc. It is broken up into subdivisions for types of cancer to provide drug-specific support. The company's Clinical Day Supply program addresses patient noncompliance with oral oncology drug regimens. To reduce waste as well as to monitor patient drug tolerance, Accredo gave only a half fill of prescription medications, then performed a clinical assessment to monitor patient drug tolerance and help ensure that patients do not take unnecessary or ineffective drugs. With the program, treatment options can also be reexamined if the drugs are working, but side effects are hindering quality of life.

Ravikumar in his debut feature. The film is jointly produced by Thirukumaran Entertainment and Studio Green, and features Vishnu Vishal and Miya in the lead while Karunakaran, T. M. Karthik, P. Ravi Shankar and Jayaprakash play supporting roles. The film received positive reviews from critics and became a box office hit. Plot In the year 2065, a scientist (Arya) invents a time machine. To prove its capability, he sends it back in time to 2015, programming it to return within forty seconds. However, the machine does not return. The time machine is seen by three people in 2015 — Elango (Vishnu Vishal), a budding entrepreneur whose ideas are rejected by all and is struggling to maintain his relationship with his rich girlfriend Anu (Miya George), who is embarrassed at the fact that Elango is unemployed; Elango's best friend Pulivetti Arumugam (Karunakaran), a fake astrologer; and an inventor Giridhara Parthasarathy (T. M. Karthik), who makes a living by repairing home appliances. The three of them are involved in an accident and witness the time machine while recovering from the shock. While Parthasarathy decides to keep the time machine for himself, he suffers an electric shock and ends up in a coma, prompting Elango and Arumugam to steal the time machine from Parthasarathy's shop. The duo use the time machine to make Arumugam's astrology practice extremely successful by going back in time and finding things lost by people under the guise of astrology. Elango further uses the machine to impress Anu's industrialist father Rajarathinam (Jayaprakash) by going to the future, obtaining the stock market results and successfully \\"predicting\\" them in front of Rajarathinam and his company's board of directors. Rajarathinam soon approves the marriage of Anu with Elango. Things go smoothly until Elango and Arumugam inadvertently thwart an encounter to kill Kuzhandaivelu (P. Ravi Shankar), a dreaded gangster and extortionist who is targeting Rajarathinam, during one of their trips to the past to find yet another item of one of Arumugam's clients. In the present day, Kuzhandaivelu is plotting to kill Rajarathinam for his role in planning the encounter and also Elango and Arumugam for (unknowingly) attacking him in a parking lot. Elango and Anu's marriage is postponed indefinitely as a result. Elango and Arumugam go back to the past to fix their mistake, but Kuzhandaivelu accidentally shoots the time machine while fighting a police officer during the encounter, damaging it. The duo find Parthasarathy, who has woken up from his coma but doesn't remember them, and ask him to fix the time machine. While Parthasarathy manages to fix the time machine, due to a lack of specific parts which have not yet been developed, it can only take the user to a specific time in the past (when Kuzhandaivelu damaged the time machine) and also as the date cannot be changed, the user cannot return to the future. Therefore, the duo decide not to use it. Later, Kuzhandaivelu spots Elango, Arumugam and Anu at a mall and pursues them. He opens fire during the chase, killing Anu. To ensure that Anu remains alive, Elango decides to use the time machine to return to the past and kill Kuzhandaivelu, even though he cannot return. But Kuzhandaivelu spots the duo and while fighting them, all three of them fall into the time machine and go to the past. In the past, Kuzhandaivelu destroys the time machine, but Elango manages to kill Kuzhandaivelu. Then, Elango and Arumugam stop themselves from finding the time machine by thwarting the accident involving them and Parthasarathy. The next morning, Elango wakes up in a bed, remembering only the events of the previous night. He soon finds out, to his surprise, that he is in a marriage hall and that he will marry Anu on that day. He does not remember, to Anu's bewilderment, any of the events which had occurred in the past two months as a result of his usage of the time machine during that period. He finds out that, without finding the time machine, he got a job and managed to impress Rajarathinam with one of his business ideas, leading to his marriage with Anu. Arumugam, who also doesn't remember anything over the past two months, is happily married. Elango and Arumugam soon find out that Kuzhandaivelu had died two months ago. They also run into Parthasarathy, who does not recognise them as they had never met. Since the time machine was never seen, it returned to 2065, making it a success.

All cases reported so far are sporadic. The syndrome was originally described in 1989Wiedemann H-R, Kunze J, Dibbern H. 1989. Atlas der klinischen Syndrome für Klinik und Praxis 3rd edition. Stuttgart: Schattauer. pp 198–199. by Hans-Rudolf Wiedemann. The genetic basis for the syndrome was identified by Dr. Wendy D. Jones in 2012. Signs and symptoms Features described in Wiedemann–Steiner syndrome include: * Short stature * Developmental delay * Low muscle tone (hypotonia) especially in infancy * Characteristic facial features * Hairy elbows (hypertrichosis cubiti) Wiedemann–Steiner syndrome may be related to global developmental delays, sleeping difficulties, feeding and digestion complexities, unusual facial features, short/petite stature, hypotonia, dental issues, hairy elbows, long eyelashes, etc. Cause Wiedemann–Steiner syndrome results from mutations in the MLL (also known as KMT2A) gene on the long arm of chromosome 11. The gene encodes a histone-modification enzyme — that is, it helps modify the expression of other genes. The condition is autosomal dominant, meaning that only one abnormal copy of the gene is needed for a person to have the syndrome. In a majority of cases to date, the mutation occurred de novo — that is, neither parent was affected and the mutation is sporadic. Offspring of those with WSS have a 50% chance of having WSS. The mechanism by which mutations in the MLL gene cause the phenotype of Wiedemann–Steiner syndrome is not yet known. Diagnosis If Wiedemann–Steiner syndrome is suspected, analysis of the MLL gene can be carried out. Otherwise, it may be diagnosed by whole-exome sequencing or whole genome sequencing. There is limited diagnostic testing in this area. The standard screening tests that take place during pregnancy that can diagnose syndromes such as Down Syndrome do not diagnose WSS. In addition, baseline genetics diagnostic tests conducted after birth do not include testing for WSS. Whole exome sequencing has been used to identify most people with WSS. Often, medical professionals do not offer the option for whole exome testing or the costs associated are not covered by insurance or require a large copay limiting individuals from having the testing done. Frequently, patients are given other incorrect medical explanations or a less specific and broader diagnosis, like autism and Rubinstein–Taybi syndrome. Additionally, once a person reaches a certain age or phase in their lifetime having been mis-diagnosed or gone undiagnosed, he/she may stop looking for answers to their medical trials and tribulations meaning they may never come across a formal WSS diagnosis. There have also been patients with Wiedemann–Steiner syndrome who were initially mis-diagnosed with Kabuki syndrome. Treatment There is no specific cure or treatment for Wiedemann–Steiner syndrome. Children with this condition may benefit from a range of supportive treatments such as physiotherapy, speech therapy, supplementary nutrition for poor feeding, and special educational support. Those affected with Wiedemann–Steiner syndrome often receive physical, occupational, speech, feeding, and/or behavioral therapies. Hippotherapy and music therapy have also been helpful to those affected by WSS. School-aged children affected with WSS may benefit from one-on-one aides, modified instruction, and/or special day class environments. Epidemiology A few hundred people have been documented with the condition worldwide. Once thought to have an incidence of 1 in 1,000,000, some research has suggested the incidence may be as high as 1 in 40,000 [reference needed].

In a career spanning more than 40 years, Small has been a member of three rock bands: Prism, Scrubbaloe Caine, and Small Wonder. With Prism, Small enjoyed great success and recognition in the early 1980s. His first studio album with the band was Small Change, released in 1981. It was the band's most commercially successful studio album on the Billboard 200, being their first and only album to the make the Top 100. The lead single, \\"Don't Let Him Know\\", co-written by Jim Vallance with Bryan Adams, became Prism's first and only Top 40 hit in the US. It went on to peak at number-one on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart in 1982, and stayed in the charts for just over four months. Their follow-up album, Beat Street, released in 1983, however, was more of a solo album by Small than a Prism album as it features no founding members of the band and relied heavily on session musicians. After Prism broke up in 1984, Small worked with the Who's bass guitarist John Entwistle, singing the lead vocals on his sixth solo album The Rock which was released ten years after it was first recorded, in 1996. He has also worked with Eddie Money, Doug Cox, and Richie Zito. Small pursued a solo career and released his debut album Time in 2002. He is currently working as a morning radio personality at CIFM-FM in Kamloops, British Columbia. Early life Henry Cave Small was born on February 29, 1948, in Beacon, New York. He learned how to play the violin at an early age, but in high school discovered other kinds of music. He was bullied as a child because of his height, which lead to confrontations. Musical career =1971–1975: Scrubbaloe Caine= From 1970–1975, Small was a member of the band Scrubbaloe Caine. Other members included Paul Dean later of Loverboy, and the band was produced by David Kershenbaum from RCA. The band released one studio album, Round One in 1973. They broke-up in 1975, after being unable to find a new recording contract. =1976–1977: Small Wonder= In 1976, Small formed the band Small Wonder with James Phillips, Jerry Morin, and William King. They released their debut album, Small Wonder, in the same year. In 1977, they released their second album Growin'. Small Wonder brought Small a three-year songwriting contract with Irving Almo Music. During this period, he made a guest appearance on Burt Sugarman's The Midnight Special. =1981–1984: Prism= From 1981–84, Small was a member of the rock band Prism. As the band were preparing to record their follow-up album to Young and Restless in the summer of 1981, lead singer Ron Tabak was fired. Various reasons cited were his conflicts with other band members, several run-ins with the law, and lack of songwriting ability. Around the same time, keyboardist John Hall left the band. Small was brought in, and the new four-piece line-up of Small, guitarist Lindsay Mitchell, bass player Al Harlow, and drummer Rocket Norton recorded the album Small Change, which was released later in 1981. The first track on the album \\"Don't Let Him Know\\", written by Jim Vallance (using his real name, as opposed to the Roddy Higgs moniker he often used in his work with the band) and Bryan Adams, became Prism's first Top 40 hit in the US and a number-one single on Billboard's new Rock Tracks chart. Their follow-up single \\"Turn on Your Radar\\" also charted, becoming their fifth and final song to chart in the U.S. By the end of the tour for Small Change, Mitchell, Harlow and Norton had individually left Prism. With Mitchell's departure, Prism now had no founding members left. In 1982, the band's touring line-up was Small, guitarist Paul Warren, bass player John Trivers, keyboardist Robyn Robbins, and Doug Maddick on drums. Although the band had essentially broken-up by the end of 1982, Small decided to continue recording as a solo artist but using the Prism name. He assembled a group of session musicians including Richie Zito, Alan Pasqua, Mike Baird and backing vocalists Bill Champlin (Chicago), Bobby Kimball (Toto) and Timothy B. Schmit (Eagles) to assist him. Together, this ad hoc line-up released the album Beat Street under the Prism name in 1983. The album was not a commercial success, and failed to have any charting singles in Canada. Small, by now the band's only member, was dropped from his label, and essentially retired from using the Prism name in early 1984, and the 'band' became defunct. =1985–present= In 1996, John Entwistle, bass guitarist for the Who, released his sixth solo album titled The Rock. This was his only solo album on which he did not sing any of the lead vocals, a role filled instead by Small. The album was actually recorded over an 18-month period in 1985 at Entwistle's Hammerhead Studios in England and was meant to be released by WEA. Legal issues kept it in the vaults for ten years, and the album was then released in four different editions between 1996 and 2005, with separate covers for each. AllMusic wrote of the album \\"There's no questioning the technical skill of the performances—this band sounds tight and expert throughout, and Entwistle and [Zak] Starkey are a mighty rhythm section.

Early life  Mária Filep was born in Debrecen in 1953. She completed her degree in architecture at the University of Debrecen.  Career  She worked at the Hajdú County State Construction Company as an architectural engineer. She was the founding member of the Hungarian Democratic Forum in Debrecen, the first opposition organization in the town. The members gathered in pubs and restaurants at weekends.  Pan-European Picnic  The idea of a Pan-European Picnic came up at one of these gatherings on 30 June 1989 in the garden of Old Vigadó Restaurant. Subsequently Filep started organizing it with a few colleagues. She risked her job and her freedom. Even though her employers suspected something was going on they did not ask questions. At first she found little support. The Roundtable Talks of Debrecen and the Hungarian Democratic Forum (MDF) rejected her overtures as unprofessional. However, the idea reached fruition took place with the support of individual MDF volunteers from Debrecen and Sopron. Hundreds of East-German citizens broke through the border-closure and set off to neutral Austria while the event was taking place. By doing so, they launched the destruction of the Iron Curtain (wall) separating the two countries. The pressure from East German refugees flooding Hungary has eventually led to the opening of the borders on 11 September 1989.  Later career  Filep went on cooperating with the MDF, but in 1994 she decided to leave the party and end her political activity. She returned to her job but she still finds civil activity important in public life. She is the president of Hajdúság–Partium Preservation Society, which is committed to urban protection, architectural and natural heritage conservation and a member of the Board of Governors of the Hungarian Urban and Village Preservation Association. She places special emphasis on preserving the heritage of the Pan-European Picnic. She remains a member of the Board of Trustees. In 2000 she organized a conference in Debrecen about cyanide contamination and the consequent ecological disaster. She organized several exhibitions titled Changes in Central Europe to familiarize people with the ideas of the Picnic.

The family consists of; dad Roger Rantanen, who used to work as a vacuum cleaner salesman; mum Ritva Rantanen from Finland, who used to work on a ferry; sister Isadora Rantanen, 14 years old and in love with the hotel competitor family's son; and Ingo Rantanen, is a big friend of animals and finds out there is a pig on the hotel, named Pyret. The Rantanens are struggling to keep the hotel running as a new more modern hotel, opened by the Grossman family, has started up nearby the highway. Many guests checked out after Ingo, one of the family members, accidentley told there was a pig on the hotel. A journalist arrived at the hotel and checked in, and was shortly after checked out after finding out there's barely no food, very old style and about the pig. She therefore stopped by the hotel sign on the alley leading to the hotel, adding \\"KN\\" before \\"orren\\", which turns out as \\"knorren\\" (\\"pigtail\\").

It is a Debian-based Linux distribution with a modified Ubuntu LTS kernel and allows deployment and management of virtual machines and containers. Proxmox VE includes a web console and command-line tools, and provides a REST API for third-party tools. Two types of virtualization are supported: container-based with LXC (starting from version 4.0 replacing OpenVZ used in version up to 3.4, included), and full virtualization with KVM. It comes with a bare-metal installer and includes a web-based management interface.Vervloesem, Koen. \\"Proxmox VE 2.0 review – A virtualisation server for any situation\\", Linux User & Developer, 11 April 2012. Retrieved on 16 July 2015. Proxmox VE is licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License, version 3.  History  Development of Proxmox VE started when Dietmar Maurer and Martin Maurer, two Linux developers, found out OpenVZ had no backup tool and no management GUI. KVM was appearing at the same time in Linux, and was added shortly afterwards. The first public release took place in April 2008, and the platform quickly gained traction. It was one of the few platforms providing out-of-the-box support for container and full virtualization, managed with a web-based user interface similar to commercial offerings. Features Proxmox VE is a powerful open-source server virtualization platform to manage two virtualization technologies - KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) for virtual machines and LXC for containers - with a single web-based interface.Proxmox: The Ultimate Hypervisor Proxmox employs kernel virtual machine (KVM) virtualization to support just about any operating system that you can download and install into a fully virtualized collection of hardware. And, yes, this is the same KVM that Red Hat, Inc. owns and uses as its enterprise-level virtualization solution. It also integrates out-of-the-box-tools for configuring high availability between servers, software-defined storage, networking, and disaster recovery. = KVM & Container Virtualization = Server virtualization supporting Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) and container-based virtualization with Linux Containers (LXC). =Storage model= Proxmox VE supports local storage with LVM group, directory and ZFS, as well as network storage types with iSCSI, Fibre Channel, NFS, GlusterFS, CEPH. =High-availability cluster= Proxmox VE can be clustered across multiple server nodes. Since version 2.0, Proxmox VE offers a high availability option for clusters based on the Corosync communication stack. Individual virtual servers can be configured for high availability, using the built-in ha-manager. If a Proxmox node becomes unavailable or fails the virtual servers can be automatically moved to another node and restarted. The database- and FUSE-based Proxmox Cluster filesystem (pmxcfs) makes it possible to perform the configuration of each cluster node via the Corosync communication stack. =Live migration= At least since 2012, in a HA cluster, live virtual machines can be moved from one physical host to another without downtime. Since Proxmox VE 1.0, released 29.10.2008 KVM and OpenVZ live migration is supported. =Virtual appliances= Proxmox VE has pre- packaged server software appliances which can be downloaded via the GUI. It is possible to download and deploy appliances from the TurnKey Linux Virtual Appliance Library.The Proxmox developers have released several virtual appliances, which are ready-made OpenVZ templates that can be downloaded directly from within the Proxmox web interface.

Yildiz represented her nation Turkey in two editions of the Olympic Games (2000 and 2004), where she failed to reach the quarterfinals in the 48-kg division. Throughout most of her sporting career, Yildiz trained for Ordu Judo Ihtisas Club in her native Istanbul under head coach and sensei Haldun Efemgil. Yildiz made her official debut at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, where she competed in the women's extra-lightweight class (48 kg). She received a bye in the first round, but succumbed her opening match to Ukraine's Lyudmyla Lusnikova upon the judges' irrevocable decision. In 2001, Yildiz reached the pinnacle of her judo career at the Mediterranean Games, where she became the first female Turkish judoka to capture the gold medal in her sport upon pinning Italy's Giuseppina Macrì in the final match by an ippon score. Two years later, Yildiz shared bronze medals with Cuba's Danieska Carrión in the same division at the 2003 World Judo Championships in Osaka, Japan to guarantee her spot on the Turkish team for her second Olympic stint. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Yildiz qualified as a lone female judoka for her second Turkish squad in the women's extra-lightweight class (48 kg), by placing third and receiving a berth from the World Championships in Osaka, Japan. Yildiz opened her fight with a more convincing victory by a waza-ari score over North Korea's Ri Kyong-ok, before she fell shortly in her next match to South Korea's Ye Gue-rin with a double shido deduction and a non-combative penalty. Shortly after her second Olympic stint, Yildiz redeemed her strength to pick up two more bronze medals in her career hardware at the 2005 Mediterranean Games in Almería, Spain, and later at the 2005 European Judo Championships in Rotterdam, Netherlands.

History It was built for the John Leslie, the Duke of Rothes between 1667 and 1674 and this became the seat of the Rothes family. The house which was dubbed Villa De Rothes was the centre of life in the village and once rivalled Holyrood Palace for both size and glamour. A 1667 extension was by a design of William Bruce.Wemyss, Charles (2005) \\"Merchant and Citizen of Rotterdam: The Early Career of Sir William Bruce\\". Architectural Heritage Vol. XVI When a fire destroyed the building in 1763, the north, east and south wings were demolished. Only the west wing was retained and this was reconstructed between 1745 and 1747. From 1904 to 1919 Leslie House was the home of Noëlle, Countess of Rothes, a noted philanthropist who became famous as a heroine of the Titanic disaster in 1912. During World War I Lady Rothes converted a wing of Leslie House into a hospital for wounded soldiers invalided from the Front.A Matter of Course : The Story of Noelle Rothes, Titanic's \\"Plucky Little Countess\\" by Randy Bryan Bigham Leslie House was again severely damaged by fire in February 2009.

Architecture and fittings Historic sketching by John Claude Nattes, 1804 John Maitland, 1st Duke of Lauderdale, and his wife Elizabeth Murry, Duchess of Lauderdale The architecture and fittings were described by Leighton in 1840: \\"It originally formed a quadrangle, enclosing in the centre an extensive court-yard, but three of the sides were burnt down in December 1763. The fourth side was repaired, and forms the present house. The picture gallery in this part of the building, which is hung with portraits of connections of the family, is three feet longer than the gallery at Holyroodhouse.\\" Among the several pictures at Leslie House in the mid 19th century mentioned by Leighton, \\"were those of the fifth Earl and his Countess, by Jamieson, the Duke and Duchess of Rothes, the celebrated Duke of Lauderdale and his Duchess, the Princess of Modena; General John, Earl of Rothes, by Sir Joshua Reynolds; Archbishop Tillotson; and a portrait of Rembrandt by himself.\\" A portrait of the Princess of Modena and a large collection of family portraits are also mentioned. The house featured several tapestries including, the story of Leander; the history of the children of Israel's journey through the wilderness; and the anointing of Saul. In the mid 19th century, the relics preserved in the house included the dagger with its sheath used by Norman Leslie, master of Rothes, at the murder of Cardinal Bethune; and the sword of State carried by the Duke of Rothes at the coronation of Charles II at Scone. Grounds Painting of Leslie House and grounds Blackwood (1836) remarked that, \\"The plantations of Leslie House are remarkably fine. The species that thrive best seem to be ash, elm, common beech, oak, and the silver-fir. The larch does not thrive so well...

Mann Memorial Library is the public library of West Paris, Maine. It is located in Main Street in the town center, in a building that resembles a small castle. The architecturally distinctive building was designed by the Lewiston firm of Gibbs & Pulsifer, and was built in 1926 as a gift from Lewis Mann in honor of his son Arthur. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. Architecture and library history The library building is a fieldstone structure, roughly divided into three sections. The most prominent section is the crenellated tower, which projects forward and left of the bulk of the building, and has three narrow casement windows on the front, staggered in height. To its right, in the center of the main facade, is an arched entrance bay, topped by an elevated parapet with crenellations and flanked on the right by a narrow casement window and a buttress. To the far right is a section lower in height, also topped with crenellations, dominated by a large many-paned window. The interior has a fairly conventional library layout, with a central circulation desk, a reading room to the right, and stacks to the left. The tower houses a sitting area, and does not have (despite the appearance of the external windows) a stairwell. The origins of the West Paris Library are in a private subscription library founded in 1889, a model used by many small communities in Maine at the time. This association received municipal funds in 1925, becoming a free library. In these years it was housed in a variety of locations. Lewis Mann, a longtime West Paris resident, bequested land and funds (the latter matched by his son Edwin) for this building, which was completed in 1926. It was one of a series of library commissions executed by the Lewiston firm of Gibbs & Pulsifer, which included the public libraries of Lewiston and Dover-Foxcroft.

However, still heavily influential on the trade globally, British publishers such as Penguin Books and Pearson remain dominant players within the industry and continue to publish titles globally.

Looking at the data provided, Richard Mollet, chief executive of The Publishers Association, explains that \\"those who ever tried to maintain that this was a binary choice have been shown to have been posing the question in the wrong way. It is not a question of either physical or digital winning out, but rather of the sector coalescing around a balanced marketplace where all formats have place. While publishing has been efficient and effective in its adaptation, the underlying driver of the evolution is of course the reader. What the 21st-century consumer desires above all is choice. As long as publishers can give readers the option of paper or screen, the market will - and is - taking care of itself. The ebook is no more a challenge to the lifespan of paper than television is to the theatre\\".

This process was initiated following the coup d’état of the Burmese junta in 1988 in order to transform the underperforming Burmese economy. Historical context Following its decolonization in 1948, Burma showed a promising economic potential as the \\"rice mile\\" of Asia, becoming the worldwide number one exporter of rice from 1960 to 1963. In 1962, Burma became a socialist country and the economy collapsed under the rule of the Burma Socialist Programme Party, following the program of the Burmese Way to Socialism. The first liberalization reforms occurred in 1987 under the new presidency of San Yu. The full reorientation toward a market economy followed the instauration of the Burmese junta rule, after the coup d'état which established the State Law and Order Restoration Council. Liberalization reforms There are two main patterns of the liberalization process. The first one, acted in September 1987, concerns the marketization and removal of restrictions in the sector of agriculture. From that point, individuals are free to grow any type of crop and export their agricultural production. Those laws are significant in a country where 70% of the population is rural and its livelihoods are consequently mainly related to agriculture. However, the liberalization was not complete since the rice market had been excluded from the reforms, and only experienced marketization during a second liberalization in 2004.Okamoto,Ikuko. \\"Chapter 7: Transforming Myanmar’s rice marketing\\" in The second one is the Foreign Investment Law of November 1988. This allows foreign capitals in a company from joint venture participation with a minimum of 35% of foreign holdings to a full detention with 100% of foreign equity. In order to attract foreign capitals, the law brings guarantees against the possibility of nationalization. It also ensures three years of tax exemption and the repatriation of profits. Impact of liberalization on economic activity and livelihood The evaluation of the performance of the post-1988 Burmese economy is incomplete due to the lack of data released by the government and the absence or unreliability of official reports. Observation and analysis of liberalization policies on livelihood in Burma thus comes from the work of social scientists and journalists. The different reforms conducted tend to have boosted one economic sector which is the extraction of fossil fuels, mainly oil and gas. The opening to FDIs has given the opportunity to a range of foreign companies to initiate the exploitation of the rich natural resources of the Burmese soil. The rest of the economy is portrayed as having no real benefits from FDIs liberalization because of the high risks that represent the uncertainty of the Burmese economy to foreign investors. =Perceived progresses= The US embassy in Rangoon has reported that the living conditions of peasants have increased as a result of the liberalization since the late 1980s, with rise in the farm incomes and access to a range of technologies including generator power and diesel fueled irrigation pumps that can replace animal powered alternatives. Consequently, farmers do not need to secure food for their cattle and get less livelihood dependency on them (potential issues are feeding and treating animals). Ikuko Okamoto analyses the effect of the second rice liberalization: \\"In the liberalization process... the private rice marketing sector was able to achieve self- sustaining development. The government’s policy to promote rice production and cut-backs in the volume of rice procurement increased the amount of rice sold in the market, which induced more traders to enter the rice-marketing business\\".Okamoto,Ikuko. \\"Chapter 7: Transforming Myanmar’s rice marketing\\" in Liberalization was thus beneficial for the expansion of a private market in which new kind of jobs such as rice traders, gave new opportunities and livelihoods characteristic of market economies, outside traditional agricultural production. The liberalization also implied the freedom for farmers to crop what they want and consequently to practice multiple cropping, eventually being less reliant on the growth of only one crop and the variations in the market prices of those ones. Farmers are more likely to secure their income and consequently gain access to food and other basic necessities. =Critics of economic reforms results= The most frequently denounced collateral effect of liberalization on the livelihoods of Burmese people is the environmental degradation due to the multiplication of energy exploitation projects by foreign companies. A number of environmental issues critical to livelihoods are not tackled within the liberalization process. \\"Pressing environmental issues include public health, sanitation, clean drinking water, soil erosion, agricultural technological development, assessing the impact of importing foreign seeds and proper designs for irrigation projects\\".Myint, Tun \\"Chapter 9: Environmental governance\\" in The construction of pipelines is denounced by NGOs as a threat to livelihoods throughout the destruction farming lands and fishing grounds, which can also be classified as restricted access zones. The simple consequence is the making of jobless populations in those areas where pipeline projects are pursued. The loss of farming land is not the only consequence: the example of construction of tourist resorts (tourism being the other activity expanding thanks to the FDIs reforms) destroying forests leaves no wood and bamboo to local population, making the construction of houses impossible. The development of the energy industry requires the employment of skilled workers. Foreign companies exploiting Burmese gas thus tend to import their employed workforce. The Foreign Investment Law has been initially criticized for not prioritizing the human local development and employment enough. It does not bring a new alternative to the third of the rural population that does not possess lands to secure a subsistence production. The lack of FDIs in other industrial sectors also causes employment issues in urban areas.Turnell,Sean. \\"Chapter 6: Myanmar’s economy in 2006\\" in The marketization of agriculture is portrayed as being beneficial mainly to large-scale exploitation involved in agribusiness, more than to small landowners relying to subsistence farming. Large exploitation establishments threaten local farmers through their cheap production capacity and do not provide landless people livelihood alternatives: the mechanization of large scale plantations implies a limited number of job opportunities, and consequently lowers wage rates of rural workers. Khin Maung Kyi et al. have also argued that macroeconomic policies inappropriate to the process of liberalization have caused high inflation. The inflation rate between 1988 and 1996 is estimated at 1000%. The purchasing power has consequently gone down, making the ability of poor Burmese to secure access to food and other primary commodities weaker, despite their progress in securing incomes. The liberalization of the market also has a wrong impact on the ability of farmers to grow crops because the free market system implies an \\"increase in the prices of fertilizer and other agricultural inputs\\". The regularity of farming production is thus threatened. Another point on which liberalization process in Burma has been denounced as misled is that it is incomplete. Market reforms often need to be tied to property law reforms. In Myanmar, despite liberalization, farmers are not protected from land confiscation when they are demarcated as wasteland, threatening the livelihood of subsistence farmers. The study of living standards indicator in Myanmar can also suggest that over the time, the situation has not progressed. Both the Central Statical Organization (CSO) in 1999 and the IHLCA Project Technical Unit in 2010 state that one-quarter of Burmese households spend 70% of their income on food. Accessing food security is thus still a problem despite the liberalization efforts. The liberalization impact can be summarized by Sean Turnell view, stating that the industries favored by the shift to market economy \\"create relatively few jobs and impose large environmental costs on the local population, so that they are doing little to create “the foundations for future growth”\\".

He later received and Mlitt degree from the university of Edinburg. After years of teaching literature at Makerere, he joined the Ugandan diplomatic service in 1998 and served in various capacities as an ambassador.  Pan-Africanism  Gakwandi theorized a re-imagined African continent, due to his belief that \\"political restructuring of the continent is a more important priority that needs to be addressed before economic restructuring can bring about the desired results.\\" Moreover, Gakwandi argues that the colonially inherited borders are the source of the small size of the majority of African states, causing the levels of poverty, dependency, underdevelopment, and ethnic conflict that is currently experienced in the region. Thus, Gakwandi proposed the creation of a new political map of Africa that would eliminate landlocked countries, as a way to mitigate border disputes, reunite African nationalities currently divided by the colonial borders, provide new states with an adequate resource base, ease existing intrastate ethnic tensions, enhance Africa's world standing, and reduce inter-ethnic tensions. With these critical objectives in mind, Gakwandi proposed a new political map of Africa consisting of seven African conglomerate states to represent the critical regions of Africa. These seven new states consisted of the Sahara Republic, Senegambia, Central Africa and Swahili Republic, Ethiopia, Swahili Republic, Mozambia, and Madagascar. The Sahara Republic state would encompass North Africa, Senegambia would encompass West Africa, the Central Africa and Swahili Republic would encompass Central Africa, Ethiopia would encompass modern-day Ethiopia as well as Eritrea, the Swahili Republic would include East Africa and art of Central Africa, Mozambia would include Southern Africa. In Gakwandi's imagining, Madagascar would remain as it currently stands and would not be incorporated into a new republic.

Although the death toll is unknown, documents attest a large number of dead and displaced people. At people's pressure, Prince Alexandru Ioan Cuza started a project of sewering the Dâmbovița River, which concretized only in 1880, after the plans of engineer Grigore Cerkez. Modern facilities were built to supply water to the city and 12 bridges.  Flooding  Prince Alexandru Ioan Cuza and Dr. Carol Davila visiting the Tabaci neighborhood during the flooding of Bucharest, three years before the catastrophe of 1865. The period between 1862 and 1865 was marked by severe flooding in this part of the country. The sixth decade of the 19th century was marked by severe flooding in the area surrounding the capital, mainly caused by torrential rains. Additional snowmelt in the spring of 1865 caused one of the most devastating natural disasters in the history of Bucharest. Then, the Dâmbovița River flooded large parts of Bucharest, lying from Grozăvești to Vitan. According to some documents cited by historian Dan Falcan, the water level reached up to three meters in some areas, ravaging Calea Rahovei, the Manuc's Inn and the Mihai Vodă Hill. Moreover, the circulation was totally interrupted, and water and food supply were made with great difficulty. In an article from The Illustrated London News appears that \\"nearly one-half of the straggling extent of Bucharest is submerged\\", showing the ampleness of the flood.  Reactions  The troops, especially the artillery and engineers, were deployed on the spot with boats. Bread, meat, wine and spirits were voluntarily furnished by the wealthier inhabitants of the upper districts. The press began a violent campaign against the government, accused that spent the money from taxes on unnecessary things, such as theaters, gardens, cattle breed improvement, etc., although the population was exposed to such calamities. At the request of Prince Cuza, the government passed a law to dismantle the manorial mills that hindered the flow of Dâmbovița River. Likewise, it's passed a law according to that all mills and sluices that \\"throttle\\" waters to be dismantled, in order not to repeat the catastrophe. Historians note that work began immediately, with hundreds of prisoners taken to work from prisons around Bucharest. The river bed was cleaned and widened to 20 meters, and bridges with pylons in water were destroyed.

After he and his friend, Sinclair Lewis, dropped out of Yale during his junior year, he made a living working odd jobs, as well as writing stories for magazines and newspapers. In 1917 he had his first novel published. He moved to Paris in the mid 1920s, where he lived until his death in 1965. In addition to his six novels, he published poetry, short stories and essays, as well as having a short stint as a book reviewer. He was married twice: after a brief marriage to Edith Summers, which produced two children, he married freelance writer and fashion consultant Dora Loues Miller, who he remained married to for more than forty years, until his death in 1965. Early life Updegraff was born into a Dutch Quaker family, the son of William Ross Updegraff and his wife Laura Alda (née Heberling) on February 14, 1883 in Grinnell, Iowa. After graduating from the public schools in Springfield, Missouri, he attended Drury College, also in Springfield, for a year. In the all of 1903 he entered Yale University. During his freshman year he won the annual award for \\"excellence in English\\" for his paper on James Fenimore Cooper, for which he received a $30 prize. While at Yale Updegraff was the editor of the monthly college magazine, the Yale College Monthly. He also befriended Harry Sinclair Lewis (better known as simply Sinclair Lewis), a young, literary student, and the two became roommates. Before graduating from Yale, in October 1906, both Updegraff and Lewis dropped out of Yale. They joined Upton Sinclair's communist community in Englewood, New Jersey, called Helicon Hall. The two worked as janitors, although they had been promised by Sinclair that they would be allowed to pursue their literary careers, During their brief time there, Lewis became engaged to Upton Sinclair's secretary, Edith Summers. After a month, during which Lewis and Updegraff spent most of their time \\"carrying around beds and mattresses and tending a furnace that insisted upon going out,\\" the two left and moved into a tenement on the lower east side in New York City, on Avenue B between Fourteenth and Fifteenth Streets. Updegraf did not remain in his new apartment very long, and in the summer of 1907 he and a friend, Joseph Barrat, began a journey on foot from New York to Fiji, by way of San Francisco, although some accounts had him going out west to seek fresher air to help him get over a bout of malaria. However, the two aborted their travels, and Updegraff returned to New York in October 1907. Upon his return he replaced his friend Sinclair Lewis in two important roles. First, he took over Lewis position as assistant editor at Transatlantic Tales, and second, he became engaged to Summers, after she broke up with Lewis. Neither moved caused a rift in the friendship between Updegraff and Lewis. During this early part of his life Updegraff supported himself with a number of clerical positions, including at the Charity Organization Society and Publishers' Newspaper Syndicate. In 1908 Updegraff and Summers were married, and the couple had two children, a son and a daughter. However, the marriage did not last long, and the two were divorced in 1911. About 1914 he married Florence Maule Cooley, a noted suffragist. They had a son, David Maule Updegraff in 1917.1920 census, Woodstock, NY Early writing career One of his earliest works to be published was his poem, \\"A Touch of Nature\\", published in The Reader Magazine in 1905. From 1907–10 Updegraff had a series of stories, poems and essays published in collections and in newspapers across the country. Some of the short stories include: \\"The Winner of the Game\\", published in the November 1909 edition of Short Stories; and \\"The Man's Wife\\", published in Ainslee's Magazine in December 1909. Some of his essays/short stories published in national newspapers included: \\"A German Alliance\\", \\"Two Mornings\\", \\"The Wash-Publish Machine\\", \\"Mr. Boggs Pulls Wires\\", and \\"That Remarkable Infant\\". His poetry appeared in numerous anthologies, including a monthly literary publication called The Smart Set, as well as in newspapers, such as \\"Bacchic\\" in 1907 in the New Castle Herald, and \\"The Incarnation\\" in the Los Angeles Herald in 1908. During the 1910s, Updegraff continued to publish stories in magazines and newspapers. Some of those publications included McClure's, The Coming Nation, and Scribner's. The Washington Times praised Updegraff's short story, \\"The White Light Liar\\", about a doorman at a Broadway restaurant. The Times called the story \\"a gem\\", and stated that Upegraff had a \\"... sure touch of inspiration, backed by what seems the largest fund of information and experience ever accorded a writing man.\\" During this period, Updegraff also made money as a critic, reviewing others' books. He also continued to publish stories in newspapers, such as \\"A Gentleman From Jupiter\\". In 1915, Updegraff was one of thirty-one signatories to a letter charging John D. Rockefeller Jr. with murder for his role in events leading to the Ludlow Massacre and the subsequent convictions of striker leaders Updegraff's first novel, Second Youth (1917), was published by Harper & Brothers to much literary fanfare, The New York Times opining that out of the new writers emerging, \\"none [is] more promising in a number of ways [than] Allan Updegraff.\\" At this point in time Updegraff was living in Woodstock, New York. He also became the editor of the local magazine, The Ploughshare. In 1917, Updegraff agreed to be one of several native Iowans to contribute to a book to be printed to benefit the Iowa Red Cross. Entitled Prairie Gold, the book was a collection of stories, poems and sketches, with all profits going to help the Red Cross' war effort. In July 1918, it was announced that Updegraff's second novel, Strayed Revellers would be released that fall, and the novel was released by the end of that August. The New York Times called it, \\"a keen social satire, always an amusing comedy, and it ends a romance of parts.\\" The Oakland Tribune gave the book a very good review, stating it was \\"... one of the 'most different' books of the year, a rollicking reaction, and the find of the season.\\" The Chicago Daily Tribune also gave the novel a good review, calling it a delicious satire. They said the novel was \\"... shocking, but its awfully funny and at times kind of high and fine, and always nicely naughty.\\" In 1918, in celebration of the end of the First World War, Updegraff published a poem in The New York Times, entitled, \\"The Bells–The Bells of Victory!\\" In 1921 he went to work for the Literary Digest, where he spent the next five years on the editorial staff. While working for the Digest, Updegraff's first novel, Second Youth, was made into a film of the same name in 1924. Produced by the short-lived Distinctive Pictures, it was distributed by Goldwyn Pictures, and starred the famous husband–wife acting duo of Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne. In 1925 Updegraff published his third novel, Dancers in the Wind, about the romance between a weary business woman and a retired philosopher. In 1926 he moved to Paris to pursue his writing career. Years in Europe After his move to Paris, Updegraff published his fourth novel, Whatever We Do, in 1927; a chronicle of a week in the life of some American tourists along the French Riveria. The Oakland Tribune gave the book a good review, calling it an \\"... amusing, shocking and biting novel ....\\" They felt it was a \\"... book of contradictions, one of surprise and beauty as well as one of many drinks and loose adventures,\\" and they complimented Updegraff's writing style, stating that his methods \\"... through force of rare skill, lifts the reader from his chair.\\" By the end of November 1928, Updegraff was visiting the United States, and it was reported that he had already begun work on his fifth novel, which was scheduled for publication in 1929. However, the book, titled Native Soil, was not published until the beginning of 1930, and dealt with the return of a young man from living abroad in Europe to his home town of Springfield, Illinois. There, he feels that the pace of Paris is much less face-paced than the growing town of his youth. He returns to Europe, unable to cope with the changes. The News Enterprise Association, one of the leading news services of the era, gave the novel a sparkling review, calling the novel \\"... a tale of singular charm.\\" They went on to say, \\"Mr. Updegraff writes with fine insight and sympathy, and his book is no cheap shocker. It is well written and thoughtful....\\" It would be over a decade before his next book was published. Prior to its publication a curious instance occurred: the novels galleys had to be recalled and altered due to one of the artists who was working on the book having the same name as one of the characters in the book, as well as living in the same artist's colony which served as the novel's setting. His sixth book was titled The Hills Look Down, and was published in 1941, to positive reviews. Updegraff died in Paris on December 7, 1965, survived by his wife of over 40 years, Dora Loues Miller.

She is one of the founders of Dastkar, a Delhi-based non governmental organization, working for the revival of traditional crafts in India. She was honored by the Government of India in 2012 with the Indian civilian award of Padma Shri. She is the daughter of late Badruddin Tyabji, ICS, who was a senior Indian civil servant and diplomat.Brussels in winter Biography Laila Tyabji was born in Delhi on 2 May 1947 to an Indian civil servant as one of his four children. Her early schooling was in schools abroad and at the Welham Girls' School in Dehradun. She subsequently continued her studies in art at the Faculty of Fine Arts, MS University, Vadodara. Later, she went to Japan to study with Toshi Yoshida, the well-known Japanese printmaking artist, before returning to India to start a career as a freelance designer. Assignments included graphic and interior design, costumes and sets for the theatre, garments and textiles. The turning point in her career came when Tyabji was asked by the Gujarat State Handloom and Handicrafts Development Corporation to document, revive and design the traditional handicrafts of Kutch tradition. The assignment, originally fixed for 3 months got prolonged to six. Returning from Kutch, Tyabji worked as a merchandiser for Taj Khazana, a chain of luxury lifestyle stores run by Taj Group of Hotels, dealing in Indian arts and crafts. However, the difficulties of getting small rural artisans to benefit from and become a sustainable part of the mainstream retail chain gave Tyabji the idea of starting an organisation that would act as a bridge between craftspeople and urban buyers. A meeting with Bunny Page, a Parsi woman with the same concerns and ideas, and many discussions and meetings, resulted in Tyabji co-founding Dastkar with five other women in 1981 The object was to give traditional craftspeople the design, product development, market information, and entrepreneurship training that would help them regain their place in the mainstream market. The Dastkari Bazaars, where craftspeople came directly to sell their own products in the Metro market, were both a sales opportunity and a learning place for craftspeople who had never previously encountered their urban customers. It was a novel idea at that time – much imitated since. The inaugural Dastkari Bazaar was held in New Delhi, the same year at the Triveni Kala Sangam. Bazaars in Mumbai, Kolkota, Pune, Bangalore, Chennai, and other Indian cities followed, and became annual events. The first NATURE BAZAAR in 1995 was an attempt (inspired by Valmik Thapar, the well known tiger expert and wildlife conservationist) to get craftspeople to use Nature as a source of both creative inspiration and raw material . It has since become a regular event, with a permanent venue at Kisan Haat, Mehrauli, Delhi. Over the last 35 years, Dastkar and Tyabji have worked with numerous crafts organisations and NGOs to use craft skills as a means of earning and empowerment. She is credited with revolutionizing the craft industry in India by developing a market for Indian crafts, modernizing the artisans' skills, and acting as the liaising link between the artisans and the buyers. Dastkar operates on the policy of leaving the ownership of the goods to the artisans who produced them, retaining a 10 percent revenue towards the operating costs. It provides the artisans with entrepreneurial training and assists them with credit, designs, and product development techniques. The organization has a producer group base of over 700 artisan groups, collectively comprising over 1 lakh craftspeople. Under the aegis of Dastkar, Tyabji has worked with Self-Employed Women's Association of India (SEWA), a similar non-governmental organization founded by renowned Gandhian, Ela Bhatt, URMUL, Sandur Kushal Kala Kendra, Rangsutra, SASHA, Berozgar Mahila Kalyan Samiti, and many others. Other major DASTKAR projects are in Kashmir for the social reestablishment of the victims of terrorism, in Ranthambore, for the rehabilitation of the people who were evacuated for the National Park and in Bellary for the revival of the dying art of Lambani embroidery. She is associated with the artisans across the country such as Banjara Needle Crafts and Rabari mirror work craftswoman of Kutch and Maharashtra, Chikan craft workers of Lucknow, gond, Phad, mata in pacheri and madhubani painters, Kasuti embroidery artisans of Karnataka, handloom weavers in Bihar and Karnataka, and the leather, textile and terracotta artisans in Rajasthan. Laila Tyabji authored Threads and Voices – Behind the Indian Textile Tradition, published in 2007, and has written numerous articles in Indian journals. Unmarried by choice, she lives in Delhi, designing, writing, and speaking on behalf of crafts and craftspeople at her Andheria Modh office as Chairperson, Dastkar. Awards and recognitions In 2003, Tyabji was awarded the Aid to Artisans' Preservation of Craft Award, the first Asian and the second overall recipient of the award, the investiture ceremony taking place in New York. Eleven years later in 2012, the Government of India honored her with Padma Shri, the fourth–highest Indian civilian award. She is also a recipient of the NIFT Lifetime Achievement Award and the Chishti Harmony Award. The Limca Book of Records, an Indian repository of records and achievements, named Laila Tyabji as the Person of the Year, in 2014.

In their original Statement of Aims,1\\\\. Statement of aims, 1976 http://againstrape.net/statement-of-aims-1976 they demanded: recognition of rape of every kind; not just by strangers but by husbands, fathers and stepfathers. They demanded that every woman must have the financial independence to escape rape and domestic violence. They said victims are entitled to compensation, along with victims of other violent crimes, from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board (renamed Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority). They also said that all women should be entitled to justice, and not be ‘put on trial’. WAR provides support for anyone fighting for justice in their own case, and that casework shapes its campaigns. Campaigns =Rape in marriage= Starting in the mid-1970s WAR campaigned for rape in marriage to be made illegal. The first public event was a mock rape trial in Trafalgar Square in 1977, where women testified about violence they had suffered and who was responsible, including those in authority and employers. WAR initiated the slogan: “Yes means yes, No means, no. However we dress; wherever we go.” The campaign took 15 years, with the law successfully amended in 1991. =Legal precedent= In 1995, WAR, with Legal Action for Women and the English Collective of Prostitutes, assisted two women to bring the first private prosecution for rape in England and Wales after the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) refused to bring charges. Using the same evidence the CPS had indicated was insufficient, a conviction was achieved, with a 14-year sentence imposed (later reduced to 11 years on appeal). In 2015, Lesley Delmenico used the transcript of the trial as the basis of the play Pursuing Justice – Sex workers take their rapist to court. =Criminal justice system= WAR has consistently criticised the authorities’ treatment of rape victims. They publicise women's experiences of the police and court responses to rape, such as when they routinely accuse women of lying. They argue that police investigations have lost or neglected evidence, the CPS close too many cases, and prosecutors are less prepared and less robust than the defence. They call for those in authority who do not do their jobs properly to be held accountable: dismissed, and prosecuted where they break the law.6 Why do the police still deal with rape cases so badly? http://againstrape.net/?s=why+are+the+police&submit;=Search =Survivors seeking asylum= From 1991 to the present day, WAR has worked with Black Women's Rape Action Project7 BWRAP http://againstrape.net and Legal Action for Women8 LAW http://legalactionforwomen.net/ to provide services to, and campaign with, asylum seekers who had been raped, but are routinely disbelieved by the authorities in order to deny them safety and asylum in the UK. =Child rape= In 2013 they held a protest outside the Old Bailey to highlight media racism when a group of men from Oxford were on trial.9 Oxford cases press release http://againstrape.net/protest-against-rape-and-racism-on- the-day-of-sentencing-the-oxford-rapists-old-bailey-london-26-june-2013 In 2014 WAR submitted 37 questions to the Home Affairs Committee regarding the responsibilities of various authorities for child rape in Rotherham.10 Rotherham questions http://againstrape.net/child-rape-in-rotherham-questions- rape-survivors-parents-and-the-general-public-want-answers-to =False allegations= In 2014 WAR publicly criticised the increasing numbers of women being prosecuted for false allegations of rape and claimed some were innocent or should never have been jailed. They released the figure that 109 women had been prosecuted for lying in 7 years.11 109 prosecutions in Guardian https://www.theguardian.com/law/2014/dec/01/109-women-prosecuted-false-rape- allegations WAR took its 7-year campaign into Parliament12 Report on FA mtg in http://againstrape.net/jail-rapists-not-rape-victims-2-dec-house-of-commons and gave a platform to family campaigns who said they and their loved ones had been victims of a miscarriage of justice. =Domestic violence= WAR campaigns for the police to stop separating investigations of rape and domestic violence when they are committed by the same man, and part of a pattern. They say that juries are less likely to convict if they are deprived of information. =Separation of children from mothers= WAR is part of the Support not Separation coalition,13 SNS blog https://supportnotseparation.blog/ founded in 2017 to prevent the unwarranted separation of children from their mothers, particularly following domestic violence. They say witnessing violence is not as harmful as separation from their main carer. =Criminal injuries compensation= In 2018 WAR's national campaign for compensation,14 CICA campaign webpage http://againstrape.net/category/campaigns/compensation working with applicants throughout England and Wales, helped win major concessions from the courts and government to review eligibility rules which disproportionately deny compensation to victims of sexual violence. =Opposing austerity cuts= WAR actively supported legal challenges including of the benefit cap, that PIP should take into account mental illness caused by rape trauma and oppose the 2 child limit on tax credits, and protested cuts to legal aid and women's support services. All of these have cut women's and children's escape routes out of violence.15 Austerity campaign webpage http://againstrape.net/category/campaigns/poverty-violence WAR campaigns for financial independence for women as well as resources so women and children can escape rape and DV. =Opposing sexual harassment= The Bakers, Food and Allied Workers' Union (BFAWU) approached WAR to assist in the union's campaign against sexual harassment and violence in the fast food and hospitality industries. The union aims to ensure that workers can report abuse, win justice and stop further violence. Controversies In May 2015 Lisa Longstaff of Women Against Rape appeared on an episode of the BBC Victoria Derbyshire show.

He was Vincent L. Gregory Professor of Cancer Prevention and Professor of Epidemiology, and a past chair of the Department of Epidemiology, in the Harvard School of Public Health in Boston. Dimitrios Trichopoulos conducted research and taught for more than four decades in the field of cancer epidemiology and prevention. He published more than 1,000 scientific papers, continually charting scientific frontiers, from seminal research linking secondhand smoke (SHS) from cigarettes with increased susceptibility to risk for lung cancer, and hepatitis B virus and tobacco smoking with increased risk of primary liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma), to findings documenting that surgically induced and early natural menopause reduced breast cancer risk. Beyond oncology, his paper linking psychological stress after an earthquake in Athens to increased risk of cardiac death was included in a 1997 list in The Lancet of 27 papers deserving to form a core canon of medical literature that every health professional should read. His oncology epidemiology and prevention research career included significant \\"firsts\\": He was first, with a 1990 paper in The Lancet, to propose that in utero exposures play a major role in breast cancer causation. He also was first in 1981, along with an independent paper published a few days later, to report that secondhand smoke increases the risk of lung cancer. Dimitrios Trichopoulos studied 51 nonsmoking women in Greece who had been hospitalized with lung cancer, then he compared them with age- matched women who had been hospitalized (also in Greece) for other problems. Though seemingly self-evident, researchers were able to determine statistically that these cancer patients were significantly more likely to have been exposed to their husband's cigarettes. Follow-up studies then began to confirm the risks of smoke inhalation by children in smoking households or in nonsmokers who live nearby smoking, in adjacent apartment units. A native of Greece, Dimitrios studied at the University of Athens Medical School, where he earned an M.D. in 1963 and a Ph.D. in 1971. In 1968, he earned a S.M. in Boston at the Harvard School of Public Health and held several teaching appointments there over the next two decades (lecturer, 1969–1970; visiting professor, 1981–1985; adjunct, 1988–1989). Harvard appointed him a full professor in the Department of Epidemiology in 1989, which department he began to chair that same year succeeding Brian MacMahon, and serving in that role until 1996. Initiatives under his leadership included a series of collaborations with investigators now at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden. In 1993, he was named Vincent L. Gregory Professor of Cancer Prevention, and also began a four-year appointment as director of the Harvard Center for Cancer Prevention.Cromie WJ, You Can Help Prevent Your Own Cancer, Researchers Say, Harvard Gazette, November 21, 1996, cites then (November 1996) most recent issue of Cancer Causes and Control, noting the then-limits of the Mediterranean Diet as substituting plant oils for animal- derived oils rather than omitting oils altogether, also noting the authors' skepticism that human behavior is fully correctable through education, accessed online 12/3/2014 Dimitrios Trichopoulos also was a Member of the Athens Academy and president of the Hellenic Health Foundation in Greece. He held teaching appointments at the University of Athens Medical School and the Karolinska Institute in Sweden. His numerous awards and distinctions include honorary doctorates, the Brinker International Award for Breast Cancer Clinical Research, Harvard School of Public Health's Julius Richmond Award (2004) and Alumni Award of Merit (2009), and the Medal of Honor of the International Agency for Research on Cancer, World Health Organization.

He studied Medicine at the University of Athens Medical School. He further studied Pathology, Microbiology, Public Health, and Epidemiology at universities of Athens, London, Oxford, and Harvard. Dr. Trichopoulos had also studied the multi-factorial etiology of hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer), with emphasis on the interactive effects of hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses, tobacco smoking, and ethanol intake. He was chief professor of Epidemiology at Harvard University from 1989-1996, professor of the prevention of cancer and Head of the Center of Cancer Prevention at Harvard University from 1993 to 1997, professor and Head department at the Department of Hygiene and Epidemiology of the University of Athens Medical School from 1972 through 2014, professor of Medical Epidemiology at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm from 1998 through 2014, and member of the Athens Academy from 1997 through 2014.

Believed to be native to eastern Asia, it has been carried with the trade in cultivated maples and is now widely found in Europe, North America and Australia. Description Female 5.5 mm long (even 6.5 mm), male 4.25 mm. Head comes to an acute point, head and prothorax greenish yellow. Forewings translucent with reddish veins (paler in male). In the resting position three narrow beaded bands of purplish brown run more or less straight across the wings, incorporating some portions of the veins. Scutellum yellow with dark markings resembling the \\"frowny\\" emoticon ☹. The eggs are inserted into the nodes of young branches, making them very difficult to detect in dormant planting stock. There is normally one generation per year (two in Italy), with the eggs over wintering. The nymphs are sharply pointed at both head and tail and are frequently yellowish. Origin and spread Specimen from Portage, Michigan, United States The species was first described (as Platymetopius hyalinus) by Herbert Osborn in 1900, from specimens taken in Washington, D.C. Since it was unlikely that a native species would have remained undetected so long, he suggested it was an introduced species brought in with exotic plants. This was confirmed in 1931 when P. W. Oman identified Platymetopius hyalinus with P. cinctus, described by Shōnen Matsumura in 1914 and found in Hokkaido, Honshu and Kyushu. In 1931 Elmer Darwin Ball designated P. hyalinus as the type (and, at the time, only) species of a newly differentiated genus Japananus. Since then a further five species have been placed in this genus. Apart from hyalinus they are all native to mainland Asia and show no tendency to major range expansions. In North America J. hyalinus has been recorded from North Carolina in the south to Ontario in the north. The first European records, from Austria and Romania, were published in 1961, followed by reports from Germany, the former Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia (1987), Bulgaria and Hungary (1989), France, Spain and northern Italy (1994), Slovenia (2002), Serbia and southern Russia (2003), Luxembourg (2010) and Poland (2012). It was discovered in Australia in 1997. The status of J. hyalinus in the United Kingdom is currently uncertain. In 1999 two insects were found during inspections of imported Acer palmatum stock that originated from South Korea. In August 2014 the insect seen in the taxobox above was photographed in Cambridge, where the complete breeding cycle has been observed. Host plants Nymph In its Asian home range the host plants are Acer japonicum and A. palmatum. In other places it readily adapts to other maple species, which no doubt assists its spread. In Europe the main food plant is field maple (Acer campestre), and it has been recorded from box elder, Norway maple, sycamore, silver maple, Montpellier maple, Acer buergerianum, A. truncatum and red maple. Economic impact Leafhoppers are regarded with some suspicion by plant growers, both because of the additional load they place on plant metabolism and their ability to act as vectors for virus diseases and phytoplasma diseases such as flavescence dorée (FD). As of 2014 J. hyalinus is not known to be a disease vector and its potential to cause significant damage is assessed as very small.

Hornswoggle was revealed to be the Anonymous Raw General Manager after the character returned for one night on July 9, 2012. In November 2014, the Anonymous General Manager made a brief return to television, but was, for a second time, removed from power.  First run  Michael Cole reads an email from the Anonymous General Manager. Mr. McMahon first unveiled the Anonymous Raw General Manager on the June 21, 2010 episode of Raw, after firing the previous general manager, Bret Hart. While Michael Cole often acted as the spokesperson, the Anonymous Raw General Manager once used a computerized voice when it was interviewed by Edge on The Cutting Edge. The interview ended with Edge destroying the General Manager's laptop. Occasionally the Anonymous General Manager left hints at its true identity, such as dropping catchphrases from popular superstars, however these were red herrings. The Anonymous General Manager controlled Raw until July 2011, when it was phased out in favor of COO Triple H and Vice President of Talent Relations John Laurinaitis without its identity ever being revealed. As buildup towards Raw 1000, previous Raw general managers returned for one night only to control the show. The Anonymous Raw General Manager returned on July 9, 2012. There, it was revealed that Hornswoggle had been the Anonymous General Manager throughout its first run. According to former WWE writer Kevin Eck, WWE had no plans regarding an identity for the Anonymous Raw General Manager before it was initially fizzled out. Hornswoggle was suggested by a writer during a creative team meeting as a joke which played off the poor reception to an earlier storyline where Hornswoggle had been revealed to be Mr. McMahon's illegitimate child. Hornswoggle has stated that the original plan for his general manager character was \\"[a] mob-boss style character with this Napoleon complex, throwing his power around\\", but these plans never came to fruition.  2014 return  At Survivor Series, The Authority, who had previously held power in WWE, were deposed. The following night, Raw closed with the Anonymous General Manager's familiar e-mail noise, followed by Michael Cole's reading of an e-mail in which the Anonymous General Manager promised to bring \\"order\\" back to WWE. The identity of this general manager remains unknown, an article on WWE.com questioned its gender and the possibility of it being Hornswoggle again.

History The Catholic Guardian Society of the Archdiocese of New York was established in July 1914 to assist teens transitioning from orphanages and institutions to life on their own, when neither the law nor society provided any protections. The 1922 Catholic Encyclopedia described the organization as follows: It was reported that in 1921, \\"over 12,000 visits were made by the Society's agents, nearly 4,000 children visited the Society's offices, and over 2,000 boys and girls attended the Society's annual reunion\\". At that time, the President of the Society was Archbishop Patrick Joseph Hayes. In 1985, former social worker Bill Guarinello was named CEO of the Catholic Guardian Society, and was additionally named President of the organization in 1993, around the time that it became HeartShare Human Services of New York. The organization has partnered with numerous celebrities, including Lauren Hutton,Jan Onofrio, South Carolina Biographical Dictionary (2000), p. 373.

Built in 1773–74, it is one of the oldest surviving rural churches in North America. Location The church is located on a promontory of the Île Perrot, on a bluff overlooking the Saint Lawrence River, known as the Cataraqui River by the original inhabitants. It lies in the municipality of Notre-Dame-de-l'Île- Perrot, and faces the town of Beauharnois to the south. The bell tower serves as a navigation aid. It is one of the ten oldest rural religious foundations in North America. The church is dedicated to Saint Jane Frances de Chantal to honor the devotion of the Seigneuresse Jeanne-Françoise Cullerier for that saint. History The Île Perrot was granted to François-Marie Perrot by Jean Talon in 1672. From then until 1721 it was part of the Pointe-Claire parish, but residents often traveled to the nearer parish of Sainte-Anne du Bout (now Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue) for religious services. Either way, they had to go by canoe. A small chapel was built on the island in 1743. This soon proved too small for the growing population, and in 1753 the seigneur Jean-Baptiste Leduc granted the site on which the present church was built. Construction did not start until 1773, and was completed in August 1774. Work continued until 1783. The original church was rectangular, with roughly the same dimensions as the present nave, ending in a semi-circular apse. The exterior walls were built of red ocher sandstone masonry. In 1838 they were covered in cement, which was repaired several times afterwards. At first the parish was served by a visiting priest, then in 1789 a resident priest came to live permanently on the island. The \\"syndics\\", or representatives of the parishioners, gradually acquired furniture, paintings and sacred vessels. The building was enlarged in 1812. The tower was installed in 1842, with the first bell, and in 1848 the church was enlarged on the side of the sacristy. The sacristy was burned down in 1852 and rebuilt in 1853. The bell tower was struck by lightning in 1863, and was not repaired for two years. In 1864 the cedar shingles that covered the church and sacristy roof were replaced with sheet metal. In 1896 the tower collapsed in a gale and had to be rebuilt. In its fall the tower had damaged the front of the church. In 1901 the nave was extended by and a new facade was built, with a new bell tower high. The architect Alcide Chaussé (1868–1944) designed the eclectic new facade. New bells were installed in 1925. The church was declared a historic monument in 1961 by the Ministry of Cultural Affairs. In 2008 it was designated one of the \\"Seven Wonders of Vaudreuil-Soulanges\\". Description The original church building was , and was high to the roof ridge. It had eight glass windows with shutters and a door. The ceiling was vaulted, made of bleached planks, and covered with cedar shingles. In 1812 the nave was extended about and the semi-circular apse was replaced by a flat walled choir. A sacristy was built as an extension of the choir at this time. With the addition of two side chapels the building took the shape of a Roman cross. The front of the church originally had just one door, but the 1901 restoration added two smaller doors and four windows. The interior decoration is in the Louis XV and Louis XVI styles, typical of traditional Quebec architecture. The high altar tableau, representing the patron saint Jeanne de Chantal, was acquired in 1790. It has been attributed to the painter Louis Dulongpré (1759–1843). Joseph Turcaut, who had studied under the sculptor Joseph Pépin (1770–1842) in the Écores workshop, made the paneling and false ceiling between 1812 and 1819, and probably also made the altars. In 1828 Louis-Xavier Leprohon (1795–1876), also from the Écores workshop, made the altarpieces, the entablature of the nave and the ornamentation of the false ceiling. The work of Turcaut and Le Prohon has been preserved intact. The medallions of Ecce Homo and La Vierge de douleur by unknown artists were installed in 1828 at the same time as the altarpiece. \\"The Miracle St. Anthony\\" and the \\"Baptism of Christ\\" in the transept are also by unknown artists. The transept also has a painting of \\"Christ in pain\\", painted in 1881 by Joseph Dynes (1825–97) of Quebec. The altarpiece of the west arm of the transept has a statue of Our Lady of the Guard donated in 1849 by the Sulpicians of Montreal. It is one of the first statues made by the Grey Nuns of Montreal in Papier-mâché, a technique they often used. The rectory was built in 1780 by Basile Proulx. It is a large stone house in typical style for the period. The exterior is unchanged apart from an addition in 1992. The interior was restored in the 1850s after a fire had caused severe damage. The priest lived in part of the building, which also contained a large meeting room, the salle des habitants. The room was used as a school for a short time. Around 1860 it became the first library on the island. The old cemetery behind the church dates to 1793, and was surrounded by a high stone wall. It was enlarged and the wall rebuilt in 1942. A new terraced cemetery accessed by a large central stairway was built between 1951 and 1959, sloping down toward the Saint Lawrence. The terraced cemetery is the only one of this type in Quebec. The Chapel of Remembrance was built in 1953, a reconstruction of the original small chapel. The commemorative chapel used stones from the original chapel at Pointe-du-Moulin.

Following the release of Illogical Life and the subsequent Acoustic Sessions EP, RJ spent the following 3 years touring Germany with Midge Ure and the UK with The Proclaimers, Sandi Thom and Gabriella Cilmi among others. =A Better Life, When I Get Old, and The Cognitive Rules EP (2011)= RJ released two singles in 2011 (A Better Life and When I Get Old), and both tracks were released on the EP The Cognitive Rules later that same year.

During his political career he belonged to the CDU. He was described by Der Spiegel in 1947 as a \\"refreshingly open-minded man with a narrow distinctive face, in his late 40s\\".\\"...ein frischer, aufgeschlossener Mann mit schmalem, markantem Gesicht, Ende der vierzig.\\" Life In 1898 Luitpold Steidle was born into a Catholic family in Ulm, in the Kingdom of Württemberg, which less than thirty years earlier had been incorporated into the German Empire. His father was a senior military judge. He attended secondary school in Munich before joining the army in 1915. By the end of the war he had reached the rank of lieutenant. He immediately resumed his education, from 1918 attending what was then known as the Technical High School (College) in Munich, where he studied Agricultural sciences. However, he then switched to a more hands-on training. He learned farming at Hohenpolding and at Grasselfing (Olching), both located a short distance to the west of Munich. In 1922 he set himself up as an independent farmer in Loibersdorf (Aying), between Munich and Rosenheim. In 1926 he took a job as a merchandise inspector, and in 1928 as a stud-inspector near Kassel, in Beberbeck, one of the country's leading stud centres. However, with the steady increase in mechanised agriculture and the general economic decline the stud business was itself under pressure and the principal stud at Beberbeck business went into liquidation in 1929, even though business activity did not come to an immediate halt. On 1 May 1933 Steidle joined the Nazi Party which had seized power in January 1933 and spent the intervening months consolidating its own power and banning other political parties in Germany. He lost his job in 1933 and a period of unemployment followed. He worked briefly as an insurance agent during 1934 before rejoining the army at the end of the year, recovering immediately the officer's rank that he had held when decommissioned in 1918. He was promoted to the rank of colonel in 1942 and sent to fight on the Russian front as a regimental commander. In 1943 he was caught up in the Battle of Stalingrad. He survived, but was taken prisoner of war by the Soviets. While in captivity he was a founder member of the German Officers' League (BDO / Bund Deutscher Offiziere), an organisation created under the presidency of Walther von Seydlitz to promote an accommodation between the Soviet Union and Germany in order to avoid the destruction of the latter after further bloodshed. Understandably, the BDO enjoyed the support of their Soviet captors. One precondition for the BDO's objective to have become a realistic proposition would have been the successful removal from power of Adolf Hitler. This did not happen for another two years. In the meanwhile, as the BDO's Vice-president (and one of its most persuasive speakers) Luitpold Steidle was sentenced to death in absentia by the German state, as he describes in the volume of his memoirs that covers this period. Till the end of the war, during his time in Soviet detention, Steidle served as representative of the National Committee for a Free Germany. When he returned to what had been Germany, it was to the part that had become the Soviet Occupation Zone (SBZ / Sowjetische Besatzungszone), and was beginning the transformation into the stand-alone state, East Germany. After the war, between 1945 and 1948, Steidle was vice-president of the German Agriculture and Forestry Division in the SBZ. In 1946, as a Roman Catholic, he joined the Christian Democratic Union (CDU / Christlich-Demokratische Union Deutschlands) in East Germany, although it was already becoming apparent that for the foreseeable future the CDU, like the country in which it operated, was destined to operate separately from its West German namesake. Between 1948 and 1949 he took over as deputy chairman of the German Economic Commission in the SBZ/East Germany. In October 1949 Steidle was elected/nominatedFollowing the establishment of an electoral structure for the October 1950 \\"election\\", a voter simply took the ballot paper, which contained only one name, and dropped it into the ballot box. A voter could vote against the candidate by crossing out his or her name, but had to do so in a separate voting booth without any secrecy. Between 1950 and 1986 recorded Participation always exceeded 98% and \\"yes\\" votes always exceeded 99% of votes cast. to the Provisional People's Chamber (Volkskammer). He remained a member of the (after 1950 no longer \\"provisional\\") (Volkskammer) till 1971. He held office from 1949 till 1950 as Minister for Work and Health, and from 1950 till 1958 as Minister for Health. He also provided advice on the creation of the National People's Army (NVA / Nationale Volksarmee), established in 1956 (following a period during which the wartime allies, including the Soviet Union, had agreed that permitting Germany an army was inappropriate). From 1960 till his retirement in 1969 Luitpold Steidle was mayor of Weimar, where afterwards he continued to live. Awards Luitpold Steidle received the usual awards conferred on politicians by states with that use Honours Systems. He was also, in 1956, made an Honorary Senator of Greifswald University and, in 1972, an Honorary Member of the Presidential Council of the Kulturbund (Culture League).

Altitudinal migration is a short-distance animal migration from lower altitudes to higher altitudes and back. It is commonly thought to happen in response to climate and food availability changes as well as increasingly due to anthropogenic influence. These migrations can occur both during reproductive and non- reproductive seasons. Altitudinal avian migration is common, and can also be found in other vertebrates, and can be seen in some invertebrates. Typical characteristics of tropical altitudinal migrants include: a high rate of frugivory or nectarvory; movement between lower elevation areas during non- breeding seasons and higher elevation areas during breeding seasons, or on a consistent annual or seasonal cycle; at least part of the population being migratory with a possible portion of the population residing at breeding sites year-round. This last characteristic can be sex-biased, as it is with juncos, in which the males are less likely to migrate than the females. The white- ruffed manakin provides a good example of an altitudinal migrant by displaying all of these traits. It has a high rate of frugivory, migrates from lower elevations to higher elevations on a predictable breeding-season based cycle, and part of the population is migratory, with a small portion possibly remaining at the breeding sites year-round. Regions There are many documented examples of migratory range shifts along an elevation gradient among temperate species. While these migrations are more understood in temperate regions, and far less understood among tropical ecosystems and species, there are documented cases. Altitudinal migration is typically seen among taxa found in montane areas. Generally, as elevation increases, the species richness decreases. =Tropics= The white-ruffed manakin (Corapipo altera) is a well known altitudinal migrant. Third year male (left) and After Third Year male (right). In the tropics, altitudinal migrations are most commonly seen among frugivores or nectarvores, such as what is seen among tropical hummingbirds, which migrate altitudinally in response to shifts in food abundance and availability. This migration pattern has been observed in neotropical birds, but has also been seen in other terrestrial, tropical montane species such as Baird's tapir and white-lipped peccary. Tropical avian species that are altitudinal migrants include the white-ruffed manakin, resplendent quetzal, at least 16 species of raptor, and many species of hummingbird. Altitudinal migration has also been witnessed in some tropical bat species. As of 2014, there is not much information as to why tropical species migrate altitudinally, other than that it may be for food resources or reproduction, as it is for temperate bat species. =Temperates= While less common in avian species in the temperate regions, altitudinal migration still plays a part in migration patterns in montane zones and is seen in most ungulates in the Rocky Mountains. Avian temperate species that migrate altitudinally include mountain chickadee, and the American dipper. Ungulates that have been observed to migrate altitudinally include roe deer, bighorn sheep, and mountain goats. Temperate bat species are also altitudinal migrants. Their migratory patterns are sex-biased altitudinal migrations, with females inhabiting lower elevations during reproductive periods.  Causes  Altitudinal migration, as a short-distance migration pattern, has been easier to trace than long-distance patterns. Still, while the proximate causes and physiological adaptations for migrations are well understood, determining the ultimate causes have been difficult. This difficulty has been linked to limited success of mark and recapture techniques used to track migratory species. There are many hypotheses for why altitudinal migration may occur, including correlations between food abundance and nutrition-the need to migrate in order to meet specific needs associated with varying abundance and nutrition; reproduction-breeding sites being at elevations different than those of non-breeding sites; anthropogenic-species being increasingly driven to higher altitudes due to human actions. = Food abundance and nutrition = Migration in response to food abundance has been the most accepted hypothesis for why species migrate altitudinally. This hypothesis states that peaks in food abundance along an elevational gradient, such as the slope of a mountain, drive migration patterns as species exploit available food resources. Peaks in food abundance along this gradient often coincide with the breeding season. Some frugivorous birds, such as white-ruffed manakins (Corapipo altera) migrate to higher elevations to exploit peaks in fruit abundance. Evidence supports the possibility that migrants have a competitive advantage compared to non-migrant (sedentary) species, due to increased foraging ability over a larger area, resulting in greater food and nutrient uptake. It's been shown that diet differs between non-migratory and migratory species in large-scale analyses and species-pair comparisons of frugivorous tropical birds. While this hypothesis is supported, and has been the most accepted, it fails to explain why altitudinal migrants return to lower elevations, or if it is done in response to shifting food resources. It has been proposed that weather- related resource availability may trigger the elevational migration of some species, such as the white-ruffed manakin during storms. = Reproduction = A number of species engage in movement that could be defined as altitudinal migration as part of their mating or reproductive behaviors. For example, in male white-ruffed manakins, migratory behavior has shown to lessen social status and mating success at leks the following breeding season. Most hummingbird species at Monteverde increase altitude during the wet season in order to breed. Of the 16 species of neotropical raptors (including the Andean condor Vultur gryphus), that are known to be altitudinal migrants, most breed in the high Andes and migrate to lowland areas during non-breeding seasons. = Nest predation = Studies have shown a decreased risk of nest predation at higher altitudes, which may explain the seasonal (breeding season—non- breeding season) altitudinal migration of some passerine birds. An experiment using 385 nests at varying locations on the Atlantic slope of Costa Rica showed decreased predation at increasing altitudes, with predation highest at intermediate altitudes. This hypothesis proposes that altitudinal migration may have evolved among some species as a response to nest predation, as a way lower the risk. Studies have also shown that elevation of home range influences breeding time. =Anthropogenic= The walia ibex (Capra walie) has increasingly been driven to higher altitudes in Ethiopian mountain ranges. This has occurred because of human activity impacting their native range, including war, expanding human settlement, and cultivation. Conservation implications = Climate change = Climate change could be causing migration patterns to shift into an earlier time frame, coinciding with an earlier start of the growing period. This means that migratory species may leave lower altitudes for higher-altitude breeding sites while those breeding sites still lack the necessary resources. Some species that have shorter migratory paths may be able to return to the lower elevations and wait, but run the risk of running out of the resources in that lower altitude, such as food and cover, that may only be available for a short, set period of time. Over 30% of birds and other species in montane forests show altitudinal migration patterns. Because of this, changes in climate and seasonality (decrease or increase) would affect a large portion of tropical species and have the potential to cause a trophic cascade on the community-level. Furthermore, climate change may cause seasonal storms and rainfall patterns to change, shifting the timing and/or need for altitudinal migration in the future by shifting availability of resources, which is believed to be a driving cause of altitudinal migration. The upward shift of species caused by climate change also holds the potential to cause both mountaintop extinction and lowland biotic attrition. This is because the lowland tropics lack species that can cope with increasing temperatures. An overall loss of species richness can occur due to there being fewer migratory species to replace lost ones. This has been seen occurring by looking at the average time of arrival and departure at high altitude areas for the American robin (Turdus migratorius). The average time interval has shifted by as much as two weeks due to the change in seasonal patterns of resource abundance and temperature. = Migrational corridors = Migrational corridors, connecting lowland and montane habitats are essential for the upkeep and survival of migratory species. Some species can cross cleared lands, suchs as pastures, but many require closed forest areas, such as what is provided by these migrational corridors. = Seed dispersal = Tropical frugivorous birds have complex elevational migrations and are responsible for the dispersal of many species of seeds across the different Holdridge life zones and transitional regions, causing wide dispersal of plant species and significant ecological linkage. A change in migration patterns can cause a decrease in the efficiency, and ability of these species as seed dispersal agents.

He served as Adviser to non party Caretaker government of Bangladesh (2001), led by President Shahabuddin Ahmed, he also served as the 15th Inspector General of Police of Bangladesh Police. (8 July 1992 – 22 April 1996), and as the Secretary to the Ministry of Youth and Sports (1996-1999). Shahjahan was renowned for his honesty and his dedication to his country, and is regarded as a symbol of honesty in policing in Bangladesh. Upon his retirement from government service, Shahjahan served as the vice chancellor of Asia Pacific University and as a senior advisor to the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and to Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) on Police reform. He also served as a vocal leader of Sujan Bangladesh and as a Former President of Bangladesh Poribesh Andolon (BAPA) advocating for better governance and environmental protections.  Career  After graduating from Dhaka University with BCom(hons) and MCom in 1962, Shahjahan began his career as a faculty member at Chaumohani College, Rajshahi Government College and subsequently University of Rajshahi in 1963 where he served in the Department of Commerce till December 1965. He was a charismatic young lecturer with a strong character and work ethic and was loved and admired by students and faculty alike. Shahjahan took the civil service exam and joined the elite Civil Service cadre. A senior Bangladeshi Police Service of Pakistan (PSP) officer on the candidate selection board noticed Shahjahan's potential and convinced him to add Police Service of Pakistan (PSP) to his placement preference list. He joined the police service in 1966, only 6 officers were selected that year, 3 were from Bangladesh (then East Pakistan) and 3 from Pakistan (then West Pakistan). Shahjahan played key roles in Bangladesh's war of independence in 1971. ASM Shahjahan was in-charge of security for the meeting where Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman delivered his 7 March speech that sparked the revolution. Shahjahan made arrangements to ensure the relaying of the speech through police wireless. He was Additional Superintendent of Police, Dhaka, and based out of Rajarbagh Police Line, the epicenter of the first attack on the nation the night of 25 March 1979. A.S.M. Shahjahan was the founding Deputy Commissioner of Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) in 1976, and in 1991 he returned to DMP as the Commissioner. He served Bangladesh Police at sub-divisional, district, divisional and national levels through various positions in different departments, such as, Criminal Investigation Department, Special Branch, Armed Police Battalion etc. On July 8, 1992, ASM Shahjahan became the 15th Inspector General of Police (IGP). Over the next four years, he worked diligently to gradually shift the focus of the national police force towards service to the people. He believed that the colonial laws, policing principles and practices designed to control a population is ideologically and practically divergent from community focused, service oriented policing and is a cornerstone of any democracy. As a visionary and progressive leader without political party affiliation, with a reputation for honesty and delivering results he was widely respected by leaders of all major political parties. = Highlights from ASM Shahjahan’s tenure as IGP = * To promote transparency and accountability to the public, he introduced “Open House Day” in every police station, a monthly event for people to come to their police station and openly critique the activities of their local police. * He was the first IGP to deploy female police officers outside the metropolitan areas, at the district level. * He led the expansion of Detective Branch, as specialized modern investigative unit, beyond the metropolitan areas and into the district level. * To preserve the history and achievement of law enforcement agencies in Bangladesh ASM Shahjahan established a Police Museum. He also compiled the history of Bangladesh Police's contribution to the liberation war for the museum. * A visionary thought leader with a global view, Shahjahan proposed the creation of SAARCPOL in the line of INTERPOL for SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) countries. * Bangladesh Police earned the flag for IGP's car for the 1st time, during his tenure. * He was a member of Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD), a committee of eminent citizens of the country, who provide expert guidance on national issues. = Secretary, Government of Bangladesh = After leaving the police department, Shahjahan became Secretary, Ministry of Youth and Sports, Govt. of Bangladesh where he served until 1999. As secretary he represented Bangladesh as chief of the mission at 1996 Summer Olympic Games held in Atlanta, also during his tenure, Bangladesh qualified to play in the ICC World Cup for the 1st time. He retired from the Government of Bangladesh in 1999, and became the Vice-Chancellor of University of Asia Pacific = Adviser, Non-Party Caretaker Government of Bangladesh = Following the provision for caretaker government through 13th Amendment of the Constitution, the second caretaker government was formed on 15 July 2001 with former Chief Justice, Justice Latifur Rahman, as the Chief Adviser. A.S.M.

The severity of the shortages has led to the largest refugee crisis ever recorded in the Americas. * * The Maduro administration has denied the extent of the crisis; and has refused to accept humanitarian aid from Amnesty International, the United Nations, and other groups as conditions have worsened. * The United Nations and the Organization of American States have stated that the shortages have resulted in unnecessary deaths in Venezuela and urged the government to accept humanitarian aid. Though The New York Times asserts that the Maduro administration and its economic irresponsibility has directly caused a lack of food, Maduro has stated that the country is fine in terms of access to food. There are shortages of milk, meat, coffee, rice, oil, precooked flour, butter, toilet paper, personal hygiene products and medicines. * By January 2017, the shortage of medicines reached 85%, according to the Pharmaceutical Federation of Venezuela (Federación Farmacéutica de Venezuela). Hours-long lines have become common, and those who wait in them are sometimes disappointed. Some Venezuelans have resorted to eating wild fruit and garbage. On 9 February 2018 a group of United Nations Special Procedures and the Special Rapporteurs on food, health, adequate housing and extreme poverty issued a joint statement on Venezuela, declaring that much of its population is starving and going without in a situation that they do not believe will end. History = Chávez administration = El Tiempo explaining the shortages. Since the 1990s, food production in Venezuela has dropped continuously, with Hugo Chávez's Bolivarian government beginning to rely upon imported food using the country's then-large oil profits. In 2003, the government created CADIVI (now CENCOEX), a currency control board charged with handling foreign exchange procedures to control capital flight by placing currency limits on individuals.CADIVI, CADIVI, una medidia necesaria Such currency controls have been determined to be the cause of shortages according to many economists and other experts. However, the Venezuelan government blamed other entities such as the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and smugglers for shortages, and has stated that an \\"economic war\\" had been declared on Venezuela. * During the presidency of Chávez, Venezuela faced occasional shortages owing to high inflation and government financial inefficiencies. In 2005, Chávez announced the initiation of Venezuela's own \\"great leap forward\\", following the example of Mao Zedong's Great Leap Forward. An increase in shortages began to occur that year as 5% of items became unavailable according to the Central Bank of Venezuela. In January 2008, 24.7% of goods were reported to be unavailable in Venezuela, with the scarcity of goods remaining high until May 2008, when there was a shortage of 16.3% of goods. However, shortages increased again in January 2012 to nearly the same rate as in 2008. = Maduro administration = Following Chávez's death and the election of his successor Nicolás Maduro in 2013, shortage rates continued to increase and reached a record high of 28% in February 2014. Venezuela stopped reporting its shortage data after the rate stood at 28%. In January 2015, the hashtag #AnaquelesVaciosEnVenezuela (or #EmptyShelvesInVenezuela) was the number one trending topic on Twitter in Venezuela for two days, with Venezuelans posting pictures of empty store shelves around the country. An empty Venezuelan store following the Dakazo in November 2013 In August 2015, American private intelligence agency company Stratfor used two satellite images of Puerto Cabello, Venezuela's main port used for importing goods, to show how severe shortages had become in Venezuela. One image from February 2012 showed the ports full of shipping containers when the Venezuelan government's spending was near a historic high before the 2012 Venezuela presidential election. A second image from June 2015 shows the port with many fewer containers, since the Venezuelan government could no longer afford to import goods, as oil revenues dropped. At the end of 2015, it was estimated there was a shortage of over 75% of goods in Venezuela. By May 2016, experts feared that Venezuela was possibly entering a period of famine, with President Maduro encouraging Venezuelans to cultivate their own food. In January 2016, it was estimated, that the food scarcity rate (') was between 50% and 80%. The newly elected National Assembly, composed primarily of opposition delegates, declared a national food crisis a month later in February 2016. Many Venezuelans then began to suffer from shortages of common utilities, such as electricity and water, because of the prolonged period of mishandling and corruption under the Maduro government. By July 2016, Venezuelans desperate for food moved to the Colombian border. Over 500 women stormed past Venezuelan National Guard troops into Colombia looking for food on 6 July 2016. By 10 July 2016, Venezuela temporarily opened its borders, which had been closed since August 2015, for 12 hours. Over 35,000 Venezuelans traveled to Colombia for food within that period. Between 16–17 July, over 123,000 Venezuelans crossed into Colombia seeking food. The Colombian government set up what it called a \\"humanitarian corridor\\" to welcome Venezuelans. Around the same time in July 2016, reports of desperate Venezuelans rummaging through garbage for food appeared. Video of Venezuelans eating from garbage in August 2015. By early 2017, priests began telling Venezuelans to label their garbage so needy individuals could feed on their refuse. In March 2017, despite having the largest oil reserves in the world, some regions of Venezuela began having shortages of gasoline with reports that fuel imports had begun. The government continued to deny there was a humanitarian crisis, instead saying there was simply less availability of food. Yván Gil, vice minister of relations to the European Union, said that an economic war had affected \\"the availability of food, but [Venezuela is] still within the thresholds set by the UN\\". Following targeted sanctions by the United States government in late-2017 due to the controversial 2017 Constituent National Assembly, the Maduro government began to blame the United States for shortages. It enacted , encouraging Venezuelans to breed rabbits, slaughter them and eat their meat. By early 2018, gasoline shortages began to spread, with hundreds of drivers in some regions waiting in lines to fill their tanks, sleeping overnight in their vehicles during the process. * * In a September 2018 Meganálisis survey, nearly one-third of Venezuelans stated they consumed only one meal per day while 78.6 percent of respondents said they had issues with food security. The Wall Street Journal reported in March 2019 that parts of barrio La Vega had been without water for almost a year; residents of the town of 120,000 said that water trucks come by infrequently, sometimes only to supply government supporters. Following increased international sanctions throughout 2019, the Maduro government abandoned socialist policies established by Chávez, such as price and currency controls, which resulted in the country seeing a rebound from economic decline. In a November 2019 interview with José Vicente Rangel, President Nicolás Maduro described dollarization as an “escape valve” that helps the recovery of the country, the spread of productive forces in the country and the economy. However, Maduro said that the Venezuelan bolívar will still remain as the national currency.  Causes  =Government policies= Overspending and import reliance Shelves filled with the same type of product. President Hugo Chávez' policies relied heavily on oil revenues to fund large quantities of imports. Production under Chávez dropped because of his price control policies and poorly managed expropriations. His successor, Nicolás Maduro, continued most of Chávez' policies until they became unsustainable. When oil profits began declining in 2014, Maduro began limiting imports needed by Venezuelans and shortages began to grow. Foreign reserves, usually saved for economic distress, were being spent to service debt and to avoid default, instead of being used to purchase imported goods. Domestic production, which had already been damaged by government policies, was unable to replace the necessary imported goods. According to economist Ángel Alayón, the availability of food throughout Venezuela is directly controlled and distributed by the government, even that through private companies. Alayón states the problem is not distribution, however, but production; he claims that nothing is being produced so over-regulation of distributors is irrelevant. Expropriations by the government resulted in a drop in production in Venezuela. * According to Miguel Angel Santos, a researcher at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, the industry of goods production in Venezuela was destroyed as a result of expropriations of private means of production since 2004, while a growth in import consumerism occurred when Venezuela had abundant oil money. The drop of oil prices beginning in 2014 made it impossible for the government to import necessary goods for Venezuelans, though by this point the country was largely reliant on imports. Currency and price controls The value of one US dollar in Venezuelan bolívares (VEF) on the black market through time, according to DolarToday.com. Blue vertical lines represent every time the currency has lost 90% of its value relative to the US dollar since the last one. This has happened four times since 2012, meaning that the currency is worth, as of December 2017, less than one ten-thousandth of what it was worth five years ago, since it has lost 99.99% of its value. The rate at which the value is lost (inflation) is rapidly accelerating. The first time the money took two years and two months (an implied monthly inflation rate of 9.3%) to lose 90% of its value, the second time one year and 10 months (implied rate 11% m/m), the third time only 10 months (implied rate 26% m/m), and the fourth time a mere four months (implied rate 77% m/m). In the first few years Chavez was in office, his newly created social programs required large amounts of funding to make the desired changes. On 5 February 2003, the government created CADIVI, a currency control board charged with handling foreign exchange transactions. It was created to control the flight of capital from the country by placing limits on the amount of foreign currency individuals could purchase. The Chávez administration also enacted agricultural measures that caused food imports to rise dramatically. This slowed domestic production of such agricultural mainstays as beef, rice, and milk.In Venezuela, Land 'Rescue' Hopes Unmet , Washington Post, 20 June 2009 With Venezuela's reliance on imports and its lack of US dollars to pay for them, shortages resulted. With limits on foreign currency, a currency black market developed since Venezuelan merchants relied on the import of goods that required payments with reliable foreign currencies. As Venezuela printed more money for their social programs, the bolívar continued to devalue for Venezuelan citizens and merchants since the government held most of the more reliable currencies. Because merchants could purchase only limited amounts of necessary foreign currency from the Venezuelan government, they resorted to the black market. This in turn raised the merchant's costs which resulted in price increases for consumers. The high black market rates made it difficult for businesses to purchase necessary goods or earn profits since the government often forced them to make price cuts. Maduro's government increased price controls after inflation grew and shortages of basic goods worsened. He called the policy an economic counterattack against the \\"parasitic bourgeoisie\\". Price regulators, with military backing, forced businesses to lower prices on everything from electronics to toys. One example is Venezuelan McDonald's franchises began offering a Big Mac meal for 69 bolivars or $10.90 in January 2014, though only making $1 at the black market rate. Since businesses made lower profits, this led to further shortages because they could not afford to pay to import or produce the goods that Venezuela relies on. With the short supply of foreign currencies and Venezuela's reliance on imports, debt is created. Without settling its outstanding debt, Venezuela could not import the materials necessary for domestic production. Without such imports, more shortages were created since there was an increasing lack of production as well. Corruption Following mass looting in June 2016 due to shortages which resulted in the deaths of at least three, on 12 July 2016, President Maduro granted Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino López the power to oversee product transportation, price controls, and the Bolivarian missions. He also had his military oversee five of Venezuela's main ports. Maduro's actions made Padrino one of the most powerful people in Venezuela. An Associated Press investigation published in December 2016 found that the military was involved in schemes to benefit from food scarcity rather than help assuage it. Military sellers would drastically increase the cost of goods and create shortages by hoarding products. Ships containing imports would often be held at bay until military officials at Venezuela's ports were paid off. Officials bypassed standard practices, such as performing health inspections, pocketing money normally spent on such certificates. One anonymous businessman who participated in the lucrative food dealings with Venezuelan military officials, and had contracts valued at $131 million between 2012 and 2015, showed the Associated Press his accounts for his business in Venezuela. The government would contract him for more than double the actual cost for products. For example, one corn contract of $52 million would be $20 million more than the market average. Then the businessman would have to use the extra money to pay military personnel to import such products. The businessman said he had been paying millions of dollars to military officials for years, and that the food minister, Gen. Rodolfo Marco Torres, once had to be paid $8 million just to import goods into Venezuela. Documents seen by the Associated Press showing prices for corn also revealed that the government budgeted $118 million in July 2016, an overpayment of $50 million over average market prices for that month. According to retired general Antonio Rivero, Maduro allowed the military to control their schemes, which made them less rebellious by giving them the resources to feed their families, among other benefits. The military has also used currency control licenses to obtain dollars at a lower exchange rate than the average Venezuelan. The military shared the licenses with friendly businessmen to import very few goods with the cheaper dollars while pocketing the remaining dollars. Documents show that General Rodolfo Marco Torres had given contracts to potential shell companies. Two companies, the Panamanian located Atlas Systems and J.A. Comercio de Generous Alimenticios diverted $5.5 million to Swiss accounts of two brothers-in-law of then-food minister, General Carlos Osorio in 2012 and 2013. In late January 2017, members of the United States Congress responded to the Associated Press investigation, suggested making targeted sanctions against corrupt Venezuelan officials who had taken advantage of the food shortages and participated in graft. Democratic Senator of Maryland and ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee Ben Cardin stated, \\"When the military is profiting off of food distribution while the Venezuelan people increasingly starve, corruption has reached a new level of depravity that cannot go unnoticed.\\" Senator Marco Rubio said that, \\"This should be one of President Trump's first actions in office.\\" Medical care used for political gain According to an article in The New York Times, medical care has been withheld for political gain. Mission Barrio Adentro was a program established by Chávez to bring medical care to poor neighborhoods; it was staffed by Cubans that were sent to Venezuela in exchange for petroleum. The New York Times interviewed sixteen Cuban medical professionals in 2019 who had worked for Barrio Adentro prior to the 2018 Venezuelan presidential elections; all sixteen revealed that they were required to participate in voting fraud. They \\"described a system of deliberate political manipulation\\"; their services as medical professionals \\"were wielded to secure votes for the governing Socialist Party, often through coercion\\", they told The New York Times. Facing a shortage of supplies and medicine, they were instructed to withhold treatment–even for emergencies–so supplies and treatment could be \\"doled out closer to the election, part of a national strategy to compel patients to vote for the government\\". They reported that life-saving treatment was denied to patients who supported the opposition. As the election neared, they were sent door-to-door, on house visits with a political purpose: \\"to hand out medicine and enlist voters for Venezuela's Socialist Party\\". Patients were warned that they could lose their medical care if they did not vote for the socialist party, and that, if Maduro lost, ties would be broken with Cuba, and Venezuelans would lose all medical care. Patients with chronic conditions, at risk of death if they couldn't get medicine, were a particular focus of these tactics. One said that government officials were posing as doctors to make these house calls before elections; 'We, the doctors, were asked to give our extra robes to people. The fake doctors were even giving out medicines, without knowing what they were or how to use them,\\" he said. =Government explanations= Smuggling In an interview with President Maduro by The Guardian, it was noted that a \\"significant proportion\\" of the subsidized basic goods in short supply were being smuggled into Colombia and sold for far higher prices. The Venezuelan government claimed that as much as 40% of the basic commodities it subsidizes for the domestic market were being disposed of in this manner. However, economists disagreed with the Venezuelan government's claim saying that only 10% of subsidized products are smuggled out of the country. Reuters noted that the creation of currency controls and subsidies were the main factors contributing to smuggling. Following President Maduro's move to grant the military control of Venezuela's food infrastructure, military personnel have sold contraband into Colombia. One member, 1st Lt. Luis Alberto Quero Silva of the Venezuelan National Guard, was arrested for possessing three tons of flour, which was likely part of a more elaborate graft operation among the country's military. Food consumption In 2013, the president of the Venezuelan government's Instituto Nacional de Estadística (INE) Elias Eljuri, referring to a national survey, suggested that all shortages in the country were due to Venezuelans' eating, saying that \\"95% of people eat three or more meals a day\\". Data provided by the Venezuelan government's statistical office instead showed that in 2013, food consumption by Venezuelans actually decreased. By March 2016, 87% of Venezuelans were reportedly consuming less due to the shortages they faced. As of 2016, the average Venezuelan living in extreme poverty lost nearly 19 pounds due to lack of food. In March 2017, a basket of basic grocery items cost four times the monthly minimum wage and by April, more than 11% of the children in the country suffered from malnutrition. By 2018, more than 30 percent of Venezuelans were only eating one meal per day. Response =Censorship and denial= The Venezuelan government often censored and denied health information and statistics surrounding the crisis. Doctors received threats not to release malnutrition data. In one case in \\"the Ministry of Health's 2015 annual report, the mortality rate for children under 4 weeks old had increased a hundredfold, from 0.02 percent in 2012 to just over 2 percent\\". The government responded to the release of this information on the Ministry's website saying had been hacked. The information was taken down from the Internet, the health minister was fired, and the military was put in charge of Venezuela's health ministry. The Maduro government has focused on providing goods to the capital city, Caracas, while outlying regions of Venezuela experience more shortages. President Maduro said he recognized there is hunger in Venezuela, though he blamed it on an economic war. Yván Gil, Venezuela's vice minister of relations to the European Union, denied a \\"humanitarian crisis\\". Instead he stated there was simply \\"a decrease in the availability of food\\", saying an \\"economic war\\" had affected \\"the availability of food, but we are still within the thresholds set by the UN\\". In an Al Jazeera interview with president of the Constituent Assembly Delcy Rodríguez, she stated, \\"I have denied and continue denying that Venezuela has a humanitarian crisis\\". As a result, international intervention in Venezuela would not be justified. She also described statements by Venezuelans calling for international assistance as \\"treasonous\\". =Rationing= Food Shoppers waiting in line at a Mercal store for government subsidized products in March 2014 Economists state the Venezuelan government began rationing in 2014 for several reasons including an unproductive domestic industry that had been negatively affected by nationalization and government intervention, and confusing currency controls that made it unable to provide the dollars importers needed to pay for all of the basic products that enter Venezuela. According to Venezuelan residents, the government also rationed public water to those who used water over 108 hours a week because of the nation's poor water delivery systems. Gasoline was also rationed allegedly because subsidized Venezuelan gasoline was being smuggled to Colombia where it was sold for a higher price. In February 2014, the government said it had confiscated more than 3,500 tons of contraband food and fuel at the border with Colombia, which it said was intended for \\"smuggling\\" or \\"speculation\\". The president of the National Assembly, Diosdado Cabello, said the confiscated food should be given to the Venezuelan people and should not be \\"in the hands of these gangsters.\\" One month later, President Maduro introduced a \\"biometric card\\" called Tarjeta de Abastecimiento Seguro, that required the user's fingerprint for purchases in state-run supermarkets or participating businesses. The device was allegedly meant to combat smuggling and price speculation. It has been described as being both like a loyalty program and a ration card. In May 2014, months after the card was introduced, it was reported that 503,000 Venezuelans had registered for it. In August 2014, it was reported that the Tarjeta de Abastecimiento Seguro failed to move past the trial phase, and that another \\"biometric card\\" was going to be developed according to President Maduro. Soon after, in August 2014, President Maduro announced the creation of a new voluntary fingerprint scanning system that was allegedly aimed at combating food shortages and smuggling. The Venezuelan government announced that 17,000 troops would be deployed along its border with Colombia. They were to assist in closing down traffic each night to strengthen anti-smuggling efforts. The effect of the nightly closings was to be assessed after 30 days. Following large shortages in January 2015, Makro announced that some stores would begin using fingerprint systems and that customers would be rationed both daily and monthly. Utilities Rationing of electricity and water began to increase into 2016. Water shortages in Venezuela resulted in the government mandating the rationing of water. Many Venezuelans no longer had access to water piped to their homes and instead relied on the government to provide water a few times monthly. Desperate Venezuelans often displayed their frustrations through protests and began to steal water \\"from swimming pools, public buildings, and even tanker trucks\\" to survive. Due to the water shortages, there were \\"increased [numbers of] cases of diseases such as scabies, malaria, diarrhea and amoebiasis in the country\\", according to Miguel Viscuña, Director of Epidemiology of the Health Corporation of Central Miranda Venezuela also experienced shortages of electricity and was plagued by common blackouts. On 6 April 2016, President Maduro ordered public workers not to go to work believing it would cut down on energy consumption. However, the workers actually used more energy in their homes using air conditioning, electronics and appliances. On 15 April 2016, President Nicolás Maduro announced that Venezuela would reverse Chávez's time change introduced in 2007 due to the shortage of electricity (the country's hydroelectric power has been hit by low water levels) in Venezuela, with a return to UTC−04:00 which began on 1 May 2016 at 03:00:00. On 20 April 2016, the government ordered the rationing of electricity in ten Venezuelan states, including the capital city of Caracas; This followed after other attempts to curb electricity usage including moving Venezuela's time zone ahead and telling Venezuelan women to stop using hairdryers had failed. Two days later, on 22 April 2016, the minister of electricity, Luis Motta Dominguez, announced that beginning the following week, forced blackouts would occur throughout Venezuela four hours per day for the next 40 days. During prolonged blackouts in early 2019, power, water and necessities became increasingly scarce or completely unavailable in certain areas. To counter this, on 1 April, Maduro announced power rationing that would last for 30 days. It was hoped that this would preserve power for the areas that needed it most, prevent more blackouts, and make water, oil, and food more accessible as a result – the water lines were also out of service, whilst oil refineries, food production plants, and refrigeration shut down. Part of the power rationing plan was to end the workday at 2 pm. In a tweet, the National Assembly President and Interim President of Venezuela Juan Guaidó said that rationing wasn't actually happening, and suggested that power was being diverted from smaller cities in Venezuela to Caracas to give the illusion that Maduro had fixed the problem after the fourth blackout. Guaidó also said that \\"anti-Maduro leaders\\" had made deals to import power through Colombia and Brazil to temporarily solve the problem, because there wasn't enough power even to ration. Reaction to rationing Venezuelan consumers had mainly negative feelings toward the fingerprint rationing system, saying it created longer lines, especially when fingerprint machines malfunctioned. They felt the system did nothing to relieve shortages because the large economic changes the country needed to make were simply overlooked. Following the announcement of the fingerprint system, protests broke out denouncing the proposed move in many cities in Venezuela. The MUD opposition coalition called on Venezuelans to reject the new fingerprinting system and called on supporters to hold a nationwide cacerolazo (a noisy form of protest). These were primarily held in areas that traditionally opposed the government. Students in Zulia state also demonstrated against the proposed system. Lorenzo Mendoza, the president of Empresas Polar, Venezuela's largest food producer, expressed his disagreement with the proposed system, saying it would penalize 28 million Venezuelans for the smuggling carried out by just a few. Days after the announcement, the Venezuelan government scaled back its plans for implementing the new system, saying it was now voluntary and is only for 23 basic goods. Despite public displeasure with the system, in an October 2014 Wall Street Journal article, it was reported that the fingerprint rationing system had expanded to more state-owned markets. =Supplier seizures= In 2013, the government of Venezuela seized the Manufactora de Papel toilet paper factory in an attempt to reduce shortages; it had also seized several large farms to try to address food shortages.Venezuelan Government Seizes Toilet Paper Factory Amid Shortage =Local Supply and Production Committee (CLAP)= According to Aristóbulo Istúriz, who was Vice President of Venezuela, the government-operated Local Supply and Production Committees (CLAP) that provides food to Venezuelans in need, are a \\"political instrument to defend the revolution\\". Allegations arose that only supporters of Maduro and the government were provided food, while critics were denied access to goods. PROVEA, a Venezuelan human rights group, described CLAPs as \\"a form of food discrimination that is exacerbating social unrest\\".A food box provided by CLAP, with the supplier receiving government funds owned by President Nicolas Maduro Luisa Ortega Díaz, Chief Prosecutor of Venezuela from 2007 to 2017 revealed that President Maduro had profited from the food crisis. CLAP made contracts with Group Grand Limited, a Mexican entity owned by Maduro through frontmen Rodolfo Reyes, Álvaro Uguedo Vargas and Alex Saab. Group Grand Limited would sell foodstuffs to CLAP and receive government funds. On 19 April 2018, after a multilateral meeting between over a dozen European and Latin American countries, United States Department of the Treasury officials stated that they had collaborated with Colombian officials to investigate corrupt import programs of the Maduro administration including CLAP. They explained that Venezuelan officials pocketed 70% of the proceeds allocated for importation programs destined to alleviate hunger in Venezuela. Treasury officials said they sought to seize the proceeds that were being funneled into the accounts of corrupt Venezuelan officials and hold them for a possible future government in Venezuela. A month later, on 17 May 2018, the Colombian government seized 25,200 CLAP boxes containing about 400 tons of decomposing food, which was destined for distribution to the Venezuelan public. The Colombian government said they were investigating shell companies and money laundering related to CLAP operations, and claimed the shipment was to be used to buy votes during the 2018 Venezuelan presidential election. On 18 October 2018, Mexican prosecutors accused the Venezuelan government and Mexican individuals of buying poor quality food products for CLAP and exporting them to Venezuela, doubling their value for sale. Suspects investigated by the Mexican government offered to pay $3 million to the United Nations refugee agency, UNHCR. During the Venezuelan presidential crisis, Guaidó cautioned that the Maduro government had plans to steal the products for humanitarian purposes that entered the country, including plans to distribute these products through the government's food distribution program CLAP. Effects =Arbitrage and hoarding= As a result of the shortages and price controls, arbitrage (or bachaqueo), the ability to buy low and sell high, came about in Venezuela. For example, goods subsidized by the Venezuelan government were smuggled out of the country and sold for a profit. Hoarding also increased as Venezuelan consumers grew nervous over shortages. =Crime= Individuals have resorted to violent theft to acquire items that shortages have made difficult to obtain. Venezuelan motorcycle organizations have reported that their members have been murdered for their motorcycles due to the shortage of motorcycles and spare parts. There have also been reports of Venezuelan authorities being killed for their weapons, and trucks full of goods being attacked to steal desirable merchandise they are carrying. Shortages are so chronic that crime has decreased because of them; since there is less cash in banks, as of 2019 there have been fewer bank robberies. There are fewer cars circulating due to the high price of imported parts, and guns for criminals are increasingly expensive, meaning that robbers have to kill authorities in order to get a weapon. = Housing = Since the mid-2000s during Chávez's presidency, Venezuela has had a housing crisis. In 2005, the Venezuelan Construction Chamber (CVC) estimated that there was a shortage of 1.6 million homes, with only 10,000 of 120,000 promised homes constructed by Chávez's government despite billions of dollars in investments. Poor Venezuelans attempted to construct homes on their own despite structural risks. By 2011, there was a housing shortage of 2 million homes, with nearly twenty prime developments being occupied by squatters following Chávez's call for the poor to occupy \\"unused land\\". Up to 2011, only 500,000 homes were constructed during the Chávez administration, with over two-thirds of the new housing developments being built by private companies; his government provided about the same amount of housing as previous administrations. Housing shortages were further exacerbated when private construction halted due to the fear of property expropriations and because of the government's inability to construct and provide housing. Urban theorist and author Mike Davis said in July 2011 to The Guardian, \\"Despite official rhetoric, the Bolivarianist regime has undertaken no serious redistribution of wealth in the cities and oil revenues pay for too many other programmes and subsidies to leave room for new housing construction.\\" By 2012, a shortage of building materials also disrupted construction, with metal production at a 16-year low. By the end of Chávez's presidency in 2013, the number of Venezuelans in inadequate housing had grown to 3 million. Under the Maduro government, housing shortages continued to worsen. Maduro announced in 2014 that due to the shortage of steel, abandoned cars and other vehicles would be acquired by the government and melted to provide rebar for housing. In April 2014, Maduro ruled by decree that Venezuelans who owned three or more rental properties would be forced by the government to sell their rental units at a set price or they would face fines or have their property possessed by the government. By 2016, residents of government-provided housing, who were usually supporters of the government, began protesting due to the lack of utilities and food. =Hunger= The government originally took pride in its reduction of malnutrition when it had oil revenues to fund its social spending in the 2000s. However, by 2016, the majority of Venezuelans were eating less and spending the majority of their wages on food. A 2016 survey by the Bengoa Foundation found nearly 30% of children malnourished. According to nutritionist Héctor Cruces, generations of Venezuelans will be affected by the shortages becoming malnourished, causing stunted growth. Venezuelans' immune systems were also weakened due to the lack of food intake, while the lack of water also caused hygienic issues.The New York Times stated in a 2016 article \\"Venezuelans Ransack Stores as Hunger Grips the Nation\\" that \\"Venezuela is convulsing from hunger ... The nation is anxiously searching for ways to feed itself\\". The hunger Venezuelans often experienced resulted in growing discontent that culminated with protests and looting. A 2017 report by The New York Times explained how hunger had begun to become so extreme in the country that hundreds of children began to die throughout Venezuela. That year, cases of malnutrition rose sharply as years of economic mismanagement began to grow deadlier. Nearly every hospital in Venezuela stated they did not have enough baby formula, while 63% said they had no baby formula at all. Dozens of deaths have also been reported the result of Venezuelans resorting to eating harmful and poisonous substances, such as bitter yuca, in order to curb starvation. In December 2019, Reuters reported that according to experts, \\"Venezuela faces a generation of young people who will never meet their full physical or mental potential\\", compounding the damage towards Venezuela's development as a result of shortages.  \\"The Maduro Diet\\"  In public, President Maduro often avoids or rebukes issues brought to him by Venezuelans regarding their diets. Many Venezuelans have criticized his response to the nation's hunger on state television. During one state address in early 2017, President Maduro joked about how one member of his staff had begun looking skinny, with the member saying \\"I’ve lost about 44 pounds since December\\" due to the \\"Maduro diet\\". While suffering from lack of food due to the shortages under President Nicolás Maduro, Venezuelans called their weight loss from malnourishment and hunger the \\"Maduro Diet\\". The \\"diet\\" was described as \\"a collective and forced diet\\", with many Venezuelans resorting to extreme measures to feed themselves, including eating garbage and wild fruits, and selling personal possessions for money to buy food. By the end of 2016, more than three-quarters of Venezuelans had lost weight because of their inadequate food intake, with about the same proportion of people saying they had lost from a lack of food in 2016 alone. In 2017, studies found that 64% of Venezuelans saw a reduction in weight, with 61% saying they go to sleep hungry, while the average Venezuelan lost . =Medicine and medical supplies= Medical shortages in the country hamper medical treatment. Venezuela's over-reliance on imported medical products and professionals has contributed to shortages in healthcare, as has the brain drain due to the crisis in Venezuela. It has also been reported that government health officials have engaged in corrupt practices like privately selling national medical supplies for personal gain. Shortages of antiretroviral medicines to treat HIV/AIDS affected about 50,000 Venezuelans, potentially causing thousands of them with HIV to develop AIDS. Venezuelans also said it was hard to find acetaminophen to help alleviate the newly introduced chikungunya virus, a potentially lethal mosquito-borne disease. Diphtheria, which had been eradicated from Venezuela in the 1990s, reappeared in 2016 due to shortages of basic drugs and vaccines. Shortages in all kinds of contraceptives, as well as the fact that abortion is illegal, have caused sickness in many women, from both backalley abortions and illness caused by pregnancy in vulnerable women. In March 2019, it was reported that the \\"collapse\\" of the health system had caused the return of old and eradicated rare diseases like yellow fever, dengue, malaria, and tuberculosis, as well as a large increase in infant and maternal mortality rates. There was also concern than untreated migrants would begin to spread diseases to other countries. Also available online. In 2014, the government could not supply enough money for medical supplies among healthcare providers, with doctors saying that 9 of 10 large hospitals had only 7% of required supplies and private doctors reporting numbers of patients that are \\"impossible\\" to count dying from easily treated illnesses due to the \\"downward sliding economy\\", and doctors at University of Caracas Medical Hospital stopped performing surgeries due to the lack of supplies, even though nearly 3,000 people required surgery. In 2015, only 35% of hospital beds were available and 50% of operating rooms could not function due to the lack of resources and it was reported by the Venezuelan NGO Red de Medicos por la Salud that there was a 68% shortage of surgical supplies and a 70% shortage of medicines in Venezuelan pharmacies. In that year, the Human Rights Watch said that they \\"have rarely seen access to essential medicines deteriorate as quickly as it has in Venezuela except in war zones.\\" =Protests= A protester during the 2014 Venezuelan protests holding a sign saying, \\"Yo protesto por la escasez. Donde los consigo?\\" (I protest for the scarcity. Where can I get these?). Demonstrations against the effects of shortages have occurred throughout Venezuela. In August 2014, many Venezuelans protested against the fingerprint rationing put in place by the government while protests against shortages grew from late-2014 into 2015. Of the 2,836 protests that occurred in the first half of 2015, a little more than one in six events were demonstrations against shortages. In 2016 after shortages of water began to occur, there were growing incidents of protest as a result. Looting In 2015, growing frustration with shortages and having to wait for hours in long lines for products, led to looting throughout Venezuela. According to the Venezuelan Observatory of Social Conflict, hundreds of events involving looting and attempted looting occurred throughout the country in the first half of the year. It was also noted that looting was not new to the country, but had been increasing throughout 2015. Looters showed signs of \\"desperation and discomfort\\" and resorted to looting because they were \\"frustrated\\" by the inability to find basic goods. In July 2015, BBC News said that due to the common shortages in Venezuela, every week there were videos being shared online showing Venezuelans looting supermarkets and trucks for food. In Ciudad, Guyana at the end of July, looting occurred in the city that resulted in one death and the arrest of dozens. =Psychological= In 2015, concerns about shortages and inflation overtook violent crime as Venezuelans' main worry for the first time in years according to pollster Datanalisis. According to the chief executive of Datanalisis, Luis Vicente Leon, since insecurity had plagued Venezuela for years, Venezuelans had become accustomed to crime and gave up hope for a solution to it. Vicente Leon said that Venezuelans had greater concerns over shortages and became preoccupied with the difficulties surrounding them instead. Eldar Shafir, author and American behavioral scientist, said that the psychological \\"obsession\\" with finding scarce goods in Venezuela is because the rarity of the item makes it \\"precious\\". Despite the threat of violent protests occurring throughout Venezuela, children were more affected psychologically by the economic crisis than violence. Abel Saraiba, a psychologist with children's rights organization Cecodap said in 2017, \\"We have children from a very early age who are having to think about how to survive\\", with half of her young clients requiring treatment because of the crisis. Children are often forced to stand in food lines or beg with their parents, while the games they play with other children revolve around finding food. In more extreme cases, Friends of the Child Foundation Amerita Protección (Fundana) psychologist Ninoska Zambrano explains that children are offering sexual services to obtain food. Zambrano said \\"Families are doing things that not only lead them to break physically, but in general, socially, we are being morally broken\\". =Society = Due to the shortages and the associated hunger, many women began to be sterilized to avoid childbirth since they could not provide enough food for their families. Young men joined gangs to fight for food, often showing signs of injury following violent confrontations for morsels of meals. Families gathered at dumpsters in the evening to obtain goods. Children would attempt to take on jobs themselves to earn money for food or even run away so they could try to find sustenance on their own. Statistics Graph showing the food scarcity rate in Venezuela There was an 80–90% shortage rate of milk (powdered and liquid), margarine, butter, sugar, beef, chicken, pasta, cheese, corn flour, wheat flour, oil, rice, coffee, toilet paper, diapers, laundry detergent, bar soap, bleach, dish, shampoo and soap in February 2015. In March 2016, it was estimated that 87% of Venezuelans were consuming less due to the shortages. There was a 50% to 80% rate of food shortages, and 80% of medicines were in short supply or unavailable. By December 2016, 78% of Venezuelans had lost weight due to lack of food. By February 2017, the Venezuela's Living Conditions Survey, managed by a multi-university organization in Venezuela, reported that about 75% of Venezuelans had lost weight in 2016. The survey had also stated that 83% of Venezuelans were living in poverty, 93% could no longer afford food and that one million Venezuelan school children did not attend classes \\"due to hunger and a lack of public services\\". In the first three months of 2019, the electrical industry suffered major decreases. The national power grid has the capacity to produce 34,000 megawatts, but was averaging between 5,500 and 6,000; this was both one cause of, and a result of, blackouts affecting at least 70% of the country. According to The Washington Post, analysts said that two-thirds of Venezuela's population (20 million people) were without water, partially or completely, in the weeks after the blackouts. International aid Donations from the Venezuelan community in the United States Amnesty International, the United Nations and other groups have offered aid to Venezuela. The Venezuelan government has declined such assistance, however, with Delcy Rodriguez denying in a September 2017 that Venezuela faced a humanitarian crisis. Venezuelans in other countries often organize benefits for those living in Venezuela, collecting products and shipping them to those they trust there. Experts say that due to the extreme state of shortages, it is necessary for many international family members to send essentials to their families.

He received the John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer in 2016. He also worked as a computer programmer for much of his life. Early life Weir was born and raised in California, the only child of an accelerator physicist father and an electrical-engineer mother who divorced when he was eight. Weir grew up reading classic science fiction such as the works of Arthur C. Clarke and Isaac Asimov. At the age of 15, he began working as a computer programmer for Sandia National Laboratories. He studied computer science at UC San Diego, although he did not graduate. He worked as a programmer for several software companies, including AOL, Palm, MobileIron and Blizzard, where he worked on the video game . Writing Weir began writing science fiction in his twenties and published work on his website for years. He also authored a humour web comic called Casey and AndyGalactanet - The Creative Writings of Andy Weir, Casey and Andy (webcomic) featuring fictionalized \\"mad scientist\\" versions of himself and his friends (such as writer Jennifer Brozek) from 2001 to 2008; he also briefly worked on another comic called Cheshire Crossing bridging Alice in Wonderland, Peter Pan, The Wizard of Oz and Mary Poppins. The attention these gained him has been attributed as later helping launch his writing career, following the failure to publish his first novel attempt called Theft of Pride. His first work to gain significant attention was \\"The Egg\\", a short story that has been adapted into a number of YouTube videos, a one-act play, and is the overarching concept of Everybody, the third album by American rapper Logic. Weir is best known for his first published novel, The Martian. He wrote the book to be as scientifically accurate as possible, and his writing included extensive research into orbital mechanics, conditions on the planet Mars, the history of manned spaceflight, and botany. Originally published as a free serial on his website, some readers requested he make it available on Amazon Kindle. First sold for 99 cents, the novel made it to the Kindle bestsellers list. Weir was then approached by a literary agent and sold the rights of the book to Crown Publishing Group. The print version (slightly edited from the original) of the novel debuted at #12 on The New York Times bestseller list. The Wall Street Journal called the novel, \\"the best pure sci-fi novel in years\\". It was made into a film starring Matt Damon and Jessica Chastain, which was released October 2, 2015. In 2015 Weir announced he was working on his second novel, provisionally titled Zhek, which he described as \\"a more traditional sci-fi novel with aliens, telepathy, faster-than-light travel, etc.\\" A fan-fiction story written by Weir, Lacero, was published in the 2016 edition of Ready Player One, making it canonical to the book's fictional universe. The work functions as a prequel to the main novel.Galactanet - The Creative Writings of Andy Weir, \\"Lacero\\" (short story fanfic) Also in 2016, Weir released The Principles of Uncertainty collection of short stories on the TAPAS app platform for short fiction. After announcing that the Zhek project had been \\"back-burnered\\", Weir moved on to another hard sci-fi novel titled Artemis, with a female protagonist, based on the Moon and set in the 2080s-2090s. The near-future thriller, published in 2017, follows \\"Jazz\\", a twenty-six-year-old woman constrained by her small town (which is also the only city on the Moon). With debts to pay and a salary that barely covers the rent, she can't say no when a life-changing opportunity drops in her lap. But she finds herself in the middle of a conspiracy for control of the city itself. On September 26, 2017, it was announced that Phil Lord and Christopher Miller had been hired to develop and direct a science fiction film, also called Artemis, based on the novel. In 2017 CBS picked up a pilot written by Weir titled Mission Control, following a group of young NASA astronauts and scientists. In May of the same year, Weir collaborated with webcomic artist Sarah Andersen to remake Cheshire Crossing for the website Tapas, before deciding upon publishing it as a stand- alone graphic novel in July 2019; due to restrictions regarding copyright from the estate of P. L. Travers, the character of Mary Poppins from Weir's original version was replaced by a Miss Gwendolyn Poole. On November 16, 2019, a film adaptation was announced to be in development from Amblin Partners and Walt Disney Pictures, to be produced by Michael De Luca and written by Erin Cressida Wilson. Personal life In 2015, Weir lived in Mountain View, California, in a rented two-bedroom apartment. Since he has a fear of flying, he never visited the set of the film adaptation of The Martian in Budapest, where most of the scenes set on Mars were shot at Korda Studios. In 2015, with the help of therapy and medication, he was able to fly to Houston to visit the Johnson Space Center, and to San Diego to attend Comic-Con. Weir has stated that he is agnostic. He has described his political views as fiscally conservative and socially liberal.

His father died when O'Rear was very young, and he began work as a printer's devil to help support his mother and fourteen siblings. Eventually, he became editor of the Mountain Scorcher newspaper and read law under its publisher. He gained admission to the bar in 1882. In 1888, O'Rear failed to unseat incumbent Congressman William P. Taulbee, but in 1894, he was elected county judge of Montgomery County, Kentucky, by a small margin, becoming the only Republican to hold that office in the county's history. He was elected to the Kentucky Court of Appeals, then the state's highest court, in 1900 and was re-elected in 1908. Among his important decisions were legalizing parimutuel betting, designating counties as the voting unit in local option prohibition votes, and upholding the Day Law that mandated racial segregation in the state's public schools. In 1911, O'Rear ran for governor, but his progressive platform alienated his party's more conservative wing, and he lost the election to Democrat James B. McCreary. Shortly after the election, he resigned from the Court of Appeals and returned to private practice. O'Rear became wealthy as a chief counsel in Kentucky for the Consolidation Coal Co. and augmented his wealth through investments in real estate. In the 1920s, he helped Mary Carson Breckinridge legally organize the Frontier Nursing Service. He became more conservative later in life, opposing integration of the graduate school at the University of Kentucky and Democratic Gov. Bert T. Combs' attempt to revise the state constitution. He continued to practice law into his nineties, becoming one of the oldest active lawyers in the U.S. He died September 12, 1961 at 98. The combined lives of O'Rear and his father spanned the administrations of every U.S. President from George Washington to John F. Kennedy. Early life and family Edward Clay O'Rear was born February 2, 1863 on his parents' farm in Camargo, Kentucky.Hughes, p. 1 He was the fourteenth of fifteen children of Daniel O'Rear and was born when his father was 68 years old. His mother, Sibba (Mynheir) O'Rear, was his father's second wife.Johnson, p. 813 His paternal heritage was Scotch-Irish. When O'Rear was seven years old, his father died, and his mother moved the family – destitute in the aftermath of the Civil War – to the county seat of Mount Sterling.Klotter, p. 217 To help support his family, he began work as a printer's devil at The Sentinel and Democrat, a county newspaper, at age nine. He later worked for The Outlook in Owingsville and The Sentinel in Flemingsburg before taking a job as editor of the Mountain Scorcher, a newspaper in West Liberty, at age seventeen.Trout, \\"Judge O'Rear Dies at 98\\" Colonel John T. Hazelrigg, the publisher of the Mountain Scorcher, was also an accomplished lawyer, and in his spare time, O'Rear read law with him. He was later appointed deputy circuit court clerk. On March 16, 1882, O'Rear was admitted to the bar in Morgan County. Candidates were legally required to be twenty-one before admission, and the Kentucky General Assembly had to grant O'Rear – then only nineteen – a special exemption. He began practice in West Liberty. On November 29, 1882, he married Virginia Lee Hazelrigg, daughter of his law tutor.Johnson, p. 814 The couple had five children – Prentice, John, James, Helen, and Hazel. O'Rear was a member of the Knights Templar. The O'Rears were also members of the Methodist Episcopal Church, and O'Rear served on the church's board of education at the 1898 general conference. Later, he was named chairman of a five-man committee to issue an opinion regarding the church's ownership of Vanderbilt University. The committee found that the university belonged to the church. Political career O'Rear returned to Mount Sterling in 1886. In 1888, he challenged incumbent Democratic Congressman William P. Taulbee to represent the 10th district in the House of Representatives, but lost in the general election. He later supervised the collection of data in the district for the 1890 census. In 1894, O'Rear was elected county judge of Montgomery County by 145 votes, becoming the only Republican to hold that office in the history of the heavily Democratic county.Johnson, pp. 813–814 During his four-year term, a Pineville real estate mogul hired him to abstract the titles to numerous acres of land in the Cumberland and Kentucky river valleys, an assignment that allowed him to travel the area and gain the confidence of wealthy investors in the eastern part of the state. In November 1900, O'Rear was elected to represent the 7th district on the Kentucky Court of Appeals, then the state's court of last resort. He was re-elected in November 1908 and rose to become the court's chief justice. Among his notable judgments were an opinion upholding the Cammack Act of 1906 which designated counties as the voting unit in local option elections on prohibition and a 1909 decision that legalized parimutuel betting in Kentucky, an important development for the state's horse racing industry. The most notable case to come before O'Rear, however, was Berea College v. Kentucky, wherein he voted with the court's majority to uphold the Day Law that mandated segregation in the state's public schools. The decision was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1954. =1911 campaign for governor= James B. McCreary defeated O'Rear in the gubernatorial election of 1911. O'Rear was chosen as the Republican nominee for governor at the party's 1911 nominating convention, soundly defeating sitting Lieutenant Governor William Hopkinson Cox and candidate E. T. Franks. O'Rear and the convention adopted a progressive platform, including support for allowing initiatives and referendumss, women's suffrage, highway improvements, stronger labor laws, a non-partisan judiciary, creation of a public utilities commission, and direct election of U.S. senators.Klotter, pp. 217, 219 He also expressed sympathy for Black Patch tobacco farmers in their disputes with the American Tobacco Company, in contrast to sitting Republican Governor Augustus E. Willson, who had deployed the state militia to quell violence perpetrated by The Night Riders, a violent subset of the discontent farmers. Consequently, the more conservative wing of his party, including Willson and Senator-elect William O'Connell Bradley, gave him lukewarm support, at best. His decision in Berea College v. Kentucky also cost him support among African-American voters, who usually voted Republican in large numbers. The Democrats, who nominated former Governor and U.S. Senator James B. McCreary, were similarly divided by factionalism stemming from McCreary's Roman Catholicism and support for prohibition. For all the divisions within their own parties, however, there were very few differences between O'Rear and McCreary.Klotter, p. 219 Both supported prohibition and both advocated progressive, populist reforms. This lack of political differences gave rise to partisan and personal attacks. O'Rear emphasized the need to cleanse the state of Democratic rule which had, recent gains notwithstanding, dominated the state for decades. McCreary responded by citing Republicans' alleged record of \\"assassination, bloodshed, and disregard of law\\", references to Willson's suppression of the Night Riders, Bradley's contentious election as senator, and the assassination of Democratic Governor William Goebel, allegedly perpetrated by Republicans, including Caleb Powers, who had just been elected to Congress after being pardoned by Willson. On a personal level, O'Rear charged that McCreary would be a pawn of Democratic political boss J. C. W. Beckham, while McCreary criticized O'Rear for not resigning his position on the Court of Appeals – and continuing to accept his salary – while campaigning for governor. The support of wealthy entrepreneur John C. C. Mayo ensured that McCreary had a much better funded campaign, allowing him to utilize traditional campaign methods such as political barbecues as well as new ones such as motion pictures and travel by automobile.Harrison and Klotter McCreary won the election by a vote of 226,771 to 195,436. Post-political life After the election, O'Rear tendered his resignation from the Court of Appeals and returned to private practice in Frankfort, Kentucky. He continued his support of progressive reforms, campaigning for Teddy Roosevelt's \\"Bull Moose\\" ticket in the 1912 presidential election.Klotter, p. 223 In the gubernatorial election of 1915, he joined with Beckham in a bi-partisan speaking tour of the state, urging the election of candidates who favored prohibition.Appleton, p. 35 O'Rear claimed that 90% of the state's murders could be connected to the sale or use of alcohol and cautioned that \\"free use of alcohol\\" compromised elections because an intoxicated voter was more willing to sell his vote.Appleton, pp. 36–37 O'Rear established a lucrative practice as chief counsel in Kentucky for the Consolidation Coal Co..Hughes, p. 4 He aided the company in developing the coal and timber resources of Eastern Kentucky, creating jobs for the residents of that region and hefty profits for himself and his client. He invested his profits in real estate in Central Kentucky, eventually acquiring approximately of farmland in Franklin, Woodford, and Fayette counties, including Mereworth Farm and its thoroughbred stables. In 1922, O'Rear's friend E. O. Robinson, a wealthy Cincinnati timber magnate, asked O'Rear to help him create the Robinson Mountain Fund, a charitable trust for the benefit of Robinson's native Eastern Kentucky. O'Rear was appointed lifetime chair of the trust. In November 1925, O'Rear helped draft Articles of Incorporation for Mary Carson Breckinridge's Kentucky Committee for Mothers and Babies (later known as the Frontier Nursing Service), and would later serve as the service's vice- president and director.Breckinridge, pp. 160, 166 In the early 1930s, O'Rear divorced his first wife; later he married his secretary, Mabel Taylor. During World War II, O'Rear was chairman of Kentucky's salvage drive to collect materials for the war effort. In 1943, he purchased the Ashley House, an estate in Woodford County, that became his home for the rest of his life. Later in life, O'Rear became more conservative, and friends quipped that he resented \\"everything from the outcome of the Civil War to the advent of the twentieth century\\". He was serving on the University of Kentucky's board of trustees by 1949 when federal judge Hiram Church Ford held that the university's refusal to admit Lyman T. Johnson, a black man, to its graduate school was a violation of Johnson's equal protection rights under the Fourteenth Amendment because the graduate programs at Kentucky State University, which was designated for blacks, were not equal to those at the University of Kentucky.Hardin, p. 95 An angry O'Rear demanded that Gov. Earle C. Clements call a special legislative session to appropriate funds for a black university equal to the University of Kentucky. Clements, who did not oppose the integration of the university, reportedly almost came to blows with O'Rear over the incident. O'Rear quipped that he attended \\"the University of Camargo.\\" Both the University of Kentucky and Kentucky Wesleyan College awarded O'Rear honorary Doctor of Laws degrees. Governor A. B. \\"Happy\\" Chandler presented him the Governor's Medallion for distinguished public service in 1959. In 1960, O'Rear chaired the Committee of 1,000, a group opposed to Governor Bert T. Combs' call for a constitutional convention to update the Kentucky Constitution, which had been ratified in 1891.Pearce, p. 157 Chandler, champion of the more conservative wing of the state's Democratic Party, joined O'Rear in his opposition. O'Rear's arguments against revision were based on legal and constitutional reasoning, while Chandler's appeals were more emotional. In November, voters rejected the convention by 17,724 votes. A 1953 Courier-Journal profile of O'Rear noted that, at the age of 90, he still went to work in his Frankfort law office one or two days per week and still served as chief counsel for Consolidated Coal, making him one of the oldest practicing lawyers in the United States. His obituary stated that he remained physically and mentally healthy – the use of a cane notwithstanding – until spraining his ankle in a January 1961 fall. An illness left him bedfast in June of that year, and he died at his home on September 12, 1961, at the age of 98. The combined lives of O'Rear and his father spanned the administrations of every U.S. President from George Washington to John F. Kennedy.

After being beaten in her first two races she won the Oak Leaf Stakes before establishing herself as one of the leading juvenile fillies of her generation with a win in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies. After the end of the season she was voted American Champion Two-Year-Old Filly. Pleasant Stage failed to win in six races as a three-year-old but finished second in the Kentucky Oaks and the Acorn Stakes and third in the CCA Oaks. She died of a heart attack on August 28, 1992 at Del Mar Racetrack after an adverse reaction to a routine vitamin shot by her veterinarian. Background Pleasant Stage was a bay filly bred in Kentucky by Mrs. Thomas Evans and raced in the colors of Thomas Mellon Evans's Buckland Farm. She was sired by Pleasant Colony, who won the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes in 1981. At stud, the best of his other progeny included Pleasant Tap and St Jovite. Pleasant Stage's dam Meteor Stage, was a Virginia-bred mare who failed to win in eleven races. She was granddaughter of Patelin, a broodmare whose other descendants have included I'll Have Another and the CCA Oaks winner Class Play. Buckland Farm's manager Pat Vickers described her as being a young horse with \\"a certain racing-filly look\\" who led the other yearlings around the field. During her racing career Pleasant Stage was trained by Christopher Speckert. Racing career =1991: two-year-old season= Pleasant Stage began her racing career at Del Mar racetrack in the late summer of 1991. On August 18 she started a 33.5/1 outsider for a six furlong maiden race and finished strongly to take third place behind Captivant and Praslin. Moved up in distance for a maiden over one mile in September she started favorite but was beaten two lengths into second place by Queens Court Queen. Despite her two defeats, the filly was stepped up in class for the Oak Leaf Stakes at Santa Anita Park on October 14 and started the 6.5/1 third choice in the betting behind the Sorrento Stakes winner Soviet Sojourn and the Del Mar Debutante Stakes winner La Spia. Ridden as in her previous start by the future U.S. Racing Hall of Fame jockey Eddie Delahoussaye, she was restrained in the early stages before taking the lead in the straight and winning by two lengths from Soviet Sojourn, with La Spia three lengths back in third. On November 2, Pleasant Stage contested the eighth running of the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies at Churchill Downs. In a fourteen-runner field she started at odds of 5.8/1 behind Preach (Frizette Stakes), Speed Dialer (Arlington-Washington Lassie Stakes) and the British challenger Culture Vulture, whilst the other runners included La Spia, Soviet Sojourn and Queens Court Queen. She started slowly and raced at the back of the field before moving up into fourth entering the straight. She produced a sustained run on the inside to overtake La Spia in the final strides to win by a head with Cadillac Women two and a half lengths back in third ahead of Speed Dialer, Spinning Round and Vivano. In the closing stages, the filly's 81-year-old owner repeatedly asked Pat Vickers \\"Is she going to get there\\": as Pleasant Stage crossed the line, Vickers replied \\"She's got it\\". =1992: three-year-old season= On her three-year-old debut, Pleasant Stage started favorite for the Santa Anita Oaks on March 8, but finished fourth of the eight runners behind Golden Treat, Magical Maiden and Queens Court Queen. In the Ashland Stakes at Keeneland on 18 April she again started favorite and again finished fourth behind Prospectors Delite, Spinning Round and Luv Me Luv Me Not. Despite her indifferent early form, the filly started second choice in the betting behind the odds-on favorite Prospectors Delite for the Kentucky Oaks on May 1. After racing towards the rear of the field in the early stages she made progress in the straight to finish second, beaten half a length by Luv Me Luv Me Not, with Prospectors Delite a neck away in third place. In the Acorn Stakes at Belmont Park three weeks later, the filly finished second of the twelve runners, beaten two lengths by Prospectors Delite after being forced to the outside on the final turn. In the Mother Goose Stakes at the same track on June 7 she produced a \\"dull effort\\" when finishing last of the seven runners behind Turnback the Alarm. Jerry Bailey took over the ride, when Pleasant Stage was moved up in distant for the CCA Oaks over ten furlongs at Belmont on July 11. She finished third of the six runners beaten two and a half lengths behind the winner Turnback the Alarm. In late August at Del Mar, Pleasant Stage had what her trainer described as an \\"apoplectic reaction\\" to a routine veterinary injection and died within two minutes. Assessment and awards In the Eclipse Awards for 1991, Pleasant Stage was named American Champion Two-Year- Old Filly.

He is commemorated in numerous epic songs, including O Armatolos, an award-winning poem written by the 19th-century Bulgarian poet Grigor Parlichev.  Historical background  At the beginning of the 19th century region of Ohrid belonged to Ottoman Empire and had status of kaza of the Sanjak of Ohri. Its governor was Dželadin-bey who had to maintain balance between Ottoman porte on one side and Ali Pasha, the leader of the bands of brigands in the neighbouring Pashalik of Yanina, on another. The bands of Ali Pasha frequently robbed neighbouring territories, including the territory under control of Dželadin-bey. Dželadin-bey belonged to influential group of Ottoman officials at western Balkans who resisted reforms to protect their possessions they forcible confiscated from other people. This is how Dželadin-bey \\"earned\\" around 100 chifliks on the territory of the kaza he controlled. To better resist them Ottomans had to mobilize local Christians to help their regular military forces to guard mountain passes toward Albania.

Fry's Army was the informal name given to a short-lived radical protest movement organized in Los Angeles, California in 1894 and headed by trade union and socialist political activist Lewis C. Fry. Fry's Army was one of about 40 \\"Industrial Armies\\" formed in 1894 to organize and transport unemployed workers for a march on Washington, D.C., the best remembered of which was the Ohio-based movement known as Coxey's Army. Beginning with an enrollment of 850 people, the \\"army\\" made a difficult cross-country journey by foot following the refusal of railroads to transport the protestors. Two trains were stolen in the course of the march, which brought Fry's Army into conflict with the authorities. Key support was gained from the Governor of Texas, which prevented mass arrest or a worse outcome, but rail transport ended in St. Louis and the remaining members of the group began a difficult march by foot. In these adverse conditions the movement melted away, splitting into rival factions in Indiana. Only a small handful of protestors eventually arriving in Washington, DC with Fry, where their protest efforts were ineffectual. History =Background= General Lewis C. Fry, organizer of the Los Angeles-based \\"Fry's Army\\" march to Washington in 1894. The American economy went through a protracted depression during the decade of the 1890s, signaled by a dramatic drop of the stock market and a financial panic beginning in May 1893.Stuart B. Kaufman and Peter J. Albert (eds.), The Samuel Gompers Papers: Volume 3, Unrest and Depression, 1891-94. Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press, 1989; pg. 363. By the end of 1893 more than 16,000 businesses and 500 banks had closed their doors, with approximately 2 million workers cast into the ranks of the unemployed. By the height of the depression in 1894 nearly 20 percent of the non-agricultural workforce would be idled by the crisis, remembered to history as the Panic of 1893. Lewis C. Fry, a former soldier, was a general organizer for the fledgling American Federation of Labor and a member of the Socialist Labor Party of America.Franklin Folsom, Impatient Armies of the Poor: The Story of Collective Action of the Unemployed, 1808-1942. Niwot, CO: University Press of Colorado, 1991; pg. 170. Fry was captivated by the idea of the Industrial Army movement of 1894, the notion of gathering and transporting unemployed workers stricken by the economic crisis for a mass march on the halls of Congress to force ameliorative and substantive change to end the economic crisis. In February 1894, with an inadequate 6-week city-level program for unemployment relief coming to an end, \\"General\\" Fry began to organize his so-called Industrial Army.Grace Heilman Stimson, Rise of the Labor Movement in Los Angeles. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 1955; pg. 156. An experienced political activist well accustomed to public speaking, Fry carefully screening all those who wished to join the so-called Commonweal movement.Folsom, Impatient Armies of the Poor, pg. 171. On March 5, Fry's newly organized \\"army\\" approved a simple three-point program for enactment, calling for federal employment of the unemployed, a ban on immigration to the United States for ten years, and a prohibition of ownership of land by non-citizens. By the middle of that same month, more than 800 people had been enrolled in the new movement and preparations began to be made to take the \\"army\\" east to put political pressure on Congress for implementation of the group's objectives. A call was made to supporters for the donation of food and blankets to supply the unemployed activists who would be making the trip. =Departure= Texas Governor \\"Big Jim\\" Hogg deescalated the situation when Fry's Army was sidetracked in the Texas desert, making possible their departure from the state by rail. Fry initially attempted to garner the support of the Southern Pacific Railroad for his effort in the form of provision of free railroad passage. The railroad unsurprisingly refused this request and on March 16, 1894,Stimson, History of the Labor Movement in Los Angeles, pg. 156 is explicit about this departure date, noting that it was \\"eight days before Coxey's start.\\" The survey of this and related movements by Folsom has the departure date as March 26 (pg. 171). Fry and a reduced force of 600 disciplined supporters set out on foot to make the several thousand mile trek from Los Angeles on the west coast to Washington, DC on the east. The group seized a Southern Pacific train at Ontario, California and proceeded with it some 20 miles eastward to Colton, California, where several thousand pounds of hardtack, bacon, and beans were gathered by sympathizers. Thus provisioned, the stolen train proceeded eastwards across the desert lands of the Southwestern United States, making it as far as El Paso, Texas. In El Paso the group raised additional provisions from sympathetic citizens following a peaceful march through town before stealing another train, which railroad officials permitted to depart the town with about 800 people aboard. Once outside the city, the stolen train was intentionally sidetracked at the tiny town of Sierra Blanca, Texas, where the Texas Rangers moved in at the railroad's behest to hold the train-stealing \\"Industrial Army\\" as de facto prisoners. Texas Governorn \\"Big Jim\\" Hogg was sympathetic to the cause of Fry's Army, however, and he ordered the Rangers to end their action against what he termed the \\"petition in boots.\\"Folsom, Impatient Armies of the Poor, pp. 171-172. In a show of public support, Gov. Hogg sent a telegram to the Dallas Times Herald declaring > \\"When a railroad company hauls tramps or unemployed penniless men into this > State it cannot dump them into a barren desert and murder them by torture > and starvation without atoning for it, if there is any virtue in the > machinery of justice. Nor will I permit them to be shot down on Texas soil > by any armed force whatever, no matter how much the Southern Pacific and the > other enemies of the state may howl about the commune.\\"Folsom, Impatient > Armies of the Poor, pg. 172. A standoff emerged between the railroad, which continued to hold Fry's Army as virtual prisoners in an essentially unpopulated desert whistle stop, and the so-called Industrial Army and their supporters. The stalemate was broken only when trade unions and concerned citizens of El Paso raised funds to pay for provisions and a special train with five passenger coaches and two baggage cars to transport the unemployed workers as far as San Antonio. Fry was aware that he was targeted for arrest as the ringleader of the train-stealing escapade and he attempted to elude arrest by boarding a passing freight train. He was soon discovered, however, and removed from the train, making his own way to the state capital of Austin, where the rest of Fry's Army was now located. An effort was made to march to the Governor's mansion to thank him for his support but this was prevented by local police, who packed the would- be protestors tightly into boxcars and sent the group north to St. Louis. =Dissolution= On April 3, 1894, the 600 remaining members of Fry's Army arrived in St. Louis, where they were refused additional rail transportation. The decision was made to once again begin the long trek to Washington by foot. Although the size of the group swelled to about 800 during the early part of this overland trek, hunger and exhaustion set in and the so-called army melted away. By the time the group reached Indiana it was bitterly divided over tactics and split into two rival groups.Folsom, Impatient Armies of the Poor, pg. 173. Only a small number of participants ever reached Washington, DC with Fry for the May 1 march on Congress, which ultimately proved ineffectual. =Legacy= After changing the spelling of his first name to Louis, Lewis C. Frye would twice run for Governor of Missouri, appearing on the ballot as the nominee of the Socialist Labor Party of America in the elections of 1896 and 1900.

The aviation industry however was very tumultuous and many bankruptcies and mergers occurred throughout history, and many airline companies came to use this float base in Yellowknife, including: Canadian Pacific Airlines (1946–1949), Yellowknife Airways (1949–1951), Associated Airways Limited (1951–1956), Pacific Western Airlines (1956–1966), Northward Airlines (1966–1978), and Air Dogrib (1978–1980s).

Over its main door is a sign saying \\"Fireweed Studios\\" in script on white with floral decoration. To its left is a bronze metallic plaque with text explaining the building's history. The Fireweed Studio is a log cabin in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, Canada, located in Somba K'e Park near City Hall. It was built in the late 1930s to house explosives at what later became Giant Mine, and later moved to its present location. In 1996 it was listed on the Canadian Register of Historic Places; two years later it was designated a city Heritage Building for its status as a well-preserved remnant of the city's early years. Following its construction, it was used for a year to store explosives. After more modern facilities were built for that purpose, reagents were stored there during the 1940s, as well as other mining supplies. It was sold to the Yellowknife Chamber of Commerce in 1973, and was renovated for use as a tourist center. More recently, after some further renovations, it has served as a gift shop operated by the Yellowknife Guild of Arts and Crafts during summer months. Building Fireweed Studio is located along the west side of 49th Avenue between 52nd and 53rd streets, at the eastern edge of the small Somba K'e Park. On the north side of the park is Yellowknife's modern brick city hall. An open expanse of grass to the west descends via a series of terraces with concrete retaining walls to a concrete tiled walkway at the edge of Frame Lake. South is a curved parking lot and wooded parkland. Across the street are residential properties amid parking lots with some mature trees along the edges, buffering the neighbourhood from the denser development and high-rises along Franklin Avenue, the city's main street, a block to the east. The building itself is a one-storey log cabin slightly rectangular in shape, with a few small trees, mostly white spruce, at the sides and rear. It sits on a concrete foundation and is topped with a front-gabled roof pierced in the centre by a small modern chimney. The logs are stained brown and form saddle joints at the corners. In the middle of the three front bays on the east (front) facade is a door of vertical flushboard in a plain wooden surround, with rusted metal strap hinges; a wooden screen door is behind it. It is the only entrance. A horizontal sign above the lintel says \\"Fireweed Studio\\". To its south is an interpretive plaque. Both sides have windows in the second and fourth of their five bays covered by locked vertical flushboard shutters similar to the door when the building is closed. The rear is completely blind; a modern electric meter is affixed to it near the southern corner. A narrow plain wooden frieze on narrow eaves marks the roofline. The roof itself is covered with asphalt shingles. History The cabin was built in 1939 at Giant Mine, north of today's Yellowknife. It is sometimes inaccurately stated, including on the building's interpretive plaque, that it was used as a blacksmith's shop; in reality it was used to store dynamite used during shaft sinking to reach the Brock gold vein. In the following decade more secure bunkers were built closer to the shaft, so the cabin was used instead for storage of other supplies, such as reagents. It continued in that use until 1973, when the mining company sold it to the local Chamber of Commerce for CDN$1, which moved it to very near its present location. At first, the chamber planned to use it as a tourist information centre. While it did some work toward that end the following year, Yellowknife's city hall was also being built nearby, and the contractor was allowed to store some construction materials in the cabin in exchange for restoring it after the city hall project was complete. However, that storage continued for a year after city hall was finished, and the chamber opened the building in 1976. The cabin continued to serve as a tourist information centre throughout the 1980s. Some work was done in 1988 to replace drywall and flooring in the interior. Four years later, the city's current tourist centre was built, and the crafts guild, one of Canada's oldest, moved in. After the tourist centre moved out in 1992, the craft guild took over, opening to the public to sell the works of its member artists on Saturdays and holidays during the summer. In 1998 the city designated it a Heritage Building. It was added to the Canadian Register of Historic Places in 2004. \\"An attractive, well-kept, nicely weathered building,\\" the Register says, \\"it has been a continuous part of life in Yellowknife since the 1930s. Today, in its location on City Hall grounds, it is a familiar landmark and symbol of Yellowknife's early years.\\" Five years later, in 2009, during some landscaping changes in the park, it was moved slightly to its current location where it was put on a newly poured concrete foundation. In 2013, the guild started opening the store on Tuesday nights to take advantage of crowds attending the city's nearby farmer's market. Sales increased briskly enough that the guild decided to extend its summer schedule, staying open on Tuesdays through the last farmer's market of the year, in late September.

It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places because of its significance to the atmospheric theatre architectural style popular in the United States during the 1920s. The theatre opened on August 30, 1928, becoming the company's tenth theatre.Motion Picture News, January 7, 1928, 16; Marion Star, August 29, 1928; Hoffman, Scott L. A Theatre History of Marion, Ohio: John Eberson's Palace and Beyond. Charleston, SC: The History Press, 2015, 26-36. A movie palace, it was one of the last to be built in the atmospheric theatre style in the United States.Williams, Celeste M., and Dietmar E. Froehlich. \\"John Eberson and the Development of the Movie Theater: Fantasy and Escape.\\" in Contribution and Confusion: Architecture and the Influence of Other Fields of Inquiry. Paper presented at 91st ACSA International Conference, Helsinki. Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture, 2004. In addition to motion pictures and newsreels, the theatre also booked vaudeville and legitimate theatre, although vaudeville had declined in popularity by the time the theatre opened. It is located at the corner of West Center Street and Campbell Street, on two former residential lots. The site was initially owned by the Campbell family, early Marion settlers. The lot slopes to the west, causing the stage to be below grade level on the east and at grade level on the west. The east lot was vacant at the time of construction, while the west lot had a residential house, which was razed. Over time, additional land was secured and added to the complex. In 1975, the theatre was sold to the Palace Cultural Arts Association, a nonprofit organization, and renovated. The Palace remains open today as a movie and performing arts center, and is one of 16 atmospheric theatres designed by John Eberson that remain in operation as theatres in the United States.Hoffman, 2015, p. 67. Architecture The Marion Palace was designed by John Eberson as an atmospheric theatre. Eberson designed it to fit the vision of owner V.U. Young for \\"A Spanish Castle\\" or \\"A Palace in Old Spain.\\"Marion Star, December 23, 1927, 5. It is difficult to assign an Eberson theatre to a precise architectural style. Eberson \\"mixed architectural styles, more interested in evoking an impression than precisely replicating an architectural period.\\" Hoffman, 2015, p. 30. The theatre is best described as designed in the Spanish Colonial Revival architecture style.Levin, Steve. A John Eberson Scrapbook. Theatre Historical Society of America 27 (2000). Spanish Colonial Revival was popular in Florida during the 1920s, and features arches, terra-cotta roof tiles, towerlike structures, balconies, ornamental ironwork, courtyards, patios and arcades. The design influence of the Spanish architect José Benito de Churriguera is prevalent. This Churrigueresque revival style is seen in the pillars to the right of the stage, the proscenium details, and in Eberson's use of balustrades, stucco shells and garlands. The outside is designed to resemble a palace exterior. Inside, Eberson transitions the patrons from a lobby through wooden doors to an arcade (at the rear of the orchestra) and into a courtyard on a hill. From the balcony, patrons are surrounded by a Spanish town wall and have the same view a resident would have from a high building looking down on the courtyard. A blue sky above creates the impression of open space. Stars are designed in constellation patterns in the ceiling and twinkle through holes in the plaster during performances. A Brenkert Brenograph Jr. projector, hidden in the east side wall, projects clouds on the ceiling, further creating an outdoor illusion.Marion Star, August 31, 1928, 1. Opening night Marion Palace Theatre Exterior c. 1928. Medical offices and a hair salon were located on the second floor and retail shops were located on the first floor. Poster for Excess Baggage, part of the opening night bill On August 30, 1928, the Marion Palace Theatre opened to a packed house for two performances.Marion Star, Aug. 31, 1928, p. 2; Hoffman, 2015, pp. 32–36. At the first performance, Colonel George B. Christian gave a brief opening address.Hoffman, 2015, p. 32. The father of President Warren G. Harding's secretary, George B. Christian Jr., the elder Christian was actively involved in Marion's civic life.Marion Star, Aug. 31, 1928, p. 2. His remarks included a short history of theatres in Marion, and he praised the beauty of the building. John Eberson then made a few remarks and introduced Young. He presented Young with a bag of birdseed, a tongue-in-cheek reference to the stuffed pigeons that Eberson had installed to create the feeling of being outdoors at the Palace.Marion Star, Aug. 31, 1928, p. 2; Hoffman, 2015, p. 33. The entertainment began with organ music by Banks Kennedy, a well-known Chicago organist.Marion Star, August 31, 1928, p. 2. He had written a new composition, which he titled \\"Everybody's Welcome to the Palace.\\" Next was a theatre overture, \\"A Night in the Clock Store,\\" by the Palace Orchestra under the direction of Elmer Newstrom. Four vaudeville acts followed: Harry Kahne, a nationally known mental wizard; Tilyou and Rogers, a comedy team; Johnny Mack and Company (including Ethel Dunton, Dolly Moran and Shirley Manion); and the Castlemans, a trio of entertainers. Following the live acts, a Metro-Goldwyn- Mayer silent picture, Excess Baggage (1928 film), starring William Haines, Josephine Dunn and Ricardo Cortez, was shown. The film is now lost.Library of Congress American Silent Feature Film Survival Guide The owner had hoped to open the theatre with the new \\"talkie\\" equipment.Marion Star, August 29, 1928, 7; Hoffman, 2015, p. 11. While the theatre was pre-wired for sound motion pictures, the equipment did not arrive until the following year.Hoffman, 2015, pp. 27–28. Upon opening in 1928, the theatre was immediately embraced by patrons.Marion Star, August 29, 1928, 2. The day before the opening, the local newspaper, The Marion Star described the Palace: > Forget for a few minutes that you are reading a copy of your evening paper. > Allow your imagination to carry you to the gentle slope of a moon-lit > Spanish hill. Before you rise [sic] a vine covered garden wall, broken here > and there with graceful arches. Through the archways spreads the soft light > of a harvest moon and the dim glow casts shadows over the somber colored > walls. Overhead myriads of stars are twinkling in an azure blue sky and > soft, fleecy clouds are drifting gently with the breeze. Picture all this in > your mind and you have a fair conception of the interior of the Palace > theater—Marion's new half million dollar playhouse. The new theater is > Spanish in design in all its details. From the walls and the mural > decorations to the reproduction of period furniture in the lounges the > Spanish design is followed. ... the designer of the theater has let his > fancy take full flight. Here and there patches of red brick appear, as > through [sic] the plaster had fallen from the walls. A niche in the wall is > cleverly adapted to hold a drinking fountain. The view from the balcony is > even better than the lower floor. As in the lower floor view of the stage is > unobstructed by pillars. [T]he balcony being of cantilever construction > removes the necessity of supporting it with posts and pillars which > necessarily cut off the view of the unfortunate patron who is forced to sit > behind one. Pietro Caproni statues Plaster cast of Antinous, from the P.P. Caproni & Brother catalog. Several Caproni casts are placed throughout the Palace. The illusion of a courtyard setting is further enhanced by the beautiful plaster cast statues that are strategically placed throughout the Palace. Almost all of these are originals produced by Pietro Caproni (1862–1928) and his firm, P.P. Caproni and Brother. With his brother, Emilio, the Caproni firm supplied plaster cast sculptures to schools, museums and theatres throughout America, including Symphony Hall, Boston. Eberson used them in all of his atmospheric theatres. Caproni believed that \\"the quality of a reproduction is of the greatest importance. In an original work of merit there is a subtleness of treatment—a certain feeling which, if captured in reproduction, places the finished piece within the realm of art itself.\\" The statues installed at the Palace are castings of classical Greek and Roman works, including the Praying Boy, the Capitoline Antinous, Doryphoros and Diana of Versailles. A casting of Lorado Taft's George Washington, dressed in Revolutionary War clothing is located in a balcony niche.Hoffman, 2015, pp. 83–90. The image to the right is a representation of the Caproni casting for the Capitoline Antinous, which is located at the Palace in a niche in the upper right hand corner of the north wall, above the proscenium. To the left of this statue is a Caproni plaster casting of the Praying Boy. Theatre organ A Page Rainbo Gold organ was installed when the Palace opened. Manufactured by the Page Organ Company of Lima, Ohio, it was first played by Banks Kennedy, who was the guest organist at the Palace until December 1928. At the opening, the Marion Star described the Page organ to its readers: > Organs of exquisite tone and ornate appearance have become one of the > outstanding features of motion picture houses and the management of Marion's > new playhouse invested a huge sum in obtaining one of the best on the > market. The organ is custom made being designed especially for the Marion > theater. The size of the building and its acoustic properties were taken > into consideration before any work was done on the musical instrument. Every > bit of material going into the construction of the organ was carefully > selected coming from many lands. Many weeks of work were necessary before > the instrument was completed and ready to install. The heart of the organ > rests in the switchboard. Keys operate silver and bronze contacts making > instantaneous connections with the pipes and other effects. The pipes are > cleverly concealed on each side of the stage, the opening forming double > windows leading to balconies of two Spanish towers. The chambers form a > natural part of the architecture of the interior. The console is the only > part of the huge organ visible. It rests on a platform that can be raised > and lowered bringing the console up to a point where it can be viewed to a > great advantage all over the house or lowered to a point where it does not > interfere with the view of the stage. The elevator is controlled by a motor > located in a soundproof room back of the stage. The console itself is known > as the Page Rainbo Gold deriving its name from the finish. It is heavily > scrolled and so finished that lights are reflected in a very effective > fashion.Marion Star, August 29, 1928, 7. That organ was sold and was replaced in 1976 with a 3/10 Mighty Wurlitzer Theatre Pipe Organ. It started its life as the second organ of the 1,200 seat Mars Theatre (now the Long Center for the Performing Arts) in Lafayette, Indiana. When that theatre opened in 1921, it owned a 3/10 Smith-Geneva pipe organ that lasted in the theatre just three years. In 1924, a 3/10 Wurlitzer was installed, and remained in the theatre until the early 1960s, when it was purchased by the former national president of the American Theatre Organ Society, Al Mason, and installed in his Michigan home. Following his death, this instrument was moved to the Marion Palace. Restoration The theatre building was completely restored in 1975–1976 after ownership was transferred to a local nonprofit group, the Palace Cultural Arts Association, under the leadership of John Keggan and his Palace Guard.https://marionpalace.org/our- history/ John Eberson's son, Drew Eberson,Luna, 1991, pp. 25–30. helped guide the restoration. At that time, the theatre seats were renovated and some were removed to create handicapped-accessible space. The theatre now has seating for 1420 patrons (originally the theatre had seats for 1540 patrons).Hoffman, 2015, p. 71. When the theatre opened, retail space was rented to four businesses on the street level and a medical clinic and beauty shop on the second floor level.Hoffman, 2015, pp. 93–98. These spaces were remodeled for a concession stand, a box office, theatre offices and multi-purpose spaces. Since 1976, the building has undergone a series of structural, backstage and front of house improvements. In 2015, repair of the front façade and signage began, including work to replace bricks and terra cotta damaged by water.Marion Star, March 7, 2015 \\"Renovations Begin at Palace Theatre\\".

It is a two-storey concrete building in a late modernist style dating to the mid-20th century. In 2006 it was designated a City of Yellowknife Heritage Site in recognition of its long standing role as a social centrepiece for the downtown community; it has been administratively listed on the Canadian Register of Historic Places as a result. \\"This is where you went to find everybody\\" in the 1960s, one city councillor recalled when the building received its heritage plaque in 2010. It was the first federal government building constructed in what is now referred to as Yellowknife's New Town. The city had begun during the 1930s as a gold mining community on a peninsula and islands in the bay named for it on Great Slave Lake. When the boom resumed after World War II, it quickly outgrew the space available there, and New Town began to develop to the south on higher ground. The post office was completed in 1956 as the centralized, downtown location for mail services for Canada Post; it also housed the territorial courts until 1978. Both functions made it an important civic presence that helped establish New Town. During later decades, the building lost some of its prominence, as federal agencies that had been housed there moved elsewhere in downtown Yellowknife for more space and the city grew too large for all of its residents to receive their mail there through general delivery. It underwent some physical changes as well. A 1958 renovation added a rear pavilion, and a fire ten years later resulted in the reconstruction of the upper floor. In the 1990s it was extensively renovated and underwent significant changes to its exterior although the building's basic form remains. In 2010 it was deemed surplus. Since 2010 it has been privately owned and leased back to Canada Post. In 2014 the city's removal of the benches in response to complaints about the behaviour of local homeless people led to a sit-in protest by local residents. Building The post office is situated on a corner lot in an urban area of low- and high-rise buildings with some parking lots interspersed amid a grid pattern of numbered streets and avenues. This level and type of development continues for several blocks in all directions. The terrain is generally level, at the top of a rise coming up from the lake, roughly in elevation. On the opposite side of 49th Street, the intersection's northwest corner, is a bank branch, with the seven-storey YK Centre office building just down the street. The northeast corner is occupied by a six-story modernist building that houses some territorial government offices. Across 50th Avenue, signed and referred to as Franklin Avenue, is a fast-food restaurant on the corner and the entrance to the Centre Square Mall complex, topped with a three-storey hotel and, a block to the east, the Northern Heights tower, Yellowknife's tallest building. Southwest of the building is a tall radio transmission tower. The building itself is a two-storey 10-by-10-bay timber frame structure faced in concrete with a flat roof. In the eastern section of the north (rear) elevation a nested pavilion three bays wide rises to an additional storey; an attached square brick chimney rises to its east. On the north and east are broad stone tiled sidewalks with shrubbery and decorative tree plantings enclosed by low stone walls on the latter. A parking lot roughly equal in area to the building is located on its west; to the south is an unnamed alley. Fenestration on the facades facing the streets consists of casement windows with a large single pane over a smaller one. On the ground floor, the southernmost bay of the east face is set with a double window. Next to it is a projecting secondary entrance set with modern metal and glass doors sheltered by a flat concrete roof. alt=The post office seen from the other street it faces, with its entrance on the ground floor at left, the flag flying, and sunlight coming through the clouds behind it The last bay on the north end is blind, with the main entrance recessed into the corner and fronted by a low porch with metal railings. A single round metal pillar supports the upper story within the recess. Two projecting plain strips surround the entryway, with a similar quoin rising from the top. The bay to the west is blind as well. A projecting course of flat strips similar to those in the quoins divides the second storey from the first. Like its counterpart below, the southernmost window on the east is doubled. This treatment is also accorded the third bay, above the secondary entrance, and the northernmost bay. The east facade has the single windows in all ten bays. On the south side, the first story has three single windows, two blind bays, three more windows and a garage with a metal door. The second story has, from the east, three single windows, a double, a blind bay and then a double followed by four singles. The west (rear) facade has no windows and only an opaque service door on the east side of the pavilion; a chainlink fence on the other side encloses the building's mechanicals. Above it are two windows spaced a bay apart, the only windows on the west. The roofline is marked by a frieze of flat metal plates in strips with small cornices between. At the northern end of the east facade are an irregular set of empty bolt holes. In the center of the roof along eastern side a flagpole rises. An air handler is located in the northeast corner. The upper story of the pavilion has the same treatments as the rest of the building. On its north facade are two windows, one the same single casement type seen elsewhere on the building, the other a triple. History From Yellowknife's beginnings as a gold mining boomtown in the mid-1930s, a building to house federal government offices, including Canada Post, in the center of town had been planned, but never built. In the years after World War II, when development resumed, the plans remained. By 1950 the current lot had been reserved for the purpose. Funding was not available until 1955. That year construction started, and by the following April the building was open and serving customers. A formal ribbon-cutting ceremony was held in July. The post office occupied the first floor, with government offices and courts upstairs. It was the first federal building in Yellowknife's New Town. As in many other communities in the Canadian North, the post office quickly became a center of social and community life. Many residents used general delivery instead of a street address and came there daily to pick up their mail, often lingering on the benches and sidewalks outside when the weather permitted. It was also adjacent to the nearby Sutherland's Drug Store, where residents often shopped, further establishing the area as the centre of town. At the time of construction, the building had a coal chimney but no coal furnace. The unused chimney was later filled in with sand and dirt. In 1958 the building was expanded slightly, with the addition of the rear pavilion. During the 1960s, different government agencies, including the Canadian Wildlife Service, the Department of Energy and Mines and the Canada Manpower Centre, located in the building. At times some of the space was even rented as private apartments. In 1968 a fire in the upper storey required that it be gutted, and the rest of the building suffered fire and water damage. In the 1970s, with the city's population growing rapidly, the implementation of letter carrier delivery to individual houses was considered. It was found not to be workable at that time, and general delivery continued to be the preferred method of receiving mail. The courts moved to a new building nearby in 1978. The population growth continued. Early in the 1980s general delivery to the population became less and less feasible. In 1982 post office boxes were offered, and later in the decade carrier service to residents was finally implemented, with Yellowknife's original postal code of X0E 1H0 ended gradually and replaced with the current X1A Forward Sortation Code. During the 1990s the building was renovated again, altering its exterior appearance significantly as a new facade and windows were installed. Nevertheless, enough of its original materials remained for it be listed on the Canadian Register of Historic Places in 2006, in recognition of its role in catalyzing the development of Yellowknife's New Town and providing a centre for the growing community. The city council formally designated it a city heritage site the following year. \\"[W]hen I was a young woman in this town, this is where you went to find everybody,\\" recalled city councillor Amanda Mallon. Public Works Canada, however, refused to allow the city to affix an informational plaque to the building, since it was still owned by the federal government. In 2010, the government decided to surplus the building, and a private concern, 6133 NWT Ltd., a partnership between Denendeh Investments and JV Development, took over ownership. Canada Post leased its former space and continued operations. The new owners allowed the city to affix a plaque early that year. Four years later, the city removed the benches from the sidewalks in front of the post office after postal workers and patrons complained that homeless people loitering there after a nearby shelter had been closed were harassing them, drinking and urinating on the building. The owners had asked that the planters be removed as well to eliminate all sitting space, and indicated it would look for some means to discourage people from sitting on them in the meantime. A local teenager organized a sit-in protest on Facebook in response, attracting others to bring their lawn chairs and sit in front of the post office during lunch hour. \\"[H]omeless people in Yellowknife are being treated like animals, and no one deserves that,\\" she told a reporter. Many other residents supported the protest, saying they had never experienced any problems with the people sitting on the benches. One postal worker said she had no complaints and found the city's response overly harsh, likening it to \\"grade school when a few kids are misbehaving and the whole class ends up getting in trouble.\\" Mark Heyck, the city's mayor, said removing the benches was a temporary measure as the city looked for long-term solutions to address the problem.

Decisions were made in virtual secrecy in private party caucus meetings attended only by the Senators of the majority party, The Caucus System is different from Senatorial Courtesy, which allowed any Senator to block a gubernatorial appointment from his or her home county. Governor Richard J. Hughes, a Democrat elected in 1961, opposed the Caucus System, which effectively prevented a small number of Republicans Senators to join together with the Democratic minority to support any of the Governor's legislative initiatives. After the 1961 elections, Republicans held a narrow 11-10 majority, meaning six Republican Senators had the power to blackball any bill from reach the Senate floor. In 1962, Senator Robert C. Crane, a Republican from Union County, died of cancer at the age of 41. His death left the Senate evenly split at ten Republicans and ten Democrats. A 1962 Special Election to replace Crane attracted considerable statewide attention, since the winning party would then control the Senate. The Caucus System became an issue in the campaign between Republican Assemblyman Nelson Stamler and Democrat H. Roy Wheeler, who supported eliminating the rule. Stamler won. When Democrats won control of the State Senate in 1965, with Hughes ally John A. Lynch Sr. (D-New Brunswick) installed as the new Senate President, the Caucus System was abolished; Senatorial Courtesy was continued. Republicans reinstated the Caucus System rule after they won back control of the Senate in 1967. Following the 1973 Democratic landslide, where Democrats won a 29-10 majority (with one Independent), the newly elected Senate Democratic leadership—Senate President Frank J. Dodd (D-West Orange) and Majority Leader Matthew Feldman (D-Teaneck) -- moved to eliminate the Caucus System and Senatorial Courtesy rules. The Caucus System rule ended for good, but a faction of the Democratic majority led by Senator James P. Dugan (D-Jersey City), the incumbent Democratic State Chairman, teamed with Republican Senators to continue the practice of Senatorial Courtesy.

He played junior football for Parkhead before turning professional with Football League Second Division club Woolwich Arsenal in 1901. After just one season in England, he returned to Scotland, where he played in the Scottish League for Airdrieonians, Third Lanark and, from 1904, for Aberdeen. He remained associated with Aberdeen for ten years, as player, reserve team coach, and official. In addition, he made occasional appearances for Queen's Park, Ayr Parkhouse, Heart of Midlothian, Hibernian and Montrose. Edgar was president of Montrose F.C. for three years in the early 1920s, and was active in sports administration in the Montrose area, where he and his wife had settled. In 1929, the couple emigrated to Canada. Life and career Edgar played as an inside forward for Glasgow- based junior club Parkhead, and made occasional appearances as a junior for Scottish League clubs including Queen's Park and Ayr Parkhouse, and for Heart of Midlothian's East of Scotland League team. While a Parkhead player, he was selected by the Scottish Junior Football Association to represent the association against their Irish counterparts in Belfast in March 1899. In October 1901 – dubbed \\"perhaps the most brilliant junior forward in Scotland at the present time\\" – Edgar moved to England where he signed for Second Division club Woolwich Arsenal. He made his Football League debut that same month, against Gainsborough Trinity, and kept his place for a few matches before losing it first to Isaac Owens and then to Walter Anderson. He finished the season with ten Football League appearances, scoring once, in a 1–1 draw with Blackpool, and played seven times in other competitions. He then returned to Scotland. In August 1903 he joined Airdrieonians, newly elected to the Scottish League First Division. He moved on to Third Lanark, and in November 1904, signed for Aberdeen of the Second Division. He was recommended to the club by team captain Duncan McNichol, who had played with him at Woolwich Arsenal. He made his first league appearance for Aberdeen on 3 December against St Bernard's, playing at centre forward in place of Augustus Lowe, who was unwell. He had a poor game, but scored – according to the Dundee Football Post, after 17 minutes of the second half, \\"Edgar, who had done nothing up till now, headed into the net\\" – but the match was abandoned because of bad light with a few minutes left to play. His official senior debut came the following week, at home to Hamilton Academicals; Aberdeen lost, and the Courier found Edgar no better at inside right than he was in the centre. Despite such an apparently unpromising start, Edgar played 14 league games in 1904–05, in which Aberdeen finished seventh in the Second Division and were elected to the First Division for 1905–06. Over the next two seasons, he contributed six goals from 31 league games, and became a popular member of the team. He was reinstated as an amateur in September 1909, and played four matches for Hibernian as a triallist, before returning to Aberdeen. He remained with the club for ten years as player, coach to the reserve team, and honorary official, and an Evening Express editorial stated that \\"If any man deserved a benefit for services rendered to the Aberdeen Football Club, that man is John Edgar. For years he was a prominent wearer of the black and gold, and at present successfully manages the reserve team. His popularity with players and public alike was fully demonstrated last night, when the match on his behalf took place\\". The benefit match in question, between teams of current and former Aberdeen players and refereed by the beneficiary himself, attracted a crowd of 5,000 spectators and raised £100. Edgar was for three years president of Montrose F.C., a club for which he formerly played. During his tenure, the club won the Scottish Qualifying Cup and the Forfarshire Cup, both in the 1921–22 season. He stepped down for business reasons in 1923. He and his wife settled in the Montrose area, where he was active in other fields of sporting organisation, as president of the Rossie Athletic Club, captain of Montrose South Links Golf Club, and member of the Montrose Highland Gathering Committee. In 1929, Edgar and his wife emigrated to Canada.

Life and career Edgar was born in Aldershot, Hampshire, the son of Scottish footballer Dave Edgar. His father settled in County Durham after playing for Darlington, and Edgar began his senior career in that county. He played for Bishop Auckland during their run to the 1951 Amateur Cup final, but was omitted from the final itself. He was reported to have picked up a late injury, but Edgar himself suggested otherwise, never played for the club again, and continued his career with nearby Ferryhill Athletic. He played his only League football in the Third Division North for his father's former club, Darlington, whom he joined from Ferryhill in 1954. Sunderland had at one time been interested in signing him, but his father advised him to continue his education rather than taking the risk of a career in professional football, so he trained as a schoolteacher and worked in local primary schools. Edgar died in Hurworth-on-Tees, County Durham, in 2006 at the age of 75.

It has a peaked roof with brown shingles and yellow trim on top. In front are flower beds; it has a yellow sign with fancy text headed \\"Yellowknife's Original School\\" at left and a wooden door of vertical boards in the middle. Behind it is a tree and part of two larger modern buildings. The first building used as a school in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, Canada, is currently located on Franklin (50th) Avenue at the south end of New Town, the city's downtown section. It is a small log cabin dating to the mid-1930s. It was designated a City of Yellowknife Heritage Site in 1998, and listed on the Canadian Register of Historic Places in 2004. Originally built by a local gold mining company, it was repurposed as a school in 1938, as the city's population had grown rapidly enough to require a school. Yellowknife Education District No. 1 was created to manage the school; its school board was the first democratically elected government body in the territory. Even with a 20-member student body, it was small enough that classes had to be held in two sessions; they were often interrupted by passing miners gawking or mistaking the building for a bar. After two years, the new district moved to larger quarters to accommodate a growing population, and eventually the district was able to build its own school. the log cabin then became a laundry and private residence in later years before being offered to the city as a historical site. In 1987, the building was moved from its original location in Old Town to its present location on Mildred Hall elementary school property where it has since been restored to provide tours of early education in Yellowknife. It is currently closed to the public; eventual plans are to use it as a museum of Yellowknife's early educational history. Building The building is located on the west side of Franklin (50th) Avenue opposite 54th Street, at the south end of downtown Yellowknife, known locally as New Town. It is in between the offices of Yellowknife Education District No. 1 and Mildred Hall School, both of which are set further back from the street. On the east side of Franklin is the modern high-rise Yellowknife campus of Aurora College. To the north along Franklin is the city's main business district, with more modern high-rise buildings including several of Yellowknife's tallest. Hotels line the street for several blocks to the south. Along the west side, the school complex gives way to residential neighbourhoods around 57th Street. The surrounding terrain is generally level, as the high ground of about in elevation at the crest of the rise from Yellowknife Bay of Great Slave Lake 1 km (1.6 miles) to the east and the smaller Frame Lake to the west. A chainlink fence sets off the building itself and its short concrete walk from the sidewalk. It is a log cabin, , one storey high on a concrete foundation topped by a shingled hipped roof. Two small planters and a low wooden stoop are in front. alt=An angle of the building showing its corner, with a side visible and bare trees in the background The main entrance is in the centre of the east (front) facade; it is set with a door of untreated vertical board and padlocked. The bay to its west has a wooden interpretive plaque where a window was once located. On the south facade there is a horizontal double-hung sliding sash window with six square panes on the west and four on the east set in a plain wooden surround. On the opposite side is a single six-pane casement window with the same wooden surround and wooden paneling covering the logs below. The west (rear) facade also has a single window. A narrow plain frieze at the end of the eave sets off the roofline. History Gold had been discovered in the area of what became Yellowknife around the turn of the 20th century. But the quantities were too small to warrant serious exploration. A small settlement grew in the 1920s around the fuel caches left by bush pilots, who used it as a staging area for flights further north. That changed with the discovery of more significant and accessible deposits in the area's greenstone belts in 1935. Within Yellowknife became a boomtown, its population reaching a thousand within a couple of years. Most development was concentrated along the peninsula projecting into Yellowknife Bay, the area today known as Old Town. \\"Life there is rough, lusty and loud,\\" reported Life magazine in 1938, \\"but it is also businesslike ... There is civic agitation for a public school.\\" That opinion had been expressed by a local newspaper, which editorialized that a school was \\"[one of] the first necessities of any organized community ... This situation requires immediate attention.\\"Silke, 2 By November, as the area's long, cold and dark winter was beginning, Yellowknife's citizens took action. A provisional school board was established, and CDN$1,000 ($ today) raised from a combination of local contributions and a federal government grant. Informal classes began at the end of January 1939. They were held at first in one resident's home; another resident, D.A. Davies, volunteered to teach them. Both building and teacher were meant as temporary measures until a dedicated building and a qualified teacher could be found. The former, a log cabin built by two local men the year before for use as a bunkhouse and kitchen, was rented from its owner, the Mining Corporation of Canada, as classes began. At the end of February 1939, Davies was replaced by Mildred Hall, a teacher certified in Alberta who had expressed interest in the position when the school was established but had been prevented from travelling north to Yellowknife from her Fitzgerald home due to the winter conditions until then. Hall faced challenging conditions in the cabin. It did not have enough space for all her 20 students, so classes were held in shifts. To keep it warm in temperatures as cold as it was necessary to keep all the windows and doors closed; letting in fresh air invariably chilled the building and its occupants. Its location, on what is now Pilots Lane, next to paths to Glamour Alley, as Yellowknife's bar district was known at the time, meant that drunken miners and prospectors would often gawk through the windows as they passed by, interrupting classes. \\"Once,\\" Hall recalled later, \\"two illuminated miners appeared in the doorway and wanted to buy a drink.\\"Silke, 4 The teacher faced educational challenges as well. Older students, who had often foregone a year or two of schooling since their families moved to Yellowknife, had to be brought up to the appropriate grade level, despite the lack of textbooks. Younger ones had to be kept busy and educated, similarly without any of the materials a teacher would usually have. In springtime, as the ice on the lake melted enough for floatplanes to come through, those shortcomings were remedied as teaching materials and textbooks were delivered. The lengthening days and Hall's growing rapport with her students helped improve matters further, and at the end of the school year, a graduation ceremony was held for the 12 students who had completed their education; each received a silver dollar. Yellowknife had established a school; now it needed to make it last. Near the end of the summer, as World War II loomed, the three-member provisional school board yielded to a formal board. It was the first democratically elected local government body in the history of the Northwest Territories. A little over a month later, they formally established what is now Yellowknife Education District No. 1 and enacted a six-mill property tax to replace the lotteries and donations that had previously funded the school. Classes began in September again, in the log cabin, with 21 students. Hall surveyed the students with an eye toward how a larger building might better meet their needs, and by the end of the year a larger bunkhouse had been found and rented. This building was large enough to partition living quarters for Hall separate from the classroom (she had not, however, lived in the original building, as is sometimes believed). After the school moved to a larger building, the cabin went through a variety of other uses. At first it was a laundry. Later owners lived there, or used it for storage. In 1987 it was sold to the city government, realizing its importance, decided to make efforts to preserve it, and move it from Old Town to the Abe Miller Centre on 53rd Street. In 1998 the city designated it a Heritage Building; two years later it was moved to its present location in front of the elementary school named after Hall and the district offices. In 2006 the cabin made the Canadian Register of Historic Places. Two years after that women in the Red Hat Society put in the planters and fence, making plans to restore some period furniture to the interior and open it as a living museum, with one member playing Hall in period dress.

The union was created in the western United States, and eventually expanded throughout the United States and Canada. The union was known for its militant measures in dealing with opposing forces, and firm in its opposition to the politics that existed in the country during the Cold War. The Mine Mill union was very active politically from the 1930s to the 1960s, when it merged with the United Steelworkers. Ironically, the principles that the union supported in the workplace often clashed with popular ideology found in the home and community. The philosophies of the union often mirrored communism, and some of its leaders were believed to be members of the Communist Party. Just as the nation struggled with the idea of communism in the 1920s, unions were faced with philosophical treatment of those in positions of power. Reid Robinson, IUMMSW president appointed communists to union positions of authority. Anticommunist members called for Robinson to resign in 1947, but were aggravated when they learned that Maurice Travis, a communist, would succeed him. Travis eventually left the party to comply with specifications of the Taft-Hartley Act, but his activities were heavily scrutinized by Senator Joseph McCarthy and his investigators. By the 1950s, the International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers had achieved establishment of approximately 300 locals, with about 37,000 total members in the United States and Canada. Although all locals had some common goals, such as establishing ways to ensure that all workers are treated fairly, each local dealt with issues specific to that group. The Cold War During the McCarthy era, Americans were very suspicious of communist sympathizers in the midst. The senator and his followers created fear and panic as they accused Americans of having communist ties, and they tried and punished them for these beliefs. The Taft-Hartley Act of 1947 gave the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) the power to spy on suspected communists. This included tapping phones and other surveillance measures. It also required that union officials remain clear of the communist party and sign statements saying that they were not members. The Smith Act of 1948 gave the government the power to indict suspected Communists and the McCarran Act of 1950 established internment camps where those who did not comply could be held. These powerful measures created an atmosphere of fear, and Mine Mill’s leaders' ties to the communist beliefs caused debate inside and outside of the union. Mine Mill leaders in the United States (Philip Murray) and Canada (Aaron Mosher) were both conservatives with a leaning to communist beliefs. During this anti-communist movement among unions, leaders of the United Steel Workers of America (USWA) were encouraged by the CIO to infiltrate the Mine Mill organization and take over its membership. Throughout its history, USWA attempted to steal away Mine Mill members, often using communism as a dividing factor. In 1950, the Congress of Industrial Organization (CIO) expelled eleven member unions that did not conform to their political standards, including the International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers (IUMMSW). The CIO leaders assumed that the Mine Mill and other unions’ members could be persuaded to leave their existing affiliations and join with more mainstream groups, but there was not a rush of Mine Mill members to move. The CIO and the Steelworkers groups, who expected to benefit from an exodus, failed to recognize the loyalty of the western mine workers who did not respond to the propaganda that had been sent their way. Miners in Montana, for example, were more concerned with the Anaconda Copper Mining Company as a threat than they were threatened by communism. They trusted Mine Mill to continue to secure benefits for them. During the McCarthy era, labor leaders like Harvey Murphy came under scrutiny, but the unions maintained a loyal following. Communist ties of Mine Mill officers caused concern for Americans inside the union, in other unions and the CIO, and those not connected to unions. In order to ensure that labor leaders complied with laws against their membership in the communist party, leaders were required to sign affidavits renouncing any communist ties. Leaders of the Mine Mill Union opposed signing the affidavits based on First Amendment grounds, but eventually they complied. Secretary/Treasurer Maurice Travice publicly renounced his association with the Communist Party, but several of Mine Mill leaders were convicted of falsifying their Taft-Hartley affidavits. James L. Daugherty, the union’s chief negotiator, refused to sign an affidavit, and he appealed to the president to stop the indictments against communist sympathizers. Leaders who reluctantly signed the affidavits were later called on charges of falsifying the documents. Communist Ties In Mine Mill Union Distrust was in the atmosphere, and the CIO supported several articles, flyers and radio broadcasts aimed to weaken the Mine Mill’s position with its members in the 1940s and 1950s. One article, appearing in Maclean’s Magazine, added fuel to the anti-communist fire. Author Pierre Berton reported that Mine Mill smelter workers were producing a dangerous component used in the making of bombs, under the direction of Harvey Murphy. This “heavy water” report, “How a Red Union Bosses Atomic Workers at Trail BC,” was untrue, but damaged the union’s reputation. Murphy and other union communist sympathizers were not the only targets of the McCarthy Committee. Many Hollywood figures, including actors, directors, producers and musicians, were called out and accused of un- American acts. A renowned singer, Paul Robeson, was among those suspected of practicing communist acts. He would play a significant role in helping restore Mine Mill’s public image. The Peace Arch Concerts The Mine Mill leaders became involved in organizing a series of annual concerts that took place between 1952 and 1955 on the United States/Canada border at Vancouver. The events drew thousands of fans of the singer/activist, even when the government plotted to shut him down. Paul Robeson was a man of many talents, some of which earned him a football scholarship to Rutgers University. He spoke several languages and he studied political science, forming distinct opinions about communism. He is best known, however, for his emotion-packed singing of “Ole Man River” in the musical, Showboat. (2) He was a popular speaker, and his messages promoted freedom and harmony among all people. Robeson, however, was outspoken about his beliefs, which angered the anti-communist watchdogs. He ignored advice to edit his public statements, praising the Soviets for their achievements and criticizing President Harry Truman for involving the United States in the Korean War. He openly criticized American policies, and the State Department had a thick file on him. Communist sympathizers like Robeson were at risk of being targeted by politicians and anti-communist activists. Although Robeson had a large following in Canada, the American government limited his ability to reach his fans by pulling his passport in 1950, restricting his travel. Robeson’s outspoken ways angered anti-communists in both the United States and Canada, and in February 1952 authorities prevented him from appearing in person at a conference sponsored by the Mine Mill leaders. Murphy then promoted another concert to take place in May at the US/Canada border in Blaine, Washington. Murphy had a plan to work around the travel restrictions, and his project became known as the Peace Arch Concerts. Murphy reasoned that although Robeson could not cross the border, they could stand on either side and see activities going on. Murphy arranged for a flatbed truck to be positioned on the American side with Paul using it as a stage as he sang into a phone. A phone line on the other side transmitted the sound of his voice to speakers on the Canadian side. Although the sound quality was somewhat compromised, the passion of his voice and the messages came through clearly. Robeson received a mixed response to his performance: some were angry and some were pleased that he had circumvent the restrictions placed on his travel. Many of the delegates in attendance equated the performance to a victory for personal freedom. The concerts brought positive media attention to the Mine Mill union and to Robeson. The show of support included about 40,000 people in attendance (2), and news of the concert reached tens of thousands via media.

The show of support included about 40,000 people in attendance, and news of the concert reached tens of thousands via media. Women’s Roles Women became vulnerable when strikes threatened their survival. Their opinions about union activities were strong, and sometimes contrasted with those of their husbands. In the post-World War II era, working-class families wanted more of a stake in their country, including company profits. Strikes against companies provided union members with a way to challenge, but every strike was a gamble. In order to demand high wages and better benefits, workers went without pay during these strikes—and few could afford the lost income. The USWA took advantage of the situation with Local 117 in Montana using the hardships suffered during strikes to get the attention of strikers, wives and families. The USWA emphasized the importance that union families should live as good Americans, an anti-communist lifestyle. Union family members all had a stake in the union’s activities and wives of the union members often formed support groups associated with the locals. During strikes, women actively supported the union efforts by picketing with the men, fundraising for funds to feed families during the strikes, cooking in strike kitchens and in whatever way necessary, but they had no voice in union decisions. Women formed auxiliary groups to support union locals, but the auxiliaries were independent in organization. When Mary Orlich publicly attacked the Mine Mill’s communist ties in her auxiliary presidential platform in 1947, the union was powerless to stop her. She told American women that red unionism threatened their lifestyles, which divided women in their support of the union. Montana union members accused her of meddling and called her disloyal. Merger The Mine Mill Union, despite its former strength, finally agreed to a merger with USWA in the 1960s. The ongoing communist leanings of the Mine Mill leaders became unfavorable, and community opposition factored into changes in the members’ positions. Where the union members’ loyalty to Mine Mill was once strong, economic issues lured them to join with the steelworkers. The strength of the USWA negotiations was demonstrated in the wages received by its members. In 1962, the Anaconda local 117 left Mine Mill to join with the steelworkers, and the loss of this local was the beginning of the end for Mine Mill. (3) The USWA had many advantages in recruiting and showed strength in numbers. Despite years of resistance, the two unions merged in 1967. Local 598 in Sudbury, Ontario, which had a contentious and sometimes violent history with the city's Steelworkers locals,\\"Fighting the good fight: Homer Seguin tells his story\\" , Northern Life, October 15, 2008. northernlife.ca voted against the merger. It remained the last autonomous remnant of Mine Mill until 1993, when it merged with the Canadian Auto Workers.

History  The first Flower Mart was held in 1911 in Mount Vernon Place around the Washington Monument, in the Mount Vernon area of Baltimore, MD. It was founded by a non-profit organization known as the Women’s Civic League, which is an organization run by women looking to better Baltimore for its citizens. The original mission of the festival was to encourage the growing of flowers and vegetables in home back and fronts yards, as well as on vacant lots.\\"To Conduct Flower Market,\\" 13 April 1911, The Baltimore Sun; \\"Flower Mart Today,\\" 9 May 1911, The Baltimore Sun. This idea was among many of the goals of the City Beautiful movement in the United States, which encouraged beautifying and fostering more healthy living conditions in urban centers. The Flower Mart is held each year at the beginning of May. Participants and vendors at the Flower Mart offer gardening tips, sell plants and seedlings, and other gardening- related goods. Along with vendors are various forms of live entertainment and edible treats for guests to enjoy, such as its traditional lemon sticks. The Flower Mart has produced many annual traditions. In 2000 the Women’s Civic League decided not to continue their management of the festival, and the event was taken on by the non-profit Flower Mart at Mount Vernon Place, Ltd.Jamie Stiehm, \\"Tradition still blooms during Flower Mart,\\" 17 May 2000, The Baltimore Sun, 3B. They declared to keep the traditional aspects of the Flower Mart, including its location in Mount Vernon Place. In 2019 the non-profit Mount Vernon Place Conservancy, which manages the Washington Monument and surrounding parks squares of Mount Vernon Place, took over the management of the event. The Conservancy intends to refocus the event on its original \\"greening\\" mission, as well as support Baltimore-based vendors.  Location  The annual Baltimore Flower Mart is held in Mount Vernon Place, in the Mount Vernon neighborhood of Baltimore. It has become a tradition since 1911 for the festival to be held in front of the Washington Monument, allowing guest to participate in the festival and to visit shops, restaurants, and museums in the Mount Vernon area. There have been 11 times when the Flower Mart was not held in Mount Vernon. It was canceled from 1939 to 1945 during World War II. Throughout the late 1960s through the early 1970s, the festival was moved from Mount Vernon Place to Charles Center due to the Baltimore Riots. In 1994, the members of the Women's Civic League voted to move the Flower Mart from Mount Vernon Place to the War Memorial Plaza. In May 1995, the 79th annual spring festival was held in War Memorial Plaza, welcoming new guest to the tradition. After the festival was cancelled in 1996, due to discrepancies within the league, the Flower Mart returned to Mount Vernon Place.Alvarez, Rafael. \\"Flower Mart Canceled for 1996 Apathy, Infighting Cited in Decision by Civic League.\\" The Baltimore Sun 14 Mar. 1996: n. pag.

History Each member first came to the public's attention as a member of another band (Clem Burke in Blondie, Glen Matlock in the Sex Pistols, James Stevenson in Chelsea, Generation X and Gene Loves Jezebel, Gary Twinn in Supernaut and Twenty Flight Rockers).The International Swingers, Vive le Rock, p. 26, September 2013 During their career, the four musicians became well known to each other, all of them had already worked together in different capacities, but never all in the same group at the same time. In 2011, Australian promoter Bicci Henderson suggested Gary formed a new band for a tour there, instead of a reformed Supernaut. Gary contacted James, Clem and Glen, then during rehearsals and the Australian tour they got along well and The International Swingers continued. In 2012 through 2014 the band performed tours in the United States and in 2013 a sold out show in London. Initially they played a set of the greatest hits of all the bands they had been in, but soon they began writing new songs for The International Swingers, like \\"FBI\\" (included in the soundtrack of the film Homefront), \\"Gun Control\\" (about gun politics in the United States, originally a Twenty Flight Rockers song entitled \\"Guns for Sale\\") and \\"Live Wire\\". Via PledgeMusic, the band raised the money to record their first full-length self-titled album, The International Swingers (originally under the working title Whatever Works Now). The album was recorded at Studio 606 in LA which is owned by the Foo Fighters. It was then mixed by Peter Walsh who has worked with Simple Minds, Pulp and most recently Scott Walker. Members =Clem Burke= Clem Burke Clem Burke is best known as the drummer for the band Blondie from 1975, shortly after the band formed, throughout the band's entire career, including the reunion and extensive 2009 - 2011 tour.

In 1987 and also later in 2004, he stood in as drummer for the Ramones (under the name \\"Elvis Ramone\\").From the film End of the Century: The Story of the Ramones Glen Matlock Clem was inducted in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2006 along with his other Blondie bandmates. In July 2011, he received an honorary doctorate from the University of Gloucestershire, as a result of his drumming project that analyses the physical and psychological effects of drumming. =Glen Matlock= Glen Matlock is best known as the bass guitarist in the original line-up of the punk rock band the Sex Pistols. He is credited as a co-author on 10 of the 12 songs on Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols. He left the band in 1977, and went on to form the Rich Kids, a new wave power pop band. He also worked with Iggy Pop (album Soldier), The Damned (album Not of This Earth), and Robert Gordon. He rejoined the original Sex Pistols members for reunion tours in 1996, 2002, 2003, 2007 and 2008.

He was known to family and friends as Reb Mendele of Ger. His mother, Mrs. Tzina Pesa, died when Pinchas Menachem was young. Orphaned of his mother, he was brought up by his grandparents, Rabbi Yitzchak Meir Alter (known as the Chiddushei Harim) and his wife. When he was about nine years old, his grandfather took him to visit the Kotzker Rebbe, an event which left a lifelong impression on him. He married Hendel Lea, daughter of his uncle Abraham Mordechai Alter, in 1864.“Beit Yaakov” magazine \\", No. 115, Kislev, 1969, p. 22-21 Justman published the fifth printed edition of the Jerusalem Talmud, at Piotrkow from 1899 to 1903, with the commentary of Rabbi Yaakov Dovid Wilovsky (Ridbaz).  Leadership  In 1905 when his brother-in-law, the second Gerrer rebbe—Rabbi Yehudah Aryeh Leib Alter died, some of the Hasidim sought to bestow the mantle of leadership upon him. He moved out of Gora Kalwaria to Pilica or Piltz as it was known by the Hasidim and become their Rebbe. He added the name Eleazar to his name Pinchas Menachem when he was very ill, on 23 Tammuz 5672 (8 July 1912). Eventually he recovered from his illness. In 1915 he moved to Wieruszów and four years later he moved to Częstochowa. Death and burial He died on Shabbat 10th of Kislev 5681 (21 November 1920) in Częstochowa. His funeral was held on Monday because of a disagreement between the Community of Pilz and the Community of Częstochowa regarding the burial place. Eventually he was buried in the Jewish cemetery of Częstochowa, next to his son Yitzchak Meir who died a year earlier. The sixth Rebbe of Ger was named Pinchas Menachem by his father Rabbi Avraham Mordechai Alter—after his beloved uncle Rabbi Pinchas Menachem Justman. He wrote a commentary on Torah, called Sifsei Tzadik, which was published after his death by his son Rabbi Enoch Gad Justman and Rabbi Menachem Mendel Alter of Pabianice, son of the Sfas Emes. His commentary on the Talmud and Psalms disappeared at some point during the Holocaust.  Family  Justman’s first wife Hendel Leah (Alter), gave birth to six daughters and three sons.

It serves to establish direct connection between GSM network and VoIP.  Usage concept  Sim-card is put into GSM-gateways (or SIM-bank connected to GSM-gateway) in order to register it with the GSM network, at the same time the gateway is connected with VoIP through program switch. Accordingly the traffic can be converted in and out between GSM and VoIP channels. SIP and H.323 protocols are used for media traffic termination. GoIP equipment is compatible with all main IP PBX: Asterisk, Mera, Oktell, 3CX etc. In comparison with PSTN, GSM-gateways provide drastic economy by amending the infrastructure and lowering the expenditures on technical support. GoIP includes an integral support of SIP and H.323 protocols with flexible settings. Duplex authentification of password and trust-list back-up will significantly decreases telecommunication expenditures, while maintaining an adaptable system of call transfer. Precisely, GoIP gateway supports the groups of several devices, with flexible settings of large GSM-gateways groups with different numbers of channels. = There are several models of GoIP GSM- gateways = * 1 Port GSM VoIP Gateway, * 4 Port GSM VoIP Gateway, * 8 Port GSM VoIP Gateway, * 16 Port GSM VoIP Gateway, * 32 Port GSM VoIP Gateway. * 64 Ports GSM VoIP Gateway, Applications of GoIP gateways: They are vastly usable by system integrators, TCP, call-centers, large and little companies and domestic users of VoIP as well. VoIP-GSM gateways produced on GoIP platform help to accomplish the following: Adding the mobile lines in the existing telephone system (GoIP provides GSM network between telephone systems and IP PBX, and ensures the fast connection to PSTN where usual telephone lines are unavailable) Organization of outbound call-centers Call transfer from GSM into SIP and backward (inbound and outbound calls between GSM and VoIP) = Determination of SIM-bank = SIM-bank is a SIM-card controller that provides remote control over VoIP GSM-gateways and allows to simplify and automatize many procedures likewise: \\\\- fast connection of SIM-cards to the gateway, rapid exchange of SIM-cards via Internet and their prearranged synchronous replacement. The cooperative use of GoIP gateways and GoIP SIM-bank enables management of unmanned devices and reduces the work pressure in SIM-cards operations, for example: SIM-cards replacement and replenishment. = The remote access advantages for SIM-cards = central management of SIM-cards, their dynamic allocation, no need to change or reinsert the SIM-card in the device, rapid replacement of SIM-cards with no breakdowns in service. For instance, the remote GoIP gateway will no longer require the replacement of SIM-cards in the device or their reinsertion. One can manage the group of GoIP gateways remotely, effectively and with minimal loss with the help of a SIM- bank. The main advantages of SIM-bank appliance include 1) the replacement of SIM-cards in gateways channels that are territorially remote from the very SIM-bank and other gateways in order to transfer the SIM-cards between the base stations of GSM operator and 2) autonomous work that supports from 32 to 128 channels for SIM-cards independent connections.

Biography  He was born into a noble military family. His father, Joseph Guillaume Debelle (1779-1816), was a Captain in the Grande Armée. After 1816, Alexandre was raised by his uncle, César Alexandre Debelle (Baron de Gachetière), who became his guardian.Brief biography @ the Bibliothèque Dauphinoise. He originally studied law at the University of Grenoble. In 1830, he decided that he would rather be an artist and studied with , Curator of art at the Museum of Grenoble. Originally a landscape artist, he devoted himself to natural scenes, with and without structures, from throughout the Dauphiné. He later published a four-volume album of lithographs as a tourist guide to the area. In addition to his early studies, he also worked with Antoine-Jean Gros and Camille Roqueplan but, in 1832, failed to qualify for admission to the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris. He returned home and exhibited at the Salon there. Finally, in 1837, he was able to exhibit at the Louvre and moved back to Paris, where he continued to exhibit until 1848. After 1839, he switched mostly to history painting; primarily scenes from the Revolutionary period. These would become his best-known works. In 1853, upon Rolland's retirement, he was appointed Curator at the Museum of Grenoble and remained there until 1887, when he was eighty-two years old. While there, he promoted the work of local artists; including Jacques Gay, Jean Achard, Henri Blanc-Fontaine, and Théodore Ravanat. In the 1860s, he was able to travel extensively throughout the Mediterranean region, producing several paintings of North Africa. From 1870 to 1872, he and librarian organized the museum's move to a new building, designed by Charles-Auguste Questel (now known as the Musée-bibliothèque de Grenoble).

In 2014, the Indian Railways announced plans to develop Bhushi Dam as a tourist resort with participation from the private sector. Bhushi reservoir History The dam was built in the late 1860s for the Great Indian Peninsular Railway as a source of water for their steam engines. it is owned by the Central Railway zone of the Indian Railways, the successor to the Great Indian Peninsular Railway. Water was carried from the reservoir to Lonavala, Khandala and the reversing station of the railways by cast-iron pipes. The Railway company later agreed to supply some water to the town of Lonavala as well, because the dam had been built using Municipal funding. In 2011, the Indian Navy proposed to take over the Bhushi dam and Bhugaon lake for its training activities at the Indian Naval Station Shivaji which is located in the vicinity. The Lonavala Police stated that such a move would restrict the access of the public to the dam. In 2012, the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) proposed to construct a long tunnel along the Mumbai Pune Expressway which would pass right below the Bhushi dam. Accidents The Bhushi Dam frequently sees cases of drowning. A 2012 report stated that as many as 25 people had died in a five-year period. In order to bring down these accidents, the Lonavala Police and the railways set up a control room near the dam, as well as imposed a ban on consumption of liquor in areas surrounding the dam. Subsequently, vehicles were banned from entering the area after 3 pm and visitors were prohibited from entering the dam and the surrounding areas after 5 pm. Tourists are usually allowed to visit the dam from 9 am up to 3 pm. Except local buses, all other buses are banned from entering the area.

Pauline Marie Ghislaine de Bassano, née van der Linden d'Hooghvorst (23 September 1814 in Meise – 9 December 1867), was a French courtier. She served as dame d'honneur to Empress Eugénie de Montijo in 1853–1867. Life She was born to the Belgian politician Emmanuel van der Linden d'Hoogvorst. In 1843, she married the French diplomat Napoléon Hugues Charles Marie Ghislain Maret de Bassano, 3rd Duc de Bassano. Her mother-in- law, Marie Madeleine Lejéas-Carpentier, had been dame du palais to the Empresses Josephine and Marie-Louise. =Court career= In 1853, her spouse was appointed chamberlain to Emperor Napoleon III of France, and she appointed Dame d'honneur to the Empress. The ladies-in-waiting of the new Empress consisted of a Grand-Maitresse or senior lady-in-waiting, the Princesse d'Essling; a Dame d'honneur or deputy, the Duchesse de Bassano, who both attended court on grand functions; and six (later twelve) Dame du Palais, who were selected from among the acquaintances to the Empress prior to her marriage, and who alternated in pairs fullfilling the daily duties.Carette Madame: Recollections of the court of the Tuileries (1890) It belonged to her task to receive the applications from the women wishing to be presented at court, instruct them in etiquette, approve them and finally present them, which was an important part of the Imperial protocol of representation. She also supervised the other female courtiers. Alongside the princesse d'Essling, de Bassano had a very visible public position as it belonged to her duty to accompany the empress at all grander representational public events. Being a public figure who dealt with those wishing admission to the court, she is also frequently depicted in contemporary memoirs.

His 1975 work, The Swabian Kreis: Institutional Growth in the Holy Roman Empire, 1648-1715, established Vann among a group of young scholars whose new vision of the historical Holy Roman Empire challenged classical notions of that institution's viability and functionality. In his study of Württemberg, he rejected traditional ideas of state building as a conscious social determinism, but instead explained the evolution of a German state in terms of relations between and among the dukes and the courtiers, privy councilors and the general representative body of the Landtag. Since 1985, the James Allen Vann Seminar, continued in his honor, offers an informal venue for scholars, graduate students, and other interested parties from the Atlanta area to discuss scholarly papers on topics concerning pre-modern European history and the relations between early modern Europe and the rest of the world.Department of History.

The series began with the 1988 film Alien Nation, which was adapted into a Fox Network television series of the same name in 1989. Fox cancelled the series abruptly after one season, but continued the story in five TV movies. The series also produced other media and merchandising tie-ins, including novels and comics. Aside from the sci-fi angle, the franchise fits into many different genres including drama, police procedural and buddy cop. Setting The franchise is set in the near future in the United States. In 1991 a flying saucer crashes in the Mojave Desert containing a race of extraterrestrials, the Tenctonese, escaping from slavery under a cruel Overseer race. They resemble humans, but have certain anatomical differences (their erogenous zones are located on their backs and the males are the gender that deliver babies) and have been bred with greater physical strength and intelligence. These Newcomers, as they are called, are accepted as the latest immigrants to America, and the franchise explores issues around their integration into the multicultural society of the US. Film The franchise originated with the Alien Nation feature film, released by 20th Century Fox in 1988. It portrays alien refugees called Newcomers or Tenctonese integrating into human society in the Los Angeles area. The Newcomers, former slaves and overseers whose ship ran aground on Earth, attempt to make new lives for themselves on Earth. Combining elements of science fiction and police drama elements, the film stars Mandy Patinkin as Sam \\"George\\" Francisco, a new Newcomer detective in the Los Angeles Police Department, and James Caan as Matthew Sykes, George's initially reluctant human partner. Television The cast of the TV series In 1989, Fox adapted the film into a new television series, also called Alien Nation, for its burgeoning Fox Network. As with the film, the series follows the Newcomers, an alien race bred as slaves on a distant planet whose ship crashes on Earth. With their ship found to be irreparable, the authorities on Earth decide to settle the refugees in Los Angeles. Retaining the film's police drama format, the series stars Eric Pierpoint as George Francisco and Gary Graham as Matthew Sikes. Episodes explore themes of racism and the treatment of minority ethnic groups.Mann, George (2012) \\"Alien Nation\\". The Mammoth Encyclopedia of Science Fiction. Hachette. . Accessed on December 3, 2014. The series ran for one season of 21 episodes and a feature-length pilot episode, ending in 1990. Fox abruptly cancelled the series after the season. Beginning in 1994, the network continued the story in five TV movies, which brought back the entire cast. The installments include Dark Horizon (1994), Body and Soul (1995), Millennium (1996), The Enemy Within (1996), and The Udara Legacy (1997), the last two made back-to-back.Gross, Ed (1998).

Established in late 1915, the gendarmerie was operational from 1916 until 1928, during which time it was Haiti's only military force, earning a reputation for active interference in civilian government that may have set the stage for the future politicization of Haiti's armed forces. From 1918 to 1920 the Gendarmerie of Haiti fought the Second Caco War, one of the so-called \\"Banana Wars\\". It was reorganized as the Garde d'Haïti in 1928, forming the nucleus of what would evolve into the modern Haitian army. Early history =Formation= Smedley Butler, shown here wearing U.S. Marine Corps uniform in later life, was Haiti's first commandant of gendarmerie. The United States invaded Haiti in the last half of 1915. The invasion followed the violation of the French embassy in Port-au- Prince by a mob that seized Haitian president Vilbrun Guillaume Sam, who had earlier fled to the legation owing to popular unrest, and \\"mutilated his body in the street.\\" Admiral William Banks Caperton, leading the initial landing force, declared martial law and ordered the Haitian army dissolved. In the absence of functioning police, U.S. Marines assumed civilian law enforcement duties, but occupation authorities had already set into motion plans to raise a local police force with the Haitian–American Convention, obligating Haiti's American-established interim government to \\"create without delay an efficient constabulary, urban and rural.\\" The Gendarmerie of Haiti was formally established in December 1915. It became operational in February of the following year, with Smedley Butler (then a Marine Corps major) assuming the post of commandant of gendarmes and the Haitian rank of major general. Officers, non-commissioned officers, and enlisted personnel of the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps were initially placed in command of the force, holding officer commissions from the Haitian government while retaining their United States commissions and enlistment status. The process for commissioning of officers was set out in the Haitian–American Convention: Early attempts to establish an officer candidate school to train an indigenous officer corps from among Haiti's educated upper class failed due to a reluctance among potential candidates to be seen collaborating with the American occupation, and by the perception that the methods of American military instruction were demeaning. Enlisted gendarmes, meanwhile, were recruited from indigenous Haitians who were paid between $10 and $25 per month. The gendarmerie was equipped initially with the Krag–Jørgensen bolt-action rifle. Uniforms were surplus Marine Corps uniforms with plain buttons in lieu of buttons embossed with the Marine Corps Eagle, Globe, and Anchor. =Expanding role= gendarmerie sub-District headquarters at Gros-Morne, Artibonite pictured in the 1920s The gendarmerie quickly evolved into the cornerstone of the United States occupation, and gendarmerie officers had practical control over the U.S. client government of Philippe Sudré Dartiguenave; one visiting American observer noted that: \\"the actual running of the government comes pretty near being vested in General Butler and his young colonels and majors.\\" On one occasion, the Haitian ambassador to the United States balked at the idea of signing a Butler-inspired compact that would give the gendarmerie control of the nation's postal service. Butler forced the issue by placing an armed guard in President Dartiguenave's office, with instructions to compel Dartiguenave to telegraph the ambassador with orders to sign the agreement \\"or else\\". Even at the local level, junior officers were virtual \\"potentates\\", having not only military and police authority in their jurisdictions, but also being responsible to sit as judges in civil and criminal cases, to collect taxes, to manage prisons, to enforce weights and measures, to register vital statistics, and to audit the financial records of municipal governments. Interference by gendarmerie officers into local governmental affairs prompted Solon Ménos, the Haitian ambassador to the United States, to file a complaint with the U.S. State Department, observing that: \\"the American officers of the Haitian gendarmerie ... have extended their powers for the communal councils to such an extent that they wish to act as administrators of the commune and not rest within their powers.\\" Second Caco War =Conflict= A Haitian gendarme photographed by Harry A. Franck in 1920 Some gendarmerie actions, including the enforcement of government press censorship, and the use of conscripted civilian labor for infrastructure development, have been cited as factors leading to the Second Caco War (1918–20), a rebellion by Haitians against the occupation. The conflict erupted on October 17, 1918, with an attack by 100 rebel cacos on a gendarmerie barracks. The assault was repulsed with significant loss of life, and commanding officer Lieutenant Patrick Kelly earned Haiti's Médaille militaire and a promotion to captain for his role in the defense of the barracks. A wave of small-scale rebel attacks on isolated gendarmerie outposts followed; over a six-month period in 1919, the gendarmerie reported more than 130 engagements with cacos. The 1919 Battle of Port-au-Prince saw the first major action between gendarmes and rebels, and after-action dispatches reported the force acquitted itself well. The day following the Battle of Port-au-Prince, a contingent of 12 gendarmes under Lt. Kemp C. Christian overran the cacos base camp, killing 30 rebels and capturing their only field gun. Nonetheless, during this period, the gendarmerie was largely dependent on the U.S. Marine Corps to provide the \\"muscle\\" for its operations, though by the end of the rebellion gendarmerie units were beginning to operate independently. By 1919 an experimental gendamerie unit had been raised under the designation \\"Provisional Company A\\". Unlike the bulk of gendarmerie units, which garrisoned towns, Provisional Company A was a mobile force organized to conduct preventative patrols. Chesty Puller, then a gendarmerie officer, was given the captaincy of Provisional Company A. The company's executive officer, Lt. Augustin Brunot, was one of the first indigenous Haitians to receive a commission. By the time the Second Caco War ended in 1920, 75 gendarmes had been killed in action. =Aftermath= A headline in the Des Moines Register from 1920 announces the planned probe of U.S. Marine Corps and Haitian Gendarmerie activity during the Second Caco War. Following the war, the U.S. Senate's Select Committee on Haiti and Santo Domingo convened a series of hearings to investigate the behavior of gendarmes and marines during the conflict. Several indigenous Haitian gendarmes who were asked to submit testimony to the hearing alleged that gendarmerie officers had executed prisoners. One gendarme, Eucher Jean, stated that: Despite the sometimes gruesome testimony it was generally believed the hearings were politically motivated and that individual excesses could largely be traced only to Lang and Dorcas Williams, both of whom had been acting under the orders of a Marine Corps officer who had since been committed to an insane asylum. Both of the accused gendarmerie officers had been indicted by U.S. Navy court-martial prior to the hearings. A separate inquiry conducted by the Haitian government concluded that, outside of 10 killings attributed to Lang and Williams, the gendarmerie's conduct of the war had been justifiable. 1924 Olympics Haiti was represented at the 1924 Olympics by a rifle team composed entirely of indigenous gendarmes. The team won the bronze medal in the team free rifle event, which was the nation's first-ever Olympic medal. The team's expenses were paid for from a voluntary fund, with all of the nation's gendarmes contributing five percent of their salary for five months to finance it. Later history and influence In 1927 the gendarmerie was reporting a strength of 160 officers, 2,522 gendarmes and 551 rural policemen. Even at this late date only about 40 of the officers were Haitian, the majority being United States Marines and sailors. In 1928, the gendarmerie was reorganized as the Garde d'Haïti and became the nucleus of what would eventually evolve into the reconstituted Haitian army. The later politicization of the Haitian military has been attributed by some to Haiti's early experience with the Gendarmerie d'Haïti. The gendarmerie's special access to U.S. resources and influence vested in it a measure of social control within Haiti that would become institutionalized in later years. On the other hand, former Haitian President Prosper Avril has observed that Haiti already had a long tradition of military involvement in government prior to the occupation, with 25 of its 26 pre-occupation presidents being either military officers or leaders of rebel groups. Avril also contends the gendarmerie worked to instill a respect for political neutrality in its men.

Austin purchased The Carolina Times in 1927 and transformed it into an institution that aided African Americans in their fight for freedom and equality in North Carolina. He used a new approach to civil rights issues in Durham, incorporating lower and middle class blacks, unlike the moderate, accommodationist approach of the black elite in Durham during this time. Austin's unusual strategy of advocating for the majority of blacks to have a voice in society succeeded in galvanizing a broader segment of the African American community in Durham to act for social change. Austin's approach to black activism helped lay the groundwork for the modern Civil Rights Movement in Durham in the late 1950s and 1960s, which also encouraged lower-income blacks to become politically active. His strategies—which were once considered too radical by his peers—allowed Austin to maintain his influence in Durham well into the 1950s and 1960s. In doing so, Austin created a lasting impact for Durham. Early life Louis Austin was born in Enfield, North Carolina, a small town eighty-five miles east of Durham. He grew up in a period when African Americans were denied basic civil liberties, including the right to vote. Throughout Austin's childhood, his father William taught him to stand up for his rights. As a young adult, Austin was enraged about racial discrimination, and spoke out about these type of injustices at his school. As a result, his parents sent him to finish his high school education at the Joseph K. Brick School in Edgecombe County. Austin then attended the National Training School (now North Carolina Central University) in Durham, North Carolina. After graduating college, Austin worked for the North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company, a black-owned company based in Durham. History of the Black Press Since Freedom's Journal, the first black newspaper, was founded in 1827, the black press served as an outlet for African Americans to define their own identity, create a sense of unity, present events from a black perspective, highlight black achievements that the mainstream press ignore, and most importantly, work for black equality. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, Booker T. Washington, who was considered the preeminent spokesman for black America during this time period, shared his accommodationist political ideologies in the black press throughout the country. He wielded great power among the black press by clandestinely controlling advertisements, loans, and political subsidies. Many black newspapers at the time relied on Washington's financial support and therefore were obligated to write editorials that he favored. Myrdal defined the black press as an instrument of the \\"Negro upper classes\\" for spreading conservative values, and establishing group control and identity. =Significance in Durham= By the 1920s, black America came to a fork in the road and had to choose whether to accommodate white societal viewpoints or oppose them. W. E. B. Du Bois opposed the white mainstream point of view. Durham was a microcosm of this national black debate, and black elites in Durham were champions of Washington's accommodationist strategy. The newspaper published by the North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company, owned by Charles Clinton Spaulding, a leading member of the black elite in Durham, was quite open about the company's determination to resist W. E. B. Du Bois's call for an aggressive challenge to white rule. Louis Austin began working at The Carolina Times in 1921, when it was called The Standard Advertiser. Upon joining the paper, he made it clear that he was committed to writing articles that were closely aligned with Du Bois' approach. Austin bought The Times in 1927, with the help of a loan from Durham's black-owned Mechanics and Farmers Bank. During the early twentieth century, black journalists like Austin played an essential role in the struggle for black equality in America. Austin worked as editor for the Times until his death in 1971. Austin's Civil Rights Activism =The Carolina Times= Louis Austin worked tirelessly to shape The Carolina Times into a vehicle for change for the African American community. He used the paper to reenergize the civil rights activism. African Americans who lived in Durham and the surrounding areas relied on their weekly subscription to inform them of issues that impacted the African American community. The paper's motto was \\"The Truth Unbridled\\", because Austin's mission was to provide North Carolinian African Americans the unadulterated truth about contemporary situations and events. Austin's honest and straightforward approach gave him credibility and strong support in Durham, North Carolina and throughout the state. During a time period when Jim Crow laws ruled the South, and white supremacy was prevalent, Austin understood that it was necessary to directly confront the problems African Americans were facing and provided a voice for these problems. The Carolina Times was influential as it created an open dialogue amongst blacks in Durham, surrounding areas in North Carolina, and throughout the nation. Austin's New Strategy Louis Austin worked towards achieving racial equality for blacks, regardless of their socio- economic status, by approaching discriminatory policies with a new, confrontational strategy. Austin shared the political philosophies of Du Bois and Frederick Douglass, both of whom advocated protest as a political tool in the struggle for equal rights. He realized that confrontation and defiance, not civility and accommodation, were needed to break white supremacy's stronghold in the South. The civil rights movement in Durham during the early 1900s was controlled by wealthy blacks, primarily Spaulding and James Shepherd, president of North Carolina College for Negroes (now known as North Carolina Central University). These black elites were known as the \\"Big Negroes;\\" they were intent on maintaining peaceful race relations in Durham and did not want to promote campaigns that would upset powerful white people in Durham and throughout the country. Confrontational policies would agitate race relations in North Carolina and jeopardize the businesses and enterprises these \\"Big Negroes\\" controlled; therefore, they saw no benefit pursuing policies in that interfered with a system in which they were economically and somewhat socially comfortable. The direction toward which the black elite steered the civil rights movement was based on their own economic self- interests. These were not representative of the majority of the black community in Durham who were unemployed due to racial inequalities and unable to receive education. According to historian Freddie Parker, Durham \\"was a diverse community that needed more than one black leader.\\" Austin was extremely frustrated with the conservative black leaders in Durham; therefore, he strove to create a racially tolerant environment in Durham for all African Americans. Austin's outspoken editorials in The Carolina Times divulged African American inequalities, and helped galvanize the African American community to focus on activism. =The Great Depression Era= Throughout the 1930s, Austin displayed his commitment to the African American masses in Durham through his efforts to bring about social and political change in many different areas. He led voter campaigns, advocated for the integration of public schools, lobbied for equal pay for black teachers and equal funding for black schools, denounced police brutality, and demanded equal employment opportunity for African Americans. Education was exceptionally important to Austin because he saw education as a crucial prerequisite for blacks to rise above racial inequalities. Austin worked tirelessly to fight for equal education opportunities, and unlike more cautious black leaders in North Carolina, did not hesitate to advocate legal action to enforce equity in education. Austin's first major action in promoting equal opportunities in education in North Carolina occurred in 1933, when he joined with black lawyers Conrad Pearson and Cecil McCoy to back Thomas Hocutt, in the lawsuit Hocutt v. Wilson, to challenge University of North Carolina's (UNC) decision to deny Hocutt's application for admission on the basis of his race. Moderate black elites, such as Spaulding, tried to convince Austin and the other black lawyers to drop the case because they wanted to maintain good relations with white state leaders in order to ensure their economic well-being. Austin displayed his commitment to legal action when he said: \\"If my actions will cause a race riot, you had better grease up your muskets for I am going back Monday to pursue this cause.\\" While Austin and the other black lawyers lost in court, according to Jerry Gershenhorn, the case was significant in the larger context because it marked a turning point in the African American struggle for equal rights and social injustice. The old order of the South would no longer go unchallenged by African Americans in North Carolina. Courageous activists, like Austin, were committed to utilizing the judicial system to challenge racial inequalities. Hocutt v. Wilson laid the foundation for future political legal actions, and served as the opening salvo in the NAACP's legal battle to overturn public education, ultimately culminating in the Brown v. Board of Education decision. The case also served as a point of entry for the NAACP into North Carolina. Louis Austin believed that African Americans could achieve better rights while working within the confines of the political system. Austin viewed political participation as a means for blacks to voice their concerns, and if the masses of the black community were politically engaged, they would be able to attain better rights. In 1928, there were only fifty black registered voters in Durham. Austin constantly embraced community mobilization in both local and national politics. Beginning in the late 1920s, Austin worked to directly confront restricts, such as literacy tests, that white supremacists imposed in order to keep blacks from voting. For example, in 1932, Austin led a \\"state-wide non-partisan political conference\\" in Durham, which attempted to foster black interest in voting, and address the difficulties blacks faced in getting to the polls. Austin recognized that the Republican Party was no longer the \\"Black Man's Party,\\" and that for African Americans, the key to gaining influence in North Carolina and throughout the South was through the Democratic Party. In 1934, Austin displayed his newfound commitment to Democratic Party when he and Frederick K. Watkins ran on the Democratic ticket and were elected justices of the peace in Durham. Throughout the country, the black press applauded their victory as a turning point for African American involvement in politics: \\"For the first time in the history of the South, two colored men were elected to office on the Democratic ticket.\\" Moreover, Austin's victory had important long term significance. After Austin won, the local head of the Democratic party tried to persuade him to back down; however, Austin remained adamant about serving in office. Austin thus \\"established a precedent\\" for blacks serving as justices of the peace in Durham. While Austin did not obtain a powerful political position, according to Joseph Cannon, Austin's victory represented the success in African American's faltering first steps in politics in Durham. Another pivotal turning point in black political influence occurred in 1935, when Austin joined with Shepard and Spaulding to form the Durham Committee on Negro Affairs, known as the DCNA. The DCNA dedicated itself to improving African Americans' economic, social, and educational opportunities, and served as a means for African Americans in Durham to enter the political arena. The DCNA proved effective in registering blacks to vote. Black voter registration in Durham doubled in the year after the organization was founded, and by 1939, there were three thousand black voters in the city. =World War II Era (1940s)= Double V Strategy When the United States entered World War II, Austin seized the opportunity and implemented the Double V campaign. Austin joined other black newspapers in articulating this dual strategy in which blacks fought for victory abroad against the Axis powers while fighting for victory at home against the forces of white supremacy. The campaign revealed the hypocrisy in America's supposed \\"war for democracy\\" abroad and attack on the Nazi's discriminatory ideology by publicizing racial oppression at home. While some southern black editors, such as P.B. Young of the Norfolk Journal and Guide, refused to directly attack segregation, Louis Austin was the leading proponent of the Double V strategy in North Carolina and demanded the end of racial segregation. One example Austin used to back the Double V campaign was how Americans condemned Japanese soldiers for committing atrocities against Americans, but they found nothing wrong with lynching African-Americans. From the outset of World War II, Austin relentlessly attacked the government for \\"all forms of discrimination, and advocated for equal access for blacks in all branches of the armed forces. He expressed the absurdity of African Americans fighting for the right to put their lives at risk and defend their country. Moreover, Austin criticized conservative black leaders who did not condemn racial segregation in the armed forces. At an October 1942 meeting amongst black leaders in Durham intended to work on issuing a Durham Manifesto, conservative leaders such as Spaulding, Shephard and Young, expressed their disagreement with \\"the principle and practice of compulsory segregation in our American society;\\" however, they worried that if they endorsed outright rejection of racial segregation in the manifesto, it would create white backlash. The American government—concerned about losing support for the war on the domestic front—began to criticize attacks from black activists and the black press and sought to put an end to the Double-V campaign. Due to government pressure and surveillance, many black newspapers moderated their editorials. However, despite government pressure, Austin remained resolute in his support for the Double-V campaign. According to Austin's daughter, an FBI agent once came to The Carolina Times office, and Austin completely disregarded his concerns, and the FBI never returned. Even when faced with challenges from the American government, Austin remained dedicated to the cause he believed in and refused to give in to pressure. Austin's role in World War II is noteworthy; Timothy B. Tyson in his book Radio Free Dixie refers to Austin \\"as the most prominent 'racial agitator'\\" during World War II.\\" The race riots of 1943 -- which erupted in over forty cities including Durham -- also factored into the growing sentiment amongst black activists to tone down their criticisms. However, Austin remained determined to the Double V strategy, and instead, used the violent uprisings to further his criticism by publicizing the harm that segregation was causing throughout the country. In June 1943, Austin expressed that \\"the law of segregation\\" was the root cause behind racial conflict in North Carolina. He believed that the riot in Durham represented the need for Durham to hire black police. While Austin utilized the race riots to demonstrate significant changes that were necessary in Durham and America, he publicly condemned the blacks who participated in the riots for their lawless behavior. He urged blacks to pursue peaceful methods to end racial segregation. One method Austin advocated was telling every African American to write letters to their mayor, their governor, and their president, and peacefully declare their frustrations through the power of words. Throughout the war, Austin taught other African Americans the importance of pursuing nonviolent methods when fighting segregation, such as publicly voicing their concerns instead. Austin, by implementing the Double-V campaign, \\"spurred a growing militant movement that would bear more fruit after the war.\\" Post-World War II After World War II, Austin continued to directly confront issues African Americans were facing, and began to see some results from his hard work. For instance, in 1953, businessman and DCNA leader R.N. Harris was elected to the Durham City Council. Harris was the first African American to serve on the city council, and following the elections, The Carolina Times wrote that \\"[h]istory was made in Durham…as the first Negro councilman in the city's 100 year-old history was sworn in.\\" During the mid 1950s, the DCNA was seen as \\"the South's most effective black political machine.\\" Furthermore, after more than two decades of campaigning for desegregation in schools, the Brown v. Board of Education decision made Austin's dream to dismantle legal segregation of education a reality. =Modern Civil Rights Era= Unlike older, conservative black activists, Austin sustained his position in the forefront of the movement for justice and equal opportunity during the modern Civil Rights Movement. Austin recognized the importance of joining with the younger generation of activists because they would be the face of the new movement, and it was crucial to steer them in the right way. In the 1950s, when the NAACP wanted to increase its membership, particularly to attract more young participants, The Carolina Times played a key role in getting people to join. During the 1950s and 1960s, Austin joined with a new generation of activists in support of the desegregation of public schools, lunch counters, and restaurants, equal access to employment opportunities, and voting rights. As the new generation of activists joined the movement the rift between the conservative and progressive members of the movement became apparent in Durham, particularly through the frustrations surrounding the DCNA's moderate, gradualist approach. The younger, more radical members wanted to push the segregation question to the front and were becoming frustrated with the DCNA. Austin was conscious of the gap between the young activists and the old, wealthy black elite. He recognized the need for the DCNA to change its approach, and The Carolina Times served as a watchdog to inform the public of what he considered to be the \\"lethargy\\" of the DCNA's efforts to improve black's rights in Durham. In June 1957, Austin ran an outspoken editorial about the organization: > [T]his newspaper senses a stagnation that is beginning to creep over the > Durham Committee on Negro Affairs which, if allowed to continue, is certain > to spell its doom….[The DCNA] is becoming too high-brow, too soft and too > compromise…. There comes a time in the life of an organization when it needs > new blood, new faces and some new ideas. There comes a time when those who > have been in control too long become satisfied to rest on their oars and > boast of their past achievements…The struggle for freedom for all must go > on. It must not be sacrificed on the altar of greed and power merely to > obtain a few crumbs for the few. What we do now will determine the destiny > of thousands who come after us. God forbid that we falter or recoil from > performing our solemn duty. Austin was calling on African Americans to join in a new and more aggressive struggle. Austin's editorial was deemed incredibly influential by Osha Gray Davidson in The Best of Enemies. Davidson stated, \\"If the civil rights movement of the 1960s was a second American Revolution, as some have called it, then Louis Austin was, especially in the crucible of North Carolina, its Thomas Paine, his stirring rhetoric pointing the way toward freedom at a crucial moment.\\" The Royal Ice Cream sit-in, occurred in Durham a week after Austin published his editorial, and was the young activist's response to Austin's challenge toward a direct action strategy. Austin, alongside Douglas E. Moore and Floyd McKissick, continued to push the DCNA to pursue more forceful actions during the modern civil rights era. Opposition to Black Nationalist Groups While Austin rallied the masses to join with the new generation of activists in order to affect change, he denounced the black nationalist and separatist organizations that arose in the late 1950s and early 1960s and thought unlawful tactics were a necessary means to achieving their goals. Austin proclaimed that \\"The Carolina Times will not give its support to any person or group of persons advocating a resort to violence as a means of solving the black man's problems in this country or elsewhere.\\" Instead, Austin believed that African Americans should work within the confines of the legal system to affect change. He had already seen society change tremendously throughout his lifetime. Austin believed that, \\"The pen is mightier than the sword,\\" and throughout his life whenever he felt angry about racial injustices, he voiced them in The Carolina Times instead of resorting to violence. Austin displayed these sentiments in an editorial in the Times: \\"we call upon every Negro of sound judgment in this country to throw his support to that segment of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and other civil rights organizations that believe in and intend to practice law and order.\\" Austin supported young, new movements whose philosophies were based on nonviolence, such as the Southern Christian Leadership Conference led by Martin Luther King Jr.. Austin was a forerunner to these big movements, as they echoed extremely similar beliefs to those that he had been stressing since the early 1920s. The movement's success Throughout the 1960s, Austin saw the fruits of his lifetime of hard labor. One significant event in the 1960s was when Thurgood Marshall was selected the first African American on the United States Supreme Court. Austin had highlighted the importance of African American engagement in the political system his entire life, and Marshall's appointment to one of the most prominent institutions in the United States government was a testament to Austin's beliefs that blacks could achieve power in the political system. The Carolina Times printed that \\"The United States Supreme Court opened a historic term October 2, with the swearing of the first Negro justice in its 178-year history.\\" The Carolina Times continued to publicize important milestones for the African American community. Impact Austin continued to advocate for civil rights causes until he died on June 12, 1971. During his lifetime, he lived to see his lifework of devoted civil rights activism come full circle. He lobbied against white supremacy, the Jim Crow laws, racism, lynching, police brutality, employment discrimination, housing discrimination, segregation in schools, as well as other forms of racial discrimination. Durham historian Jean Anderson describes Austin as \\"an indefatigable crusader for justice and civil rights ... of a new class of blacks who kowtowed to no one, and he made the paper an unrelenting crusader for all black causes, including in his coverage news that bore on race relations from all over the nation.\\" Austin used The Carolina Times to broadcast racial discriminations in order for them to be heard. After Austin died, a letter to the editor in a newspaper based in Virginia stated that Austin left \\"to Durham a rich heritage of unselfish service and a better community than it would have been otherwise.\\" It is evident that Austin's impact was known throughout the South and the United States and not only in North Carolina. Austin influenced Durham through his own undertakings during his own lifetime, and his actions continue to influence change in Durham to this day. Austin was able to teach the younger generation of activists what it meant to be a powerful leader, and these leaders were able to keep the movement alive. He taught them the importance of political engagement in order to effect change. Austin served as a paradigm for future black leaders about the importance of challenging the status quo, and not to be too scared to challenge unfair practices when others fear that it might create commotion. For example, Howard Fuller, who went on to lead Operation Breakthrough, was mentored by Austin. Austin taught Fuller to take on the upper class in the black community with the same zeal and uncompromising spirit that he used in confronting the white power structure. In the final days of his life, Austin said to Fuller, \\"they're going to get mad at you, but you've got to keep…doing…these things.\\" During Louis Austin's 44 years as editor of The Carolina Times, he shaped it into an institution that gave black people a place to voice their concerns and a conduit to be heard, and his grandson, Kenneth Edmonds, continues to carry out Austin's vision in Durham to this day. In modern-day Durham, The Carolina Times motto, \\"The Truth Unbridled\\" continues to live on, and The Carolina Times is still Durham's only black-owned and operated newspaper. Edmonds said The Carolina Times aims to help the black community progress. As the current publisher of The Carolina Times, Edmonds continues the fight for \\"equality, civil rights, and the political rights of African Americans.\\" Equally important, by rallying African Americans to register to vote, Austin created a black political movement in Durham that continues to grow.  Posthumous Recognition  Austin was recognized as a Main Honoree by the Sesquicentennial Honors Commission at the Durham 150 Closing Ceremony in Durham, NC on November 2, 2019. The posthumous recognition was bestowed upon 29 individuals \\"whose dedication, accomplishments and passion have helped shape Durham in important ways.\\" References =Bibliography=       Category:American civil rights activists Category:American male journalists Category:African-American journalists Category:1898 births Category:1971 deaths Category:People from Enfield, North Carolina Category:People from Durham, North Carolina ","title":"Louis Austin"},{"id":"44588351","text":"Robert Boal (November 15, 1806 – June 12, 1903) was an American politician and physician from Pennsylvania.

It is the twelfth volume in his extensive Dray Prescot series of sword and planet novels, set on the fictional world of Kregen, a planet of the Antares star system in the constellation of Scorpio. It was first published by DAW Books in 1976. The Dray Prescot series is made of several cycles of novels, each cycle essentially forming a series within the series. In addition to being the twelfth volume in the series as a whole, The Tides of Kregen is also the first of three volumes in the Krozair Cycle. It is set on the fictional continent of Turismond as well as the island of Valka and Earth. The 52 completed novels of the Dray Prescot series were written by Bulmer between 1972 and 1997, when a stroke stopped his writing, also the later Dray Prescot books, after 1988, were originally only published in German. The series is in the spirit of Edgar Rice Burroughs John Carter of Mars series.Ken Bulmer obituary The Guardian, published: 22 December 2005, accessed: 4 December 2014 Plot summary Map of the Eye of the World The book takes place a number of years after the events of Armada of Antares and the short story Wizard of Scorpio. It begins with an argument between Khe-Hi- Bjanching, a young Wizard of Loh and Evold Scavander about a visitation by Phu-si-Yantong. Prescot is than visited by the Gdoinye, the messenger bird of the Star Lords, to tell him his service will be required soon. He is astonished to hear that his soon Drak was able to see the bird, too, when he thought it invisible to all himself. He shortly after informs Delia that he might be leaving soon. When a messenger informs Prescot that the Shanks, a mysterious race of raiders have attacked an island of Valka and he rushes out with a small force to beat them back. The small force, including Delia and Drak, are trapped in an island village and under attack when Prescot is teleported away by the Star Lords. He resists and refuses to take up battle in his new location, instead returning to Delia. The Gdoinye warns him of his foolishness to resist and once more he is teleported, arriving for the first time fully armed and clothed. Again he defies the Star Lords and for this he is banished to Earth, seemingly for good. Prescot spends the next decades on Earth, getting involved in wars out of boredom and growing every more morose and desperate to return to Kregen. He studies science and is eventually introduced to a Madam Ivanovna who reveals herself to be connected to Kregen but to be neither a Savanti nor a Star Lord. She tells Prescot her real name, Zena Iztar and he learns that 18 years have passed on Kregen since his departure. He learns that Drak and Delia survived the attack and that his older twins are now 32 years old and the second set 21, the age Delia was when she met Prescot. He also learns that the Savanti are only interested in the humans of Kregen while the Star Lords goals are broader and that their interests have clashed. She also tells him that it was her who influenced his directions at the Eye of the World when the Star Lords and the Savanti pulled him in opposite directions. Three more years pass before Prescot is finally returned to Kregen in 1871. Prescot finds himself fighting slavers on a remote island. After fulfilling this task he sets of in a small boat, not knowing where he is. He is eventually rescued by a merchant ship and taken to Xuntal from where he heads home to Valka. He finds all his family dispersed and Delia to have left for the Eye of the World almost a year ago and follows her. Once more Prescot crosses the hostile lands and the Stratemsk mountains of eastern Turismond to reach the inner sea, after a 50-year absence. He heads for Felteraz and Mayfwy, widow of his friend Zorg to gain information. He learns that Delia had indeed been there and that the eternal war between the two sides is going badly for the Zairians, with the South holding up at sea but consistently losing the land battles to the Grodnims. Prescot returns to the fortress of the Krozairs of Zy but instead of a welcome he is declared Apushniad, an outcast, for not heading the call to arms to all Krozairs when it was issued. Prescot is deeply affected by this sentence as being a Krozair was of the titles he held the one he valued most. He is sentenced to become an oar slave once more but is allowed an hour with Delia just before being send to the ship, their first encounter in 21 years. Prescot passes the time from then on in a form of trance, unable to comprehend what was happening until he is freed by his to former oar comrades Nath and Zolta. They inform him that Delia has returned to Valka, being pregnant, and that she expects Dray to regain his status as Krozair, which the latter accepts as his duty. Prescot secretly leaves his friends to head west and meet Pur Zenkiren who leads an army there. He survives a raid by the Grodnim on an army supply camp and gains a new friend in Duhrra the wrestler when he saves the latter, acquiring the alias of Dak in the process. He heads for the city of Shazmoz, under siege by the Grodnim. In Shazmoz he meets Zenkiren and at first the too declares Prescot an Apushniad but the latter forces him to listen to some of his story. Zenkiren eventually sides with Prescot and explains the current situation in the Eye of the World. Genod Gannius, new leader of the Grodnim, a man Prescot suspects to be related to Gahan Gannius and Valima whom he saved so long ago in The Suns of Scorpio has employed tactics against the Zairians Prescot himself so long ago used against the Overlords of Magdag in an unsuccessful slave revolt. Departing from Zenkiren Prescot and Duhrra ride west, to the Grand Canal and the Dam of Days, where the Eye of the World ends, a territory now held by the Grodnim, with Prescot resolved to leave this part of Kregen for good and to concentrate on his life back in Vallia. He returns to the Akhram of the Todalpheme, the monks calculating the tides of Kregen and learns that a convoy loaded with flying boats for the Grodnim is scheduled to pass the Dam of Days just before a storm will hit and the dam will be closed. Unwilling to let the Grodnim have the advantage of flying boats, usually unseen at the Eye of the World, Prescot resolves to destroy this convoy but not after arguing with himself as to whether he should get involved or not. Prescot finally reaches the Dam of Days, build by the ancient Sunset People who the Savanti were the last remnants of. He forces the dam open to let the flood through and destroy the ships from Menaham carrying the flying boats as well as all ships as far as Shazmoz. The Star Lords attempt to teleport him away but he successfully fights them, feeling that he is also helped by another force. With the task completed the two companions head for Magdag, encountering Zena Iztar on their way who confirms to Prescot that it was her who assisted him against the Star Lords. She informs him that he will not be allowed to leave the Eye of the World as yet but he continues on to Magdag nevertheless. Publishing The book was first published in English in August 1976.

They work is focusing on assisting the Chuvash diaspora in preserving ethnic identity and the development of culture of the Chuvash people, the creation of national- cultural associations. In October 8–9, 1992 in Cheboksary the 1st Congress of Chuvash National Congress convened by the Resolution of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Chuvash ASSR. In 2005, outside of the Chuvash Republic Chuvash operated 67 national-cultural associations, and on 1 January 2009, that was 79. They are formed in 29 regions of the Russian Federation (including 12 regions of the Volga Federal District) and 6 foreign countries.  Chronology  Interregional Public Organization \\"Chuvash National Congress\\" was established on October 8–9, 1992 at the founding meeting. Was elected president Atner Petrovich Khuzangaĭ, chairman of the Committee on Education and International Relations of the State Council of the Chuvash Republic. In 1992-1993, CNC participated in the development of the law \\"On the languages of the Chuvash Republic.\\" In 1992, the Chuvash National Congress joined the Assembly of Turkic peoples (ATP), in 1993 - in the Organization of Non-Aligned Nations and Peoples, in 1994 - Assembly of peoples of the Volga and Ural (APVU), in 1995 - the Assembly of the Peoples of Russia (APR). Congress in 1994-2000 participated in the preparation of the Constitution of the Chuvash Republic. In 1994-1995, spent preparing for the establishment of the Day of State (later - Republic Day). This festival is usually celebrated on June 24. To commemorate the 1100th anniversary of the Volga Bulgaria in the Park of the 500th anniversary of Cheboksary established \\"Unforgettable» post. 21–22 June 1995 CNC passed the II Congress. In 1992-2002, Chuvash National Congress participated in congresses and conferences on national issues in the United States, the Netherlands, Estonia, Turkey, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Crimea, Azerbaijan, Cyprus and other countries. Since 1996, the PLS was the Grand Council meet on the territory of the Chuvash living outside the country (village Slakbashevo (Bashkortostan), Ulyanovsk, Samara region). In 1997-2002, in Moscow, Ulyanovsk, Samara, Saratov, Tatarstan, Krasnoyarsk created Chuvash national-cultural autonomies. In 1997, President of CNC Atner Huzangay elected vice-president of the non-aligned nations and peoples. 24–25 October 1997 Congress passed the III Congress. President of the Congress became Gennady Arkhipov. In April 1998, Chuvash National Congress held in Berlin Days of Chuvash culture. In 1999-2002, CNC together with the Ministry of Culture of the Chuvash Republic organized festivals of pop Chuvash songs. Later, he became known as an international festival of Chuvash pop song \\"Silver Voice\\". 21–22 July 2000 CNC passed IV Congress.

This method largely relies on harnessing the tree's vascular system to translocate and distribute the active compounds into the wood, canopy and roots where protection or nutrition is needed. Tree injection is currently the most popular method for control of damaging insects, pathogens, and nematodes in landscape tree care.  Description  Trunk injection has been developed primarily for use on large size trees and in proximity of urban areas where ground- and air-spray applications are impractical due to substantial drift-driven pesticide losses or not allowed due to potential human exposure. However, the prime driver of tree injection use has been a wide spread need for control of many invasive tree pathogens and insects pests. The most infamous examples are that of Ophiostoma fungi that cause Dutch Elm Disease (DED) and insect Emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis) which have specific biologies that lead to severe internal damage of wood and thus tree death, and which make their management extremely difficult or inefficient with classical pesticide application methods. Trunk injection for tree protection is viewed as environmentally safer alternative for pesticide application since the compound is delivered within the tree, thus allowing for selective exposure to plant pests. In landscapes and urban zones trunk injection significantly reduces the non-target exposure of water, soil, air, and wildlife to pesticides and fertilizers. In the last 20 years, tree injection is gaining momentum with the development and availability of new, efficient injection devices and injectable and xylem mobile formulations of pesticides, biopesticides and nutrients. Trunk injection works by adding a water soluble chemical directly into the lower stem of the tree structure.  Applications  A number of newly occurring and fast spreading invasive insect pests and diseases such as Polyphagous Shot Hole Borer (PSHB) Euwallacea , which can vector plant pathogenic fungus Fusarium euwallaceae, and Sudden Oak Death (SOD) caused by an Oomycete Phytophthora ramorum, establish the use of trunk injection as the most efficient tree protection technique in landscapes and urban forestry. In the past and recently, trunk injection of pesticides and plant resistance activators has been investigated in agriculture for control of pathogens and insect pests on fruit tree crops and grapevines. The most investigated are diseases and pests of avocado, apple, and grapevine, such as Phytophthora root rot of avocado Phytophthora cinnamomi and avocado thrips Scirtothrips perseae, fire blight Erwinia amylovora and apple scab Venturia inaequalis, oblique banded leaf roller Choristoneura rosaceana and codling moth Cydia pomonella, and grapevine downy mildew Plasmopara viticola and powdery mildew Uncinula necator. Apple trees are especially interesting as a research model in agriculture since it is known that apple production requires intensive spray schedules for control of pathogenic fungus V. inaequalis with as many as 15-22 sprays of fungicides per season in humid climate. Trunk injection of pesticides is considered as an option for precise compound delivery which will reduce the negative impact of drift-driven pesticide losses in the environment, that occur after aerial or ground spraying of pesticides. Besides negative consequences of frequent pesticide applications in the environment, stem injection of grapevines is investigated in viticulture for control of pathogens with difficult biologies which infect and destroy woody tissues and that cannot be controlled efficiently by canopy spray applications of fungicides. To increase the efficiency of injected compounds in trees and vines, important considerations are plant anatomy, weather and soil conditions, tree physiology processes, spatial and temporal distribution of injected compound, and the chemical properties of injected compound and formulation.

Such items include earthenware, decorative metalwork, weapons, and human corpses, known as bog bodies. As Kaul noted, \\"we cannot get away from the fact that the depositions in the bogs were connected with the ritual/religious sphere.\\" The earliest examples of wetland deposits from Scandinavia come from the Mesolithic, including elk bones and earthenware vessels. In the Neolithic, earthenware vessels and flint axes were deposited in the wetlands, with a number of wooden platforms being constructed to allow greater access to the wetlands themselves. In the Bronze Age, a wide variety of different items were placed into bogs, although the levels of deposition fluctuated throughout the period. It also witnessed the deposition of several high-value metal items, including the Trundholm sun chariot and a number of lurs and shields. The Pre-Roman Iron Age witnessed the continued deposition of these high-status item, including decorated metal cauldrons, most notably the Gundestrup Cauldron. It also saw the deposition of increasingly complex assemblages, which often brought together animal and human bones with stones, sticks, and wooden equipment. Many of the items deposited in bogs were highly valuable. It is possible that some artefacts also ended up in bogs and lakes without deliberate human intent, for instance if they were lost by accident or produced in settlements that existed adjacent to such wetland areas. Terminology Given that these items are typically interpreted as having a religious or cultic purpose, terms such as \\"offerings\\", \\"sacrifices\\" and \\"votive deposits\\" have been used to refer to them, however \\"depositions\\" is sometimes favoured as being more neutral. Kaul noted that \\"in many cases it can be difficult to tell whether the deposition had a practical function or was related to religion and ritual.\\" Bogs and wetland areas were widespread in much of southern Scandinavia in the past, although many have been destroyed since the Middle Ages due to drainage and agricultural use. Archaeological evidence makes it clear that they were not always remote or inaccessible places in prehistoric contexts, and in various cases were located close to human settlements. Kaul suggested that \\"the bogs can be regarded as uncultivated areas that were closer to the forces of nature, where people felt closer to divine beings.\\" In some cases, it appears that items were not actually deposited into the water or bog itself, but were placed on dry-land adjacent to the water. The majority of artefacts from bogs and other wetland contexts in Scandinavia were not discovered through archaeological investigation, but have been discovered by accident, particularly by individuals engaged in peat cutting. Mesolithic A number of items have been discovered in wetland places that were deposited during the Mesolithic, or \\"Middle Stone Age\\" period of Scandinavian prehistory. A number of deposits of elk bones dating to c.9500 BCE have been found in Lundby Bog in South Sealand, while several others dated to c.8500 BCE and associated with the Maglemosian culture have been found at Skottemarke on Lolland and at Favrbo in West Sealand. Parallels have been drawn with some of the hunting rituals which have been ethnographically recorded among the Sami people in northern Scandinavia. A number of artefacts associated with the Late Ertebølle culture have also been found in bogs, among them earthenware vessels, flint-core axes, and imported shoe-last celts. At Mosegaard Bog in Åmosen, Central Sealand, a collection of 21 pierced animal teeth were found together in a wetland context, with Kaul suggesting that these could probably be considered \\"a Mesolithic ritual deposition\\". Neolithic In the Early and Middle Neolithic, funnel beakers, such as that depicted here, were deposited in Scandinavian wetlands In a number of cases, it has been shown that Neolithic settlements were located very close to the edge of a bog or lake, in some instances where items from the same period had been deposited. These settlements were likely inhabited on a seasonal basis, from where people hunted and fished but also brought domestic animals with them. For instance, at Storelyng IV, a site in the Central Sealand Åmose which is dated to c.3400 BCE, archaeological evidence indicates that a community arrived there in mid- May, where they hunted, fished, and gathered shellfish in the adjacent lake, before slaughtering a number of goats that they had brought with them and departing in mid-August. A characteristic of Early Neolithic depositions is the placing of earthenware vessels near to the banks of a lake, something which may have parallels in the latter part of the preceding Mesolithic Ertebølle culture. This tradition was carried out for around a thousand years, from c.4000 BCE to shortly before 3000 BCE, when the practice largely died out. Archaeological analysis of burnt remains of food on the inside of some of the earthenware funnel beakers from this period reveals that they contained a fish soup, although traces of acorn have also been identified. It is unclear whether these earthenware items were actually deposited in the water with food in them, or whether this had been consumed or otherwise removed beforehand. In many cases, animal bones have also been deposited alongside the earthenware. Zooarchaeological analysis of the bones have revealed that sheep or goats are well represented in the assemblages, with domestic ox also being common, although both pig and wild animals like red deer and roe deer have also been found. The bones have often been split, so as to allow bone marrow extraction, suggesting that the animals had been eaten prior to the deposition of the bones. These assemblages are often interpreted as the result of a ritual meals consumed communally, with sheep or goats being of particular symbolic importance at these events, given that their remains are far less common in debris from settlement sites. Flint axes were often deposited in wetlands in the Neolithic Flint axes were also placed in bogs during the Neolithic, with examples having been identified as belonging to the Early, Middle, and Late periods of this era. In some instances they are associated with earthenware deposits, although in others they are found alone; this is particularly evident in the Scania area, where earthenware deposits are scarce. In various cases, multiple axes were deposited in the same place; one such example was found under controlled excavation conditions at Gamla Wärslätt in Billinge Parish, Scania. Here, four Early Neolithic flint axes were found close to each other, in what had evidently been peat at the time of deposition, for one was found standing vertically, and the other horizontally. It was believed that they had not been deposited together in one event, but independently. In a few instance, it is clear that simple copper axes, which had been imported into Scandinavia from southern Europe, were deposited in wetlands from the Early Neolithic onward. In various instances, amber beads were deposited in wetlands; such deposits are particularly in North and North West Jutland. In one case, at Mollerup in Salling, 13,000 small amber beads were found in an Early Neolithic earthenware vessel. During the Early Neolithic, many human remains associated with the Funnelbeaker culture were deposited in Scandinavian wetlands. Both entire skeletons and singular skulls have been found; it is unclear if these latter remains were originally deposited without the rest of the body, or whether the rest of the body was simply not discovered. One Neolithic skeleton from Sigersdal in Veksø Bog, west of Copenhagen, was found to have a thin plant fibre cord wound repeatedly around its neck, suggesting the possibility that the individual was strangled before deposition. Similar cords around the neck were found on two other Neolithic bog skeletons, one from Stenstrup Bog in North West Sealand and the other from Bolkilde Bog in Als, South Jutland. Human remains appear to have declined greatly in the Late Neolithic. A number of wooden platforms have been identified from Neolithic Scandinavia, and attributed to the Funnelbeaker culture. These would have permitted access to a specific part of the lake or bog, where deposits could then be made. An example found to be 10 metres wide and 22 metres long and constructed from branches and twigs was discovered in Saltpetermosen in Hillerød, North Sealand. At this specific site, deposits had been made throughout the Early Neolithic and into the early part of the Middle Neolithic, and included two funnel beakers, ox and lamb bones, and both a greenstone axe and slate axe. Another example of a wooden platform, believed to be c.50m long and c.10m wide was found at Veggerslev Bog in Djursland, East Jutland, where it had also served as a platform for depositional practices and which again stretched from the Early Neolithic into the Middle Neolithic. The depositional practices changed during the Neolithic. Around 3000 BCE, the tradition of placing earthenware vessels, Funnelbeaker Culture battle-axes and amber into waterplaces rapidly declined, at the same time as the deposition of these items in front of the facades of megalithic tombs also declined. Conversely, the deposition of flint-axes continued unaffected, both in water- places and in front of the tombs. The Late Neolithic saw the arrival of metal technologies in Scandinavia, with both the development of bronze technologies and the arrival of items imported from elsewhere. This Late Neolithic metalwork is extremely rare in graves of this period, although have been found buried as single finds or as hoards, both in wetland and dryland sites. One of the most prominent examples was from Gallemose near Randers in East Jutland; here, nine flanged axes (of disparate origins; one is from Central Europe, another from the British Isles, and another from Scandinavia) were deposited alongside three large hooks and nine large rings, all of which appear to have been made somewhere south of the Baltic. The Late Neolithic also witnessed the arrival of gold artefacts into Scandinavia, although few of these appear to have been deposited into waterplaces. Bronze Age Brudevælte Lurs from Brudevælte, Denmark In Scandinavia, the Bronze Age is viewed as starting around 1700 BCE. The period is named after the rapid rise in the number of bronze artifacts which have been discovered from this period, many of which had been deposited in wetlands. Other however were deposited on dry land sites, with it appearing that these items were often treated in the same manner regardless of the place of deposition. Depositions in the Bronze Age of this area are often characterized by the general absence of wooden platforms, earthenware vessels, bones, and wooden figurines, which are present in other periods. Only in a few examples are earthenware vessels, bones and figurines present from this period, in what are typically highly isolated depositions. Many everyday objects were placed into the wetlands during this period, in some cases as single finds and in others of assemblages containing a variety of different form of artifact. Such items include working tools such as sickles and axes, weapons (namely swords and spearheads), and decorative items, such as Late Bronze Age celts, neck ring, and belt ornaments. Other items deposited in the wetlands during the Bronze Age were far rarer and wealthier goods, and these have been more readily associated with religious practice among archaeologists; such items include the Trundholm sun chariot, the horned Veksø helmets, and the lur horns. At Mariesminde on Funen, 11 golden bowls with horse-head handles were found inside a bronze amphora that had been imported into Scandinavia from Central Europe. At Midskov in Funen seven gold bowls were found in a small waterhole under 20 metres in diameter. Many of these items would have been represented high material value and a high degree of craftsmanship. They would have been obtained from further south in Europe, and depositing them in the wetlands would have therefore taken them out of circulation. Kaul suggested that such luxury items may have been used for a certain number of years, for specific ceremonial occasions, before they were removed from circulation by being deposited in the wetlands. Various explanations have been put forward to explain this rise; perhaps it represents the increasing importance of a female deity in the religious beliefs of the area, or it could indicate a growth in women's societal status in this period. Conversely, these feminine items could have represented male status in Bronze Age Scandinavia. The Trundholm sun chariot was found deposited in wetland A number of shields dating from the Late Bronze Age have also been found in Scandinavian wetlands. These items were likely imported and have been found at such sites as Falster, Himmerland in Jutland, and at Halland. It has been suggested that they served a cultic, as opposed to practical, military purpose. In some cases these were found as hoards; 16 shields were found close together in two heaps at the Fröslunda bog near to Lake Vänern in Västergötland in Sweden. The deposition of human remains in wetland contexts appears absent from the Early Bronze Age, just after it had declined in the Late Neolithic. However, they begin to reappear in the Late Bronze Age, from which these depositions continue into the Early Iron Age. There was clear chronological change throughout the Bronze Age. Throughout what archaeologists have termed Period I and Period II (c.1600-1300 BCE) the number of depositions rose rapidly while the content of the depositions also increased with the inclusion of a wide variety of items. The quantity of bronze items declined during Period III (1300-1100 BCE), before rising again in Period IV (1100-900 BCE) and reaching a peak in Period V (900-700 BCE) before a further decline in Period VI (700-500 BCE). Throughout this period there are also other differences that are apparent; bronze objects associated with women are not present in Period I, although have begun to appear by Period II and by Period VI they were the dominant form of artefact in the wetland deposits. Iron Age =Pre-Roman Iron Age= It is apparent that in the Iron Age, Scandinavian communities began to exploit the bogs in ways that they had not done before. Bog ore was obtained for use in iron production, while there is evidence that peat cutting for use as fuel began in the Pre-Roman Iron Age. This new usage of the resource may have led to \\"changes in the sacral use of bogs and wetlands too\\". In various cases it is apparent that individuals returned to the same site on repeated occasions to add more depositions; thus Kaul stated that while in Bronze Age Scandinavia, bogs were typically a place only for deposition, in the Iron Age \\"the bog became a place where rituals were clearly performed, a sacral place more closely linked with the human world.\\" The wetland deposits of the Pre-Roman Iron Age shared many traits with those of the preceding Period VI of the Bronze Age. Deposits of bronze neck rings continued, however the deposition of the twisted Wendel ring ceased at an early stage in the Pre-Roman Iron Age. At the same time, a number of new forms of neck rings that had developed in the Pre-Roman Iron Age were deposited, both the crown neck-rings and the ball torques. The Pre-Roman Iron Age also saw the revival of deposits of earthenware vessels, perhaps containing food, into the bogs; a tradition that had been present in the Early Neolithic but which was largely absent from the Bronze Age. In almost all cases, these are isolated instances, and are not clustered with other earthenware pots. From the Early Iron Age, there was also an appearance of complex depositions, some of which were accompanied by earthenware and others that were not. These included depositions of animal bones and in some cases human bones, heaps of stones, and wooden items such as wheels and other wagon parts or wooden poles, some of which had anthropomorphic or phallic shapes. A notable site from this period was discovered at Forlev Nymølle, near Skanderborg, East Jutland. Here, there was evidence of a continuing tradition of deposition that lasted between c.200 and 50 BCE, resulting in the creation of several separate heaps of items. Some of these consisted of a variety of different items, such as wooden objects, earthenware vessels, animal bones, small stones, and tree branches. In one of the mounds was an anthropomorphic figure that is 2.74 m long, created from a forked piece of oak. It was found alongside a truss of flax, a heap of hand-sized stones, some worked pieces of wood, sherds of an earthenware vessels, and a few goat bones; these items were probably deposited in the wetland along with the statue. The Gundestrup Cauldron is a prominent example of a deposit from the Pre-Roman Iron Age Another noted site was discovered from the bog at Hedeliskær at Skødstrup in the north of Århus, East Jutland. Here, a wooden figure was surrounded with earthenware vessels, animal and human bones, and a number of shattered pots and two iron knives placed above it. Around this layer were the complete skeletons of thirteen dogs, tied to two large stones, and nearby was a small collection of human skull and arm bones and a wooden phallic figurine. The inclusion of dogs as deposits was found at a wide variety of sites during this period. In various instances, they were deposited alongside earthenware vessels; at Tibirke Bog in North Sealand, a Pre-Roman Iron Age deposit contained the remains of three dogs interspersed with earthenware potsherds in a heap, close to some complete earthenware vessels, wooden sticks, and stones. As with the preceding Bronze Age, the Pre-Roman Iron Age also witnessed the deposition of rare valuable items into wetlands. Indeed, the latter part of the Pre-Roman Iron Age witnessed the largest number of such high prestige items deposited in these contexts at any point in Scandinavian prehistory. The most prominent examples of these are the Gundestrup Cauldron and Mosbæk Cauldron, both of which were found in Himmerland, Jutland, as well as the bronze cauldrons from Rynkeby on Funen and Sophienburg in North Sealand. These valuable items, all of which were imported goods created elsewhere in Europe, are rarely found in conjunction with other items, such as earthenware, bones, or stone heaps, which has led to the suggestion that they were not placed into the water with elaborate ritual or ceremony. While many of these valuable items were clearly of foreign manufacture, a small number of others appear to have been created within Scandinavia itself, such as a gold torc from Lavindsgård bog on Funen and a neck ring from Løgtved Bog in West Sealand. It is also evident that the Pre-Roman Iron Age witnessed the earliest weapon burials into Scandinavian wetland contexts; these have been found in Hjortspring, although the weapons from Krogsbølle may also be from this date. None show evidence of burning prior to deposition. Such weapon burials become far more common in the ensuing Roman Iron Age and Migration Period. The Pre- Roman Iron Age contained the highest quantity of human remains deposited in wetlands of any period in prehistoric Scandinavia. A variety of bog bodies from this period have been found to have been killed either through strangulation or having their throat slits. Interpretations have typically argued that these individuals were the victims of human sacrifice, capital punishment, or a rite combining both. =Roman Iron Age= The deposition of dogs in wetland sites also continued into the early Roman Iron Age, where again they were often associated with earthenware vessels. One Late Roman Iron Age deposit found in the Hundstrup Bog in South Sealand contained five high- quality worked earthenware vessels; the four smaller cups were found beside one another, with the larger upside-down bowl covering them. During the second and third centuries CE, there is evidence for a range of stable contacts between Northern Europe and the Roman Empire. The social elite in many Northern regions adopted the symbols and in some instances behaviour of the Romans. Lars Jørgensen commented that the archaeological material from the bogs that dates from the Roman Iron Age was \\"so extensive that one can write a fully adequate, exciting narrative about the period.\\" The peak in the number of weapon deposits is in the third century CE, with Jørgensen suggesting that this represented a peak in conflict in the region. Such weapon finds are not found in conjunction with human remains. Although it has faced criticism, the dominant scholarly interpretation of these deposits is that they represent war booty captured from enemy soldiers. In this, the weapon deposits have been termed \\"the spoils of victory.\\" One suggestion is that the deposits represent the fulfillment of a contract with supernatural entities; in such a scenario, the victorious side had entered into a contractual obligation rooted in gift- exchange whereby they agreed to offer up their war booty in payment for victory. Accounts of artifacts being sacrificed to the gods appear on various textual sources authored by Roman writers from this period; one of these appears in the Annals of Tacitus, which claims that after a battle in which the Hermunduri tribe defeated the Chatti in a battle of 58 CE, the victors devoted \\"the enemy's army to Mars and Mercury, a vow which consigns horses, men, everything indeed on the vanquished side to destruction.\\" An earlier source, the Historiae Adversum Paganos of Orosius, states that following the Battle of Arausio in 105 BCE, the victorious Cimbri tribe \\"destroyed all that had fallen into their hands in an unheard-of and hitherto unknown maledictory ritual; clothing was torn apart and thrown away, gold and silver were thrown in the river, the men's armour was cut to pieces, the breastplates of the horses were sunk in the waters, the people were hanged from trees with a rope around their necks\\". Objects discovered in Nydam Bog on display at Gottorp Castle While this scenario provides the possibility for understanding more about conflict in Iron Age Scandinavia, it also leaves open the question of whether the deposits were made by troops engaged in defensive or offensive warfare. Jørgensen argues that the deposits may have been sacrifices made after a successful offensive, with a conquering army taking it from a foreign region and bringing it back to their own for deposition. Ilkjær believed that this model was \\"improbable for purely psychological reasons. Why risk life and limb for a conquest that was anyway to be sacrificed afterwards?\\" For this reason they deemed a defensive armed force to be a more likely candidate for being the victorious depositors. A third suggestion was provided by Hansen, when he argued that they may have been deposited by Scandinavian warriors who had been fighting either for or against the Roman Armies on the limes, and that upon their return they were attempting to seize land; they suggested that this was potentially evidenced by the large number of Roman artefacts in the depositions and the chronological correlation between the two events. It has been suggested that the weapon depositions of this period represented an imitation of Roman sacrifices to the gods, which could have been brought to Scandinavia through the many Northern Europeans who served as mercenaries in the Roman army. However, in Scandinavia the places of deposition were in bogs and lakes, in keeping with ancient tradition, rather than in the temples favoured by Roman society. Other suggestions have however been made regarding the nature of these weapon depositions. In 1857, the Danish archaeologist Jens Jacob Asmussen Worsaae suggested that they represented the detritus of nearby battles which had simply fallen into the wetlands. This was contested by fellow archaeologist Conrad Engelhardt, who demonstrated that the weapons had been deliberately sorted and organised into categories before being deposited. =Migration Period= Scandinavia's Migration Period lasted for approximately two centuries, from the latter fourth to the latter sixth century CE. There is great diversity in the deposits from the fifth to the sixth centuries, with a rapid decline in the number of deposits then occurring in the sixth. Many dress accessories have been found in wetland contexts from the Migration Period. The Migration Period witnessed a large rise in the deposition of fibulae, with many cruciform fibulae being found as single finds in Scandinavian bogs. Gold bracteates from this period, most of which were created in Scandinavia, were also deposited in both wetlands and dryland sites; Kaul noted that with these items, \\"for the first time since the Bronze Age, objects with true, complex Scandinavian iconography were laid in bogs.\\" In Gummersmark near Bjæverskov in South Sealand, eight bracteates were deposited alongside an amber bead, several glass beads, and a decorated silver-gilt fibulae. During the Migration Age, there were a few examples of earthenware pots being placed in wetlands, although nowhere near the numbers that were seen in the Pre-Roman and early Roman Iron Age. It appears that ultimately, these earthenware deposits ceased during the period. One example, from Fjaltring in West Jutland, contained several small earthenware vessels on a number of flat stones. Animal bones, particularly those of horses but also sheep and cattle, were also deposited into wetland contexts in this period. Further, examples of bridle gear worn by horses was also found in some depositional contexts. There are also apparently unique items that have been found from wetland deposits of this period, such as the two gold horns from Gallehus in Jutland. There is a unique example of a well-sculpted wooden male figurine, dressed in Migration Period style costume, that has been found from Rude Eskildstrup in South Sealand. Circa 42 cm tall, there has been debates as to whether it was a representation of a god or a human being. A number of bronze figurines have also been found in the bogs; some of these are Roman imports although others are cruder Scandinavian creation. Kaul suggested that the decline in complex deposits associated with sacrificial practices, which had been present earlier in the Iron Age, indicated that in Migration Period Scandinavia, the locations for sacrifice had moved from the wetlands to areas controlled by the magnate, possibly in a building. Viking Age Scandinavia's wetlands saw the deposition of separated military fittings into the seventh century CE. Antiquarian and archaeological interest Flemming Kaul noted that \\"Many of the finest, most important aspects from our ancient history\\" came from bogs, and that without these bog finds Scandinavian museums would \\"be stripped\\" of their \\"most magnificent pieces\\".

Tech. N.p., n.d. Web. 6 Nov. 2014. The most common type of fibers used in short fiber thermoplastics are glass fiber and carbon fiber . Adding short fibers to thermoplastic resins improves the composite performance for lightweight applications. In addition, short fiber thermoplastic composites are easier and cheaper to produce than continuous fiber reinforced composites. This compromise between cost and performance allows short fiber reinforced thermoplastics to be used in myriad applications.  Mechanical properties  Mechanical properties of short fiber reinforced composites depend critically on the fiber length distribution (FLD) and the fiber orientation distribution (FOD). In particular, the strength of short fiber reinforced composites increases with the increase of the mean fiber length and with the decrease of the mean fiber orientation angle (angle between the fiber axis and the loading direction). The elastic modulus (E) of misaligned short fiber reinforced polymer composites depends on the distributions of fiber lengths and orientations within the composite structure. In general, the composite elastic modulus increases with the decrease of the mean fiber orientation angle and with the increase of the fiber orientation coefficient; and the elastic modulus increases with the increase of mean fiber length when the mean fiber length is small. When the mean fiber length is large, it has nearly no influence on the elastic modulus of short fiber reinforced composites.  Aspect ratio  An important characterizing parameter of short fiber composites is the aspect ratio (s) defined as the ratio between the length (l) and the diameter (d) of the fibers used as reinforcement: :s =\\\\frac{l}{d} The value of s can vary depending on fiber type and design, assuming values from approximately 50 to 500.D.Hull, T.W. Clyne. An introduction to composite materials: Cambridge University Press, 1996. https://books.google.com/books/about/An_Introduction_to_Composite_Materials.html?id=BRcdDu4bUhMC Aspect ratios can affect properties such as the strain to failure and toughness. A higher aspect ratio will result in lower values of strain at failure and toughness, due to angular particles inducing crack formation.Oréfice, R. L., L. L. Hench, and A. B. Brennan. \\"Effect of Particle Morphology on the Mechanical and Thermo-Mechanical Behavior of Polymer Composites.\\"Journal of the Brazilian Society of Mechanical Sciences 23.1 (2001): n. pag. Web. 3 Dec. 2014. http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0100-73862001000100001&script;=sci_arttext.  Void formation  Short fiber reinforced composites are used increasingly as a structural material because they provide superior mechanical properties and can be easily produced by the rapid, low-cost injection molding process, by extrusion and with spray-up technique. An important issue for short fiber thermoplastic composites is void formation and growth during production processes. It has been shown that voids tend to nucleate at fiber ends, and their content depends on processing conditions, fiber concentration, and fiber length. For example, in an injection molding process bubble growth is suppressed by cooling the material under pressure. Density measurements confirm a much lower void content (-1%) in the injection-molded samples in comparison with the extrudates. Another factor playing an important role in void formation is the cooling rate. While the melt is cooled external surface layers solidify first. These layers restrain the contraction of material within the melt. This leads to internal voiding. As a result, slower cooling rates decrease void content in the composite. Finally, in an extruded structure, longer fibers result in higher void contents. This unexpected behaviour is due to the overcoming of other factors like viscosity, extrusion pressure and shear rate, which make the analysis on this phenomenon very complicated.  Simulations and modelling  Short fiber thermoplastics can be modelled as a matrix with fiber inclusions. According to the inclusion model, the stress within the material is proportional to the product of inclusion volume fraction and the stress within a single inclusion. In other words, the stress within the composite is proportional to the fiber volume fraction and the stress on a single fiber. Using Mean Field Theory and the Mori-Tanaka model, the stresses within a short fiber thermoplastic can be modelled computationally. Assuming the matrix is a newtonian material, the creep from an applied shear stress can be approximated from equilibrium thermodynamics. This will yield information about the composite's rheological response.  Applications and processing  Short fiber reinforced thermoplastics have a broad range of applications due to fiber reinforcement properties. Short fiber thermoplastics are able to withstand up to 30,000 psi of applied tensile load and have an elastic modulus on the order of 2 x 106 psi. They are ideal for applications for which toughness is of critical importance, high volume production is involved, and long shelf life and scrap recycling are important issues. With all of these performance capabilities, one of the greatest advantages to using short fiber reinforced thermoplastics is their ease of processing and reprocessability. Ease of processing has been the key factor to the widespread use of short fiber reinforced thermoplastics. Effective processing techniques and the ability to recycle scrap offer significant cost reductions that compare to those of thermoset compounds and metals. Because of this, short fiber reinforced thermoplastics are desired in the electrical and electronic, automotive, oilfield, chemical process, and defense industries. Although short fiber thermoplastics have progressed considerably over the years and have a secured spot in a colossally-sized market, further refinement of compounding and process technology along with improvements in part design could allow the performance window of these materials to widen significantly, allowing them to be used for more applications in the future.  Morphology  Injection molding is a traditional cost-effective method for manufacturing of short-fiber thermoplastics. The processing conditions such as mold temperature and pressure as well as filling time, the part geometry, position and number of injection gates are main factors influencing distribution of fibers. As a result, depending on the total thickness of the manufactured parts as well as the distance from mold wall, different fiber orientation distributions can be observed. In a thin layer in mid-thickness fiber orientations are preferably perpendicular to the mold flow direction, while in two near wall thicknesses fibers are preferably in line with the mold flow direction.  Self-heating  An aspect of thermoplastics which distinguishes them from metallic materials is their time dependent properties as well as relatively low melting temperatures. As a result, the frequency at which a load is applied or rate of applied load is a determining factor on mechanical properties of such materials. Due to low thermal conductivity of thermoplastics, the generated heat due to energy dissipation under applying load results in self-heating or thermal degradation. In short fiber thermoplastics, the frictional heating between fiber and matrix as well as a higher intensity of stress near fiber ends increase the degree of self-heating.

It is certain that Mackay took part in the Siege of Haddington in 1548. 17th-century historian Sir Robert Gordon writes of Iye Du Mackay: \\"served divers tymes in wars upon the borders, against the English: in which service he behaved himself valiantly\\".Mackay, Angus. (1906). pp. 96. Quoting: Gordon, Sir Robert. (1580 – 1657). A Genealogical History of the Earldom of Sutherland. Originally written in 1630, republished in 1813. pp. 136 However, 19th-century historian Angus Mackay states that records show that Iye Du Mackay actually fought for the English and not against them.Mackay, Angus. (1906). pp. 96. Upon the death of his father Donald, Iye Du Mackay returned to Strathnaver to secure the estates, but for twenty years he had to fight against the combined power of George Gordon, 4th Earl of Huntly and John Gordon, 11th Earl of Sutherland, as he could get no legal title to his father's lands. In 1551 a Parliament took place in which both the Earl of Huntly and the Earl of Sutherland had their first innings against Iye Du Mackay, who had already made himself obnoxious to the party of Mary of Guise.Mackay, Angus. (1906). pp. 96 - 98. In 1552 Mary of Guise held a court at Inverness and invited Mackay, John MacDonald of Moidart and the Earl of Caithness, but all refused to appear. According to historian Angus Mackay, Iye Du Mackay knew that attending would mean being clapped in irons and so wisely stayed at home. In September 1553 a complaint was made to the Privy Council and Mackay and the Earl of Caithness were again summoned to Inverness to appear before the Earl of Huntly who was \\"Lieutenant General of these parts\\". The Earl of Huntly failed to capture John of Moidart, and was put in prison by his opponents. The Earl of Sutherland was empowered by Mary of Guise to apprehend Mackay and laid siege to him in Borve Castle. The Earl of Sutherland was joined by Hew Kennedy of Girvanmains who set sail from Leith in a hired ship called the Lion that was armed with cannon from Edinburgh Castle. Iye Du Mackay, finding himself besieged by cannon both from land and sea, slipped away, leaving his cousin, Rory mac-Ean mor Mackay, in charge of the castle. Borve Castle was ultimately broken and Iye Du Mackay was later captured and imprisoned in Dumbarton Castle from 1 February to 20 October 1555. 17th-century historian Sir Robert Gordon states that in Iye Du's absence his cousin, John Mor Mackay, entered into and spoiled Sutherland with the \\"best and most resolute\\" men of Strathnaver but were defeated at the Battle of Garbharry by the Clan Sutherland.Mackay, Angus. (1906). pp. 99. Quoting: Gordon, Sir Robert. (1580 - 1657). A Genealogical History of the Earldom of Sutherland. On 5 October 1562 Mary, Queen of Scots granted full remission to Iye Du Mackay for having supported the English at Haddington in 1548.Mackay, Angus. (1906). pp. 100. On 28 October 1562 the Clan Mackay were amongst those who defeated the Earl of Huntly at the Battle of Corrichie. Huntly was killed in battle and his son, Sir John Gordon, was captured and later executed in Aberdeen. At the parliament held on 28 May 1563, the Earl of Sutherland, who had fled the country, was also condemned to death. This sentence was reduced four years later, when he was allowed to return to Scotland. Disputed lands Map showing the territory of the Clan Mackay that was known as Strathnaver in relation to Sutherland and Caithness. The boundary is marked with a dashed line. (click to enlarge) On 19 April 1567, Parliament ratified the gift from the queen to the newly restored George Gordon, 5th Earl of Huntly, Mackay's lands of Strathnaver.Mackay, Angus. (1906). pp. 101. Huntly later passed ownership of the lands to his cousin, the Earl of Sutherland. It was claimed that Mackay's father, Donald, was a bastard, and he was consequently barred by law from inheriting his father's estates.Mackay, Angus. (1906). pp. 101 - 102. Bastard or not, Donald Mackay had held the lands by a charter under the Great Seal that had been granted to him by James V of Scotland.Mackay, Angus. (1906). pp. 102. Finally on 29 July 1570 an agreement was made between Huntly, Sutherland and Mackay in which Huntly would alienate the Strathnaver lands to Mackay for 3000 merks but would keep the feudal superiority.Mackay, Angus. (1906). pp. 103. Huntly later disponed the superiority over to the Earl of Sutherland. However, by 20 April 1571 Mackay had sasine of the lands of Strathnaver by charter. Later feuds During the years 1570 – 1571 the Gordon Earl of Huntly with the assistance of his cousin, the Gordon Earl of Sutherland assailed the Clan Forbes in Aberdeen with much success.Mackay, Angus. (1906). pp. 104 - 105. However, in the meantime Mackay and the Earl of Caithness swept into Sutherland taking and occupying Dunrobin Castle with many of the Earl of Sutherland's followers failing to oppose them: Murray of Aberscross fled to Strathbogie (Huntly), Gordon of Drummuie to Orkney and Gray of Skibo Castle to St Andrews. Family Iye Du Mackay died in November 1572.Mackay, Angus. (1906). pp. 105 - 106. He had married firstly his cousin Helen, daughter of Hugh MacLeod of Assint. However, as he and his wife were first cousins, their children would be barred by canon law from succeeding their father. They had two sons: #Donald Balloch Mackay (Progenitor of the Mackay of Scoury branch of the clan. He fought at the Battle of Clynetradwell in 1590 and was ancestor of the famous General Hugh Mackay of Scoury). #John Beg Mackay. (Killed in a skirmish in 1579 at Balnakeil, parish of Durness). Iye Du Mackay married secondly, Christian, daughter of John Sinclair of Duns, Caithness. They had two sons and three daughters: #Huistean Du Mackay, 13th of Strathnaver, who succeeded his father. #William Mackay, 1st of Bighouse. (Progenitor of the Mackay of Bighouse branch of the clan). #Eleanor Mackay, who married Donald Bane MacLeod of Assint. #Jane Mackay, who married Alexander Sutherland of Berriedale. #Barbara Mackay, who married Alexander Macdavid, chieftain of the Clan Gunn.

Overview The murder was committed by a woman wearing black gloves and a veiled niqab, who proved to be unknown to the victim. After committing the murder, the perpetrator planted a bomb at the home of an Arab–American physician. These attacks, taking place in the wake of a spate of attacks on Westerners in Saudi Arabia, attracted international coverage and raised concerns in the international security and business communities. The stabbing, which took place in Boutik Mall, an Abu Dhabi shopping mall located on Al Reem Island, and was caught on tape in a routine surveillance video, unsettled citizens and the foreign population of Abu Dhabi because acts of terrorism are an extremely rare event in the United Arab Emirates. The Emirates have classified the murder as a lone wolf terrorist attack inspired by terrorist ideology acquired online. Incident =Murder= At the beginning of the investigation, authorities left open the possibility the murderer could have been a man in disguise.American teacher stabbed to death in restroom of Abu Dhabi mall  Reuters Two days after the murder, on 3 December, Abu Dhabi Police released a statement that, \\"Investigations are still under way to identify the suspect's identity and gender. Witnesses reported that the culprit was fully covered wearing an abaya, black gloves and face cover.\\" Abu Dhabi Security Media Department at the Ministry of Interior posted a video on its official YouTube channel, showing CCTV footage of the suspect, dubbed the \\"Reem Island Ghost\\", who stabbed the American kindergarten teacher Ibolya on Monday afternoon on Al Reem Island in Abu Dhabi.Abu Dhabi Police Security Media - Security Media Releases CCTV Footage of Suspect who Stabbed American Woman on Reem Island On the CCTV footage, people on the scene can be seen reacting to the killing. One mother with a young child can be seen hurrying him away while security guards move towards the corridor. People appear to be alerted to something happening in the toilets and while a security guard moves along the corridor into them, the suspect moves towards the elevators. The video then shows the assailant fleeing the scene following the crime that took place inside the washroom of a shopping mall, wearing a black abaya, black gloves and the face-covering veil known as niqab. Police said the victim was stabbed to death with a \\"sharp tool\\" following an argument in a women's restroom. On the surveillance footage, the robed suspect is seen stepping off an elevator, briefly interacting with a security guard, then taking a newspaper before walking toward the restroom. Some 90 minutes later, the suspected attacker runs back into the lobby as shoppers scatter, shakes off a woman who tries to stop the suspect, and boards an elevator to a parking garage before fleeing. The tape ends with footage of a bloody trail of footprints leading from one of the restroom stalls. On the morning of Thursday 4 December, news sources mentioned that Abu Dhabi Police were able to catch the killer. Later during the day, General HH Sheikh Saif bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Interior in UAE, said that the security and police forces arrested the suspected \\"Niqabi\\" woman for the brutal murder of the American teacher. He emphasized that the suspect was identified in less than 24 hours, and arrested in less than 48 hours. He explained that after committing her first crime, the \\"Niqabi\\" suspect went to another building located at the Abu Dhabi Corniche where she planted a primitive bomb on the doorstep of an Egyptian American doctor's house. The police forces were able to dismantle the bomb time before it detonated.Abu Dhabi Police Security Media - Saif bin Zayed : The \\"Al Reem Ghost\\" in Police Custody Sheikh Saif described the crime as \\"a slap to every noble human value that the UAE cherishes- all of which are derived from the teachings of Islam and the genuine Arab heritage.\\" He stressed that the UAE vigorously defends such civilized values both on its own soil and outside of its borders, and expressed his deep sorrow to witness such crimes in a country that is characterized by security and safety. =Murderer= There was a conflict in information about the real identity of the murderer. While international news coverage mentioned that the murderer was 38-year-old Yemeni-born UAE citizen Dalal al Hashemi, UAE based newspapers mentioned on December 4 that the murderer was not called Dalal al Hashemi.القاتلة المنقبة ليست \\"دلال الهاشمي\\" ودلائل على عمل إرهابي منظم A few months later, UAE based news coverages started to refer to the murderer as Alaa Bader Abdullah,Reem Island Murder Accused Pleads Not-Guilty also called Ala'a Badr Abdullah al-Hashemi. The woman was reported to have been executed in 2015.Fenton, Siobhan. \\"Ibolya Ryan murder: UAE executes woman who murdered US teacher inside shopping mall.\\" The Independent. Monday July 13, 2015. Retrieved on May 31, 2016. =Attempted bombing= Security videos show, and police reports confirm, that Ryan's murderer returned to her car and drove to the home of an Egyptian-American expat physician where she planted a bomb, which was discovered by the physician's son before it could explode. The physician's 13-year-old son discovered the bomb on his way to evening prayers at mosque. According to WAM, the materials used in the homemade bomb were \\"primitive\\". The Security Media Department posted a dramatic YouTube video explaining the details of the crime which included images taken from CCTV. The video also highlighted the search and inspection procedures conducted by the police and security forces, which eventually led to the arrest of the suspect and solved the mystery behind the crime. SBZ - YouTube There are also shots showing the same white SUV that the suspect was seen driving from the scene of the crime. Blood can be seen on the steering wheel and a black suitcase - identical to the one she allegedly carried to the doctor's apartment - are also shown in the police video. In 4 December video, the suspect is also seen heading towards the doctor's home with a small black suitcase. A security guard said he saw her enter and then leave quickly. The bomb was spotted when the doctor's son was going to mosque in the evening to pray and noticed the strange object in front of the house. Victim Ryan was a Romanian-born US citizen. She was the mother at the time of 11-year-old twins, who lived with her in Abu Dhabi, and a 13-year-old daughter who lived with Ryan's ex-husband, Paul Ryan, in Vienna. She self-described as a Hungarian, born and raised in Romania, who taught in four countries including the United States over the past 15 years. She and her husband moved to Sopron, Hungary with their 3 children about 8 years before her death, and subsequently divorced. Classification as terrorism The move to classify the incident as an act of terrorism was not taken lightly in Abu Dhabi, where the economy depends on the labor of hundreds of thousands of ex-pats and on tourism. According to an unnamed security official in the U.A.E. and reported by the official WAM (Emirates News Agency), shortly before the attack the killer had logged on to terrorist websites and \\"acquired the terrorism ideology and learned how to manufacture explosives.\\" According to WAM, the \\"crimes she had committed are the result of a personal instigation and a lone terrorist act.\\" Context The economy of the UAE depends on the tight security for which its member states are noted. The murder followed a September 2014 statement by Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, spokesman for the self-described Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant urging Muslims to murder Westerners and people from any country participating in attacks on the Islamic State — \\"kill him in any manner or way however it may be.\\" The Emirate has taken an important and well-publicized role in that war. The attack can be viewed as part of a \\"trend of terrorist acts through inspiration rather than a direct order from militant groups\\", including the 2014 Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu ramming attack, the beheading of French tourist Herve Gourdel in Algeria, and recent killings of Danish and American nationals in Saudi Arabia. Response The UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) issued new security warnings on 5 December, advising that indiscriminate attacks could be made on foreigners in the Gulf States and elsewhere, \\"Attacks could be directed against British interests. There is considered to be a heightened threat of terrorist attack globally against UK interests and British nationals, from groups or individuals motivated by the conflict in Iraq and Syria.\\" The US State Department's Overseas Security Advisory Council (OSAC) issued a new security advisory, urging Americans in the Gulf to vary their routines and schedules. American Security officials had previously warned expatriates working in the Middle East of a jihadist web posting urging attacks on teachers in American schools. A fundraising effort was launched by the recruitment firm involved with bringing Ryan to Abu Dhabi in order to bring Ryan's body home and provide for her children's education. The Ryan family took control of the fund weeks later and repurposed it to assist Ryan's family in Romania. The expat community in Abu Dhabi was shaken by the murder; security in Abu Dhabi is tight and the country is usually considered safe for foreign workers. Trial In late June 2015, the Federal Supreme Court in Abu Dhabi sentenced to death the accused Emirati woman, Alaa Bader al-Hashemi, for the crimes. The ruling was made by the supreme court, and could not be appealed. Hashemi had reportedly requested the court for psychological help, on account of a chronic mental illness and \\"unreal visions\\". However, psychiatric tests ordered by the court showed that she had been aware of her actions and that her mental condition was not found to have affected her actions. Execution Ahmed Al Dhanhani, Attorney General for the State Security Prosecution, announced that on Monday morning, July 13, 2015, the ruling of The State Security Circuit of the Federal Supreme Court No. 73 of 2015 on the execution of Alaa Bader Abdullah had been carried out, following the approval of President Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan.

Early life and family Born in Thames on 28 April 1925, Brokenshire was the son of Albert Thomas Brokenshire, a plumber, and Elvira Margaret Brokenshire (née Serpell). He was educated at Thames High School, and entered the RNZAF in 1943, and saw active service in the Pacific, attaining the rank of flying officer in 1945. In 1954 he married Noeline Gourley, an athlete who had represented New Zealand in the 80 m hurdles at the 1950 British Empire Games. The couple went on to have three children. Architecture The Hermitage Hotel, Mount Cook Village, with the octagonal \\"Panorama Room\\" restaurant on leftIn 1946, he began studying architecture at the Auckland University College School of Architecture, graduating in 1951. He worked briefly for the Christchurch City Council before working with Dunedin firm Miller, White and Dunn on buildings at the University of Otago. He then moved to Christchurch-based architects Hall and Mackenzie, where he worked on the new Hermitage Hotel at Mount Cook Village, notably designing its octagonal restaurant, and various buildings for the new Ilam campus of the University of Canterbury, including the registry. Pottery He started working with pottery in 1951, alongside his wife Noeline, and became a full-time potter in 1979. He began potting by throwing on a wheel but following a workshop with Patricia Perrin in the early 1960s, who was teaching a hammer and anvil technique using large-scale coils, Brokenshire began making work through hand building. Hand building suited Brokenshire's architectural background, enabling him to build a piece steadily to whatever scale he desired. Brokenshire also incorporated Māori motifs into his work, including modelling some pieces on Māori anchor stones. His work is held in the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, the Christchurch Art Gallery Te Puna o Waiwhetu, and the International Museum of Ceramics in Faenza, Italy. Brokenshire served as vice president of the New Zealand Society of Potters, and was an art critic for The Press newspaper in Christchurch from 1980 to 1984.

Attacking Chinese forces attempted to take the strategic position but were repelled by a combination of heavy firepower and effective counterattacks. After the battle, soldiers from the Black Watch relax at a rest centre and wait to be transported back to the front Background On 14 April 1952 as a result of adjustments under Operation Westminster the 1st Commonwealth Division was deployed. The advanced party of 1st Black Watch had arrived in the divisional area on 8 June and by 22 June the battalion, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel David McNeil Campbell Rose, had completed its concentration and it was arranged that training should be completed by 7 July, after which the Black Watch would join the 29th British Infantry Brigade. Under plan \\"Sovereign\\" the Commonwealth Division received orders on 23 October to take over the sector of the right battalion of the 1st US Marine Division west of the Samichon River. The US Marines on a highly strategic crescent shaped ridge known as the Hook had already defeated a Chinese People's Volunteer Army (PVA) attack known as the First Battle of the Hook a few days before and needed to be replaced for rest. This left sector was to become the responsibility of 29th brigade and to the extreme right, of its line between the Imjin and Kowang-san, was handed over to the Republic of Korea Army (ROK) 1st Infantry Division. This right sector became the responsibility of 28th Brigade with the Canadian 25th Infantry Brigade moving into reserve.Grey pp 143-44 The positions particularly after the US marine battle had been so battered that many in the Black Watch found the defenses to be of little use. Koreans KATCOM's helped to shore up the defenses over the coming days sometimes under shell fire.Barker pp 32-42 Battle On 18 November at about 19:00 two companies of PVA infantry were spotted by a standing patrol on Outpost Warsaw, below the forward positions on the Hook. They radioed a warning back but the patrol was quickly attacked and neutralized by the PVA; half an hour later the company deployed on the Hook was attacked from three different directions.Johnston pp 328-29 Troops from the Duke of Wellington's Regiment watched the battle from their positions on Yong Dong, away, and laid into the PVA with their machine guns firing on fixed lines over the Samichon valley and across the Black Watch for over eleven hours. In addition the divisional artillery pounded the positions in front of the Scots and continued throughout the night. By the end of this time over 50,000 rounds had been expended and a lull in the battle came shortly before midnight as the PVA appeared to have withdrawn. Within half an hour a bugle announced their return; grenades being thrown along with exploding shells and machine gun fire raged with the PVA being plainly visible in the searchlights. Some of the searchlights were knocked out making it increasingly hard to find suitable targets both for artillery and small arms. The PVA managed to get a footing on the position under the pressure of repeated attack on a very narrow front. Despite counterattacks by the Black Watch they were forced back by sheer weight of numbers. Rose called on a counterattack with a search and clearance operation using Centurion tanks of the B Squadron, 5th Royal Inniskilling Dragoons; one tank was knocked out but the Black Watch started to clear the Hook of the PVA and the fighting was still going on at dawn. The Scots pressed forward, and having failed to consolidate their positions the PVA were not prepared to carry on the fight in daylight and they withdrew, as battlefield clearance squads moved in take out the PVA wounded. A few of the Scots had been captured when the forward platoons were overrun, but most had stayed safe in their tunnels and dugouts when their positions were known to be lost and occupied or overrun by the PVA. With the daylight now strong the battle ended with the British troops having retained the position. Aftermath For a second time, the PVA had failed to evict UN forces from the Hook. Canadians notably Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry that had supported the Black Watch took over their positions so they could rest and take care of the casualties. PVA attacks continued throughout the rest of the year and into 1953, at the end of January US troops relieved the Commonwealth Division on the line and the Division was pulled back to rest, reorganize and retrain. The Black Watch returned after two months, and deployed to the Hook with one Rifle company being deployed on each of the features' four hills, Point 121, the Hook, the Sausage and Point 146. Another rifle company was loaned from the Dukes to be deployed on Point 146. The Black Watch found the Hook to be the same as when they left it; a constant barrage of shelling with the PVA habitually targeting the supply route leading up to the back of the ridge, a large proportion of their shells landing close to the Black Watch Command Post. The PVA artillery was based in a semi-circle of hills opposite the Hook, the guns were kept in tunnels, manhandled out to fire and then quickly pushed back again to safety away from UN counter bombardment and air attacks. The Dukes relieved the Black Watch on the night of 12/13 May 1953 and expected to be attacked at any time. They fought the Third Battle of the Hook two weeks later.

He is originally from Bamunka-Ndop, in the Northwest Region of the Republic of Cameroon, and currently teaches French language and literature and serves as Chair of the Department of Modern Languages at the University of Indianapolis.http://uindy.edu/cas/modern-languages/faculty  Biography  Peter Wuteh Vakunta is a naturalized American citizen with roots in Cameroon. He immigrated to the United States in 2001, after serving as a senior translator at the Presidency of the Republic of Cameroon in Yaounde. He earned his bachelor's degrees in Cameroon and Nigeria, as well as his MA and MS degrees in the US and Cameroon.http://www.langaa-rpcig.net/_Peter-W- Vakunta_.html In 2009, Vakunta received a Ph.D. in French and Francophone Studies with a minor in linguistics from the University of Wisconsin Madison where he taught courses in the Theory of African Literature, Contemporary African Fiction, and Intensive English Language. Vakunta is married with five children.  Camfranglais  Vakunta is fluent in English,French, Hausa, and Creole (Cameroon), Camfranglais, and Bamunka. He has lived and worked in France, Cameroon, South Africa, Nigeria and the United States of America. In his capacity as study abroad coordinator, he has traveled with hundreds of students to France, Canada, Italy, Finland, Estonia, Spain, Cameroon, and South Africa. Vakunta writes expertly in all the aforementioned languages. He also writes in and about Camfranglais, a hybrid language largely based on French syntax and vocabulary that has served as a language of resistance in Cameroon since surfacing in the 1970s.UIndy news. Vakunta's writing probes the politics of language. Available at: http://news.uindy.edu/2014/06/11/profs- writing-probes-politics-of-language/ Vakutna has written poetry and critical works in Camfranglais,See, for example, Camfranglais around the Mungo, available at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwpJNYxR-4U including a recent biographical work on Lapiro de Mbanga.Dr. Peter Vakunta's interview with Lapiro de Mbanga, available at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZW4tlDIBulA Vakunta's research focuses on African Studies, canonical questions bordering on the translation of postcolonial francophone literature; it makes explicit the working of the creative impulse in the interface between original writing and its translation into global Frenches. Vakunta's teaching interests border on interdisciplinarity as a locus for discourse on challenging habits of thought; crossing borders in educational globalization; curriculum and instruction; second language acquisition, intercultural skills development, post-coloniality and translational theories. He has had scholarly articles published in the following peer-reviewed journals: Meta 53.4 (2009); Translation Review 73 (2007); Tropos 34 (2008); Journal of the Midwest Modern Language Association (2009); Chimères (2010); Journal of African Literature Association (2009, 2010); Miniatures 58 (2011), and African Literature Today 29 (2011). Vakunta has authored the following fictional works in Camfranglais and Pidgin English: Requiem pour Ongola en camfranglais: une poetique camerounaise, 2015; Tori shweet for Cameroon Pidgin English,2015; Poems from Abakwa in Cameroon Pidgin English, 2015; Takembeng and other Poems from Abakwa,2015; Speak Camfranglais pour un renouveau ongolais,2014; Cam Tok and Poems from the Cradle, 2010,and Majunga Tok: Poems in Pidgin English, 2008.  Indigenization of language  In 2011, Vakunta released a work on literary theory exploring linguistic indigenization in African literature and its implications for literary criticism as well as translation theory. Indigenization, within this context, is defined as \\"the African writer's attempt at negotiating linguistic and cultural spaces in a bid to infuse literary works with the worldview, imagination and sensibilities of indigenous cultures.\\"Vakunta, Peter. Indigenization of Language in the African Francophone Novel: A New Literary Canon. Peter Lang, 2010. Page 2. Analyzing the works of Nazi Boni, Ahmadou Kourouma, and Patrice Nganang, Vakunta concludes that \\"indigenization of language constitutes the single most effective tool with which postcolonial African writers attempt to individualize the use of the French language,\\"Ibid. Page 147. calling for further research into the controversial aspects of language usage in postcolonial literature. In 2014, Vakunta released yet another seminal work on linguistic hybridization titled Camfranglais: The Making of a New Language in Cameroonian Literature This work addresses the emergence of a hybrid code in Cameroon and its usage as a narrative canon in francophone literature. In order to transpose the speech patterns and idiolects of ordinary Cameroonians into fictional writing, creative writers consciously manipulate the French language in an attempt to reflect the socio-cultural realities of the writing context. Linguistic 'miscegenation' has engendered what has come to be referred to as a third code that poses enormous problems for readers and translators not acquainted with the Cameroonianisms that constitute the subtratum on which this language is formed. When creative writers resort to Camfranglais as a literary medium they do so in a bid to superimpose the speech particularisms and value systems of Cameroonians upon a foreign language—in the case of Cameroon, French. In 2016, Vakunta published his first voluminous work on translation theory and practice titled Critical Perspectives on the Theory and Practice of Translating Camfranglais Literature. Vakunta's short stories and poems have appeared in scores of poetic and short anthologies in the United States, Europe and Africa. As part of his cross-disciplinary inquiry, he has conducted four insightful interviews published as follows: \\"Lapiro de Mbanga in His Own Words: An Interview with Dr. Peter Vakunta,\\" in Postnewline (2012); \\"Legalese as a New Literary Canon in African Literature: An Interview with Benjamin Kwakye,\\" in The Entrepreneur (2010); \\"The Ramifications of Linguistic Innovation in African Literature: An Interview with Patrice Nganang,\\" in Palapala Review (2009),and \\"The Pragmatics of Poetic Translation: Interview with Poetic Translator, David Scheler in The Entrepreneur (2009). He has organized panels at conferences where his students have presented scholarly papers with him. The latest conference where this happened was the panel titled \\"The Nuts and Bolts of Translation Theory and Practice in the 21st Century\\" at the Cross-Pollination II Conference hosted by the University of Indianapolis on March 24, 2017. Six of his students were presenters on this panel.Two of his students presented well-researched papers during the 2014 Summer Research Institute at his university. Symposia and colloquia constitute the backbone of Vakunta's research enterprise. He has chaired several panels and presented scores of well-researched papers at the Modern Language Association, Midwest Modern Language Association, African Literature Association, African Studies Association and the American Literary Translators Association. He is a novelist, poet, short story writer and essayist.

The appearance of chessboards in computer vision can be divided into two main areas: camera calibration and feature extraction. This article provides a unified discussion of the role that chessboards play in the canonical methods from these two areas, including references to the seminal literature, examples, and pointers to software implementations. Chessboard camera calibration A classical problem in computer vision is three- dimensional (3D) reconstruction, where one seeks to infer 3D structure about a scene from two-dimensional (2D) images of it.D. Forsyth and J. Ponce. Computer Vision: A Modern Approach. Prentice Hall. (2002). . Practical cameras are complex devices, and photogrammetry is needed to model the relationship between image sensor measurements and the 3D world. In the standard pinhole camera model, one models the relationship between world coordinates \\\\mathbf{X} and image (pixel) coordinates \\\\mathbf{x} via the perspective transformation : \\\\mathbf{x} = K \\\\begin{bmatrix} R & t \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\mathbf{X} \\\\quad, \\\\quad \\\\mathbf{x} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{P}^2 \\\\quad , \\\\quad \\\\mathbf{X} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{P}^3, where \\\\mathbb{P}^n is the projective space of dimension n. In this setting, camera calibration is the process of estimating the parameters of the 3 \\\\times 4 matrix M = K \\\\begin{bmatrix} R & t \\\\end{bmatrix} of the perspective model. Camera calibration is an important step in the computer vision pipeline because many subsequent algorithms require knowledge of camera parameters as input.R. Szeliski. Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications. Springer Science and Business Media. (2010). . Chessboards are often used during camera calibration because they are simple to construct, and their planar grid structure defines many natural interest points in an image. The following two methods are classic calibration techniques that often employ chessboards. =Direct linear transformation= Direct linear transformation (DLT) calibration uses correspondences between world points and camera image points to estimate camera parameters. In particular, DLT calibration exploits the fact that the perspective pinhole camera model defines a set of similarity relations that can be solved via the direct linear transformation algorithm.O. Faugeras. Three-dimensional Computer Vision. MIT Press. (1993). . To employ this approach, one requires accurate coordinates of a non-degenerate set of points in 3D space. A common way to achieve this is to construct a camera calibration rig (example below) built from three mutually perpendicular chessboards. Since the corners of each square are equidistant, it is straightforward to compute the 3D coordinates of each corner given the width of each square. The advantage of DLT calibration is its simplicity; arbitrary cameras can be calibrated by solving a single homogeneous linear system. However, the practical use of DLT calibration is limited by the necessity of a 3D calibration rig and the fact that extremely accurate 3D coordinates are required to avoid numerical instability. =Multiplane calibration= Multiplane calibration is a variant of camera auto-calibration that allows one to compute the parameters of a camera from two or more views of a planar surface. The seminal work in multiplane calibration is due to Zhang.Z. Zhang. \\"A flexible new technique for camera calibration.\\" IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence. vol. 22(11), pp. 1330-1334 (2000). Zhang's method calibrates cameras by solving a particular homogeneous linear system that captures the homographic relationships between multiple perspective views of the same plane. This multiview approach is popular because, in practice, it is more natural to capture multiple views of a single planar surface - like a chessboard - than to construct a precise 3D calibration rig, as required by DLT calibration. The following figures demonstrate a practical application of multiplane camera calibration from multiple views of a chessboard.J. Bouguet, \\"Camera calibration toolbox for MATLAB\\". http://www.vision.caltech.edu/bouguetj/calib_doc/. (2013). Chessboard feature extraction The second context in which chessboards arise in computer vision is to demonstrate several canonical feature extraction algorithms. In feature extraction, one seeks to identify image interest points, which summarize the semantic content of an image and, hence, offer a reduced dimensionality representation of one's data. Chessboards - in particular - are often used to demonstrate feature extraction algorithms because their regular geometry naturally exhibits local image features like edges, lines, and corners. The following sections demonstrate the application of common feature extraction algorithms to a chessboard image. =Corners= Corners are a natural local image feature exploited in many computer vision systems. Loosely speaking, one can define a corner as the intersection of two edges. A variety of corner detection algorithms exist that formalize this notion into concrete algorithms. Corners are a useful image feature because they are necessarily distinct from their neighboring pixels. The Harris corner detector is a standard algorithm for corner detection in computer vision.C. Harris and M. Stephens. \\"A combined corner and edge detector.\\" Proceedings of the 4th Alvey Vision Conference. pp. 147-151 (1988). The algorithm works by analyzing the eigenvalues of the 2D discrete structure tensor matrix at each image pixel and flagging a pixel as a corner when the eigenvalues of its structure tensor are sufficiently large. Intuitively, the eigenvalues of the structure tensor matrix associated with a given pixel describe the gradient strength in a neighborhood of that pixel. As such, a structure tensor matrix with large eigenvalues corresponds to an image neighborhood with large gradients in orthogonal directions - i.e., a corner. A chessboard contains natural corners at the boundaries between board squares, so one would expect corner detection algorithms to successfully detect them in practice. Indeed, the following figure demonstrates Harris corner detection applied to a perspective-transformed chessboard image. Clearly, the Harris detector is able to accurately detect the corners of the board. =Lines= Lines are another natural local image feature exploited in many computer vision systems. Geometrically, the set of all lines in a 2D image can be parametrized by polar coordinates (\\\\rho,\\\\theta) describing the distance and angle, respectively, of their normal vectors with respect to the origin. The discrete Hough transform exploits this idea by transforming a spatial image into a matrix in (\\\\rho,\\\\theta)-space whose (i,j)-th entry counts the number of image edge points that lie on the line parametrized by (\\\\rho_i,\\\\theta_j).L. Shapiro and G. Stockman. Computer Vision. Prentice-Hall, Inc. (2001). R. Duda and P. Hart. \\"Use of the Hough transformation to detect lines and curves in pictures,\\" Comm. ACM, vol. 15, pp. 11-15 (1972).P. Hough. \\"Machine analysis of bubble chamber pictures.\\" Proc. Int. Conf. High Energy Accelerators and Instrumentation. (1959). As such, one can detect lines in an image by simply searching for local maxima of its discrete Hough transform. The grid structure of a chessboard naturally defines two sets of parallel lines in an image of it. Therefore, one expects that line detection algorithms should successfully detect these lines in practice. Indeed, the following figure demonstrates Hough transform-based line detection applied to a perspective-transformed chessboard image. Clearly, the Hough transform is able to accurately detect the lines induced by the board squares. The following MATLAB code generates the above images using the Image Processing Toolbox: % Load image I = imread('Perspective_chessboard.png'); % Compute edge image BW = edge(I,'canny'); % Compute Hough transform [H theta rho] = hough(BW); % Find local maxima of Hough transform numpeaks = 19; thresh = ceil(0.1 * max(H(:))); P = houghpeaks(H,numpeaks,'threshold',thresh); % Extract image lines lines = houghlines(BW,theta,rho,P,'FillGap',50,'MinLength',60); %-------------------------------------------------------------------------- % Display results %-------------------------------------------------------------------------- % Original image figure; imshow(I); % Edge image figure; imshow(BW); % Hough transform figure; image(theta,rho,imadjust(mat2gray(H)),'CDataMapping','scaled'); hold on; colormap(gray(256)); plot(theta(P(:,2)),rho(P(:,1)),'o','color','r'); % Detected lines figure; imshow(I); hold on; n = size(I,2); for k = 1:length(lines) % Overlay kth line x = [lines(k).point1(1) lines(k).point2(1)]; y = [lines(k).point1(2) lines(k).point2(2)]; line = @(z) ((y(2) - y(1)) / (x(2) - x(1))) * (z - x(1)) + y(1); plot([1 n],line([1 n]),'Color','r'); end %-------------------------------------------------------------------------- See also *Computer vision *Projective geometry *Pinhole camera *Photogrammetry *Camera calibration *Feature detection *Feature extraction *Canny edge detection *Corner detection * Structure tensor matrix *Hough transform Further reading # M.

An offset is some means of asymmetrically compensating for a disadvantage, particularly in a military competition. Rather than match an opponent in an unfavorable competition, changing the competition to more favorable footing enables the application of strengths to a problem that is otherwise either unwinnable or winnable only at unacceptable cost. An offset strategy consequently seeks to deliberately change an unattractive competition to one more advantageous for the implementer. In this way, an offset strategy is a type of competitive strategy that seeks to maintain advantage over potential adversaries over long periods of time while preserving peace where possible. The term is used officially to characterize the capabilities of the U.S. military in comparison to possible opponents. Two periods from the Cold War are treated as canonical cases. In the 1950s, President Eisenhower emphasized nuclear deterrence to avoid the larger expenditures necessary to conventionally deter the Warsaw Pact. In a second period from about 1975 to 1989 the term “Offset Strategy” returned, again referring to technological superiority to offset quantitative inferiority in conventional forces. A Third Offset Strategy is associated with the Defense Innovation Initiative announced by Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel at the 2014 Reagan Defense Forum, and U.S. strengths in particular technologies and warfighting domains to offset growing disadvantages U.S. forces face against anti-access and area-denial (A2/AD) systems. Second Offset Strategy Following the Vietnam War, U.S. defense expenditures declined. By the mid-1970s, the U.S. Department of Defense’s annual budget fell by nearly $100 billion in FY 2015 dollars when compared to the peak in defense spending during the late 1960s. Warsaw Pact forces outnumbered NATO forces by three to one in Europe and DoD did not have the funds to increase forces sufficiently to match. Secretary of Defense Harold Brown therefore sought technological means to “offset” the numerical advantages held by U.S. adversaries and restore deterrence stability in Europe. Secretary Brown's “Offset Strategy” emphasized new intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) platforms, improvements in precision- guided weapons, stealth technology, and space-based military communications and navigation. These initiatives were guided by a long-range research and development plan for component technologies and systems led by DARPA. Key resulting systems include the Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) found on the E-2s and E-3s, the F-117 stealth fighter and its successors, modern precision-guided munitions, the Global Positioning System (GPS), and improved reconnaissance, communications, and battle management. Although the U.S. never used Offset Strategy's technologies against the Soviet forces, they directly led to the ease with which the United States expelled Iraqi Forces from Kuwait during Desert Storm. Some historians and military analysts treat the Cold War Offset Strategy as a source of a new \\"American Way of War\\" which redirected American military innovation toward a new era of persistent conflict and hybrid wars. Third Offset Strategy The Defense Department's Third Offset Strategy, which seeks to outmaneuver advantages made by top adversaries primarily through technology, is at heart based on the time- honored military concepts of being able to win a war if necessary but also having enough capability to deter one. The U.S. Department of Defense's Defense Innovation Initiative was announced in November 2014. A core component of the initiative is the formation of a Long-Range Research and Development Planning Program that will purportedly target several promising technology areas, including robotics and system autonomy, miniaturization, big data, and advanced manufacturing, while also seeking to improve the U.S. military's collaboration with innovative private sector enterprises. The Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments released a report outlining the potential components of a Third Offset Strategy in October 2014, shortly before Secretary Hagel's announcement. The report emphasizes the development of next- generation power projection platforms like unmanned autonomous strike aircraft, the acceleration of the LRS-B, additional investments in undersea warfare systems like Unmanned Underwater Vehicles, and steps to reduce U.S. and partner vulnerability to the loss of space-based communications. The principles of the Third Offset Strategy were reflected in the 2018 National Defense Strategy.

It serves as the main base for air ambulance helicopters in the central part of Eastern Norway. It is a base for a Eurocopter EC-135P2+ and a Eurocopter EC145 T2, both operated by Norsk Luftambulanse (NLA). The base became the first permanent ambulance heliport in the country when it opened in 1978. The facility is owned by Oslo University Hospital. History After NLA was founded in 1977, it started working to establish a permanent ambulance helicopter base in the central parts of Eastern Norway.Andersen: 22 Initially the foundation started fund-raising to run a one-year trial with a helicopter based near Oslo. The proposal was rejected by the Ministry of Social Affairs, which stated that the need for such a service would be primarily in remote locations and that an equal service for the whole country would have to be established for state funding.Andersen: 30 As a promotional stunt, NLA allied with the Norwegian Automobile Federation (NAF) and brought an ADAC helicopter to various sites in Eastern Norway. By indicated that each location was a possible candidate for a base, they were able to garnish support from the various local newspapers. However, NAF did not have funds to follow through on the project and pulled out.Andersen: 34 Norsk Luftambulanse started discussions with Akershus County Municipality, who were positive to the service. This resulted in Akershus Central Hospital (SiA, today Ahus) being selected as the initial base.Andersen: 31 NLA's first helicopter was a Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm Bo 105 which was leased from the manufacturer and named Bård 1.Andersen: 29 To aid funding, it received advertisements. The base was inaugurated on 7 June 1978 as Lørenskog Heliport, Central Hospital.Andersen: 14 The initial base was a simple structure consisting of a plastic hangar and a small room at the hospital. The crew received dorms in a nearby dormitory.Andersen: 128 NLA did not have an air operator's certificate to begin with and subcontracted operations to Mørefly.Andersen: 16 High operating costs caused NLA to switch operators to Partnair from 1 May 1979. They proposed moving the base to Oslo Airport, Fornebu to cut costs, but this was rejected.Andersen: 49 In its first year of operation, the base carried out 216 missions. Until Stavanger Heliport, Central Hospital opened in 1981, Lørenskog was the only ambulance helicopter base in Norway. The Eurocopter EC145 T2 The original base had limited facilities and long distances between the crew rooms and the helicopter. This caused the need for a new, compact base, which opened in November 1987. NLA located its Global Medical Services to the heliport. The division was responsible for handling international calls from members regarding medical questions.Andersen: 21 It was moved to Ullevål University Hospital in Oslo in 2002.Andersen: 212 With the opening of the new Ahus in 2008, a new, integrated base was built, allowing the heliport to administratively integrated into the emergency department of the hospital. Facilities The heliport is located on the outskirts of Akershus University Hospital, about from the emergency department. The asphalt heliport tarmac measures . The facilities include a hangar for two helicopters and a fuel tank. The facility is owned and operated by Innlandet Hospital Trust, part of Southern and Eastern Norway Regional Health Authority. It features a hangar and a single asphalt helipad.

Early opposition =Opposition from Marxists= Opposition to Leninism and to the person of Lenin can be traced back to the split in the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party into the Menshevik and Bolshevik factions at the 2nd Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party. Bolshevik opposition to Lenin arose with the emergence of the Otzovists (or Recallists), who opposed participation in parliament. They included Alexander Bogdanov, Mikhail Pokrovsky, Anatoly Lunacharsky and Andrei Bubnov. Menshevik opposition to Leninism and Bolshevism was essentially based on what they saw as Lenin's authoritarian nature and methods for achieving a Marxist state. Such opposition was only heightened following the October Revolution, such as Julius Martov's denunciation of the restoration of the death penalty.\\"Yuliy Osipovich Martov: Down with the Death Penalty! (1918)\\". Anti- Leninism in the context of Russian communism can also be seen in the context of those individuals that wanted Lenin removed as state leader during his reign of 1917–1924, which was both from moderates who saw policies such as war communism as too extreme and hardliners who saw policies such as the New Economic Policy as a capitulation to capitalism. Eduard Bernstein and Rosa Luxemburg have criticised Lenin, asserting that his conception of revolution was elitist and essentially Blanquist. As part of a longer section on Blanquism in her \\"Organizational Questions of Russian Social Democracy\\" (later published as \\"Leninism or Marxism?\\"), Luxemburg writes: \\"For Lenin, the difference between the Social Democracy and Blanquism is reduced to the observation that in place of a handful of conspirators we have a class- conscious proletariat. He forgets that this difference implies a complete revision of our ideas on organization and, therefore, an entirely different conception of centralism and the relations existing between the party and the struggle itself. Blanquism did not count on the direct action of the working class. It, therefore, did not need to organize the people for the revolution. The people were expected to play their part only at the moment of revolution. Preparation for the revolution concerned only the little group of revolutionists armed for the coup. Indeed, to assure the success of the revolutionary conspiracy, it was considered wiser to keep the mass at some distance from the conspirators\\".Rosa Luxemburg, Leninism or Marxism? , Marx.org , last retrieved April 25, 2007. \\"Left-Wing\\" Communism: An Infantile Disorder is a work by Lenin attacking assorted critics of the Bolsheviks who claimed positions to their left. Most of these critics were proponents of ideologies later described as left communism. Left communism is the range of communist viewpoints held by the communist left, which criticizes the political ideas of the Bolsheviks at certain periods, from a position that is asserted to be more authentically Marxist and proletarian than the views of Leninism held by the Communist International after its first and during its second congress. Another early analysis the Soviet Union as state capitalist came from various groups advocating left communism. One major tendency of the 1918 Russian communist left criticised the re-employment of authoritarian capitalist relations and methods of production. As Ossinsky in particular argued, \\"one-man management\\" (rather than the democratic factory committees workers had established and Lenin abolished) and the other impositions of capitalist discipline would stifle the active participation of workers in the organisation of production. Taylorism converted workers into the appendages of machines and piece work imposed individualist rather than collective rewards in production so instilling petty bourgeois values into workers. In sum these measures were seen as the re-transformation of proletarians within production from collective subject back into the atomised objects of capital. It was argued that the working class had to participate consciously in economic as well as political administration. This tendency within the 1918 left communists emphasized that the problem with capitalist production was that it treated workers as objects. Its transcendence lay in the workers' conscious creativity and participation, which is reminiscent of Marx's critique of alienation.Jerome, W. and Buick, A. 1967. 'Soviet state capitalism? The history of an idea', Survey 62, January, pp. 58-71. These criticisms were revived on the left of the Russian Communist Party after the Tenth Congress in 1921, which introduced the New Economic Policy. Many members of the Workers' Opposition and the Decists (both later banned) and two new underground left communist groups, Gavril Myasnikov's Workers' Group and the Workers' Truth group, developed the idea that Russia was becoming a state capitalist society governed by a new bureaucratic class.Fox \\"Ante Ciliga\\"EH Carr, The Interregnum 1923-1924, London, 1954, p80 The most developed version of this idea was in a 1931 booklet by Myasnikov.Marshall Shatz =Opposition from non-Marxists= Initial opposition to Lenin was from those loyal to the Tsar and the status quo of Russian society prior to 1917. This can best be seen in his expulsion to Switzerland. Opposition to Leninism can also be seen in terms of those individuals and states that sought the removal of Lenin once in power. This was best illustrated during the Russian Civil War when foreign powers aided the White Army in their quest to unseat Lenin. During this time, there also came opposition from the Polish state, the Polish-Soviet War and in former Russian territories such as Finland, where the local Whites won the Finnish Civil War. Internally, there were a number of events in Russia that can be treated as representing anti-Leninism: these include the Tambov Rebellion and the Kronstadt rebellion. Socialist Revolutionary Party Vladimir Pchelin's depiction of the assassination In the election to the Russian Constituent Assembly held two weeks after the Bolsheviks took power, the Socialist Revolutionary Party won the largest share of votes at 40% of the popular vote as opposed to the Bolsheviks' 25%. In January 1918, the Bolsheviks disbanded the Assembly and the majority of the Socialist Revolutionaries turned against Lenin. After the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was signed by the Bolshevik government, removing Russia from the First World War, the Left Socialist Revolutionaries also dropped out of the government. They launched an unsuccessful uprising against the government on 6 July. On 30 August, Social Revolutionary Fanny Kaplan wounded Lenin in an unsuccessful assassination attempt. Anarchist anti-Leninism Opposition also existed in the confines of the Russian anarchist movement. Whilst this can be traced back to the initial split between anarchism and Marxism, it intensified when it became clear that Lenin had no intention of dismantling the state in the immediate future. Despite some anarchist events such as the funeral of Peter Kropotkin passing without objection, the anarchist anti-Leninist movement was largely suppressed.Voline The Unknown Revolution; Paul Avrich The Russian Anarchists. This claim would become standard in anarchist works. For example, the prominent anarchist Emma Goldman in an article from 1935 titled \\"There Is No Communism in Russia\\" said of the Soviet Union: \\"Such a condition of affairs may be called state capitalism, but it would be fantastic to consider it in any sense Communistic [...] Soviet Russia, it must now be obvious, is an absolute despotism politically and the crassest form of state capitalism economically\\".\\"There Is No Communism in Russia\\" by Emma Goldman Opposition after 1924 =Marxist Opposition= Whilst opposition to Lenin prior to 1924 was largely opposition to Lenin as an individual, post 1924 it has centered more on opposition to the doctrine of Leninism. Such opposition has come from Marxists who believe the ideals of communism were betrayed following the Russian Revolution and in contrast a form of state capitalism was established.See, for example, the introduction to Pannekoek's Lenin As Philosopher (1938), where he writes: \\"In the Revolution, the Bolshevists […] stood as the foremost representatives of Marxism [… but] a system of state- capitalism consolidated itself, not by deviating from but by following Lenin's ideas (e.g. in his State and Revolution). A new dominating and exploiting class came into power over the working class.\\" Major supporters of this form of anti-Leninism include the Socialist Party of Great Britain as well as the World Socialist Movement. =Non-Marxist Opposition= Opposition to Leninism alongside another varieties of socialism and communism, is still practiced by those that oppose any form of Marxist teachings. There also remains strong opposition to Leninist teachings from anarchist movements, specifically the idea of a revolutionary vanguard. Anarchists When speaking about Marxism, Murray Bookchin said that \\"Marxism, in fact, becomes ideology. It is assimilated by the most advanced forms of state capitalist movement—notably Russia. By an incredible irony of history, Marxian \\"socialism\\" turns out to be in large part the very state capitalism that Marx failed to anticipate in the dialectic of capitalism. The proletariat, instead of developing into a revolutionary class within the womb of capitalism, turns out to be an organ within the body of bourgeois society [...] Lenin sensed this and described \\"socialism\\" as \\"nothing but state capitalist monopoly made to benefit the whole people.\\" This is an extraordinary statement if one thinks out its implications, and a mouthful of contradictions\\".\\"Listen, Marxist!\\" by Murray Bookchin While speaking about Leninism, the authors of An Anarchist FAQ say: \\"Rather than present an effective and efficient means of achieving revolution, the Leninist model is elitist, hierarchical and highly inefficient in achieving a socialist society. At best, these parties play a harmful role in the class struggle by alienating activists and militants with their organisational principles and manipulative tactics within popular structures and groups. , these parties can seize power and create a new form of class society (a state capitalist one) in which the working class is oppressed by new bosses (namely, the party hierarchy and its appointees)\\". \\"H5.

An anti-statist is one who opposes intervention by the state into personal, social and economic affairs. In anarchism, this is characterized by a complete rejection of all hierarchical rulership.  Overview  Anti-statism is present in a variety of greatly differing positions and encompasses an array of diametric concepts and practices. Anti- statists differ greatly according to the beliefs they hold in addition to anti-statism as significant difficulty in determining whether a thinker or philosophy is anti-statist is the problem of defining the state itself. Terminology has changed over time and past writers often used the word state in a different sense than we use it today. Anarchist Mikhail Bakunin used the term simply to mean a governing organization while other writers used the term state to mean any lawmaking or law enforcement agency. Revolutionary socialist Karl Marx defined the state as the institution used by the ruling class of a country to maintain the conditions of its rule. According to liberal Max Weber, the state is an organization with an effective legal monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force in a particular geographic area.  Topics  * Anti-militarism is the opposition to \\"military rule, high military expenditure or the imposition of foreign bases\\". It is an opposition to statist military policy, especially nuclear armament, and is closely associated with pacifism. Anarcho-pacifism is a radical form of these principles. * Civil disobedience is the practiced rejection of the legislative authority of the state. This is usually defined as pertaining to the relationship between the laws of the state and the citizen. Civil disobedience often aims to challenge the legitimacy of a political or judicial ruling through protest. * Disinformation is false information spread deliberately to deceive. * Laissez-faire is the absence of any state intervention in a market economy. The theory of rests on the principles that economic intervention by the government is either impractical, illegitimate or both. * Self-governance is the ability of a group or individual to exercise all necessary functions of regulation without intervention from an external authority. * Surveillance saw the advent of technologies such as high speed surveillance computers and biometrics software. As governments now possess an unprecedented ability to monitor the activities of their subjects, many civil rights and privacy groups have expressed concern that allowing continual increases in government surveillance of citizens will end up in a mass surveillance society, with extremely limited, or non-existent political and personal freedoms.  Forms  Besides Cynicism (contemporary) and Nihilism, there are: = Political theories = Anti-statism is a common element in anarchist and libertarian political philosophy. Anarchism is defined by its principle aim of abolishing the state and its institutions. According to anarchist doctrine, the state is a tool of domination and coercion that is illegitimate regardless of political tendencies. On the other hand, libertarianism seeks to maximize liberty and political freedom as its core principles. This may include either a complete or partial opposition to state power, with the goal of abolishing or restricting the state. Communist approaches to anti-statism centre on the relationship between political rule and class struggle. Karl Marx defined the state as the institution used by the ruling class of a country to maintain the conditions of its rule. To this extent, the ultimate goal of communist society was theorized as both stateless and classless. Political movements may adopt anti-statist principles for other reasons such as aesthetic, ideological or religious beliefs, or as a result of social or political marginalization. Examples of this may include resistance movements under military occupation or a conflicting regime. = Egoism = In egoist philosophy, self-interest is held as the grounding principle of human action, morality or both. Max Stirner proposes that most commonly accepted social institutions such as the notion of state, morality and property rights are mere illusions or ghosts in the mind. In this way, noncompliance to government authority is always justified.

Socialist Perspectives, Edited by Phyllis Jacobson and Julius Jacobson, 1983.Samuel Farber, Cuba since the Revolution of 1959: A Critical Assessment, Chicago: Haymarket Books, 2011  Trotskyism  A Diego Rivera mural (Man, Controller of the Universe) depicts Trotsky with Marx and Engels as a true champion of the workers' struggle. Associates and followers of Leon Trotsky were organized in the Left Opposition within the Communist parties before they were purged in the Moscow Trials in the 1930s. Trotskyists differ from most other ideological manifestations on the \\"anti-Stalinist left\\" in that they, like Marxist–Leninists, also claim to be Leninists. Subsequently, his followers formed the Fourth International in opposition to the Stalinist Third International. Trotsky saw the Stalinist states as deformed workers' states, where a political structure gave most workers very little power in decision making.\\"Class Nature of Eastern Europe\\" Resolution Adopted by the Third Congress of the Fourth International—Paris, April 1951 Trotsky and his followers were very critical of the lack of internal debate among Stalinist organizations and societies and political repression enacted by Stalinist governments (i.e. the Great Purge); nationalist elements of Stalinist theory (the Socialism in One Country thesis, for example, adopted by Stalin as state policy), that led to a very poor revolutionary strategy in an international contest (and breaking with the internationalist traditions of Marxism); and its totalitarian, bureaucratic, obscurantist, personalistic, and high repressive methods (which Trotsky called \\"inquisitorial\\", in a speech that was read and broadcast in English). Less orthodox Trotskyists and other critics of Stalin have seen it as a new form of class state, called bureaucratic collectivism (James Burnham, Milovan Đilas and Max Shachtman) or as state capitalist (Tony Cliff, C. L. R. James and Raya Dunayevskaya).Martin Oppenheimer The “Russian Question” and the U.S. Left, Digger Journal, 2014  Left communism and libertarian Marxism  The communist left was initially enthusiastic about the Bolshevik Revolution, but lines of tension between the communist left and the leadership of the Communist International opened up very soon. Left communists and libertarian Marxists such as Sylvia Pankhurst and Rosa Luxemburg were among the first left-wing critics of Bolshevism.Weitz, Eric D. “‘Rosa Luxemburg Belongs to Us!\\" German Communism and the Luxemburg Legacy.” Central European History, vol. 27, no. 1, 1994, pp. 27–64. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/4546390.Schurer, H. “Some Reflections on Rosa Luxemburg and the Bolshevik Revolution.” The Slavonic and East European Review, vol. 40, no. 95, 1962, pp. 356–372. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/4205366. Council communists, left communists, Luxemburgists, Marxist humanists, and ultra- leftists see communism as something that can only be achieved by the proletariat itself, and not through the dictatorship of a vanguard party acting on its behalf.  Anarchism  Anarchists such as Emma Goldman were initially enthusiastic about the Bolsheviks, particularly after dissemination of Vladimir Lenin's pamphlet State and Revolution which had painted Bolshevism in a libertarian light. However, the relations between the anarchists and the Bolsheviks soured in Soviet Russia (for example, in the suppression of the Kronstadt rebellion and the Makhnovist movement). Anarchists and Stalinist Communists were also in armed conflict during the Spanish civil war. Anarchists are critical of the statist, totalitarian nature of Stalinism and Marxism–Leninism in general as well as its cult of personality around Stalin and subsequent leaders seen by anarchists as Stalinists such as Kim Il-sung or Mao Zedong).  Democratic socialism  A significant current of the democratic socialist movement has defined itself in opposition to Stalinism. This includes George Orwell, H. N. Brailsford,F. M. Leventhal, The Last Dissenter: H.N. Brailsford and His World, Oxford University Press, 1985, (pp. 248–49).

There were also a number of anti- Stalinist socialists in France, including writers such as Simone Weil\\"In August 1933 Weil carried these reflections further in a widely read article in the avant-garde, anti-Stalinist Communist review Revolution proletarienne... John Hellman, Simone Weil:An Introduction to her thought. Wilfrid Laurier University Press, 1982 (p.21) and Albert Camus\\"From well before the Algerian war the Communists in particular held against Camus not so much his anti- Stalinism as his growing refusal to share political \\"positions\\" or get into public arguments...\\" Quoted in Tony Judt,The Burden of Responsibility: Blum, Camus, Aron, and the French Twentieth Century. University of Chicago Press, 2007 (p. 92) as well as the group around Marceau Pivert. In America, the New York Intellectuals around the journals New Leader, Partisan Review and Dissent saw Soviet Communism as a form of totalitarianism in some ways mirroring fascism.Maurice Isserman Steady Work: Sixty Years of Dissent: A history of Dissent magazine, Dissent, January 23, 2014  Titoism  At first, the Communist Party of Yugoslavia and the regime it established through the successful war of liberation against the Axis invaders by the partizans was modeled on that of Soviet Union, and Tito was considered to be \\"Stalin's most faithful pupil\\". However, in 1948, the two leaders broke apart and Tito's aides (most notably Edvard Kardelj, Milovan Đilas, and Moša Pijade) began a theoretical effort to develop a new brand of Socialism that would be both Marxist–Leninist in nature and anti-Stalinist in practice. The result was the Yugoslav system of socialist workers' self-management, also known as Titoism, based on the organizing of every productive activities of society into \\"self- managed units\\". Đilas, particularly, wrote extensively against Stalinism and was radically critical of the bureaucratic apparatus built by Bolshevism in the Soviet Union. He later grew critical of his own regime as well and became a dissident in Yugoslavia. He was imprisoned but later pardoned.  Non- Communist Left  The Non-Communist Left (NCL) was a designation used in the United States Department of State and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) referring mainly to leftist intellectuals who had become disillusioned by Stalin.Saunders, Cultural Cold War (1999), pp. 62–63. \\"The Agency had been toying with an idea for a while now: who better to fight the Communists than former Communists? In consultation with Koestler, this idea now began to take shape. The destruction of the Communist mythos, he argued, could only be achieved by mobilizing those figures on the left who were non-Communist in a campaign of persuasion. The people of whom Koestler spoke were already designated as a group—the Non-Communist Left—in the State Department and intelligence circles.\\" Arthur Schlesinger Jr. highlighted the group's growing power in a popular 1948 essay titled \\"Not Right, Not Left, But a Vital Center\\". Another such publication was The God that Failed (1948), a collection consisting of six essays from former Communists who remained on the left which was edited by R.H.S. Crossman. Winning over and harnessing the power of the NCL became central to the US propaganda struggle against the USSR during the early Cold War.Saunders, Cultural Cold War (1999), p 63. This strategy directly inspired the creation of the Congress for Cultural Freedom (CCF), as well as international journals like Der Monat and Encounter; it also influenced existing publications such as the Partisan Review.Saunders, Cultural Cold War (1999), pp. 162. \\"The headquarters of 'professional' anti- Stalinism was the American Committee for Cultural Freedom, and the magazines whose editors who sat on its board, namely Commentary, the New Leader and Partisan Review.\\" Under these auspices and consequently in fashionable intellectual circles in the United States and Europe, anti-Stalinism became \\"almost a professional stance\\", \\"a total outlook on life, no less, or even a philosophy of history.\\"Philip Rahv, quoted in: Saunders, Cultural Cold War (1999), pp. 161–2. Prominent figures in this group include Arthur Koestler, Melvin J. Lasky, Dwight Macdonald, Sidney Hook, Stephen Spender, Nicolas Nabokov, and Isaiah Berlin. (The NCL notably excluded Jean-Paul Sartre because it could not accept his individualistic existentialist views.)Saunders, Cultural Cold War (1999), p 121. \\"Sartre was the enemy not just because of his position on Communism, but because he preached a doctrine (or anti-doctrine) of individualism which rubbed against the federalist 'family of man' society which America, through organizations like the Congress for Cultural Freedom, was promoting. (The Soviet Union, by the way, found Sartre equally uncongenial, branding existentialism 'a nauseating and putrid concoction.')\\" Key organizers of the CIA's Non-Communist Left operation, titled QKOPERA, included Frank Wisner, Lawrence de Neufville, Thomas Braden, Charles Douglas Jackson and Michael Josselson.Saunders, Cultural Cold War (1999), pp. 99. Other supporters within the intelligence community included George F. Kennan, W. Averell Harriman and General Lucius D. Clay.Saunders, Cultural Cold War (1999), pp. 66. The NCL began to lose its cohesion and its appeal to the CIA during the radicalism of the late 1960s. Opposition to the Vietnam War fractured the coalition, and 1967 revelations of CIA funding (by Ramparts and others) were embarrassing for many of the intellectuals involved. Soon after the story broke, Braden (with tacit support from the CIA) wrote an article in the Saturday Evening Post which exposed CIA involvement with the Non-Communist Left and organized labor.Saunders, Cultural Cold War (1999), pp. 401–402. \\"Richard Helms, who was now director of the CIA, was, according to Rostow's memo, aware of the article, and conceivably of its contents also. The CIA had ample time to invoke its secrecy agreement with Braden, and prevent him publishing the piece.\\" Some argued that this article represented an intentional and final break of the CIA with the NCL.Saunders, Cultural Cold War (1999), pp. 398–399.  New Left  The emergence of the New Left and the new social movements in the 1950s and 1960s led to a revival of interest in alternative forms of Marxism. Figures associated with British cultural studies (e.g. Raymond Williams), Italian autonomism and workerism (e.g. Antonio Negri), French groups like the Situationist International (e.g. Guy Debord) and Socialisme ou Barbarie (e.g. Cornelius Castoriadis) as well as the magazine Telos in the United States, were examples of this.

A character based on the doll is a reoccurring antagonist in the Conjuring Universe. Background According to the Warrens, a student nurse was given the doll in 1970. They say the doll behaved strangely, and that a psychic medium told the student that the doll was inhabited by the spirit of a deceased girl named \\"Annabelle\\". The student and her roommate tried to accept and nurture the spirit-possessed doll, but the doll reportedly exhibited malicious and frightening behavior. It was at this point that the Warrens say they were first contacted, moving the doll to their museum after pronouncing it demonically possessed. The doll remains in a glass box at The Warrens' Occult Museum in Monroe, Connecticut. Texas State University assistant professor of religious studies Joseph Laycock says most skeptics have dismissed the Warren's museum as \\"full of off-the- shelf Halloween junk, dolls and toys, books you could buy at any bookstore\\". Laycock calls the Annabelle legend an \\"interesting case study in the relationship between pop culture and paranormal folklore\\" and speculates that the demonic doll trope popularized by films such as Child's Play, Dolly Dearest, and The Conjuring likely emerged from early legends surrounding Robert the Doll as well as a Twilight Zone season 5 episode 6 titled \\"Living Doll\\" (in which the character of the mother is named Annabelle), released 5 years prior to the Warren's story. Laycock suggests that \\"the idea of demonically-possessed dolls allows modern demonologists to find supernatural evil in the most banal and domestic of places.\\" Commenting on publicity for the Warren's occult museum coinciding with the film release of The Conjuring, science writer Sharon A. Hill said that many of the myths and legends surrounding the Warrens have \\"seemingly been of their own doing\\" and that many people may have difficulty \\"separating the Warrens from their Hollywood portrayal\\". Hill criticized sensational press coverage of the Warrens' occult museum and its Annabelle doll. She said, \\"Like real-life Ed Warren, real-life Annabelle is actually far less impressive.\\" Of the supernatural claims made about Annabelle by Ed Warren, Hill said, \\"We have nothing but Ed's word for this, and also for the history and origins of the objects in the museum.\\" The doll was also described in Gerald Brittle's 1980 biography of Edward and Lorraine Warren, The Demonologist. Character The Warren's story of the doll served as inspiration for the Annabelle doll character depicted in The Conjuring Universe, a film series that includes the following: Annabelle (2014), Annabelle: Creation (2017), and Annabelle Comes Home (2019). The producers did not use the likeness of Raggedy Ann, partially because doing so would require special permission, partially to make the doll's appearance more unsettling for a horror film; its appearance has been described as a \\"terrifying porcelain doll that is disfigured and immediately menacing\\". The character made a brief appearance in James Wan The Conjuring 2 (2016) and Aquaman (2018), as well as The Curse of La Llorona (2019) and Shazam..

The Bennett Juniper is the largest known juniper tree in the United States.\\"2010 National Register of Big Trees.\\" American Forests. Web. 30 Nov. 2014. It is located in Section 5, Township 5 North, Range 20 east of the Mount Diablo meridian,Topographical map of 5-5-20E from USGS, republished by Save the Redwoods League (October 7, 2008). The tree is just south of the center of section 5. on an inholding in the Stanislaus National Forest in Tuolumne County, California. The tree is owned by the Save the Redwoods League, a nonprofit conservation organization dedicated to the preservation of western big trees.  Species  Originally the Bennett was considered to be a western juniper (Juniperus occidentalis). Over time the differences between the northern and southern populations of western junipers justified dividing them into two subspecies and the Bennett is in the southern population which was named Juniperus occidentalis australis. A field guide published by UC Press in 2001 gives the common name Mountain Juniper for the australis population.Stuart, John D., and John O. Sawyer. Trees and Shrubs of California. Berkeley: U of California, 2001. DNA studies (2006) by AdamsAdams, Robert P. Junipers of the World: The Genus Juniperus. 4th ed. Bloomington, IN: Trafford, 2014. resulted in the southern population being raised to species status and it was given the common name “grand juniper” (Juniperus grandis). This name and status are recognized in the USDA Plant Database.\\"Welcome to the PLANTS Database.\\" USDA PLANTS Database. USDA. Web. 02 Dec. 2014.  Age  The age of the Bennett has been an enigma and the subject of several attempts to determine the age. As reported in Madroño, the tree was cored in the 1930s by Glock and he estimated the age as about 3,000 years old.Glock, pp. 24-25. The tree was cored again in 1989 by Peter Brown from the University of Arizona Tree Ring Lab at the request of the current owners of the Bennett, Save the Redwoods League. His estimate based on a short sample was the age was also almost 3,000 years. During this coring it was discovered that rotten wood was reached about into the tree and that the tree was also partially hollow. As a result there will never be a definitive result from a complete core sample. The naturalist Clarence K. Bennett for whom the tree is named believed the tree to be over 6,000 years old. His conclusion was based upon extrapolations of measurements taken either from core samples or cross-sections of nearby trees.Bennett, Clarence K. \\"World's Oldest Living Thing.\\" Pony Express Dec. 1955: 3. Print. An example is a cross-section from a downed juniper about away which was in diameter and 800 years old. About away is the Scofield Juniper stump which is about in diameter and 2700 years old by ring count. A major issue with the extrapolation method is that the Bennett has some access to water in a drainage which is unusual in this area for junipers.  Size  The Bennett Juniper's height is feet with an average crown spread of . The diameter at breast height ( above ground) is . This gives it a total of 573 points by the American Forests formula for measuring \\"Big Trees\\", and by that measure the Bennett is the largest juniper of any type listed in the National Register of Big Trees.National Register of Big Trees 2012, p. 36. American Forests  Location  The Bennett Juniper grows on Sardine Meadow, an open area at elevation just off the top of a ridgeline. The site was heavily glaciated during the last ice age stripping the site of any previous soils. Current soils vary between and thick and are derived from the underlying volcanic bedrock. While sitting in a dry spot, the roots on one side of the tree can reach a seasonal drainage. The area is dominated by low-growing () sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata) and scattered lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta murrayana) and a few juniper. Because of fire suppression since the 1950s there are more sagebrush and young trees (both lodgepole and juniper) than would be historically normal for the preserve. Once the sagebrush established its dominance very few young trees have started since 1960. There are a number of junipers within several miles whose heights, but not other dimensions, rival the Bennett. In each case they are growing on glacial till or, more commonly, a glacial moraine with much deeper soil and water availability.  Human history  The Native Americans certainly visited this area in the summer time, though no specific history regarding the tree is known. Within a half mile (.8 km) of the preserve are five locations with bedrock mortars and several spots where obsidian (often used for tools) was worked. The earliest known sighting, probably in the 1920s, of the Bennett was by Basque sheepherders who described a huge juniper to their employer, Ed Burgson, a local Tuolumne County sheep rancher. The naturalist Clarence Bennett, who had traveled throughout the Sierra studying junipers, connected with Burgson a few years later.Dewitt, John B. The Bennett Juniper. San Francisco: Save the Redwoods League (1988). Print. This was the largest specimen that Bennett had ever seen. Bennett became a champion of getting the tree studied and protected. By the 1950s the Forest Service had named the tree after Bennett.Bennett Juniper Stewardship Project, Save the Redwoods League. It quickly became apparent after a road was built into the area in the 1950s that the Bennett was going to need some protection from visitors. The first attempt was the formation of the Bennett Juniper Association, which placed a monument at the tree in 1963. Joseph W. Martin Sr., the owner of the land on which the Bennett resides, and Clarence Bennett were getting on in years and decided that establishing a formal nature preserve and transferring it to a major established conservation organization was the best method of long term protection for the Bennett. Martin carved out a piece of land from his holdings in the area, and donated it to Nature Conservancy in 1978. The Conservancy was not in a position to manage the preserve, and the cumulative impact from an increasing number of visitors was taking its toll. John B. Dewitt, the Executive Director of Save the Redwoods League, had been a regular visitor to the Bennett for many years. He could see how the site was being degraded and foresaw irreversible damage was on the verge of happening. Although the mission of the League is to protect redwoods (Sequoia sempervirens) and not junipers, Dewitt convinced his Board of Directors that the League should acquire the property and take on the responsibility for the protection of the Bennett. Nature Conservancy transferred title to the League in 1987. The following year the League hired a summer resident steward to manage the visitation and repair previous impacts. The caretaker camps nearby.Caring for one of the oldest living trees in the world, Save the Redwoods League. In 2018, the Bennett was threatened by the Donnell Fire, a wildfire which advanced to within a half-mile (.8 km) of the site. A sustained effort by firefighters on the ground and in the air prevented the fire from advancing further and saved the tree.Andrea Diaz, California wildfire threatens the oldest and tallest juniper tree in the US.

Horrornews.net notes that \\"MM fits nicely into a category of extreme crime and extreme violence like a welcoming cousin. Probably more attuned to sit closer to on-your-shelf films like A Serbian Film, Kalifornia, and I Stand Alone than say Saw or Hostel.

Byrne's large margin of victory over Republican Charles W. Sandman, Jr.—he won by 721,378 votes (66.4%-31.1%) helped Democrats gain 13 seats in the State Senate, giving Democrats control, 29-10, with one Independent. Republicans were also not helped by a divisive primary that saw the incumbent, William Cahill, a moderate, lose to the more conservative Sandman. Cahill barely supported Sandman in the general election. This election marked the first time since 1967 that Democrats controlled the State Senate. History For the first time, the state was to be divided into 40 legislative districts, with each district electing one State Senator and two members of the General Assembly. The districts were drawn first to achieve a population balance (districts were drawn to be within +/- 4% of each other), and then to be as geographically compact as possible. Many districts included parts of several counties. Some districts had more than one incumbent. Until 1965, the New Jersey State Senate was composed of 21 Senators, with each county electing one Senator. After the U.S. Supreme Court, in Reynolds v. Sims (more commonly known as One Man, One Vote), required redistricting by state legislatures for congressional districts to keep represented populations equal, as well as requiring both houses of state legislatures to have districts drawn that contained roughly equal populations, and to perform redistricting when needed. In 1965, the Senate was increased from 21 members to 29 members, and larger counties were given more than one seat, and some smaller counties shared one or two Senators. The map was changed again in 1967, and again in 1971, as the state adjusted to the one man, one vote ruling. Gains and Losses Nine incumbent Republican Senators were defeated for re-election: * District 3: James Turner (R-Gloucester) lost to Democrat Raymond Zane, a Gloucester County Freeholder. * District 6: John L. Miller (R-Camden) lost to Democrat Alene Ammond. * District 10: Richard Stout (R-Monmouth) lost to Democrat Herbert Buehler. * District 12: Joseph Azzolina (R-Monmouth) lost to Democrat Eugene Bedell, an Assemblyman from Monmouth County. * District 14: William Schluter (R-Mercer) lost to Democrat Anne Clark Martindell. the Vice Chairwoman of the New Jersey Democratic State Committee. * District 20: Frank X. McDermott (R-Union) lost to Democrat Alexander J. Menza, an Assemblyman from Union County. * District 27: Michael Giuliano (R-Essex) lost to Democrat Carmen Orechio, the Mayor of Nutley. * District 37: Joseph Woodcock (R-Bergen) lost to Democrat Matthew Feldman. a former State Senator and the Bergen County Democratic Chairman. * District 38: Frederick Wendel (R-Bergen) lost to Democrat John Skevin, a former Assemblyman from Bergen County. One incumbent Democratic Senator was defeated for re-election: * District 35: Joseph Lazzara (D-Passaic) lost to Republican Frank Davenport, the Passaic County Sheriff. Five incumbent Republican Senators did not seek re-election in 1973, and Democrats won four of those seats: * District 5: Frank Italiano (R-Camden), succeeded by Democrat John Horn, the Assembly Minority Leader, from Camden County. * District 9: John F. Brown (R-Ocean), succeeded by Democrat John F. Russo, a former Ocean County Prosecutor. * District 24: Peter W. Thomas (R-Morris), succeeded by Republican James P.

Two incumbent Republican Senators were elected to Congress in 1972 and resigned their State Senate seats in January 1973 to take their seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. Both seats were won by Democrats: * District 21: Matthew John Rinaldo (R-Union), succeeded by Democrat Thomas Dunn, the Mayor of Elizabeth. * District 23: Joseph Maraziti (R-Morris), succeeded by Democrat Stephen Wiley, a Morristown attorney. One incumbent Republican Senator was defeated for renomination in the June primary and Republicans held that seat: * District 22: Jerome Epstein (R-Union), succeeded by Republican Peter J. McDonough, an Assemblyman from Union County. McDonough won 60%-40% over the incumbent, who was facing an indictment. Five incumbent Democratic Senators did not seek re-election in 1973. Democrats won four of those seats, and the fifth was one by an Independent: * District 18: J. Edward Crabiel (D-Middlesex), who briefly sought the 1973 Democratic nomination for Governor, succeeded by Democrat Bernard Dwyer, the Mayor of Edison. * District 19: Norman Tanzman (D-Middlesex), succeeded by Democrat John Fay, an Assemblyman from Middlesex County. * District 28: Ralph DeRose (D-Essex), who lost to Brendan Byrne in the Democratic gubernatorial primary, succeeded by Democrat Martin L. Greenberg, who was Byrne's law partner. * District 30: William Bate (D-Passaic), succeeded by Independent Anthony Imperiale, an Assemblyman from Essex County. (Bate was redistricted into District 34, where Democrat Joseph Hirkala lived; instead of challenging Hirkala in the primary, he instead ran successfully for the State Assembly.) * District 32: William F. Kelly, Jr. (D-Hudson), succeeded by Democrat Joseph W. Tumulty. Ten incumbent Democratic Senators were re-elected in 1973: * District 2: Joseph McGahn (D-Atlantic) * District 4: Joseph Maressa (D-Camden) * District 7: Edward J.

Wallwork (R-Essex) * District 40: Garrett Hagedorn (R-Bergen) Leadership Democrats chose Frank J.

It is the type species for the genus Ichnotropis, and is commonly called the Cape rough-scaled lizard due to them being found in southern Africa's Cape region. They are also called ornate rough-scaled lizard or Smith's rough-scaled sand lizard. The small lizards are terrestrial and occur in grassland, desert and brush areas of southern Africa. Description I. capensis are medium-sized lizards with slender bodies, long tails, and well developed legs. Most of the specimens found are less than 76 mm long in snout–to-vent length (SVL) and share the general characteristics of its genus, including the following: * Keeled or overlapping dorsal scales are present, and the head shields are smooth to slightly rough * Subocular scales border the lip, and no collar is present * Smooth or tubular lamellae are present under the toes, but the toes lack a serrated or fringed edge * The cylindrical tail lacks a lateral fringe I. capensis is notably distinct from the genus in that the hind legs do not reach the underarm of the forelimbs.Allen, Joel (1919)Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History, Vol. 39, American Museum of Natural History, pp. 509 Adults have uniform grey and yellowish brown backs with white lateral stripes that may be bordered with dark black spots. The juvenile has a pale grey and brown back with white lateral stripes. Races There are two accepted races: * Ichnotropis capensis capensis (A.Smith, 1838) * Ichnotropis capensis nigrescens Laurent, 1952 Habitat It occurs in semi-arid shrub savannas of Africa,Kennedy, A., Marais, J., Bauer, M., Lewis, P., and Thie, Monte. (2014) Effect of Fire on the Herpetofauna of the Koanaka Hills, Ngamiland, Botswana. Check List. 8. pp. 666–674 where they seek shelter in soft soiled burrows, under rocks and brush. The species has been reported from South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, and Zambia.Ichnotropis capensis from the Database online Biology These lizards are insectivorous and feed on termites and other small insects. They are active hunters during the day and many specimens have been found around termite mounds.Fleming, P., and Loveridge, John. (2003). Miombo woodland termite mounds: resource islands for small vertebrates?. Journal of Zoology. 259. pp. 161–168. =Mating= The life expectancy is 13 to 14 months, and mating occurs in the spring with hatchlings appearing in late summer from October to December. Females make an inclining burrow in soft soil 100 to 200 mm long and lay 3-9 eggs (6.5 mm x 9.5 mm). The females may have up to two clutches in their lifetime. =Taxonomy and evolution= Based on morphological evidence from the capensis species, southern African genus Ichnotropis and North American genus Psammodromus diverged from a common ancestor in the lineage of Lacerta lepida and Lacerta monticola during the Oligocene epoch (24 to 36 million years ago).Busack, Stephan & Maxson, Linda. (1986) Molecular relationships among Iberian, Moroccan, and South African lacertid lizards (Reptilia: Lacertidae). Amphibia-Reptilia 8. pp. 383-392. =Predators= It is recorded as prey of the shikra and secretarybird, both birds of prey that are native to Africa.Biodiversity Explorer online, Ichnotropis capensisBiodiversity Explorer online, Sagittarius serpentarius They may have other predators as well, as they are small lizards, but there is no evidence suggesting that they are endangered or hunted by indigenous people who live near their habitat.

The album was released on November 24, 2014, by Infamous Records. Background In a November 2014, interview with Nah Right, Prodigy spoke about the album, saying: \\"I did a deal with Boogz so he could promote his label and we decided to name the album to help push his brand. It’s just fun. When you listen to it it’s just fun music. It’s hardcore hip- hop but at the same time the energy that Boogz brings to it just enables me to create a lighter side of my writing aside from doing real dark hip-hop. [I’m] still sticking to my guns and being myself. I’m going to always be myself but it’s just like making songs with Boogz–his personality alone, outside of the music, he’s just a fun person. He likes to joke around a lot, do pranks on motherfuckers so it comes out when he writes. You can tell, his music is just fun. He make that smoker music. Boogz comes from that skater world. He reminds me of my son. My son’s a skater, my son has the same sort of fun personality. That new foundation is just like they ain’t really about beefin’ and drama in hip-hop. They’re just about having fun and making money and doing what they do.\\" Critical reception Homer Johnsen of HipHopDX gave the album three and a half stars out of five, saying \\"For Prodigy, Young Rollin Stonerz is more of an Indie effort, in that there are no famous guests or producers. The production also stands out for its indifference to the Boom Bap sound that molded him into what he is today. As for Boogz, it works amazingly well. And, as far as his career of projects go, this is a watershed moment for the young rapper. But at eleven songs, the better moments of the album aren’t duplicated enough for either artist.

The large segment of related bunyaviruses is approximately 6800 bases in length and encodes a probable viral polymerase. The middle CVV segment has a 4463-nucleotide sequence and the smallest segment encodes for the nucleocapsid, and a second non-structural protein. CVV has been known to cause outbreaks of spontaneous abortion and congenital malformations in ruminants such as sheep and cattle. CVV rarely infects humans, but when they are infected it has caused encephalitis and multiorgan failure.Cache Valley virus. (2012). http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Cache Valley virus.

Journal of Clinical Microbiology, 51(6), 1966–1969. doi:10.1128/JCM.00252-13 The three parts are called the small, medium, and large segments, based on the number of bases. The large segment encodes the L protein, which is the RNA dependent RNA polymerase. The small segment utilizes an open reading frame with alternative initiation sites to encode two proteins. Depending on the initiation site, it can either code for the protein that makes up the nucleocapsid, N, or a non-structural protein, NSs.Obijeski, J., & Murphy, F. (1977, May 31). Bunyaviridae: Recent Biochemical Developments [Electronic version]. Journal of General Virology, 37, 1–14. The medium segment encodes 2 type 1 integral transmembrane glycoproteins, Gn and Gc, as well as a non-structural protein Nsm. The Gc and Gn proteins start as one precursor protein and are then cleaved cotranslationally. They are modified by N-linked glycosylation.Shi, X., Kohl, A., Li, P., & Elliott, R. M.

However, there is information of the replication cycle for the genus orthobunyavirus, which CVV is a part of. A heterodimer of integral transmembrane proteins Gn and Gc form spikes on the surface of the virus particle. They are involved in virus attachment and cell fusion. Once inside the cell, the viral membrane fuses with the endosomal membrane, and the virus genome is released. Transcription involves an RNA dependent RNA polymerase, and it occurs in the cytoplasm of the cell. Transcription of the tripartite genome is terminated by a strong hairpin loop sequence at the end of each segment. Once the virus has replicated enough, it is encapsidated.Orthobunyavirus (n.d.).

Role of Bunyamwera Orthobunyavirus NSs Protein in Infection of Mosquito Cells. PLoS Negl Trop Dis 6(9): e1823. Bunyamwera virus NSs protein is a nonessential gene that contributes to viral pathogenesis. It has been shown that in mammalian cells, NSs induces shut-off of host protein synthesis, which leads to cell death. It also counteracts the host cell antiviral response and seems to be the main virulence factor,Kohl A, Clayton RF, Weber F, Bridgen A, Randall RE, et al.

(2007) La Crosse bunyavirus nonstructural protein NSs serves to suppress the type I interferon system of mammalian hosts. J Virol 81: 4991–4999. it seems the differential behavior of NSs could be one of the factors responsible for different outcomes of infection in mammalian and mosquito cell lines. Human cases Prior to 1956 there were no known cases of acute infections of Cache Valley virus (CVV) in humans. However antibodies against CVV have been reported.Sexton, D., Rollin, P., Breitschwerdt, E., Myers, S., Dumais, M., Bowen, M., & Goldsmith, C, et al. 1997, February 20). Life-Threatening Cache Valley Virus Infection [Electronic version]. The New England Journal of Medicine, 547–550. doi:10.1056/NEJM199702203360804 One study found neutralizing antibody to CVV in 12% of 356 persons surveyed in Maryland and Virginia in the 1960s. These results and other such serosurveys are based on nonrandom sampling and therefore often difficult to interpret.Campbell, G., Mataczynski, J., Reisdorf, E., Powell, J., Martin, D., Lambert, A., & Haupt, T, et al. (2006, May). Second Human Case of Cache Valley Virus Disease [Electronic version]. Emerging Infectious Diseases, 12(5) CVV disease is a neuroinvasive illness. Of the three confirmed human cases of CVV disease two resulted in non-fatal meningitis, only the first case caused fatal encephalitis and multiorgan failure. The first case was a 28-year-old man from North Carolina in 1995. It is likely he was infected with the virus via mosquitos during a deer-hunting trip. The patient's first symptoms were muscle pain, fever, chills and a headache. He began vomiting the day after the first symptoms appeared. Six days after the onset of the illness more severe symptoms appeared including confusion, tachycardia (elevated heart rate), a rash, bilateral conjunctivitis and meningismus. The next day the patient became hypotensive and delirious. Later respiratory failure, seizures and necrosis of the fingers and toes occurred. One leg was amputated because of extensive muscle and cutaneous necrosis. Seven months after the onset of the illness the patient died of pulmonary complications. The causative agent was identified as a virus in the family Bunyaviridae by electron microscopy. This was then identified genetically as CVV. Viremia was recorded seven days after the onset of fever; this is a longer period of viremia than what is normally observed in cases of Bunyaviridae infections. The second human case of CVV was a 41-year-old man from Wisconsin in October 2003. He developed an acute illness with severe nausea, vomiting, fatigue and headache. He was diagnosed with acute aseptic meningitis. After three days the patient was released from the hospital; he reported feeling fully recovered four months later, though he experienced headaches more frequently than usual. The causative agent was observed with electron microscopy as being virions morphologically similar to bunyaviruses. Nucleotide sequencing identified the virus as CVV. The third human case of CVV was a 63-year-old woman in New York, in September 2011. When she was admitted to the hospital her symptoms were fever, headache, neck stiffness and photophobia. A week before she had noticed a lesion on her arm, as this began to fade a rash developed and spread. She then developed a fever and symptoms of meningitis. The patient was discharged, but returned the next day with nausea and vomiting. She was diagnosed with aseptic meningitis. She was discharged four days later. Two months after this she reported ongoing difficulties in word finding and headaches. CVV was identified as the causative agent by PCR, sequence analysis confirmed this identification. It is likely that CVV disease is underreported. Very few human cases have been reported despite its wide geographic distribution and the large number of mosquito species that transmit it. The rarity of CVV disease diagnosis is partly due to the fact that laboratories rarely test for CVV. Therefore, the true incidence of CVV disease and its full clinical range are still unknown. Given the widespread distribution of CVV and other viruses in the same serogroup in the United States it is possible some unexplained cases of severe multiorgan failure, congenital anomalies and human viral encephalitis may be due to CVV or similar viruses. More research of such cases is needed.

(1990). Evidence that cache valley virus induces congenital malformations in sheep. Veterinary Microbiology, 297–307. The virus does not only infect sheep, however, as In 2002 a survey conducted in 22 states showed 28% of cattle expressed specific antibodies to CVV.Sahu, S., Pedersen, D., Ridpath, H., Ostlund, E., Schmitt, B., & Alstad, D.

Cache Valley virus has also been identified as a cause of fetal abnormalities in goats.https://vetrecordcasereports.bmj.com/content/7/1/e000725 Other serological surveys have also shown antibodies to CVV in domestic and wild ruminants, along with horses. Of wild ruminants, deer have a very high seroprevalence. With viraemia lasting 1 to 3 days, they are easily able to spread the virus to vectors including Culicoides midges and Aedes, Anopheles, Coquillettidia and Culiseta group mosquitoes. Therefore, deer tend to act as amplifying hosts to the virus. =Symptoms in sheep= While the virus is able to replicate in adult animals, besides a slight febrile response in some cases, there are no known symptoms of infection. There is a quick period of viraemia before seroconversion and the infection is cleared quickly by the animal's immune system. However, if the animal is pregnant and not protected by antibodies from a previous infection, Cache Valley virus can be very lethal to a developing fetus. The symptoms the fetus develops from CVV infection are largely age dependent. At less than 28 days of gestation, the embryo usually dies and is reabsorbed by the mother.Schoenian, S. (n.d.). Sheep 201: Sheep diseases A–Z. Retrieved December 5, 2014, from http://www.sheep101.info/201/diseasesa-z.html Between 28 and 45 days of gestation, infection leads to malformations in the developing fetus and occasionally leads to abortions. Early in this window, between 28 and 36 days, the virus leads to both central nervous system and musculoskeletal defects, while after 36 days of gestation infection only leads to musculoskeletal deformities. Death of the fetus usually occurs between 27 and 35 days gestation, when the central nervous system tissues are most susceptible. After 45–50 days of gestation CVV infection is not expected to cause harmful effects. After 76 days the fetus has a functioning immune system and antibodies to the virus are produced. Autopsies of infected fetuses show severe lesions in the brain and spinal column, ranging from microscopic in size to whole sections of the brain missing. In one laboratory case, the cerebral hemispheres were nothing more than fluid-filled sacs that were easily ruptured.Edwards, J., Livingston, C., Chung, S., & Collisson, E. (1989). Ovine Arthrogryposis and Central Nervous System Malformations Associated with in utero Cache Valley Virus Infection: Spontaneous Disease. Veterinary Pathology, 26, 33–39. The most common musculoskeletal deformations include arthrogryposis and greatly reduced muscle mass, with the most severe cases having torticollis, scoliosis, and kyphosis. While most affected lambs are stillborn, those that do survive are usually so weak they die within minutes of birth.Redden, R., & Dyer, N. (2011, January 13).

When the virus crossed the placenta and infected the developing fetus, it showed a tropism for the immature fetal cells of the central nervous system and skeletal muscle.

The brick building at left is Station 2, while the two yellow smokestacks at right are part of Station 3. Both buildings were demolished by 2015. Glenwood Generating Station is a power station in Glenwood Landing, New York owned by National Grid plc. It is mainly known for being the former site of an architecturally significant 1920s brick power station. That building and an adjacent 1950s station were demolished over the course of 2013 to 2015, due to their obsolescence as well as the excessive cost of safely retaining the building given its poor condition. Two smaller generators constructed in 2002 remain in operation.  Architecture  Station 2 was constructed in the 1920s and considered significant as a rare surviving example of early 20th-century industrial architecture. It was designed in an industrial Beaux-Arts style, with large arched windows and stringcourse intended to prevent it from becoming an eyesore given its proximity to affluent communities. It was constructed with Flemish bond brickwork and decorative limestone elements. (Document starts on page 27 of file.) It was also constructed to minimize noise and ash pollution. Buildings with such architectural detail were usually found in urban areas, making the Glenwood plant unusual for being far from urban areas at the time of its construction. (Document starts on page 153 of file.) The building was divided into three sections: a narrow four-story administration section to the north containing offices; a five-story turbine room containing a large open space with decorated glazed buff brick walls; and a six-story boiler house mainly filled with equipment, topped by six 140-foot smoke stacks (ultimately reaching 265 feet above the floor slab). At the time of its demolition the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation determined that it appeared to meet the criteria for listing on the National Register of Historic Places, triggering an alternative use analysis. Given the building's poor condition after three decades of disuse, the excessive cost of making the building structurally sound prevented any plans to retain or renovate it.  History  Glenwood Generating Station in 1936 = Construction and early history = The first facility on the site was Station 1, constructed in 1906 and expanded during World War I, which existed until at least 1939. The Station 2 building was constructed from 1928 to 1931 by the Nassau Power and Light Company, a predecessor of the Long Island Lighting Company (LILCO). The extra generating capacity was needed due to a sixfold increase in Long Island's electricity demand from 1910 to 1925. The expansion also reflected LILCO's then-novel philosophy of using few centralized power plants interconnected by transmission lines, rather than many small plants distributed through the region. In 1936 it was described as \\"the key electric generating plant of the Long Island system,\\" and its control room managed LILCO's entire system. In 1939 it was upgraded to burn both coal and oil, and in 1946 natural gas capability was added. In 1942, a 3-hour power outage caused by testing of new distribution circuits affected seven major factories producing material for World War II. These included the Grumman plant in Bethpage and the Republic Aviation plant in Farmingdale, where workers staged an impromptu baseball game while they waited for power to return. Local hospitals and Mitchel Field were able to continue operating under auxiliary power. Although sabotage was not suspected, it caused the colonel in charge of civilian protection for Nassau County to request that the Army guard the power station. The two units of Station 3 became operational in 1952 and 1954. At the time The New York Times called it \\"one of the most modern power plants in the country,\\" with both mechanical and electrostatic precipitators for dust and ash collection, as well as valve silencers and noise barriers. It was the first turbine generator mounted on an open deck in the Northeastern United States. An identical unit was constructed in Far Rockaway, Queens in 1953. = Later history = In 1972, the Town of Oyster Bay board unanimously denied LILCO a permit to further expand the plant with five 50 MW gas turbines, citing air-quality concerns and the effects of the 1970s energy crisis. Town Supervisor John W. Burke at the time noted the board's recognition that \\"in view of the fuel shortage, construction of gas turbines just seems out of step with the direction being taken by the average consumer, who lowers his thermostat and wears a sweater in his home to reduce the amount of fuel burning.\\" The Station 2 generating units were taken out of operation in 1978, but as late as 2009 the building was used for such purposes as a waste water treatment facility for the adjacent operational units, office and warehouse space, and transmission and fiber optic lines. In 1998, as part of a state- brokered deal, LILCO's power generation facilities, including the Glenwood plant, were absorbed into KeySpan Energy, with the public Long Island Power Authority (LIPA) taking over transmission and delivery functions. In 2001, LIPA proposed building two mini-turbines at Glenwood Landing as part of a plan to build ten such plants across Long Island to avoid the risk of rolling blackouts in the face of increased demand like those experienced in California the previous year. The pair of turbines produced 79 MW, just under an 80 MW threshold that would have triggered a full regulatory and environmental review. The new turbines were completed by May 2002, and were the first of the ten to enter operation. As a result of the 1998 deal, LIPA had an option to purchase KeySpan's power plants outright before December 2005. Just before the option expired, LIPA decided to purchase two plants in Far Rockaway and Oceanside with the intention of modernizing them, while there was no provision for immediate modernization of the remaining major plants in Glenwood Landing, Port Jefferson, and the Northport Power Station. KeySpan was acquired by National Grid in 2007. Station 3's utilization decreased from 43 percent in 2001 to 11.2 percent in 2005. As of 2009, the power station was used as a peaking power plant operating in the summer, with two operational natural gas steam-electric generating units with a combined 210 MW capacity. It had a once-through water cooling system using water from the adjacent Hempstead Harbor. By 2014 the Station 2 building had deteriorated to the point where it was nearing condemnation. = Demolition = Station 2 being demolished in November 2014 In 2011 it was announced that the Glenwood Landing station would be shut down and demolished along with its sister plant in Far Rockaway. The two stations were described as the oldest and least efficient of the power plants on Long Island, with the closures saving $76 million through 2015. Local resident Karin Barnaby campaigned to renovate Station 2 for commercial and cultural uses rather than demolish it, pointing to other redeveloped historic power plants in the United States such as the Pratt Street Power Plant in Baltimore and the Homan Square Power House in Chicago. Despite collecting 780 signatures for a petition, this was rejected due to the excessive cost of renovating the building given its poor condition. Demolition was estimated to cost $8 million, as opposed to $31 million to make the building structurally sound without improving it, and $100 million to renovate it into a mixed-use development including an exhibition hall in the old turbine room. Using the building for new power generation capacity was deemed unfeasible because modern generation equipment was incompatible with the building design. Demolition of the plant raised concern about the financial effects on the local North Shore School District, as the over $20 million annual tax payments from the plant provided 20 percent of the district's budget. This led to fears of a 15–19% increase in residential taxes in late 2014. However, it was determined that according to state law there could be no more than a 1% increase in property taxes for a given tax class as a result of a decreased tax assessment in another class (the four tax classes being residential, cooperatives/condominiums, commercial, and utilities). The financial effects on the district would thus have to be mitigated by increased taxes on remaining utilities in the district, as well as a $2.5 million one- time grant from the state arranged by local state legislators. The site's municipal and school payments in lieu of taxes fell from $23.2 million in 2012 to $16.6 million in 2015. Station 3 was demolished in November 2013, and demolition of Station 2 was completed in 2015. National Grid opted for a controlled deconstruction rather than an implosion or using a wrecking ball. The demolition of Station 2 required the relocation of a peregrine falcon nest from the top of one of the smoke stacks. After demolition and land remediation had been completed, the area was planned to be paved over with asphalt and offered to developers. Two gas-turbine peaking generators, three electrical substations, three fuel tanks, and a water tower elsewhere on the site remain in operation.

(Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division), revolving around the character of Phil Coulson and his team of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents as they race to destroy an ancient Kree city before Hydra can get to it and unlock a potentially extinction-level event. It is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), sharing continuity with the films of the franchise. The episode was written by Jeffrey Bell, and directed by Michael Zinberg. Clark Gregg reprises his role as Coulson from the film series, and is joined by principal cast members Ming-Na Wen, Brett Dalton, Chloe Bennet, Iain De Caestecker, Elizabeth Henstridge, and Nick Blood. The episode introduces the Inhumans to the MCU, and reveals that principal character Skye (Bennet) is actually comics character Daisy Johnson, while guest character \\"The Doctor\\" (Kyle MacLachlan) is Calvin Zabo. \\"What They Become\\" originally aired on ABC on December 9, 2014, and according to Nielsen Media Research, was watched by 5.29 million viewers. The episode received a positive critical response, with the performance of guest star Kyle MacLachlan praised, and the introduction of the Inhumans, along with the character reveals, highlighted as groundbreaking and exciting, though also potentially confusing or insignificant to non-comic book fans.  Plot  Immediately following the events of \\"...Ye Who Enter Here\\", S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent Melinda May outmaneuvers her Hydra assailants and flies to San Juan, Puerto Rico, where S.H.I.E.L.D. must race to enter the hidden Kree city below and destroy it before Hydra can get to it. A contact in San Juan reveals to agents Bobbi Morse and Lance Hunter that Hydra has already arrived, setting up residence above the ancient temple said to be needed for an extinction-type of event. Guessing that Hydra intends to drill straight down to the temple, S.H.I.E.L.D. decides to attack straight away. Inside the Hydra base, former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Grant Ward delivers Skye to her father; who introduces himself as Cal. He is regretful for having not been able to raise Skye and protect her himself, but wants to fix that now by helping her fulfil her 'destiny'. He explains that her mother came from a line of people who have gifts, and she was taken by Hydra agents under the guise of S.H.I.E.L.D. Hydra leader Daniel Whitehall butchered her, took the secret to her gift (long-life) and threw her remains in a ditch, where Cal found her, swearing vengeance against Whitehall, the man he is now supposedly aligned with. Realizing who Cal and Skye are, and that Ward isn't loyal to Hydra, Whitehall has the three incapacitated and guarded, but is prevented from taking further action when S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Phil Coulson attacks the base, along with May, Morse, and Hunter, in hopes of disabling the drill before Hydra can reach the temple with the Obelisk. Agents Triplett, Simmons, and Fitz enter the city and place Howling Commando explosives around the temple, ready to destroy it for good. During the fighting in the Hydra base, Cal escapes and finds Whitehall, ready to take his vengeance, but is prevented from doing so when Whitehall drops dead, killed by Coulson. Enraged, Cal attacks Coulson, and only stops when Skye threatens to kill him. He agrees to leave, and reveals that Skye's real name is Daisy. Agent 33, feeling lost without Whitehall, who had brainwashed her, helps Ward escape from S.H.I.E.L.D. and Hydra. Skye, wanting to make things right, goes looking for the Obelisk, and realizes that Raina, who Cal also believes to be descended from the gifted people, has taken it down to the city. There she finds Mack, possessed by the city, who guides her to the temple. Skye follows Raina into the city, and Coulson follows her soon after, against May's advice. Hearing of this, Triplett races to disable the explosives, and then searches for the temple to help Skye. Skye reaches the temple to find Raina waiting for her. The Obelisk floats to a central pedestal, and the temple begins to close itself. Coulson is stopped from entering by Mack, but Triplett manages to get in before the room is sealed. The Obelisk opens, revealing crystals inside that release a burst of mist. Skye and Raina begin to be covered by stone, and in an attempt to save them, Triplett smashes the Obelisk and the crystals. This doesn't work, and the two become fully encased in stone cocoons. Triplett, thinking he has lost his friend Skye, is turned to stone by a shard of the Obelisk. Raina's cocoon begins to crack, her appearance having been transformed during the process, although she is not shown in full in this episode. Skye bursts out of her own cocoon, her new abilities shaking the entire island, but she watches in horror as Triplett's petrified body crumbles in front of her. In an end tag, another Obelisk glows and pulses; apparently alerting a man with no eyes. He calls an unknown person to say that there is someone new.  Production  = Development = In November 2014, Marvel announced that the tenth episode of the season would be titled \\"What They Become\\", to be written by executive producer Jeffrey Bell, with Michael Zinberg directing. = Writing = Talking about the revealing of Calvin Zabo and Daisy Johnson in the episode, executive producer Maurissa Tancharoen said, \\"As we always do, we pulled from what exists in the Marvel Universe and put our own spin on it. We had always had our eyes on Daisy Johnson, and therefore her father and her whole history. We sort of planted that throughout the first season and a half. You knew the story of her parents and the havoc they caused, the massacre in the Hunan province in China. We lay in things like that, and over time you put the pieces together. But of course Daisy’s powers aren’t really activated until that moment you see in the Winter Finale.\\" Continuing on from this, executive producer Jed Whedon stated that \\"There are parts of it that move away from the story in the comics, but partially that’s because we’d invented our own way [of getting there]. We also wanted it to be a surprise to the people who are familiar with the comics, but [it’s] also because we’re tying it to a larger world. [It’s] not just her origin story, it’s the origin story of a bigger, other world.\\" Elaborating on that and the idea of introducing the Inhumans to the MCU in the episode, Tancharoen said, \\"It’s been a property in the Marvel Universe that we’ve been interested in since the beginning. Our tagline when we began the show was “not all heroes are super,” and we wanted to focus on that and highlight that for the first season. Now as we move forward we’re diving deeper into the Marvel Universe, and it’s our way of exploring a whole new world that may be people who have special abilities. We think that’s going to open everything up for us.\\" Also, speaking on the death of Agent Triplett in the episode, something the executive producers do not \\"take lightly\\", Whedon explained, \\"We need to establish that there are stakes in our world, and there can be real consequences. But mostly for us it was for the mixed emotion of that moment, which we’re very proud of. Our whole goal is to have the audience feel something, and to be able to feel excitement and despair at the same time made it seem more powerful to us. It makes for a more complicated journey for Skye going forward, because it’s not all fun and games ... this is something that she may not understand right away. What happened in there, it would be complicated anyway to understand. Now it will be very emotionally complex as well.\\" = Casting = In November 2014, Marvel revealed that main cast members Clark Gregg, Ming-Na Wen, Brett Dalton, Chloe Bennet, Iain De Caestecker, Elizabeth Henstridge, and Nick Blood would star as Phil Coulson, Melinda May, Grant Ward, Skye, Leo Fitz, Jemma Simmons, and Lance Hunter, respectively. It was also revealed that the guest cast for the episode would include B.J. Britt as Antoine Triplett, Adrianne Palicki as Bobbi Morse, Henry Simmons as Alphonso \\"Mack\\" Mackenzie, Ruth Negga as Raina, Patton Oswalt as Billy and Sam Koenig, Reed Diamond as Daniel Whitehall, Kyle MacLachlan as The Doctor, Jamie Harris as man, and Hunter Seagroves as Hydra agent. Seagroves did not receive guest star credit in the episode. Britt, Palicki, Simmons, Negga, Oswalt, Diamond, and MacLachlan all reprise their roles from earlier in the series. Ming-Na Wen also portrays Agent 33. The episode reveals that MacLachlan's character, previously referred to only as \\"The Doctor\\", is actually Calvin Zabo, while principal character Skye is his daughter, Daisy Johnson. On portraying Agent 33, Ming-Na Wen stated that \\"It’s sort of a sad character for me to portray because she’s so opposite from May. May is so confident and knows exactly what she needs to do and can get the job done based on her own opinions and with Agent 33, not only is she disfigured, not only doesn’t she have her face anymore, she doesn’t have her identity anymore. ... I think it’ll be interesting to see how her character gets resolved or how her character evolves down the line.\\" About the introduction of Jamie Harris as \\"man\\" at the end of the episode, Tancharoen said \\"you will learn his character’s name pretty soon.\\" = Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-ins = \\"What They Become\\" reveals that Skye and Raina are Inhumans, thus introducing that species to the MCU. Jed Whedon said that \\"It's been something in the works for a long time. It's an important property in the comics, and they have obviously announced plans for a feature in the cinematic universe. It's one of the first instances where we get to start planting the seeds on the show before the film.\\" In April 2016, the Inhumans film was taken off Marvel Studios' release schedule.  Release  = Broadcast = \\"What They Become\\" was first aired in the United States on ABC on December 9, 2014. It was aired alongside the US broadcast in Canada on CTV. = Home media = The episode began streaming on Netflix on June 11, 2015, and was released along with the rest of the second season on September 18, 2015, on Blu-ray and DVD.  Reception  = Ratings = In the United States the episode received a 1.7/5 percent share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49, meaning that it was seen by 1.7 percent of all households, and 5 percent of all of those watching television at the time of the broadcast. It was watched by 5.29 million viewers. The Canadian broadcast gained 2.33 million viewers, the second highest for that day, and the third highest for the week. = Critical response = Kyle MacLachlan's performance in the episode was highly praised by critics. Alan Sepinwall, writing for HitFix, felt that the episode, as the culmination of many of the season's storylines so far, \\"had a whole lot to squeeze into a short amount of time\\", and also felt that it did so mostly successfully. Sepinwall particularly praised the Skye/Cal reunion scene and the performances of Bennet and MacLachlan, while noting that Triplett's \\"sacrifice probably would have meant more if he had been given more to do this season\\". Eric Goldman of IGN scored the episode a 9.3 out of 10, indicating an \\"Amazing\\" episode, responding positively to the Daisy/Cal and Inhuman reveals and the impact they have on the MCU films, praising MacLachlan's performance, as well as Bennet's, but stating that Triplett \\"died still feeling like an unfulfilled character.\\" Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club graded the episode an 'A-', saying \\"the show is finally realizing its full potential\\", praising the introduction of the Inhumans and MacLachlan's performance, as well as the dramatic weight given to the final scene, though he noted that Triplett's \\"death isn’t quite as impactful as it should be ... because he never really integrated into the team in a meaningful way.\\" James Hunt of Den of Geek praised the introduction of the Inhumans, and the way that the episode tied up multiple storylines, whilst setting up new and exciting ones for the rest of the season. Kevin Fitzpatrick of Screen Crush felt that, from a casual viewer's perspective rather than a comics fan's, the Daisy/Cal and Inhuman reveals were most likely insignificant, and perhaps made the episode a bit of a let-down in terms of a mid-season finale. Fitzpatrick also felt that the Skye/Cal reunion overshadowed the other storylines/relationships in the episode, but did praise the action scenes, specifically the opening dogfight and the Coulson/Cal fight. Some of Fitzpatrick's thoughts were reiterated by Joseph McCabe of Nerdist, who stated \\"Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. hasn’t seen an episode so simultaneously satisfying to longtime comic-book fans and frustrating to its general audience as it does in \\"What They Become\\"\\", noting that the Daisy/Cal and Inhuman reveals would mean nothing to average viewers, as opposed to \\"Marvel maniacs\\" who \\"should be elated\\". McCabe did have praise for MacLachan's performance, calling his reunion with Skye \\"the most entertaining\\" scene of the season, and saying \\"He generates humor, rage, joy, spite, menace, sympathy, and insanity all in the span of a few minutes. ... watching him creepily stroke Skye’s hair as he hums “Daisy Bell” is absurdly entertaining.\\" = Accolades = In June 2016, IGN ranked the episode as the third best in the series.

A continuous line of eight bastions and curtain walls encloses interior fortifications; seven regular polygonal bastions and a single semi-circular or \\"half-moon\\" bastion to the north. Where fully developed bastions consist of two faces and two flanks with fire from the flanks being able to protect the exposed curtain walls and adjacent bastions, curtain walls between the semi- circular and regular bastions at Dashtadem are angled-in slightly so that the former is protected by the adjacent projecting fortifications. The main gate requires one to enter at a right angle from the east of the northern bastion. This design prevented cavalry from charging the entry. Low-relief depictions of lions on \\"panels\\" are upon the exterior wall above the arched gateway. A low-irregular decagonal interior wall surrounds a fortress keep and an adjacent 10th-century chapel of S. Sargis. Five of the ten original semi- circular bastions remain standing. The keep consists of four semi-circular towers (12th century?) that were affixed at a later date to earlier 10th- century Armenian fortifications. Beneath the towers are large cisterns and tunnels that lead to the top of the keep. The structure has been partially renovated in recent years, while the chapel has been entirely rebuilt. On the east wall of the fortress keep is an Arabic dedicatory inscription of 1174, written in Kufic script attributing the structure to Sultan ibn Mahmud (Shahanshah), one of the Shaddadid Princes that ruled in Ani. It reads the following passage: Until recently, the fortress had been home to local shepherds and their families. These individuals have been displaced from the grounds while renovations have been underway.

It lives in grasslands and savannas of Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda and Somalia. The cheetah inhabits mainly the Serengeti ecosystem, including Maasai Mara, and the Tsavo landscape. A cheetah from British East Africa was described by the American zoologist Edmund Heller in 1913. He proposed the trinomen Felis jubatus raineyi as a distinct subspecies. It also was recognized as several other distinct subspecies, such as A. j. ngorongorensis and A. j. velox. In 2017, the Cat Classification Task Force of the Cat Specialist Group subsumed A. j. raineyi to A. j. jubatus. In 2007, the total number of cheetahs in East Africa were estimated at 1,960 to 2,572 adults and independent adolescents. East African cheetahs form the second-largest population after the Southern African cheetah. In 2007, there were between 569 and 1,007 cheetahs in Tanzania, between 710 and 793 cheetahs in Kenya, between 40 and 295 cheetahs in Uganda and approximately 200 left in Somalia. Kenya is the main stronghold for the East African cheetah, with the largest population of 800 to 1,200 adults in the country since 2015. In 2016, it was estimated that more than 1,000 individuals are resident in the Serengeti/Maasai Mara ecosystem of Tanzania and Kenya. Formerly widespread in East Africa, the East African cheetah lost a high percent of ranges and has gone extinct in three countries; the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (the North Kivu province and the South Kivu province), Rwanda and Burundi. Taxonomy In the 19th and 20th centuries, several cheetah type specimens from East Africa were described and proposed as subspecies: *The Scottish zoologist Andrew Smith proposed the scientific name Felis fearsoni in 1834 for a specimen from the northeast of the Natalia Republic. The name was also spelled fearoni, fearonii or even fearonis by Leopold Fitzinger in 1869. Therefore, A. j. fearsoni was never accepted as a scientific name or a synonym. *In 1913, the American zoologist Edmund Heller described a cheetah under the trinomen Acinonyx jubatus raineyi, which had been shot by the American hunter Paul J. Rainey at the Ulu Station of Kapiti Plains in Kenya in 1911. The East African cheetah, also known as Rainey's cheetah was named in honor of Rainey. * Heller also proposed the scientific name Acinonyx jubatus velox for a cheetah shot by Kermit Roosevelt in June 1909 in the Loita Plains, near Narok in British East Africa. He called it African highland cheetah. The skin is darker in color and has large black spots, which are more numerous than in raineyi's, and has the largest body size among cheetah zoological specimen. * In 1913, the German zoologist Max Hilzheimer proposed the name \\"Acinonyx jubatus ngorongorensis\\" for a type specimen from the Ngorongoro area in Tanzania. Other naturalists and zoologists also described cheetahs from other parts of East Africa that were all considered synonyms of A. j. raineyi. In 2005, the authors of Mammal Species of the World recognized A. j. raineyi and A. j. velox as valid taxa, and considered A. j. ngorongorensis synonymous with A. j. raineyi. In 2017, the Cat Classification Task Force of the Cat Specialist Group subsumed A. j. raineyi and A. j. velox to A. j. jubatus, thus recognizing only one subspecies in Southeastern and Southern Africa. Evolutionary history The earliest African cheetah fossils from the early Pleistocene have been found in the lower beds of the Olduvai Gorge site in northern Tanzania. Not much was known about the East African cheetah's evolutionary story, although at first, the East and Southern African cheetahs were thought to be identical as the genetic distance between the two subspecies is low. In the 1990s, it appeared from a DNA research that the East African cheetah is a separate subspecies differing from the Southern African cheetah. In early 2011, results of phylogeographic genetic analysis on cheetah subspecies revealed more about the distinctiveness and significant differences between cheetah subspecies, revealing the connection between the East and Southern African populations. The mitochondrial DNA data shows that the East African cheetah had no common haplotype with the Southern African cheetah, although one haplotype consisting cheetah populations from Tanzania and Kenya clustered with Southern African cheetah. It was suggested that a population in East Africa might be derived from a relatively recent re-colonization events. The mtDNA study reveals that the divergence between the two populations occurred between 28,000 and 36,000 years ago. Physical characteristics A tall female cheetah at Tarangire National Park, Tanzania East African cheetahs measure around in head-and-body length and weigh between . The males are usually larger than females. Measurements on wild cheetahs in Tanzania were taken, and they can measure up to between in length and weighs between . The largest have been recorded in Kenya. Depth of skull and length of mandible are significantly larger in males. It is the second-palest after the Northwest African cheetah. East African cheetahs have a white-yellowish coat to a tannish coat. Their fur are usually quite shorter and leaner, however some can have a thick coarse fur on the belly. It has many round black spots, some can be found on the chests and neck, except on its white underside. The spots merge toward the end of the tail to form four to fourteen dark rings followed by a white tuft at the tip of the tail. Its tear marks run from the corner of the eyes to the mouth which reduces the glare of sunlight in its eyes, which is relatively thick. It also has a slighter build than other African cheetahs. There have been reports about cheetahs of other color variations, such as melanism and ticked. A black (melanistic) cheetah was sighted in the Trans-Nzoia District of Kenya in 1925. A ticked (spotless) cheetah was shot in Tanzania in 1921, it had only a few very small spots on the neck and back. Distribution and habitat In East Africa, cheetahs primarily live on scrub forests, grasslands, savannahs, open fields, steppes and arid environments where preys are available, in which are suitable to be the cheetahs' main hunting grounds. A few can also be found at lakeshores and coastal areas, including mountain ranges. The cheetahs of Amboseli National Park also live in arid deserts of Nyiri. The cheetah's range has the highest density mostly in between northern Tanzania and southern Kenya. The largest populations are mostly found at the Serengeti National Park, the Masai Mara National Reserve, Kora National Park and the Ngorongoro Crater from Tanzania and Kenya, as there were between 569 and 1,007 cheetahs in Tanzania and between 710 and 793 individuals in Kenya. However, in 2015, it is estimated that between 800 and 1,200 adult cheetahs reside in Kenya, making the country the main stronghold for the vulnerable species in East Africa. There are rare sightings of cheetahs at the Ngorongoro Conservation Area and in the Katavi National Park from southwest Tanzania. Populations were estimated at around 40 to 295 cheetahs in Uganda as of 2007. Cheetahs are resident in Kidepo Valley National Park in northern Uganda. It is estimated that only 20 individuals live in Kidepo since 2014. =Former ranges= The East African cheetah has lost most of its historical range, such as in the North Kivu and South Kivu provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and in Virunga National Park. It might share borders with the Northeast African cheetah in Northeast Africa. It is regionally extinct in Rwanda and Burundi. Ecology and behavior =Reproduction and life cycle= Three young cheetahs in Maasai Mara, Kenya Male cheetahs are sociable and often live in a group of other males called coalitions. In the Serengeti, it was found that 41% of the adult males were solitary, 40% lived in pairs and 19% lived in trios.Richard Estes, foreword by Edward Osborne Wilson (1991) The Behavior Guide to African Mammals. University of California Press. Page 371. Male cheetahs are territorial, and establish their territories by marking their territories by urinating on trees or logs. The female cheetah's home ranges can be very large and a territory including several females' ranges is impossible to defend. Instead, males choose the points at which several of the females' home ranges overlap, creating a much smaller space, which can be properly defended against intruders while maximizing the chance of reproduction. Coalitions will try their best to maintain territories to find females with whom they will mate. The size of the territory also depends on the available resources; depending on the habitat, the size of a male's territory can vary greatly from . Female cheetahs can reproduce at 13 to 16 months of age with an average age of sexual maturity between 21 and 22 months. Cheetah cub births mostly occurs during January to August in East Africa after 90 to 95 days of gestation. =Hunting and diet= A cheetah hunting a Thomson's gazelle Cheetahs are diurnal animals (active mainly during the day), whereas the stronger apex predators, such as hyenas, African leopards and lions are nocturnal (active mainly at night). Hunting is the major activity throughout the day; peaks are observed during dawn and dusk indicating crepuscular tendencies. Groups rest in grassy clearings after dusk, though males and juveniles often roam around at night. In Kenya, cheetahs of the Masai Mara hunt after sunset to escape the high temperatures of the day. In the Serengeti, they hunt when the lions and hyenas are inactive. A study in Nairobi National Park showed that the success of cheetah hunt depends on the species, age, sex, and habitat of the prey, and the size of the hunting herd or the efficiency of the hunting individual. It usually eats medium-sized or large mammalian herbivores, such as antelopes. It preys on impala, Grant's gazelle, gerenuk, wildebeest, waterbuck, hare and guineafowl. It even feeds on other large mammals, such as plains zebras and ostriches on few occasions. However, its favorite prey is the Thomson's gazelle. The gazelle is found mostly in savannas, grasslands and open fields of the Serengeti ecosystem of Tanzania and the Masai Mara ecosystem of Kenya, where the cheetah can chase and catch its prey at full speed. In Somalia, cheetahs feed on Soemmerring's gazelles. Historically, Speke's gazelles fell prey to the cheetahs, which were formerly the main prey of the cheetahs in semi-deserts and grass steppes of the Horn of Africa. However, it suffers from population decline and habitat degradation. =Enemies and competitors= Cheetahs are threatened and outranked by larger predators in their area, as they are known to be unable to defend themselves against these predators. In the Serengeti ecosystem, they are highly threatened by East African lions,Denis-Hoot, 198. as they can kill cheetahs, cause high-rate cheetah cub mortality, also steal their food. Other predators such as African leopards, East African wild dogs and hyenas also threaten the cheetahs. Spotted and striped hyenas frequently scavenges from the cheetah kills, and the cheetahs would surrender their meals to the incoming hyenas without a fight. However, coalitions of male adult cheetahs can chase predators away. Even a single cheetah are also known to chase jackals and African golden wolves away from their territory or their food. Threats The cheetah is threatened by poaching, habitat loss and fragmentation. Cheetahs in the Serengeti and the Maasai Mara are affected by infectious disease, although it does not represent a major threat to the free- roaming cheetahs of East Africa. Conservation Three cheetahs at sunrise of western part of Maasai Mara, Kenya The cheetah species is listed on Appendix I of CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species), Appendix I of CMS (Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals) and is protected under national legislation throughout most of its extant and some of its former range. Despite the numerous reserves and national parks for the cheetah, its population still is in decline. There are various conservation projects in order to save the cheetah from extinction, such as the Mara-Meru Cheetah Project, the Serengeti Cheetah Project, Action for Cheetahs in Kenya and the Tanzania Cheetah Conservation Programme.The Tanzania Cheetah Conservation Programme There are currently no known East African cheetahs in captivity. However, in Whipsnade Zoo features displays that inform visitors about ZSL's cheetah conservation project in Tanzania. Despite the conservation project is involved on East Africa, the captive cheetahs of the zoo are actually Northeast African cheetahs. In popular culture * The book The Cheetahs by Alan Caillou tells the story about an Ethiopian family raising a pair of cheetah cubs named Taitu and Amro. A 1989 film released by Disney called Cheetah is loosely based on the book, where the cheetah is a female named Duma (the Swahili word for cheetah) and is adopted by an American family. * The book How It Was with Dooms tells the true story of a family raising an orphaned cub named Duma in Kenya. The film Duma (2005) was loosely based on this book. * Similarly, Roger Hunt successfully tames a cheetah from the Tsavo East National Park in Willard Price's Safari Adventure, after rescuing it from an elephant pit trap. The cheetah soon befriends a German shepherd dog called Zulu. * André Mercier's Our Friend Yambo (1961) is a curious biography of a cheetah from Kenya adopted by a French couple and brought to live in Paris. It is seen as a French answer to Born Free (1960), whose author, Joy Adamson, produced a cheetah biography of her own, The Spotted Sphinx (1969). * Disney's 2011 movie African Cats is about cheetahs and lions in Maasai Mara.

Born in Arraye-sur-Seille (Lorraine), he belonged to a family of native nobility of Vivarais. Jean-Baptiste-Pierre Courcelles, Dictionnaire universel de la noblesse de France, Au Bureau général de la noblesse de France,1822, pp. 73-74.Sources disagree on the commune of his birth: some say Arrage-sur-Seille, which is misspelled (Array-sur-Seille). His father André de Chambarlhac, Seigneur de La Chaux, was stationed at Maubeuge in 1753. It isn't clear if his mother, Marie Mathieu, was also present there. See Nicolas Viton de Saint Allais, Nobiliare universel de France, ou recueil général des généalogies historiques des maisons nobles de ce royaume. Paris, L'Auteur, 1818, p. 301 or Jean-Baptiste-Pierre Courcelles, Dictionnaire universel de la noblesse de France, Au Bureau général de la noblesse de France,1822, pp. 73-74. Family and military service Born on 17 May 1754 in Lorraine, he was the illegitimate son of André de Chambarlhac, Lieutenant colonel and Seigneur de La Chaux, and Marie-Mathieu. Albert Révérend, Armorial du premier empire: titres, majorats et armoiries concédés: Chambarlhac, France, Au bureau de \\"L'Annuaire de la noblesse\\", 1894, p. 201.There is some suggestion that he was actually born in 1752, but not legitimated until 1754, upon the marriage of his parents. See M. de Saint-Allais (Nicolas Viton), Nobiliaire universel de France: Chambarlhac, France, Au bureau du Nobiliaire universel de France, Réimprimé à la Librairie Bachelin-Deflorenne, 1876, p. 302. Chambarlhac belonged to a family of Vivarais nobility, and sources frequently confuse his family line with that of Jacques-Antoine de Chambarlhac de Laubespin, also a baron of empire. Joseph Alcide Georgel, Armorial historique et généalogique des familles de Lorraine. Elbeuf, Chez l'auteur, 1882, p. 162-163For example, Louis-Andre-Antoine Chambarlhac (d 1867) is frequently attributed to Dominique Andre Chambarlhac, but is actually in the Laubespin line. Alcide misattributes parentage; but Albert Révérend places the son with Jacques-Antoine de Chambarlhac. He became a cadet on 1 June 1763, in the King's Infantry Regiment. Admitted to the School of Engineering at Mezieres in 1769, he graduated on 31 January 1773 as second lieutenant and received the certificate for engineering first lieutenant on 18 January 1775. He served successively in such fortifications as Nancy, Verdun, Thionville, Landau and Fort-Louis from 1776 to 1785, and achieved the rank of captain on 30 March 1786. He joined the Vosges volunteers and commanded the Fort-Louis on 11 August 1792. Subsequently, he was appointed lieutenant colonel and engineer-in-chief. As chief engineer, Chambarlhac was responsible for the defense during the siege. Finally, without ammunition, food, or supplies, the garrison surrendered on 14 November 1794; Chambarlhac was not released until 23 September 1795 (1 vendemaire an IV). During his captivity, and in recognition of his gallant defense, on 21 March 1795 (1 germinal an III ), he received the rank of brigade chief and director of fortifications. After his release, he served in Strasbourg, another heavily fortified city, from 16 October 1795 (24 vendemaire an IV). On 9 March 1796 (19 Ventose an V), as chief engineer, joined the Army of the Rhine and Moselle. Throughout 1796, he served in this Army's campaign, supervising the crossing into the German states, and the offensives at several cities. He supervised the technical aspects of the defense of the fortress of Kehl at the end of the campaign, and he was wounded in the leg during one of the French sorties to dislodge the Austrian besiegers. Chambarlhiac supervised the technical defense of the old Vauban fortress at Strasbourg/Kehl. The fortress at Kehl fell on 9 January 1797, and the fortress at Hüningen a month later. On 19 February 1797 (1 ventôse an V), Chambarlhac assumed charge of the fortifications at Landau. He left 29 August 1800 to supervise the refortification of Mainz. The government charged him in 1801 with the demolition of fortifications at Kastel, Ehrenbreitstein and Düsseldorf. On 11 December 1803 (19 frimaire an XII), he received a founding patent of the Legion of Honor. =Napoleonic wars= Sent to the Army of Naples in 1806, Chambarlhac witnessed the siege of Gaeta, and received, after the surrender of the place, the order to go to the Grande Armée. On August 15 of this year, the Napoleon elevated him to commander of the Legion of Honor. He took an active part in the sieges of Magdeburg, at the end of 1806, as well as those of Colberg and Stralsund, and the defense of the citadel of Passau in 1808. The following year, the War Minister entrusted him with the restoration of the fortifications of this place and the establishment of the bridgehead Lintz. He followed this assignment as inspection of fortresses and bridges in the Netherlands, where he was in charge in 1810, earning him (6 October 1809) the title of baron of the Empire. Émile Campardon, Liste des membres de la noblesse impériale. Au siège de la Société, 1889, p. 41. In 1811, he completed the fortifications of Danzig and contributed, two years later, to its defense. Imprisoned in Stettin in 1813 and 1814, Chambarlhac returned to France after Napoleon's abdication. On 27 June 1814, Louis XVIII gave Chambarlhac the Cross of St. Louis and appointed him Lieutenant-General Emeritus on 20 August. During his Hundred Days, Napoleon confirmed Chambarlhac in that grade by decree of 18 April 1815. Chambarlhac retired on October 18 that year, and died on 4 August 1823 in Paris, Île-de-France. =Promotions and Honors= Chambarlhac received the following promotions, assignments and awards: *Cadet 1 June 1763 Royal Infantry *Engineering school, 1769 *Lieutenant 31 January 1773 *Captain 30 March 1786 *Lietuenant colonel/engineer in chief, Vosges Volunteers 8 November 1792 *Prisoner of War after the surrender of Saint- Louis, 14 November 1793 -23 September 1795 *Chef of brigade and Director of Fortifications, 21 March 1795 *General of Brigade 1 February 1805 *Commander Legion of Honor, 15 August 1806 *Fortifications Inspector Holland 1810 *Fortifications of Stettin 1813-1814 *Lieutenant-General honorary 27 June 1814 (by Louis XVIII) *Chevalier of the Order of Saint Louis 27 June 1814 *Retirement 18 October 1815 Notes and citations =Notes= =Citations= Category:French commanders of the Napoleonic Wars Category:French Republican military leaders of the French Revolutionary Wars Category:1754 births Category:1823 deaths ","title":"Dominique-André de Chambarlhac"},{"id":"44591147","text":"The Sayyid of Martyrs Battalions, or Kata'ib Sayyid al-Shuhada (KSS) (, The Battalion of the Sayyid's Martyrs) is an Iraqi Shia militia formed in 2013.

Photograph provided by Elizabeth Bush, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. The tomato leaf mold fungus is a specific pathogen of tomato plant Lycopersicon, this pathogen has restricted host range (host specific pathogen) that only infects tomatoes, mainly in greenhouses. The symptoms of this disease commonly occurs on foliage, and it develops on both sides of the leaf on the adaxial and abaxial surface. The older leaves are infected first and then the disease moves up towards young leaves. Symptoms of tomato leaf mold appear usually with foliage, but fruit infection is rare. The primary symptom appear on the upper surface of infected leaves as a small spot pale green or yellowish with indefinite margins, and on corresponding area of the lower surface, the fungus begins to sporulate. The diagnostic symptom develops on lower surface as an olive green to grayish purple and velvety appearance, which are composed of spores (conidia).AVRDC - The World Vegetable Center. Tomato Diseases Leaf Mold. Continuously, the color of the infected leaf changes to yellowish brown and the leaf begins to curl and dry. The leaves will drop upon reaching a premature stage, and the defoliation of the infected host will cause further infection. This disease develops well in relative humidity levels above 85%. When the temperature reaches optimum level for germinating, the host will be infected by the pathogen. Occasionally, this pathogen causes disease on the fruit or blossoms with various symptoms. Fruits such as green and ripe one will develop dark rot on the stem. The blossoms will be killed before fruits grow.  Environment  Free water is required for Cladosporium fulvum to germinate, spores are unable to infect the perfectly dried leaf. Spores germinate in the leaf surface with free water and humidity with above 85%.High Plains IPM Guide, a cooperative effort of the University of Wyoming, University of Nebraska, Colorado State University and Montana State University. Cladosporium Leaf Mold. This pathogen can survive at least one year without a host which is called non-obligate. The temperature must be between 40°~94 °F (4°~34 °C) for germinating spore. The pathogen usually infects the leaves by penetrating through stomata in a high humidity level.  Disease Cycle  The life cycle starts with the fungus overwintering as sclerotia on plants debris, in seeds and in soils as a saprophyte. Conidia also play an important role as a survival structure, once they are resistant to drying, and might survive up to one year in the absence of a susceptible host. When condition are favorable the sclerotia produce new conidia, which act as primary inoculum to infect plants. The conidia produce mycelium that infects the plant through stomata when humidity is 85% or higher and produce conidiophores on the abaxial leaf surface of infected leaves. The symptoms usually start to appear 10 days after inoculation with spore formation, a large number of conidia are produced and these spores are easily spread from plant to plant by the wind, splash water, on tools, clothing of workers and also by insects. Spores are highly dependent on weather condition to germinate, thus they only geminate in water films or when the humidity level are superior than 85%, at temperature among 40° and 94 °F (4° and 34 °C). However the optimum temperature for germination is among 75° and 78 °F (24° and 26 °C). Reproduction Although it was previously considered that C. fulvum only reproduces asexually, the discovery of mating type genes indicated a capability for sexual reproduction.Stergiopoulos I, Groenewald M, Staats M, Lindhout P, Crous PW, De Wit PJ. Mating-type genes and the genetic structure of a world-wide collection of the tomato pathogen Cladosporium fulvum. Fungal Genet Biol. 2007 May;44(5):415-29. Epub 2006 Dec 18. PMID: 17178244 These mating type genes have high similarity to homologous genes in other ascomycete fungi.  Management  The disease management or control can be divided into two main groups: disease control in greenhouse and disease control in the field. Both controls are very similar. The differences are presented in few controls adopted in greenhouse in which some environmental conditions are controlled such as humidity and temperature as well sanitization of the greenhouse. = Culture = The first strategy of management is the cultural practices for reducing the disease. It includes adequating row and plant spacing that promote better air circulation through the canopy reducing the humidity; preventing excessive nitrogen on fertilization since nitrogen out of balance enhances foliage disease development; keeping the relatively humidity below 85% (suitable on greenhouse), promote air circulation inside the greenhouse, early planting might to reduce the disease severity and seed treatment with hot water (25 minutes at 122 °F or 50 °C). = Sanitation = The second strategy of management is the sanitization control in order to reduce the primary inoculum. Remove and destroy (burn) all plants debris after the harvest, scout for disease and rogue infected plants as soon as detected and steam sanitization the greenhouse between crops. = Resistance = The most effective and widespread method of disease control is to use resistant cultivars. However, only few resistant cultivar to tomato leaf mold are known such as Caruso, Capello, Cobra (race 5), Jumbo and Dombito (races 1 and 2). Moreover, this disease is not considered an important disease for breeding field tomatoes. = Chemical Control = The least but not the less important management is the chemical control that ensure good control of the disease. The chemical control is basically spraying fungicide as soon as the symptoms are evident. Compounds registered for using are: chlorothalonil, maneb, mancozeb and copper.  Importance  Tomato leaf mold is a plant disease originated from the South and Central America. In 1883, Cooke first discovered the tomato leaf mold in North Carolina. This disease is not common on the fruit, but if the control is not run, the foliage can be greatly damaged and result in significant yield losses. Once the spores of this fungi are spread by air, water, tools and insects,Tomato Leaf Mold, Helen Margaret Griffiths http://www.ballpublishing.com/growertalks/ViewArticle.aspx?articleid=20665 the development of the disease is quick, moving from lower to upper leaves; the controlling must be done as soon as possible. It includes avoiding water on the surface of leaves, handling plants in high humidity, and in the worst case, disinfecting the whole greenhouse.

It was released by CBS Columbia. The album helped establish Ali's reputation as an eloquently poetic \\"trash talker\\". The album has also been identified as an early example of rap music and a precursor to hip hop music. Overview The liner notes were written by the American poet Marianne Moore, a longstanding fan of Clay. Clay collaborated on the writing for the album with the comedy writer Gary Belkin, who was listed as producer on the original release and later as a co-writer in a 1999 re-release.Martin, Douglas, \\"Gary Belkin, 79, Dies; Wrote Comedy for TV Variety Shows\\", New York Times, August 4, 2005. Belkin would later claim he had largely ghost-written the works, although Belkin's assertions have been disputed (e.g., by George Plimpton and David Remnick).Paul Beatty, Hokum An Anthology of African American Humor, 2008, p. 463 The album idea had been proposed to Clay by the William Morris Agency, and the recording was conducted at Columbia Records' 30th Street New York Studio before an audience of 200 people. Rather than being listed as \\"tracks\\", the first 8 entries on the album were listed with \\"rounds\\" numbers, and Billboard duly noted that Clay claimed he would beat Sonny Liston in 8 rounds.Billboard, August, 1963, Cassius Clay Cuts Record in Eight Although Clay's remarks were treated skeptically at the time as mere promotional bragging, when the Liston fight was held the following February, Clay won in a major upset when Liston gave up after only 6 rounds. Clay had proved tougher than expected from the beginning, and he began to dominate the fight in the third round. Despite being nearly blinded in the fourth round – apparently by an ointment used on a cut on Liston's face – Clay recovered, and by the end of the sixth round he was landing blow-after-blow in combinations, almost at will. At the opening of the seventh round, Liston spat out his mouth guard and refused to rise to continue. On the day after the fight, it was disclosed that Clay had joined the Nation of Islam (which was confirmed by Clay himself the following day), and a week later its leader Elijah Muhammad announced that Clay would change his name to Muhammad Ali. Following his upset victory and other major news, there was a surge in demand for the LP of the previous August. To take advantage of the moment, the title track \\"I Am The Greatest\\" was also released as a single, with the B-side \\"Will The Real Sonny Liston Please Fall Down\\". The phenomenon became a significant event in the musical culture that year.Billboard, March 7, 1964, full story on page 4. \\"I Am The Greatest\\" was also released as a single with Clay singing his cover of the Ben E.

I Am the Greatest reached number 61 on the album chart, and sold 500,000 copies in the United States. Certain tracks on the album have been identified as rap music, such as \\"Will The Real Sonny Liston Please Fall Down\\" which is identified as the first rap battle track.

Her prolific work addressed individualism, futurism, religion and \\"feminility\\" among other topics. Biography =Family and early adolescence= As an adolescent, Leda showed obvious talent at writing. Her poem, Le gomene, was published by Filippo Turati in the newspaper of the Italian Socialist Party (PSI). At a very young age she moved with her parents to Alexandria, coming into contact with the anarchists who congregated at \\"The Red Barn,\\" including writer and poet Giuseppe Ungaretti and Enrico Pea. Still a teenager, Rafanelli learned typesetting and became a proponent of individualist anarchism. These years would be depicted many decades later by Maurizio Maggiani in Il coraggio del pettirosso. =Leda in Alexandria= Although many individualist anarchists would side in favor of World War I as interventionists, Leda confirmed her pacifist convictions. In contrast, the Manifesto of the Sixteen, signed by anarchist communist Peter Kropotkin among others in 1915, supported Italy's entry into the war. According to Rafanelli, genuine individualist tendencies within anarchist ideology were incompatible with the bourgeois-democratic ideas on which the pretext for warmongering rests. At the end of her stay in Egypt, Rafanelli was introduced to Sufism. The Islamic faith, for Rafanelli, was seen as hostile in character towards the Western world and its attempt to control and monopolize power and culture. Returning from Egypt to Italy with her newly married husband, the anarchist Ugo Polli, she published an article, La Libertà in which she compared the two ways of life: the Christian West and the Islamic East. =In Italy on the eve of and during World War I= In the period before the First World War, just back to Italy, Leda was very close ideologically to her friend, the poet and composer Pietro Gori and the journalist Armando Borghi. Aided by Olimpio Ballerini, husband of the well- known Florentine anarchist Teresa Fabbrini, Leda and Ugo founded the Rafanelli-Polli publishing house. The marriage was to be short lived, however. After separating from her husband Rafanelli partnered with painter Carlo Carra for a short but intense relationship which is the subject of Alberto Ciampi's 2005 book, Leda Rafanelli-Carlo Carrà: un romanzo: arte e politica di un incontro. Later she had an affair with Joseph Monnanni, with whom she had a son and published some novels and essays (including Bozzetti sociali, Seme nuovo, Verso la Siberia, Scene della rivoluzione russa). After founding a publishing company, Società Editrice Sociale, at the invitation of the anarchists Ettore Molinari and Nella Giacomelli, she created two magazines La Rivolta (1910) and La Libertà (between 1913 and 1914) with Giuseppe Monnanni. In this period, Benito Mussolini courted Rafanelli by mail. The letters were collected in a book entitled A Woman and Mussolini. The correspondence consisted of forty letters sent to Rafanelli by the future fascist dictator. According to Alessandra Pierotti, who has extensively studied her writing and has had frequent contact with one of her four grandchildren, there was never intimate relations between the two. It must be recognized that at this time (1913 - 1914) Mussolini was still a respectable revolutionary socialist and had participated in the Red Week, supporting the insurgency with speeches and articles. Vladimir Lenin expressed esteem for Mussolini, considering him a possible leader of the revolution. Mussolini was still director of Avanti, the newspaper of the Italian Socialist Party. Rafanelli, for her part, denied ever having been the lover of Mussolini while for the latter it was a source of pride. It should be said that Mussolini could never openly admit to having received a rejection from a woman. However historians PV Cannistraro and BR Sullivan, in their biography of Margherita Sarfatti, argue that the Rafanelli actually had a love affair with the future dictator. Before and during the First World War, the circle of anarchists linked to Rafanelli would, without any hesitation, advocate a pacifist position and condemn the conflict, despite the proselytes for interventionism in the Left, both in Italy and abroad. The most striking case at the international level was to be Peter Kropotkin, who even for a short period invite them to fight on the side of the Triple Entente. Even Rafanelli's old comrade Giuseppe Ungaretti became a fierce advocate of interventionism, enlisting as a volunteer at the beginning of the conflict. =Between the wars= With the seizure of power by fascists in 1922, Società Editrice Sociale ceased publication and Rafanelli was compelled towards political silence. Nevertheless, she succeeding in publishing Incantamento (1921), Donne e femmine (1922) and L'oasi. Her last literary creation is of particular importance as it is a harsh denunciation of colonialism published under a false name during the fascist repression of the Libyan resistance movement of the Sufi brotherhoods of Senussiya. Forced by economic hardship to make ends meet as a fortune teller, Rafanelli lived between Milan and Genoa, finding serenity to write Nada, La signora mia nonna and Le memorie di una chiromante, works imbued with the influences of the oriental novels of her youth. Le memorie di una chiromante (The memories of a fortune teller) also has a strong autobiographical character with clear references to the activities she undertook in order to survive. =After World War II= At the end of the 1940s, living mostly in Genoa and found a livelihood by teaching the Arabic language, Rafanelli created artistic works in Arabic characters and wrote for Umanità Nova Part of her work has been collected by Aurelio Chessa, who has created one of the most important Italian anarchist archives, the Camillo Berneri Family Fund. The archive, based in Reggio Emilia, presents the complete collection of all the works and autobiographical writings of Rafanelli, for which a Leda Rafanelli Fund was specifically established.

Sheptock is currently homeless, and often referred to as a homeless, homeless advocate. Early life Sheptock was born in Atlantic City. He suffered a massive head injury as a child, and was not expected to develop normal cognitive functions. The head injury also left him exhausted and causing him to walk away from many conversations. Sheptock was in foster care for about five years. Then, when he was five years old, he was adopted by Joanne and Rudy Sheptock, a Polish man and Italian woman. They lived in an old mansion in Peapack-Gladstone, New Jersey and had a family of thirty-seven children—seven natural-born and thirty adopted children. Most of the children the children they adopted had some sort of handicap, such as: neurological impairment, mental retardation, emotional problems, blindness, missing limbs and lung problems. in 1985, the family moved to Interlachen, Florida. Sheptock graduated from Hollister Christian Academy. Early homelessness Sheptock was homeless off and on since 1994 after walked off his job as freight handler after a dispute with his supervisor. From 1998 until 2005, he used crack cocaine. In the Summer of 2005, Sheptock hiked from Gainesville, Florida—where he had been homeless and unemployed—to Washington, D.C. His first night in D.C.—where he stayed in Logan Circle Park—was his last night using crack cocaine. Fight to save Franklin Shelter In 2006, around the time the future of Franklin School Shelter was in flux, Eric Sheptock received coaching on homeless advocacy from Mary Ann Luby, a Dominican Nun. Sheptock began his advocacy as a member of the committee to save Franklin Shelter. The Franklin School Shelter was a 235-bed men's shelter in downtown, DC. The Franklin Shelter served as an emergency facility—residents were permitted to stay there only between 4 P.M. and 7 A.M. In November, after the closing of Franklin Shelter, a fellow homeless advocate, David Pirtle, taught him how to use email. Sheptock and other advocate prevented the shelter from closing in 2006. On September 26, 2008, however, Mayor Adrian Fenty closed the shelter and the residents—including Sheptock—had their personal belongings moved to a homeless shelter in Anacostia. Sheptock brought suit in D.C. Superior Court, alleging two D.C. law violations, as well as a Fifth Amendment procedural due process claim premised on the District's failure to provide advance notice and an opportunity to be heard before closing the shelter. Shortly thereafter, Sheptock brought a new suit in D.C. Superior Court that raised eight claims: \\"a Fifth Amendment procedural due process claim; a Takings Clause challenge to the appropriation of the former residents' personal belongings; intentional infliction of emotional distress; conversion; negligence; and violations of the Emergency Act, the Frigid Temperature Protection Amendment Act of 1988, D.C.Code § 4–753.01, and the Homeless Services Reform Act of 2005, D.C.Code § 4–754.22.\\" In these suits, Sheptock did not prevail.Baltimore v. District of Columbia, 10 A .3d 1141 (D.C.2011) Sheptock tried to sue in Federal Court, but the suit was dismissed on Res Judicata grounds. Homeless advocate After the Franklin Shelter closed, Sheptock moved to the downtown, D.C. shelter, Community for Creative Non-Violence, which was made famous by fellow activist, Mitch Snyder. By June 2009, National Public Radio's All Things Considered did a piece on him called \\"Homeless Advocate Goes High Tech.\\" He appeared on CNN to make a pitch for a job. By 2010, Eric Sheptock had 4,548 Facebook friends, 839 Twitter followers, and two blogs. Sheptock was mentioned in Barbara Ehrenreich's Nickel and Dimed, speaking to the criminalization of homelessness, saying “Can you imagine?”“They arrested a homeless man in a shelter for being homeless?” In 2011, Sheptock launched \\"Shelter, Housing, and Respectful Change\\" for the purpose of informing homeless people about budget cuts that could negatively impact their lives. In 2013, he launched a robust conversation with activists and government about the possibility of his home, Community for Creative Non-Violence, the 1,350 bed shelter closing. In 2014, the DC City Council declared December 31, 2014 as \\"Eric Jonathan Sheptock Day.\\" In a ceremony, Jim Graham and Muriel Bowser presented Sheptock with the honor.

He was born in Paris to a family of Russian Jewish immigrants. Lambert began his activity as a Trotskyist militant before the Second World War when he was a member of the Internationalist Workers Party (POI) led by Raymond Molinier. After the war he continued his activism, as a member of the now united French section of the Fourth International, the Parti Communiste Internationaliste (PCI). In the PCI he was known as a specialist in trade union matters. When Michel Pablo, the secretary of the Fourth International, raised the question of entrism sui generis he eventually came to oppose this and helped to challenge Pablo within the French Section of the FI, backing the PCI leadership around Marcel Bleibtreu (also known as Pierre Favre). Differences between Lambert and Bleibtreu forced the latter to leave the PCI. By this time, 1952, the PCI had split into two mutually hostile groups on the question of entrism sui generis and the associated perspective of hundreds of years of deformed workers states propagated by Pablo. As leader of the PCI by 1954 Lambert forged an alliance with the Socialist Workers Party in the United States and others opposed to Pablo. Lambert lead the PCI to join with these anti-Pabloist fores to form the International Committee of the Fourth International (ICFI). This alliance would last for nearly a decade at which point the SWP (US) and its international faction fused with the International Secretariat of the Fourth International, within which Pablo was now marginalised, to form the United Secretariat of the Fourth International. Lambert was left in 1963 to continue the ICFI in an alliance with the Gerry Healy-led Socialist Labour League, based in Britain. The much shrunken ICFI consisted at this point of the SLL, Lambert's Organisation Communiste Internationaliste (the PCI as rebranded in 1966) and smaller groups around Europe and Latin America, most notably the POR in Bolivia led by Guillermo Lora and the Politica Obrera group in Argentina led by Jorge Altamira. By the time of the ICFI's congress in 1966, pressures were building between the OCI (which thought the SLL to be \\"ultimatistic\\") and the SLL. In 1971 the OCI left the ICFI to form the Organising Committee for the Reconstruction of the Fourth International and in 1973 and 1974 proposed discussions to the USFI. This was supported by the US SWP but the Nicaraguan Revolution intervened in 1979 and instead the OCRFI eventually united with Nahuel Moreno's group to form the Parity Committee for the Reconstruction of the Fourth International. The parity commission failed, leaving Lambert's supporters organised in the Fourth International (ICR). In 1996 the Fourth International (ICR) reproclaimed the Fourth International and goes by that name since. Under his real name of Pierre Boussel, Lambert was candidate at the presidential election in 1988. He gathered 116,823 votes (0.39% of validly cast ballots). Lambert died in Paris.

The project was eventually scrapped in favour of a similar project formally known as the Western Distributor which additionally consists of a tunnel. The project is under construction and now known as the West Gate Tunnel Project. The project, estimated to cost $680 million, was promised in 2013 by the then Victorian Labor Opposition to allow an estimated 5000 trucks a day to bypass the congested West Gate Bridge. The project was Labor's alternative to the Napthine government's controversial $18 billion East West Link, which it cancelled in April 2015. Labor promised to have contracts for the West Gate Distributor project signed within six months of forming government following the 2014 state election, and said the road would be completed by 2018. The project would have involved the construction of new lanes on a section of the West Gate Freeway and on-ramps and off-ramps connecting to a new elevated road along Hyde Street, Yarraville. The route was to continue along a widened Whitehall Street and Moreland Street towards Footscray Road, from which trucks could enter the port precinct. The government awarded a contract in December 2015 for the first stage of the project, which was for road widening, signalling and bridge works, and that work was completed in mid-2017.Vicroads project website on West Gate Distributor. Plans for further work on the project were abandoned when the government opted in April 2017 to instead proceed with a rival project, the $5.5 billion West Gate Tunnel, which was an unsolicited proposal by infrastructure company Transurban revealed in March 2015. Background Plans for the West Gate Distributor project were announced on 19 November 2013 as part of the Labor Party's Project 10,000 transport plan, which promised a range of major road and rail improvements that would provide a transport alternative to the Coalition government's East West Link toll road. Labor said the projects would create a total of 10,000 construction jobs in Victoria. An artist's representation of the road contained in the Project 10,000 public document showed a two-lane off-ramp for eastbound freeway traffic, located east of the Westgate golf course and Williamstown railway line. The off-ramp continued as an elevated two-lane road that crosses Stony Creek and swept northwards to merge with Hyde Street, south of Francis Street. A parallel two- lane road was to allow southbound vehicles on Hyde Street to exit, then cross Stony Creek, pass under the West Gate Freeway and merge with westbound freeway traffic. Lanes were also to be added in each direction on the West Gate Freeway between Williamstown Road and the Western Ring Road. Labor's plan was based on a proposal in Sir Rod Eddington's 2008 East-West Link Needs Assessment report, which had recommended the implementation of a Truck Action Plan that would include a new link from the West Gate Freeway to the port via Hyde Street in a bid to reduce truck movements on Francis Street and Somerville Road. The Truck Action Plan was a supplement to a new 18 km east- west cross-city road link.Investing in Transport: East West Link Needs Assessment, a study by Sir Rod Eddington, March 2008, Introduction, page 14; chapter 9, pg 220. The Eddington study had found that total daily truck movements to and from the Port of Melbourne could more than double from 9000 to 23,000 by 2035.Investing in Transport: East West Link Needs Assessment, a study by Sir Rod Eddington, March 2008, chapter 6, pg 160, 162. The announcement of the West Gate Distributor project marked a switch in strategy by Labor leader Daniel Andrews, who in October 2012 had spoken in favour of a second major river crossing in Melbourne's inner western suburbs to provide a road alternative to the West Gate Bridge. Andrews had criticised the Government's staging of the East West Link—announced a month earlier—and urged that the western part of the project should proceed first. From mid-2013 Andrews began opposing construction of the entire East West Link. Planning and construction Heavy vehicles at the southern end of Whitehall Street, which will form part of the West Gate Distributor route to the Port of Melbourne. The West Gate Bridge is in the background.While still in opposition, Andrews announced in September 2014 that the project was \\"shovel ready\\" and \\"ready to go\\" and that if elected, a Labor government would release the expressions of interest for the project by Australia Day 2015. In January the government called for expressions of interest in stage one, the northern section. That work would involve widening of Moreland Street to provide a four-lane divided road, new traffic signals at Moreland Street's intersection with Footscray Road, Parker Street and Whitehall Street, and the widening and strengthening of Shepherd's Bridge over the Maribyrnong River. A new cycle and pedestrian bridge would also be built alongside Shepherd's Bridge. A contract for stage one was awarded to Fulton Hogan in December 2015; construction was expected to begin in April 2016 and be complete by mid-2017. Roads Minister Luke Donnellan said some properties would be affected by construction, but said the number of acquisitions would not be revealed until the \\"preferred alignment\\" was finalised. Earlier planning for the Brumby government's 2008 Victorian Transport Plan, which had incorporated Eddington's Truck Action Plan, had suggested that up to 21 homes and 22 business properties would need to be acquired for road widening. Criticism The Victorian Coalition government disputed Labor's claim that the West Gate Distributor would remove 5000 trucks a day from the West Gate Bridge, citing traffic modelling that showed about 4130 trucks a day travelled to the port's Swanson-Dynon precinct from the west, and that only 30 percent of them—about 1240 trucks—approached by the West Gate Freeway. Western suburbs advocacy group LeadWest has claimed the bypass could backfire, pushing more trucks on to residential streets in Yarraville and Footscray. A spokesman said LeadWest was concerned that westbound drivers exiting the port bound for Brooklyn, Laverton North and Truganina would continue to use inner suburban streets to avoid the gradient on a truck ramp from Hyde Street to the West Gate Freeway. He said drivers would save on fuel and toll expenses by continuing to use suburban streets. The RACV has criticised the lack of detail in the government's announcements on the project, expressing concern over the potential for traffic confusion resulting from a \\"spaghetti junction\\" of ramps between Williamstown Road and the West Gate Bridge. RACV policy manager Brian Negus said the motoring lobby group was waiting to see the detail \\"because thus far, we've only seen a couple of pages from Labor prior to the election and that doesn't give us good detail\\". The Herald Sun has reported that documents prepared by unnamed \\"environmental agencies\\" show the construction area is contaminated by dangerous materials including demolition waste that would require cleaning up and delay the project. It said plans to fast-track the work could also be jeopardised because large areas near the bridge and Stony Creek had been classified as areas of cultural heritage sensitivity. The area was reported to have once been used as a food and water source by the Boonwurrung people.

(Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division), revolving around the character of Phil Coulson and his team of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents as they race Hydra to enter a hidden alien city, and get to the mysterious Raina. It is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), sharing continuity with the films of the franchise. The episode was written by Paul Zbyszewski and directed by Billy Gierhart. Clark Gregg reprises his role as Coulson from the film series, and is joined by principal cast members Ming-Na Wen, Brett Dalton, Chloe Bennet, Iain De Caestecker, Elizabeth Henstridge, and Nick Blood. Recurring guest star Ruth Negga reprises the role of Raina. \\"...Ye Who Enter Here\\" originally aired on ABC on December 2, 2014, and according to Nielsen Media Research, was watched by 5.36 million viewers. The episode received mostly positive reviews, with most critics finding it a good penultimate episode for the first half of the season. Plot S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent Skye has been having bad dreams, and cannot shake the feeling that something bad is about to happen. Director Phil Coulson wants to get to the hidden alien city as fast as possible, and destroy it, before Hydra can get there with the Obelisk. In Vancouver, Hydra agents led by Agent 33 (who, after being electrocuted by S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent Melinda May while wearing a nano-mask that gave her May's face and voice, now looks and sounds like May permanently, except for a horrible scar on her face, and a more electronic-sounding voice) are closing in on Raina, but she is protected by S.H.I.E.L.D. agents Billy and Sam Koenig. Coulson decides to split up the group, sending May, Skye, and Lance Hunter to collect Raina and the Koenigs, and taking Agents Bobbi Morse, Leo Fitz, Jemma Simmons, and Mack with him to San Juan, Puerto Rico, below which is the alien city. On the way, Mack questions Morse about the relationship she has been rekindling with Hunter, asking her if she will let Hunter in on \\"the other thing\\", which she says she will not. Simmons tries to open up to Fitz about her feelings for him, wanting to explain that he is her best friend, but before she can he tells her that he is leaving the Science division to work with Mack in the garage, feeling that he is just getting in her way. In San Juan, Morse is concerned that Coulson wants to use the power of the Obelisk for himself, as that is what previous Director Nick Fury would do. Coulson assures her that he isn't Fury, and that unlike Fury, he has an \\"acceptable losses\\" number of zero. A contact of Morse's then directs them to an old guard tower, said to be above an entrance shaft to the city, but leaves due to stories that the tower is haunted. When Skye tells Raina that Hydra has the Obelisk, Raina realizes that they want her because she is \\"worthy\\" of its power, and could take it to the alien city. Wanting to do this to find out what she could become, Raina attempts to give herself up to Hydra, but is prevented by the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents. En route to San Juan, Raina tells Skye that her father, a crazy murderer now aligned with Hydra, is quite misunderstood. She claims that he found her in Thailand when she was a lost soul, and showed her that she could be something else. However, all he ever wanted was to be with Skye. Raina also explains that the Obelisk, or the Diviner, was left on Earth by the alien race the Kree to decide who is worthy to inherit Earth. Only one of these people, like Raina and potentially Skye, can go to the city with the Diviner and unlock its true power. Realizing that those not worthy should probably not enter the city, Skye attempts to warn Coulson and his team, but their communications are jammed by Hydra, who had followed a tracker embedded in Raina. S.H.I.E.L.D. traitor Grant Ward boards the plane and takes Raina and Skye, as well as the coordinates for the city, before promising not to harm anyone else. In San Juan, not knowing of the potential danger, Mack is lowered down to the city. He touches a symbol on the ground, and it starts glowing, causing great pain for him. The team pulls Mack back up, but he is overcome with rage, his eyes turn red, and he attacks them. Morse manages to subdue him, and he falls back down the shaft to the city. Coulson then orders the entrance be blocked off. In an end tag, Agent 33 tells Hydra leader Daniel Whitehall that Ward let the other S.H.I.E.L.D. agents go, and Whitehall tells her to rectify this mistake. Production =Development= In November 2014, Marvel announced that the ninth episode of the season would be titled \\"...Ye Who Enter Here\\", to be written by Paul Zbyszewski, with Billy Gierhart directing. =Writing= Explaining Skye's nightmare at the beginning of the episode, Executive producer Maurissa Tancharoen stated, \\"She’s having some gut feelings and they are manifesting in her dreams. Are the dreams foreshadowing something? Perhaps.\\" Executive producer Jed Whedon added, \\"Mainly, they serve to show how afraid she is of all of this. In the audience’s mind, there’s a little bit of a sense of not obsession, but her interest in this lifelong journey of finding her parents. All of this is tied together emotionally.\\" Going on to explain Skye's mindset when she hugs Coulson before he leaves for the city, Tancharoen said, \\"When we first met Skye, she’s always been someone who goes off of instinct and impulse. Through the course of this season, in her training with May, she’s toned that down and learned how to be an agent, suppressed emotion and been there for the fight first. It’s a nice moment that brings us back to the old Skye and the heart of her relationship with Coulson, which will always have elements of a father-daughter relationship. For some reason, she feels more concerned than usual about this mission, so she gives him a hug. It’s just a nice way to see that she’s that old Skye that acts on impulse and wants to show she cares.\\" =Casting= In November 2014, Marvel revealed that main cast members Clark Gregg, Ming-Na Wen, Brett Dalton, Chloe Bennet, Iain De Caestecker, Elizabeth Henstridge, and Nick Blood would star as Phil Coulson, Melinda May, Grant Ward, Skye, Leo Fitz, Jemma Simmons, and Lance Hunter, respectively. It was also revealed that the guest cast for the episode would include B.J. Britt as Antoine Triplett, Adrianne Palicki as Bobbi Morse, Henry Simmons as Alphonso \\"Mack\\" Mackenzie, Ruth Negga as Raina, Patton Oswalt as Sam and Billy Koenig, Reed Diamond as Daniel Whitehall, Jeffrey Corbett as Chad, and Brittnee Garza as Cashier. However, Corbett and Garza did not receive guest star credit in the episode. Britt, Palicki, Simmons, Negga, Oswalt, and Diamond all reprise their roles from earlier in the series. Ming- Na Wen also portrays Agent 33. =Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-ins= Raina reveals in the episode that the alien corpse seen in the first season episode \\"T.A.H.I.T.I.\\" is that of a Kree. Other members of that species play significant roles in the 2014 film Guardians of the Galaxy. Asked whether this counts as the series' tie-in to Guardians, Whedon stated \\"It is a very far away other galaxy, so it’s a little bit harder to have one of them walk into our set, so a direct tie-in is a little bit more challenging, but it’s all one universe, so there’s always opportunity for more. ... In Guardians, we saw parts in our universe that we hadn’t explored yet, so it shows we’re a part of that too.\\" Release =Broadcast= \\"...Ye Who Enter Here\\" was first aired in the United States on ABC on December 2, 2014. It was aired alongside the US broadcast in Canada on CTV. =Home media= The episode began streaming on Netflix on June 11, 2015, and was released along with the rest of the second season on September 18, 2015, on Blu-ray and DVD. Reception =Ratings= In the United States the episode received a 1.8/5 percent share among adults between the ages of 18 and 49, meaning that it was seen by 1.8 percent of all households, and 5 percent of all of those watching television at the time of the broadcast. It was watched by 5.36 million viewers. The Canadian broadcast gained 2.20 million viewers, the second highest for that day, and the sixth highest for the week. =Critical response= Nerdist's Joseph McCabe criticized the \\"terrible cliffhanger\\", but said \\"I’ll take awkward cliffhangers tacked onto jet-propelled episodes any day over the boring consistency of S.H.I.E.L.D.‘s freshman year.\\" Oliver Sava graded the episode a 'B+' for The A.V. Club, calling the Fitz and Simmons scenes \\"The major character work this week\\", and on which saying \\"Elizabeth Henstridge and Iain De Caestecker’s chemistry really solidified the relationship between the characters, which makes their breakup all the more painful.\\" Sava was critical of Gierhart's directing and Bennet's acting for the opening dream sequence, but felt that they \\"both fare better when it comes to the waking world, particularly the action sequence[s]\\", which he felt made good use of close- quarter situations. Eric Goldman of IGN scored the episode a 7.9 out of 10, indicating a \\"Good\\" episode, praising the Fitz and Simmons interactions, saying \\"Fitz telling Simmons he no longer will work in the lab was given added weight by Iain De Caestecker and Elizabeth Henstridge, with the latter providing some heartbreaking emotions and tears on her face over the situation.\\" He was critical of the Koenig brothers humor, which he found \\"forced\\", and lamented the lack of Kyle MacLachlan's \\"The Doctor\\", \\"even as he was talked about a lot.\\" Kevin Fitzpatrick at Screen Crush felt \\"it was important that the series stick the landing on the final two episodes of season 2’s front half, and while we expect the story threads to pay off more handsomely next week, “Ye Who Enter Here” ended up feeling a little lighter for it ... If nothing else, the brisk pace and impressive action choreography throughout the hour kept things humming along nicely enough\\". He was pleased that Fitz and Simmons talked about their feelings, but said \\"it seems almost as though “Ye Who Enter Here” wasn't quite ready to deal with any actual ramifications of the feelings gap between the pair\\". He ultimately said \\"Memorable moments like Koenig’s umbrella cloak or Skye’s extended fight with Agent 33 offer acceptable substitute for whatever cards the showrunners hold back until next week, and Ward’s latest betrayal offered some intriguing wrinkles in hour that boiled down to little more than “get to hidden city, or at least tease cryptically.”\\" James Hunt, writing for Den of Geek, stated \\"the series finally feels like it has some direction, rather than just momentum\\", and was pleased with Ward's actions at the end of the episode, saying \\"This episode did do one thing I didn't expect, though, and that's make Ward seem like a believable villain. The scene where he entered the plane worked because he had the power, and they respected it.\\" Alan Sepinwall of HitFix called the episode \\"another solid, engaging installment, and a good set-up for whatever's coming next week.\\" \\"[E]ven with all the characters and bits of business to deal with, the episode never felt overcrowded or rushed, and was able to focus on the character element that's made season 2 such a huge improvement over season 1.\\" He particularly praised Palicki, and the way Raina's exposition scenes did not come across as \\"massive exposition dump[s]\\".

Lawson then wrote a 2015 book, Arms and the Dudes, detailing the story. The film follows two arms dealers, Efraim Diveroli and David Packouz, who receive a U.S. Army contract to supply ammunitions for the Afghan National Army worth approximately $300 million. The film is heavily fictionalized and dramatized, and some of its events, such as the duo driving through Iraq, were either invented or based on other events, such as screenwriter Stephen Chin's own experiences. The film stars Jonah Hill, Miles Teller, Ana de Armas, and Bradley Cooper, who also co-produced. Filming began on March 2, 2015 in Romania. The film premiered in New York City on August 3, 2016 and was theatrically released by Warner Bros. Pictures on August 19, 2016. It received mixed reviews from critics and grossed $86 million. Hill received a Golden Globe nomination for his performance.  Plot  In 2005, David Packouz is a massage therapist living in Miami, Florida with his girlfriend Iz. David spends his life savings on high-quality bedsheets to resell to retirement homes, but the venture fails. David runs into his old friend Efraim Diveroli, who has formed his own company, AEY, selling arms to the US government for the ongoing war in Iraq. Iz informs David she is pregnant, and Efraim offers him a job at AEY; although David and Iz vehemently oppose the war, David joins AEY and lies to Iz. Efraim explains that military equipment orders are posted on a public website, and their job is to bid for small orders ignored by larger contractors but still worth millions. Local businessman Ralph Slutzky provides them funding, under the false belief that AEY only sells arms to protect Israel. David and Efraim land a contract to provide several thousand Beretta pistols to the Iraqi Police in Baghdad, but an Italian embargo blocks the shipment, which is waylaid in Jordan. Failing to deliver the cargo as promised would mean that AEY would be blacklisted from any future contracts. Meanwhile, Iz overhears the true nature of David's business. David and Efraim fly to Jordan, bribing locals to release the shipment, and are provided with a driver to transport them and the shipment into Iraq. The trio drive through the night, bribing a border patrol and evading armed insurgents, and arrive at the military base, where Captain Santos is impressed that they survived the Triangle of Death; the two are paid handsomely. AEY secures larger and more lucrative deals, expanding their operation, and David's daughter Ella is born, while Efraim grows more unstable and untrustworthy. The company has a chance at \\"The Afghan deal\\", their biggest yet: the US government posts a massive order worth $300 million, which requires 100 million rounds of AK-47 ammunition and would net a $100 million profit. Facing a global shortage on AK-47 ammunition, the duo encounter legendary arms dealer Henry Girard, who has access to massive unused weapon depots in Albania. Needing to dispose of these arsenals—including over 100 million rounds of AK-47 ammunition—in accordance with NATO treaties, and unable to deal directly with the US, Girard offers to make the deal through AEY. Efraim agrees, despite David's discomfort at working with a man on a terrorist watchlist. The two go to Albania to test the ammunition and win the contract, though Efraim learns they severely underbid their competitors. Iz, frustrated with David's lies, leaves to live with her mother. Preparing the shipment in Albania, David discovers virtually all the rounds are Chinese-made and illegal due to a US embargo; to conceal this, Efraim has the ammunition repackaged. Learning Henry has charged them a 400% markup, Efraim plans to cut him out of the deal, ignoring David's protests and destroying the only copy of his partnership contract with David. Henry retaliates by having David kidnapped, beaten, and threatened at gunpoint; David wonders if his missing Albanian driver, Bashkim, has been killed. David learns Efraim did not pay Enver, the Albanian handling the repackaging. Returning to Miami, David quits AEY and demands the money he is owed, but Efraim refuses. David returns to working as a massage therapist and convinces Iz to move back in with him, telling her the truth about AEY. Weeks later, Efraim and Ralph offer David a paltry severance package, and David threatens Efraim with evidence of his falsified company documents. Shortly after, David and Efraim are arrested by the FBI, who had been contacted by the disgruntled Enver. The FBI had previously arrested Ralph, who wore a wire in an incriminating meeting with David and Efraim. Efraim is sentenced to four years in prison for numerous crimes related to conspiracy and fraud on the Afghan deal, while David gets seven months' house arrest for his cooperation. Months later, Henry apologizes to David for abducting him in Albania and thanks him for not mentioning Henry to the FBI. David asks Henry about the events of the deal, including Bashkim's fate, but Henry offers him a briefcase of money in exchange for \\"no more questions.\\" The movie ends, leaving David's decision unclear. Cast  Production  Initially, Jesse Eisenberg and Shia LaBeouf were set to star in the film; however, Jonah Hill and Miles Teller were eventually cast. Further casting was announced in early 2015, with Ana de Armas joining in February, and JB Blanc joining in March. Screenwriter Stephen Chin based many of the incidents on his own experiences in Iraq. = Filming = Shooting was initially set to begin late April 2015, in Miami, for several weeks. According to SSN Insider, filming began on March 2, 2015. Later confirmed by the Business Wire on March 17, 2015, filming was underway in Romania. On April 29, 2015, Hill and Teller were spotted filming on the set in Burbank, California.

On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 61%, based on 229 reviews with an average rating of the 6.06/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"War Dogs rises on the strength of Jonah Hill's compelling performance to take a lightly entertaining look at troubling real-world events.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 57 out of 100, based on 41 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B\\" on an A+ to F scale. ScreenCrush's Matt Singer said, \\"Superficially, the movie looks a lot like past Phillips comedies about men behaving badly, with dirty jokes and wacky hijinks galore. But War Dogs is more critical of its protagonists’ behavior, and there's plenty of sad commentary about the state of modern America.\\" Ignatiy Vishnevetsky of The A.V. Club had misgivings about the film's slant and biographical omissions, writing: \\"One might quibble with the way Phillips limits responsibility on the Pentagon deal by painting AEY as better businessmen than they actually were [...], while avoiding the darker sides of the story...\\" Matt Zoller Seitz of RogerEbert.com, in a mixed review, stated that \\"War Dogs is a film about horrible people that refuses to own the horribleness.\\" See also * 2008 Gërdec explosions * Lord of War (2005): semi-biographical film about an international arms dealer References  External links    Category:2016 films Category:2010s biographical films Category:2010s crime comedy-drama films Category:2010s war films Category:American films Category:American biographical films Category:American buddy films Category:American crime comedy-drama films Category:American war comedy-drama films Category:War adventure films Category:English-language films Category:Comedy films based on actual events Category:Crime films based on actual events Category:Drama films based on actual events Category:Films based on newspaper and magazine articles Category:Films about arms trafficking Category:Films about businesspeople Category:Films produced by Bradley Cooper Category:Films produced by Todd Phillips Category:Films set in 2005 Category:Films set in 2006 Category:Films set in 2007 Category:Films set in 2008 Category:Films set in Afghanistan Category:Films set in Iraq Category:Iraq War films Category:War in Afghanistan (2001–present) films Category:Films set in Albania Category:Films set in Miami Category:Films shot in California Category:Films shot in Florida Category:Films shot in Los Angeles Category:Films shot in Miami Category:Films shot in Romania Category:War films based on actual events Category:Films directed by Todd Phillips Category:Films scored by Cliff Martinez Category:Films with screenplays by Todd Phillips ","title":"War Dogs (2016 film)"},{"id":"44591868","text":"Joseph-Alcide Chaussé (7 January 1868 – 7 October 1944) was a Canadian architect, best known for the Egyptian-style Empress Theatre of Montreal. Early years Joseph-Alcide Chaussé was born in Saint-Sulpice, Quebec on 7 January 1868. His parents were Edouard Chaussé and Rose-de-Lima Rivest. His father was a timber merchant. He attended St. Mary's Academy (Académie Sainte- Marie), Montreal, then studied architecture in Montreal in the office of Alphonse Raza. He also studied under architects in Chicago and Milwaukee. He became an architect in 1888. He married Rose-de-Lima Renaud on 8 September 1894, and they had five sons of whom two survived. In 1890 he was one of the founders of the Association of Architects of the Province of Quebec. He was responsible for the plans for the presbytery of the Assomption-de-la-Sainte- Vierge (1897) and the new facade of the church of Sainte-Jeanne-de-Chantal (1901) in what is now Notre-Dame-de-l'Île-Perrot. City official On 21 May 1900 Chaussé was appointed a building inspector for the city of Montreal. He wrote papers for the cities of Montreal and Quebec about fire prevention and construction regulations. Chaussé was the main promoter of the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada, founded in 1907. He was honorary secretary of the institute until 1942. In 1911 Chaussé and the architect Joseph Venne overhauled the Montreal building regulations. In 1914 Chaussé was appointed municipal architect. Later career Empress Theatre (Montreal) (1927) On 1 August 1918 Chaussé returned to private practice, specializing as an expert in court appearances and in municipal assessments. He designed the church of Sainte-Gertrude, built in 1925 in the north of the Island of Montreal. His best known work is the Empress Theater (1927) in Montreal in an Egyptian style inspired by the discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun in 1922. Chaussé was involved in various national and international architects' associations, and participated in conferences in locations such as London, Budapest and Rio de Janeiro. Joseph-Alcide Chaussé died in Montreal on 7 October 1944.

The Old Dude has a cataract in one eye that frightens the narrator, so much so that he plans to murder the old man. After several nights of watching the Old Dude sleep by shining a pen- light through his door, he illuminates the old man's diseased eye, which is open. The Old Dude had been awake for some time, and the narrator speculates that he was very afraid and trying to calm himself down. Seeing the eye, however, drives Drogan into a rage. The narrator claims to have very sensitive hearing from his military service, and smothers the old man for fear of the neighbors hearing the man's heartbeat. He dismembers the body and conceals the parts beneath the floorboards. The police arrive the following morning; a neighbor summoned them after hearing a yell in the night. Drogan invites them in, but soon hears a rhythmic thudding sound that he believes to be the Old Dude's beating heart. Convinced that the police can hear it as well, he confesses to the crime. In a paragraph at the end, we are told that the preceding story had been a statement taken from Drogan during the course of the investigation. It is revealed that Richard Drogan is actually an alias for Robert S. Deisenhoff, an escapee from a Veterans Hospital.Booth, Bob. \\"The Old Dude's Ticker.\\" The Big Book of Necon.

Etymology It takes its name from the San Juan River, where specimens were collected. Description Individuals range between in length. The body is slender and long, with a short, compressed face and flexible lips. In an example of sexual dimorphism, the rays of males' pelvic and anal fins are lined with small hooks. General coloration is a dark brownish-yellow, with a dark stripe running from directly behind the gills to the caudal peduncle. The ventral surface is light yellow. The dorsum and fins are patterned with melanophores. A reddish spot can be observed on the ventral part of the base of the caudal fin. Range and habitat H. sanjuanensis is believed to be endemic to the upper San Juan River in Colombia. Specimens were recovered from clear, fast-flowing streams with sandy or rocky bottoms. Diet The species is insectivorous. Among other things, it has been known to eat water scavenger beetles, black flies, flesh flies, damselflies, predaceous diving beetles, caddisflies, nematodes, and isopods.

Image denoising Sensors such as CCD, CMOS or ultrasonic probe may encapsulate noise signal. Noise reduction is commonly used to improve quality of the image. However, techniques such as smoothing filters and many other algorithms may lose local structure of image while denoising the image. More over, efficiency is also taken into consideration. Principal component analysis PCA was invented in 1901 by Karl Pearson, to transform original dataset into linearly uncorrelated PCA domain. PCA works in the way that principal components with larger possible variance are preserved while discarding low variance components. Image denoising by principal component analysis with local pixel grouping(LPG-PCA) was developed by Lei et. in 2010. It is based on the assumption that the energy of a signal will concentrate on a small subset of the PCA transformed dataset, while the energy of noise will evenly spread over the whole dataset. Assume original image is denoted by I and noise is denoted by v, then the measured image will be I_{v} = I + v. In order to denoising I_{v}, first a train dataset X_{v} must be constructed using local pixel group. Using this X_{v} and apply PCA the noise in the image can be reduced. =Construct local pixel group= For each pixel px in the image, select a K\\\\times K window centered at px denoted by :x=[x_{1} ... x_{m}]^{\\\\rm T}, m=K^{2} and a training window centered at px. The training window is L\\\\times L, L>K. Take the pixels in each possible K\\\\times K block within the L\\\\times L training block yields (L-K+1)^{2} samples \\\\overrightarrow{x_{i}}^{\\\\rm v}. If the distance between a sample and the center window \\\\overrightarrow{x_{0}}^{\\\\rm v} is smaller than some threshold, then accept the sample. So the train dataset X_{v} is acquired by put all the accepted sample together as column vectors into a matrix. =Denoising using local pixel group= First step of this part is centralize X_{v} and \\\\overline{X_{v}} is obtained. By computing the covariance matrix of \\\\overline{X_{v}} denoted by \\\\Omega_{\\\\overline{x}}, the PCA transformation matrix P_{\\\\overline{x}} can be obtained.

Apply this to all the pixels in the image and the denoised image can be obtained. Experiments by Lei show that LGP-PCA can effectively preserve the image fine structures while smoothing noise. The solution is competitive compared with other algorithms such as Block-matching algorithm.

It was described as new to science in 1948 by Wei-Fan Chiu as a species of Boletus; F.L. Tai transferred it to the genus Tylopilus in 1979. The fruit body has a hemispherical to cushion-shaped, white cap measuring in diameter. The pores on the cap underside measure less than 1 mm wide. The flesh in the stipe is whitish to yellowish at the base, and does not change color with injury. It has ellipsoid spores measuring 9–11 by 5–6 µm. The type collection was made in Chichushan (Yunnan Province), in September 1938 growing under the conifer species Chinese white pine (Pinus armandii). Related Asian Tylopilus species include T. javanicus and T. roseolus.

It was founded as a one-man shop in 2009 by company president Paul Kanitra. By 2014, Lobbyit had grown to seven employees and projected $1 million in annual revenue. The firm is known for its pricing structure, which is “unique” among DC lobbying firms: it offers its clients set monthly prices based on a tier system with retainers that are much lower than traditional lobbying firms and month-to-month contracts. History Lobbyit was founded in 2009 by Paul Kanitra, who began his lobbying career working on behalf of the Associated Locksmiths of America and the Reno-Sparks Indian Colony. He later moved onto governmental relations at Carfax, where he worked for five years until deciding to open his own lobbying firm. In 2013, Lobbyit partnered with Salsa Labs, the developers of an online-based organization software platform to offer clients new grassroots advocacy options. With the partnership finalized, Lobbyit announced that it would be rolling out its new Tier 4 service, which combined Lobbyit's lobbying services with Salsa Labs’ advocacy platform. Later that year, Lobbyit was featured in a Voice of America China video report entitled “China: Democracy in America: Right to Petition” that examined the federal lobbying industry and its role in American democracy. In 2014, Lobbyit was one of InTheCapital's annual 50 on Fire, which “celebrates visionary individuals and companies across DC's top industries.” Corporate Vision Magazine named Lobbyit Best Lobbying Firm & Government Affairs Consultancy in the United States. Operations Unlike many other federal lobbying firms which charge tens of thousands of dollars monthly for their services, Lobbyit charges lower prices and offers month-to-month contracts. In 2014, its most expensive service offering cost $4,999 monthly and all of its clients paid less than $60,000 per year. Company founder and president Kanitra has said the inspiration for the company's pricing structure came from companies such as McDonald's, Wal-Mart, and Amazon.com. Staff *Paul Kanitra, founder and president *Max Perkins, senior vice president *Jason Ortega, vice president *Justin Lewis, government relations manager Clients Lobbyit has represented over 100 clients, including businesses, associations, non-profits, municipalities, and colleges and universities. Instead of lobbying on broad issues such as health care policy, most of Lobbyit's registered lobbyists concentrate on assisting individual businesses or groups with specific issues. As of 2014, the majority of Lobbyit's client base have never hired a lobbyist before, and the company educates these new clients on how the American federal government operates as a part of its services. Notable clients include the Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association; the American Jail Association; Carfax; Brick Industry Association; the city of Plano, Texas; the city of Point Pleasant Beach, New Jersey; Hobby Distillers Association; the National Child Care Association; the National Council of Investigation and Security Services; Texas Christian University; and the World Floor Covering Association. In 2017, it was announced that Lobbyit had been working with Brick Industry Association (BIA) since 2012. BIA scheduled an average of 20 Capitol Hill visits annually before working with Lobbyit, which was able to schedule an average of 100 annual Capital Hill visits for BIA members.

They would continue to tour and record through the late 1960s as a backing band with Otis Redding and as a solo group as well. They have been credited by James Brown and others with first putting the 'funk' in the rock and roll beat.  Background  In 1953, Little Richard, dissatisfied with his solo career, formed a road band starting with Wilburt \\"Lee Diamond\\" Smith on saxophone, who became the leader, Nathaniel \\"Buster\\" Douglas on Electric guitar, Charles \\"Chuck\\" Connor on drums, and Olsie \\"Bassy\\" Robinson on bass guitar. Little Richard and the band did many club performances from 1953 to 1955. Little Richard didn't record his first hit \\"Tutti Frutti\\" with the Upsetters, but he recorded it with studio musicians who had worked with Fats Domino, after he told Art Rupe, founder of Specialty Records, that he liked Fats Domino's music. He recorded a number of songs with the Upsetters such as \\"Keep A Knockin'\\", and \\"Ooh My Soul\\" however most of his big hits in his prime were recorded with a studio band which included Lee Allen and Earl Palmer.  Films  The band appeared in a few rock n' roll movies such as: \\"The Girl Can't Help It\\", \\"Don't Knock the Rock\\", and \\"Mister Rock and Roll\\". They did not actually play, nor did Little Richard sing, but they lip synched to their hits \\"Tutti Frutti\\", \\"Long Tall Sally\\", \\"Ready Teddy\\", \\"The Girl Can't Help It\\", and \\"She's Got It\\" from 1956 to 1957.  Little Richard trades Rock N' Roll for Gospel  During a concert in Australia in late 1957, Little Richard decided it was time to quit rock n' roll and devote himself to God, after he saw the Russian satellite 'Sputnik 1' fly overhead. He believed it was a sign from God to give up Rock & Roll. Specialty Records released three albums after he quit - \\"Here's Little Richard\\"(1957), \\"Little Richard\\"(1958), and \\"The Fabulous Little Richard\\"(1959). The band continued until the mid-1960s. They had songs including \\"Hattie Malatti\\" and \\"Mama Loochie\\" (1958), both sung by the band's lead sax player Wilburt Smith under the alias \\"Lee Diamond and the Upsetters\\".
