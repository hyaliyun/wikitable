He was a member of a family of printers and publishers which was connected to the Moretus family, which operated the Plantin Press in Antwerp. He was principally a painter of portraits and his principal patrons were the Moretus family.J. Slegers, T. De Roo, 'Jacob Van Reesbroeck, ‚Äòhuisschilder‚Äô bij Balthasar Moretus II', online publicatie van Museum Plantin- Moretus/Prentenkabinet (2013), p. 26 Life Balthasar van Meurs was born in Antwerp some time between 1612 and 1619 as the son of Jan van Meurs. His father was a publisher and served as an alderman in Antwerp. His mother Catharina or Catelijne de Sweert was a sister of Maria de Sweert, who was the wife of Balthasar I Moretus. Balthasar I Moretus was an influential printer and publisher in Antwerp who was the grandson of Christoffel Plantin and took over management of the Plantin Press in Antwerp, one of the leading publishing houses in Europe, after his own father died in 1619. Balthazar Moretus started a partnership with Jan van Meurs which lasted until 1629. Jan van Meurs also worked closely with the Nutius family of printers. Through these collaborations and family connections Jan van Meurs was part of the circle of humanists in Antwerp of which Rubens was also a member.Anne-Marie S. Logan, Michiel Plomp, Peter Paul Rubens: The Drawings, Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York, N.Y.) Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2005, p. 174Max Rooses, Petrus- Paulus Rubens en Balthasar Moretus. Een bijdrage tot de geschiedenis der Kunst Balthasar became in April 1637 a member of the 'Sodaliteit van de Bejaerde Jongmans', a fraternity for bachelors established by the Jesuit order. It is not clear whether he is the son of Jan van Meurs who was registered in the guild year 1646‚Äì1647 as a master painter or wijnmeester, i.e. the son of an existing master.Ph. Rombouts and Th. van Lerius, De liggeren en andere historische archieven der Antwerpsche sint Lucasgilde Volume 2, Antwerp, 1871, p. 182, 436 Balthasar's brother Jacob would later take over the book publishing business from his father.Frans Olthoff, De boekdrukkers, boekverkoopers en uitgevers in Antwerpen sedert de uitvinding der boekdrukkunst tot op onze dagen, M. Ruef, Antwerp, 1891, pp. 68‚Äì69 The brothers are later mentioned in a lawsuit regarding the authenticity of a copper plate painting sold as a Pieter Breughel the Elder from the estate of their father, who had acquired an extensive collection of Flemish paintings during his lifetime.Erik Duverger, Antwerpse Kunstinventarissen uit de Zeventiende Eeuw, Koninklijke Academie voor Wetenschappen, Letteren en Schone Kunsten van Belgi√´, 1985 Portrait of Jules Chifflet In the guild year running from 18 September 1673 to 18 September 1674 his death duties were paid to the Antwerp Guild of St. Luke. Work Only very few works by van Meurs are known. The known works are all portraits and were commissioned by the Moretus family, owners of the Plantin Press and linked with the van Meurs family through marriage and business ties. The Moretus family had employed various prominent Antwerp portrait painters to make portraits of its members. These painters included Rubens, Jacob van Reesbroeck, Pieter Thijs, Erasmus Quellinus the Younger, Thomas Willeboirts Bosschaert and possibly Gonzales Coques. These paintings were displayed in the 'gallery of honour' of the family. In 1650 Balthasar van Meurs was commissioned by his uncle Balthasar II Moretus to paint four portraits. The persons to be portrayed were Jan van den Wouwer, a humanist who was a pupil of Justus Lipsius and a good friend of Balthasar I and II Moretus, the Antwerp bishop Johannes Malderus and the scientist Jean-Jacques Chifflet and his son Jules Chifflet, both acquaintances of the Moretus family and authors of the Plantin Press. It appears that in choosing the persons to be portrayed Balthasar II considered the commercial or emotional link with the person portrayed more than their contribution to the humanism for which the Plantin Press had been famous. This reflected Antwerp's decline as an intellectual and humanistic centre at the time of Balthasar II. The portraits of van den Wouwer and Malderus, who were both deceased when the portrait commission was given, appear to be based on portraits of the same persons by van Dyck. The portraits of the Chifflets may have been made from life as both were alive and often in Antwerp where van Meurs could portray them.

Biography The son of the Chief Stahlmeister, Prince Alexander Borisovich Kurakin and Alexandra Ivanovna, n√©e Panina. Nothing is known of his childhood and youth; in 1761 ‚Äì lieutenant general; in 1762, he was the hofmeister. Having established a commission on November 29, 1762 to resolve the issue of monastic estates, Catherine II appointed to this commission secular persons: Senator Count Ivan Vorontsov, Prince Sergey Gagarin, Chief Prosecutor of the Holy Synod Prince Kozlovsky, Teplov and Prince Boris Kurakin. Upon the establishment of the Collegium of Economy on May 12, 1763, Prince Kurakin was appointed its president. This was a very important appointment: the Collegium of Savings was to collect over one and a half million revenues, that is, almost a tenth of the then total budget of Russia. By a decree of March 30, 1764, the Chamber Collegium was also entrusted with his management; Kurakin was also made a senator. We learn from the empress's papers that she was dissatisfied with the \\"silent situation\\" of such an important collegium as the Chamber Collegium and her appointment as president Kurakin hoped to revive it. The absence of a higher government agency that would manage the state's finances as a whole was a very significant gap in the Russian government throughout the eighteenth century, and the attempt to create such an agency, initiated by the union of the Chamber Collegium and the Collegium of Savings, is extremely remarkable. And Prince Boris Kurakin belonged in this regard, no doubt, the main role. The State Archive contains two remarkable reports submitted by him to the Empress on issues of state economy; after them, he was appointed president of the Chamber Collegium and one of his reports served as the basis for a personal decree dated March 30, 1764, which outlines the unsatisfactory position of the Chamber Collegium at this time and the range of tasks and responsibilities that its activities should determine in order for this activity to receive true state significance. The Chamber Collegium at that time acted according to the regulations of 1731, which significantly narrowed its tasks in comparison with how Peter the Great outlined them. Prince Kurakin proposed to return in general to what Peter had set as the task of the collegium. He argued that the Chamber Collegium should not only be aware of revenues, but should manage, open and create new sources of income, improving, mainly, the situation of those classes that mainly generate income. Empress Catherine highly appreciated the activities of Kurakin. Having received news in Saint Petersburg about his serious illness, she sent him the following rescript on November 21, 1764, in which she attributed the last two phrases with her own hand: The successor to Prince Boris Kurakin for the presidency of the Chamber Collegium, Aleksey Melgunov, completely adopted the ideas of Kurakin, and the order from the collegium for the deputy to the Commission to compose a draft new code was a repetition of the reports of Prince Kurakin. The printed letters of Prince Boris Kurakin to his son, Prince Alexander Kurakin for 1763 and 1764, depict Prince Boris Kurakin to us as a very cordial, serious, and strictly devoted man.

Founded Its first match was played on 17 September 1870. The Ardrossan and Saltcoats Herald of the same date stating: > This game is rather exciting and amusing both for players and spectators, > not to speak of the novelty of the game in this district we have no doubt > that many who have never seen football played properly will avail themselves > of this opportunity. The club took an advert out on the first page of that paper, near the top of the page. It stated: > Members of the Ardrossan Castle Foot-Ball Club are requested to meet on the > Practice Ground (Head of Glasgow Street) today at 3pm precisely to take part > in the opening game of this club. History Rugby union in Ardrossan evidently was on the rise - as within a month of the Castle side's first match, another Ardrossan rugby union side became its main rival. Simply known as Ardrossan, this side had played Ardrossan Castle on the 24th September 1870 and had a re-match on 1 October 1870. The Castle side were now playing on the Castle ground. The first match is noted as being played over a two-hour period, divided into four half-hours. There was no scoring for the first hour but McAusland scored a try for Castle; and Hughes scored a try for Ardrossan; more crucially for the scoring at the time both conversions were good. Brown got another try for Castle but the goal attempt was missed. In the fourth half-hour, the Castle scored another try through Shaw. The conversion not recorded was obviously successful as the newspaper reports that Castle won the match by a goal. In March 1871 a rugby union match was played between Ardrossan Castle and Paisley. This match ended in a no-scoring draw; but the return match was won by Paisley by a try to zero. It is likely that the club folded by 1889; when the lack of sports grounds available to Ardrossan sides had put paid to their existence. Other sports The Ardrossan Castle name was used for other sports notably cricket and curling. The Ardrossan Castle Cricket Club was defunct by 1889; as noted by the response in the Irvine Times of Friday 10 May 1889. The club was sent a challenge by Beith Cricket Club for a match but the club could no longer fulfil the fixture. The cricket club blamed a lack of a sports field for the match; which they stated had affected all the sports of the town. 'There is no place available for sports' it lamented. The columnist hoped that if a suitable sports field was secured remnants of the Ardrossan Castle side and the Parkend side - evidently also defunct - might join together as a new viable team. The Ardrossan Castle Curling Club was evidently more successful. The Royal Caledonian Curling Society admitted them as members in January 1850. The newspaper reports that the Bonspeil was in Lochwinnoch, and that the laird did not let them use the Castle Semple Loch; and that they had to use the Barr Loch instead about a mile away to the south-west of the town. Ardrossan Castle fielded a curling side till 1958. A much later Ardrossan Castle playing association football seems unconnected. This was the name of a local Under 16 side.

Early years Maria Lu√≠sa Domingas Eug√©nia Ana Filomena Josefa Ant√≥nia Francisca Xavier Sales de Borja de Assis and Paula de Sousa Holstein was born on 4 August 1841, in Lisbon, in the Palace of the Dukes of Palmela. She had blonde hair and blue eyes, presumably inherited from Maria Anna Leopoldina von Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Beck, the grandmother of the first Duke of Palmela. She attended a school in France, where the daughters of the European aristocracy received a religious education taught by nuns, but also had classes in fine arts, and visits to museums, monuments and concerts. In what was the Lisbon society wedding of the year, in April 1863 she married D. Ant√≥nio de Sampaio e Pina de Brederode, the second son of the Viscount of Lan√ßada, who was a soldier who had volunteered for the British army and fought in the Crimean War (1853‚Äì56). On the death of her father in 1864 three years after her mother's death, she became the Duchess of Palmela and her husband became the 3rd Duke. At the age of 24, the new Duchess was in control not only of a vast fortune but also an artistic heritage consisting of the family's many properties and the numerous works of art they contained. Artistic work Appreciated as a sculptor, she was also a significant patron of the arts, both by awarding scholarships and financial grants and by commissioning and buying works of art to modernize the already notable Palmela collection. She started her artistic career soon after the birth of her two children, D. Helena Maria Domingas in 1864, and D. Pedro Maria Lu√≠s Eug√©nio in 1866. Important initial influences were Victor Bastos of Portugal‚Äôs Academy of Fine Arts in Lisbon, which had been founded in 1836, and the Frenchman, , an artist of the Romantic school who had arrived in Lisbon in 1858. Calmels painted and sculpted the Palmela family and in 1865 and 1866 worked with the Duchess on the redesign of the late-18th-century Palmela palace in Lisbon, continuing to provide works of art for the palace until the turn of the century. He was also responsible for the decoration of a summer house that the Duke and Duchess built in Cascais at the time when the royal family were spending part of their summers there. De Sousa Holstein's artistic training was not just restricted to formal lessons by Bastos and Calmels. Affluent, cosmopolitan, and enlightened, she surrounded herself with some of the most respected artists of the time. She was a friend of the actresses Sarah Bernhardt, who visited Lisbon in 1895, and Eleonora Duse. In the field of sculpture, she worked in Paris with Auguste Rodin and Jean-Baptiste Claude Eug√®ne Guillaume. Guillaume sculpted a bust of her in 1889. With a favourable reception at her first two showings in Lisbon, the Duchess exhibited at the 1878 Exposition Universelle (1878) in Paris, possibly using her connections to secure a place. Exhibiting at the annual exhibitions of the \\"Society for the Promotion of Fine Arts\\" (Sociedade Promotora das Belas-artes-SPBA) as well as at smaller exhibitions of paintings often held in Lisbon's bookshops, she continued to gain favourable comment for her sculptures and watercolours. The writer Ramalho Ortig√£o said that she was \\"no longer a simple amateur, a dilettante, but an artist in the most beautiful sense of the word\\", and the journalist Rangel de Lima noted that \\"the art of sculpture in Portugal can, therefore, be exalted for having among its cultivators such a noble and distinguished amateur in the works to which she connects her name\\". Her first presentation at the Salon of the Soci√©t√© des Artistes Fran√ßais in Paris was in 1884, where her sculpture of Diogenes was very favourably received. It became sufficiently popular to be subsequently reproduced in smaller versions in brass. While her works received considerable acclamation, the willingness of a member of the nobility to put in the hard work required to reach a stage of competence that, were she poor, would have enabled her to live on her work was often commented on. Some observers were suspicious and gave her the nickname of the \\"Duchess of Calmels\\", implying that her teacher C√©lestin-Anatole Calmels had more to do with the production of the works of art than just her training. Others disagreed, noting that her work was too \\"feminine\\" to have been helped by Calmels. She remained unaffected by the criticism and her work as a sculptor was finally recognized by Portugal with the award of the Order of Santiago () in 1909, the year of her death. The order is awarded for exceptional and outstanding merit in literature, science, and the arts. While many female painters emerged in Portugal in the second half of the 19th century, De Sousa Holstein remained the predominant Portuguese woman sculptor of the time. Charitable work At the end of the 19th century, Lisbon had many poor people and the streets were full of beggars, particularly children. The Duchess of Palmela, together with Maria Isabel de Lemos Saint-L√©ger, Marchioness of Rio Maior, thought of promoting an institution that would serve meals, at reasonable prices, to the most deprived sections of the population. They decided to form the \\"Society to Promote Economic Kitchens\\" (). With the support of several other aristocratic families, banks and other donors guaranteed, the Duchess of Palmela visited Switzerland and England to see how such charitable organizations operated. On her return she ordered, at her own expense, all necessary equipment, including kitchen utensils, ovens, tables and chairs, and cutlery. She also arranged for some Sisters of Charity to travel to Lisbon from France to run the operation. The first soup kitchen opened on 8 December 1893, an important day for the Catholic Church as it is the Feast of the Immaculate Conception. Seven other Economic Kitchens were to follow. The first meal consisted of a bowl of grain soup with rice, stewed cod, of bread, and a glass of wine. Subsequent meals did not include wine. King Carlos I of Portugal often contributed food, such as animals shot during his hunts and surplus fish caught by the royal yacht Am√©lia IV. In her life, the Duchess of Palmela had become such an important and well-known personality that when people in Lisbon spoke of \\"the Duchess\\" everyone knew who they were talking about, even though there were many others with the same title. Following the assassination of King Carlos in Lisbon on 1 February 1908, she remained in seclusion. The final exhibition of her art was in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in the same year. She died on 2 September 1909, at her farm in Sintra, of angina pectoris at the age of 68. The Society for the Promotion of Economic Kitchens continued after the Duchess's death and would eventually pass to the control of the Santa Casa da Miseric√≥rdia de Lisboa, a Portuguese charity connected to the Catholic Church.

The site received protection by the central government as a National Historic Site in 2017. Overview The Irinosawa site is located at an altitude of 49 meters on the southernmost side of a hill sandwiched by the Sakogawa and Nisakogawa rivers, and extends 430 meters north to south and 450 meters east to west. It contains the ruins of many pit dwellings in an extremely dense configuration not found in any other known Kofun period settlement, and was surrounded by a moat. One of the pit dwellings was found to contain two bronze mirrors, 28 iron items and over 200 beads (including several jade magatama) , In addition, many relics have been excavated from other pit building ruins, and two more mirrors. The density of artifacts is highly unusual, but the presence of mirrors is a major mystery, as at the time bronze mirrors were considered sacred ritual items which were in the possession of only the highest rulers and to have several in one ordinary dwelling, let alone in multiple coexisting buildings is unprecedented. Much of the pottery shards found are of a type common in the Kansai region or Japan, and many of the glass beads originated from outside the Japanese archipelago. As the pit dwellings contained no hearth or evidence of habitation, it has been speculated by archaeologists that the buildings are warehouses, possibly a trade center, or possibly an outpost of the Yamato state, which was expanding its influence into the region even during the 4th century AD. The defensive nature of the building arrangement and the fact that many of the buildings appear to have been intentionally destroyed by fire led some weight to this theory, as Yamato influence was spreading over the opposition of the local Emishi tribes. It was excavated in 2017 in conjunction with construction work on a bypass for Japan National Route 4 See also *List of Historic Sites of Japan (Miyagi) ReferencesExternal links * Miyagi Prefecture official site *Kurihara City official site Category:Kurihara, Miyagi Category:Kofun period Category:Archaeological sites in Japan Category:History of Miyagi Prefecture Category:Historic Sites of Japan ","title":"Irinosawa Site"},{"id":"64151307","text":"Podkletnoye () is a rural locality (a selo) in Usmanskoye 2-ye Rural Settlement, Novousmansky District, Voronezh Oblast, Russia.

She taught undergraduate modules on Spanish art at the University College Dublin from 1989 to 2003 along with authoring books, essays, magazine articles and scholarly catalogues on the subject. Biography She was born Rosemarie Scully on 3 April 1942 in Ireland. Growing up in a family with a strong presence in religious art, Mulcahy worked as a model for the Spanish courtier Pedro Rodr√≠guez in Madrid, before working for Balmain in Paris in the early 1960s. She became attracted to Spanish art by viewing Abraham and the Three Angels' from the renaissance painter Juan Fern√°ndez Navarrete. Between 1970 and 1973, Mulcahy studied a Bachelor of Arts degree in history and the history of European painting at University College Dublin (UCD). She later studied for a Master's degree in the history of art at London University and, supervised by Anne Crookshank, wrote a doctoral dissertation on Philip II of Spain's artistic patronage at El Escorial at Trinity College Dublin. Mulcahy became involved in environmental initiatives, was an honourary secretary for An Taisce, and was an active committee member of the Upper Leeson Street Area Residents‚Äô Association. Her work involved 16th and 17th-century Spanish art and the Spanish Renaissance. With an interest in Irish contemporary art, in 1988, she served on the Rosc exhibition's executive committee, compiling its accompanying dialogue. That same year, Mulcahy compiled the scholarly catalogue Spanish Paintings at the National Gallery, which was commissioned by Homan Potterton. She began teaching undergraduate models on Spanish art at UCD in 1989 and was later made UCD's adjunct professor and honourary senior fellow of its history of art department. In 1992, Mulcahy's book, The Decoration of the Royal Basilica of El Escorial, was published. She talks about the reconstruction of Philip II's design of El Escorial in the book, the first time there was a thorough reconstruction of the building. The book won the 1994 Eleanor Tufts Prize from the American Society of Hispanic Art Historical Studies. Five years later, Mulcahy published a monographic book on a thesis on a painting by Juan Fern√°ndez de Navarrete. In 2000, she helped to organise an exhibition of the graphic works of the painter and one of her favourite artists Jos√© Hern√°ndez in Dublin. Mulcahy stopped teaching at UCD in 2003. In 2004, she published her collective essays Philip II of Spain, Patron of the Arts. Although she had not thought of a career in university, she was visiting professor in Reinassance studies at Smith College in the United States in the 2009 spring semester. Mulcahy's works were published in Apollo, Archivo Espa√±ol de Arte (English: Spanish Art Archive) and The Burlington Magazine. She was also an honourary associate of the Hispanic Society of America and was an honourary member of the Royal Hibernian Academy. At the time of her death, Mulcahy was involved in the study of sculptures of Pompeo Leoni on the high altar of the Escorial's basilica led by an international research group from the Museo del Prado. Personal life She was married to the engineer and colour artist Se√°n Mulcahy (1926‚Äì2018). In 2001, Juan Carlos I of Spain presented Mulcahy with the Officer's Cross of the Order of Isabella the Catholic to recognise \\"her outstanding contribution to the study of Spanish art and culture.\\" She died suddenly in Dublin on 5 September 2012. Legacy According to The Irish Times, the Patrimonio Nacional, the Spanish royal site body, had admired Mulcahy's work, and \\"was a true hispanista, who loved Spain and its people, and had a passion for flamenco dance, in which art she herself excelled.\\" In November 2013, UCD renamed a seminar room the Rosemarie Mulcahy Seminar Room in its School of Art History & Cultural Policy after her and the scholar's library of Spanish art works, archival material and research and teaching papers were donated by her family to the university to form the Rosemary Mulcahy Collection. The Rosemarie Mulcahy Scholarship for the Study of Spanish Art was established in her honour by Trinity College Dublin and the Centro de Estudios Europa Hisp√°nica.

The author used the pen name Guillermus Saphoensis in this work. Traversagni was a Franciscan friar and humanist scholar from Savona, Northern Italy. Considered to have been the first humanist professor of rhetoric at the University of Cambridge, Traversagni wrote the Margaritae eloquentiae as a guide to rhetoric and the art of preaching. The original book was published in 1478 under the full title of Rhetorica nova, sive, Margarita eloquentiae castigate ad eloquendum divina accommodata, (The new rhetoric, or, The pearl of purified eloquence, adapted to the expression of matters divine). The Epitome margaritae eloquentiae is a short summary of Rhetorica nova and was finished during Traversagni‚Äôs stay in Paris in 1480. It was only ever published in England by William Caxton probably in the same year. Traversagni is known to have visited England twice in the 1470s and may have paid Caxton to print the book. Traversagni could then sell copies to his pupils. In the Epitome Traversagni argues that preaching is a rhetorical skill which aims to promote Christian virtue. At Cambridge Traversagni had lectured on Aristotle's Ethics and also the Rhetorica ad Herennium attributed to Cicero. He uses these philosophers' concepts of demonstrative logic to prove his point.  Physical Description  The copy of the Epitome in Leeds Special Collections is printed on Italian paper of the kind made in Fabriano and Genoa in the medieval period and has watermarks of the scissors type. The binding is 20th century limp vellum with a smooth spine. The ‚ÄòEpitome is printed in Caxton‚Äôs type 2* with 29 long lines to a full page. The signatures are [a‚Å∂ b‚Å¥ c‚Å∂ d‚Å∂ e‚Å∏ f‚Å¥]. There are no printed signatures, catchwords or pagination.  Provenance  The Epitome was formerly part of a volume which belonged to Anthony Higgin who was Dean of Ripon from 1608‚Äì1624. The rest of the volume is in the British Library. In 1960 the Epitome was bought for the Brotherton Collection.  Feature  The second page of a ballad relating to Henry Fitzroy Duke of Richmond and Somerset (1519‚Äì1536) written on a sheet inserted at the back of the volume There is a handwritten annotation on the verso of the final leaf of the book and the recto of an inserted leaf.

She is notable for taking part in the First voyage of Kerguelen and for her subsequent solo mission of discovery to Australia. Anse du Gros Ventre was named in her honour. Career Gros Ventre was built at Bayonne on plans by L√©on-Michel Guignace, on plans by Jean-Joseph Ginoux, as a 16-gun armed storeship. In 1768, she was at Brest, first under count de Roquefeuil-Montpeyroux, who sailed her to Amsterdam, and later under La Brizolli√®re In 1769, command of Gros Ventre went to Beaumont, who sailed her from Rochefort to Toulon, calling Lisbon on the way, along with her sister-ship Tamponne. In 1771, she was under Faur√®s.. In 1772, Gros Ventre was at Isle de France (Mauritius). On 20 August 1771, Berryer arrived at the island, under Lieutenant Kerguelen, tasked with a mission of exploration to seek new territories South of Isle de France. Kerguelen abandoned Berryer and requisitioned the 24-gun fluyt Fortune and Gros Ventre to continue his mission. Fortune and Gros Ventre started by surveying a new route to the Coromandel Coast discovered in 1767 by then- Ensign Grenier, of the corvette Heure du Berger. Then, on 16 January 1772, Gros Ventre and Fortune departed for the First voyage of Kerguelen, Gros Ventre under Saint Alo√ºarn. Gros Ventre and Fortune sailed South, the crew suffering considerably from the cold, for which they were neither prepared nor equipped. On 13 February, they sighted land, and Ensign Boisguehenneuc managed to land, and claim the new shore for France. From 14, the ships surveyed the coast, but the poor state of the crew prevented anchoring. On 16, Gros Ventre and Fortune lost sight one from another in the fog and a heavy sea. On 18, both stopped searching for the other and, while Fortune returned to Isle de France under Kerguelen , Gros Ventre sailed under Saint Alo√ºarn to the 40th Southern parallel, where she arrived on 4 March, and on 17, she reached Cape Leeuwin. For several days, Gros Ventre attempted to land a party ashore, but the cliffs and currents frustrated the attempt. The ship then sailed North, surveying the coast on the way, arriving at Shark Bay on 28 March. On 30, Gros Ventre found a spot where she could drop anchor and send a boat ashore, under Ensign Mengaud. Saint Alo√ºarn lay a claim by deploying a flag and burying a message and two coins. Gros Ventre left Shark Bay on 8 April and sailed to Timor, following and surveying the Australian coast on the way. She arrived on 3 May and spent some time restoring her supplies and resting her crew. She departed again on 1 July, arriving at Batavia on 17 July. From there, she sailed on 8 August and arrived back at Isle de France on 5 September 1772. After Saint Alo√ºarn died, on 27 October 1772, Ensign Boisguehenneuc took command. From 1774 to 1776, Gros Ventre was at Isle de France under Charles de Mengaud de la Haye, shuttling between Isle de France and Isle Bourbon (now La R√©union).  Fate  In 1777, Gros Ventre was hulked at Isle de France. She is last mentioned in lists in 1779.

It adopted as its journal the Buchbinder-Zeitung, which had been published since 1880, and in 1904 established a head office in Berlin. The union played a leading role in establishing the International Federation of Bookbinders and Kindred Trades.

Leuven ; Paris ; Bristol, CT: Peeters 2015.  Earlier archaeological research  Archaeological research on the Asasif necropolis was conducted in 1883 by the Supreme Council of Antiquities (SCA) and in the 1920s by an expedition directed by Herbert E. Winlock from the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. From 1969 to 1977, an expedition from the University of Vienna and the Austrian Archaeological Institute in Cairo carried out work in the framework of the ‚ÄúAustrian Excavations in the Asasif‚Äù project directed by Manfred Bietak.  Recent archaeological research and discoveries  The Austrian excavations were resumed as part of The Ankh-Hor Project directed by Julia Budka, in cooperation with the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich and the Austrian Academy of Sciences. The project aims to complete the documentation and conservation works initiated by M. Bietak, especially in the area of Saite Theban Tomb 414 (the tomb of Ankh-Hor), which will enhance our knowledge about the burial practices and grave furnishings of the 1st millennium BC. In 2009‚Äì2014, a Spanish expediotion from Instituto de Estudios del Antiguo Egipto in Madrid conducted research in the chapel of the tomb of Vizier Amenhotep Huy (Asasif Tomb No. 28).Francisco Jose Martin Valentin, Chapel of the tomb belonging to Amenhotep III‚Äôs Vizier, Amenhotep Huy.

Morales. In 2013, the Polish ‚ÄúAsasif Project‚Äù, directed by Anastasia Stupko-Lubczy≈Ñska and Patryk Chudzik, commenced its work under the auspices of the Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology University of Warsaw. It aims to document private funerary architecture of the Middle Kingdom. Both the interiors of the rock-cut tombs and their courtyards on the rocky slopes are studied. The graves belong to high-ranking officials from the reigns of Mentuhotep Nebhepetre II and the subsequent rulers of the 11th and 12th dynasties. The results of the excavations, as well as studies of architectural remains and small finds, should also throw light on the later rebuilding and reuse of these structures. Although the necropolis had been known and studied for years, the Polish team made a discovery in 2014: a funerary chapel from the 12th dynasty, with a fragment of a limestone altar and funerary offerings, was uncovered in one of the courtyards. Another project, started in 2018, is the ‚ÄúFrench Archaeological Mission in Asasif‚Äù (FAMA), a joint undertaking of the Institut fran√ßais du Proche-Orient (IFAO), University of Strasbourg, and the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) directed by Fr√©d√©ric Colin.

The research conducted by the Egyptians, which focuses on the tombs located on the bottom of the valley, has yielded the most spectacular discoveries: in 2019, a cachette with thirty wooden coffins from the 22nd dynasty (946‚Äì722 BC), containing excellently-preserved mummies of priests and priestesses, was found.

The five servicemen were drawn to check on a suspicious car which turned out to be a car bomb which exploded when attempts were made to open the door to which his trigger was connected. The perpetrators of the attack were Vincenzo Vinciguerra (guilty confess), Carlo Cicuttini and Ivano Boccaccio, members of the subversive neo-fascist group New Order; exponents of the armed forces and of the police also ended up under investigation for attempts to misdirect the investigation through the opening of lines of inquiry, later revealed to be inconsistent, towards organizations and groups of left and far left. The same secretary of the Social Movement Giorgio Almirante was accused of having favored the escape and hiding in Spain of one of the perpetrators of the attack, Carlo Cicuttini, who was sentenced to life imprisonment in in absentia. Cicuttini began serving his sentence in 1998, but for health reasons he was released from prison and died in 2010, while Vinciguerra served his life sentence.  History  The period in which this blood event took place was in a precise and delicate historical-political context: on May 7, 1972 the early political elections had taken place, which had assigned the leadership of the country to a new executive chaired by Giulio Andreotti, while the Calabresi murder occurred on 17 May. The political debate was still turbulent, and was accompanied by feared attempts at coup d'√©tat. Before Peteano, there were several terrorist attacks and massacres of fascist origin, in conjunction with the tensions linked to the groups of the extra-parliamentary left that had undertaken the armed struggle, there was a climate of tension and concern within the parties. politicians and government, a first step towards what has been called \\"theory of opposite extremisms\\". The night of May 31, at 22:35, an anonymous phone call reached the switchboard of the emergency service of the Carabinieri station of Gorizia: to receive it and to register it was the switchboard operator Domenico La Malfa. The text of the communication in dialectal language is as follows:: Three gazelles of the carabinieri arrived on the marked place, who found the white Fiat 500 with the two holes on the windscreen, as the anonymous informant had communicated in dialect. The first patrol that is sent is that of the Gradisca carabinieri, with the pinned Mango and the carabiniere Dongiovanni. Ten minutes later the two are on site and find the Cinquecento number plate GO 45902. It is visible in a dirt lane, immediately after a curve, at kilometer 5. Mango decides to call his officer, Lieutenant Tagliari, who also leaves accompanied by the brigadier Antonio Ferraro and the carabiniere Donato Poveromo and arrive on the spot with a second gazelle at 23:05, then joined by a third patrol from Gorizia. The carabinieri Antonio Ferraro, Donato Poveromo and Franco Dongiovanni attempted to open the hood of the vehicle, causing the car to explode and being killed, while two others were seriously injured.  Investigations  Colonel Dino Mingarelli, the old right-hand man of the general Giovanni de Lorenzo, was placed to direct the investigation on the matter. Mingarelli immediately directed his investigation into the Lotta Continua circles of Trento, but the investigations did not obtain the expected results: the Milanese judiciary received information according to which the attack would be carried out by a group neo-fascist terrorist, which also included Ivano Boccaccio, a militant killed in an attempted hijacking of a plane at Ronchi dei Legionari airport in the following October. The information had been given by Giovanni Ventura, meanwhile arrested for the massacre in Piazza Fontana: the colonel however discarded the Milanese indication, as an order from the SID invited him to suspend investigations into the far-right terrorist group. The colonel, with his \\"right arm\\" captain Antonino Chirico, directed the investigative attentions towards six young people, leading them to trial: according to Mingarelli they would take revenge on some rude people suffered by the carabinieri. The proposed motive did not convince the judges, who acquitted the six young people, who, once free, denounced Mingarelli for the false accusations, initiating a new investigation against police officers and magistrates for having diverted the investigations. Meanwhile, the investigation of the massacre was directed towards the neo-fascist circles.

It was uploaded on 13 October 2014 onto the Filmbilder & Friends YouTube channel. Production and release The film was created by Andreas Hykade and funded by the Federal Film Board. Nuggets features a stylised and minimalist animation style. A kiwi, the short's only character, is drawn with black strokes and lines, and is staged on a pure white background, with splashes of goldish yellow being featured in the form of the titular nuggets. German studio Film Bilder released Nuggets onto their Filmbilder & Friends YouTube channel on 13 October 2014. The video is just over 5 minutes in duration. The video credits Hykade with the film's script, direction, and animation. Angela Steffen worked on the film's animation and artwork. Heiko Maile worked on the film's music and sound design. Additionally, Ralf Bohde, Bianca Just, and Thomas Meyer-Hermann received post- production, production management, and production credits, respectively. Plot and themes Nuggets follows a kiwi who encounters nuggets as it walks down a path. As it indulges in a nugget, the kiwi experiences a blissful high, causing the kiwi to feel as if it is flying in the air. The kiwi progressively experiences diminishing returns with each nugget it consumes, with subsequent flights becoming shorter and the falls back down to the ground becoming harsher. As the kiwi struggles with this, the white background also becomes darker and darker. The short portrays the nugget as a metaphor for some sort of drug, with the story itself functioning as an allegory for the stages of addiction. While there are no explicit references to drugs, some media publications have suggested the short specifically addresses drug addiction, with HuffPost Korea writing that most YouTube viewers also interpreted this meaning. Reception The video was covered by media outlets internationally. HuffPost Canada wrote that the kiwi's struggle with addiction was \\"extraordinarily gripping\\", opining that \\"there's something so devastatingly human between the stark black and white lines of German animator Andreas Hykade's five-minute creation.\\" RTBF, a French public broadcasting organisation wrote that the mise-en-sc√®ne in Nuggets was \\"refined\\". Writing for Fast Company, Joe Berkowitz called Nuggets \\"a fully realized allegory for addiction\\", and opined that it \\"succinctly captures the heartbreaking reality of addiction.\\" The video achieved virality on YouTube, receiving over 3 million views in a little over a month following its release. By April 2015, it reached over 7 million views. As of June 2020, the video has received over 19 million views. Outside of YouTube, Nuggets was also widely shared on Reddit.

In 1984, he founded les ballets C de la B, which has been called 'one of the world's most influential dance theatre companies'. Platel came to prominence alongside choreographers like Anne Teresa de Keersmaeker and Wim Vandekeybus in what became known as the Flemish Wave. CareerEarly years (1956‚Äì1984)= Alain Platel was born in Ghent in 1956. In 1969, he was accepted to study at the Hoste-Sabbattini Mime Centre in Ghent. He trained as a remedial educationalist, working with physically and mentally disabled children, but continued to study mime (with Wim Vandekerckhove) and later to take courses at the Paul Grinwis Academy of Ballet. In 1980, he attended a contemporary dance workshop led by the Canadian choreographer Barbara Pearce in Paris, and went on to dance in her production Patchwork. As a director, Platel is self-taught. =Les ballets C de la B (1984‚Äì2003)= Platel founded les ballets C de la B in 1984 on a dare from a former teacher. Along with his sister Pascale and their friend Johan Grimonprez, Platel devised and staged a performance in his loft in Ghent (Stabat Mater). They ironically called themselves 'Les Ballets Contemporains de la Belgique': a name which stuck, albeit in a shortened form. A producer from Antwerp's De Beweeging Festival was present at the performance and invited the newly formed company to perform at the festival. Stabat Mater was the first in a succession of small-scale productions made by les ballets C de la B during the late 1980s and early 1990s, for which Platel shared directing roles with other members of the company. Les ballets C de la B quickly achieved a modest level of national success, but their major break came in 1993, when a group of international theatre programmers happened to see Platel's Bonjour madame‚Ä¶ at a festival in Amsterdam, which led to European tour bookings and a rapidly growing profile on the international dance scene. Between 1993 and 2003, les ballets C de la B produced an increasing number of larger-scale projects, securing international commissions and state funding from the Flemish government. Run as a collective, the company's performers were encouraged to develop their own choreography and Platel shared directing duties with other members including Hans Van den Broeck, Christine De Smedt and Koen Augustijnen. Platel's productions included three collaborations with the author and theatre-maker Arne Sierens and Ghent-based youth theatre company Victoria (Moeder en kind, Bernadetje, allemaal indiaan). At the same time, Platel began incorporating live musicians within his choreography, in a series of productions constructed around the work of famous composers, beginning with La Tristeza Complice (1995), a co-production with the music theatre company LOD muziektheater, which featured music by Henry Purcell arranged for ten accordionists. This was followed by Iets op Bach (1998): the first of several works based on music by the director's favourite composer, J. S. Bach. Platel organised the Beste Belgische Danssolo competition between 1995‚Äì1997, open to solos of any style and designed to discover new talent. The first competition was won by Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui, who subsequently performed in Iets op Bach and would go on to choreograph many of les ballets C de la B's productions. Shortly after making allemaal indiaan (1999), Platel announced that he would no longer be making productions. Nevertheless, he returned to les ballets C de la B in 2003 with Wolf, commissioned by the Ruhrtriennale, which used music by Mozart and counted fourteen dogs among its performers. =Hiatus and return to directing (2003‚Äì)= During his hiatus from directing, Alain Platel studied sign language and continued to work with amateur and semi-professional performers from varied backgrounds, as documented in his collaborations with the documentarian Sophie Fiennes (Because I Sing, 2002; Ramallah! Ramallah! Ramallah!, 2004). In 2006, Platel directed his own full-length documentary about the dancers of les ballets C de la B, entitled les ballets de ci de l√†. In the same year, Platel returned to the company as a director, with vsprs (2006), based on Monteverdi's Vespers. This production cemented the director's collaboration with the composer Fabrizio Cassol, which began with the participatory choral project Uit de Bol (2006), and would continue with piti√©! (2008), Coup Fatal (2014) and Requiem pour L. (2018). Since 2006, Platel has continued to direct new work with les ballets C de la B, usually in collaboration with other artists. Nine Finger (2007) was made with actor Benjamin Verdonck and Fumiyo Ikeda of Rosas, while Gardenia (2010) and En avant, marche! (2015) were collaborations with the director Frank Van Laecke and Platel's regular music director Steven Prengels. Platel currently lives in Ghent. Style In his own productions and in his influence on the overall aesthetics of les ballets C de la B, Alain Platel's work is characterised by the extensive, often chaotic combination of dance, theatre, live music, circus and other performance styles. Most of his later productions are structured around live performances of famous classical works, with the musicians being fully involved in the choreography. A particularly grand example of this is C(H)≈íURS (2011), which featured the 72-person chorus of the Teatro Real Madrid performing operatic choruses by Wagner and Verdi. Often, the music is extensively reconstructed or rearranged by Platel's musical collaborators; Coup Fatal (2014) involves a Congolese band performing Baroque arias, while nicht schlafen (2016) combines music by Mahler with African polyphonic chant. Platel's productions have always involved varied ensembles of performers with different skills, levels of training, backgrounds and body types, including amateurs, children and elderly performers. His work includes large-scale celebrations of amateur performance, such as Because I Sing (2001) which featured sixteen London choirs (reprised in 2006 in Brussels as Uit de Bol/Coup de ch≈ìurs), and le Sacre du Printemps (2018): a 'mass choreography' that involved 300 participants from various Ghent dance groups. Gardenia featured a cast of seven drag queens, all aged between 55 and 65 years, inspired by the closing of a Barcelona drag cabaret. Platel's choreographic work is also concerned with the unconscious: with uncontrolled, unconditioned or arbitrary movements, tics and spasms, which he has described as 'bastard dance'. The movement material explored in projects such as vsprs (2006), Out of Context ‚Äî for Pina (2010) and tauberbach (2014) was informed by Platel's own experience working with disabled children and adults. Platel has acknowledged Pina Bausch as an important inspiration, calling himself 'a child of Bausch'.

One of the strategies includes the claims that the Jasenovac concentration camp was just a labor camp, not an extermination camp. The Croatian Wikipedia has also attracted attention from international media because of bias and negationism about the crimes of the NDH.  Historiography  SFR Yugoslavia = The genocide of Serbs was not properly examined in the aftermath of the war, because the post-war Yugoslav government led by the Communist Party didn't encourage independent scholars out of concern that ethnic tensions stemming from the war could have the capacity to destabilize the new regime. They tried to conceal wartime atrocities and to mask specific ethnic losses. The genocide scholar Henry R. Huttenbach wrote that ‚Äúan ideologized and camouflaged Titoist Yugoslav history‚Äù suppressed the genocide against Serbs, as well as that ‚Äúsuppression bordering of total denial‚Äù. All World War II casualties were presented as ‚ÄúYugoslavs‚Äù, while all collaborationists were named as ‚Äúfascists‚Äù. = Croatia = Historian Mirjana Kasapoviƒá explained that in the most important scientific works on genocide, crimes against Serbs, Jews and Roma in the NDH are unequivocally classified as genocide. However, she concluded that there are three main strategies of historical revisionism in the part of modern-day Croatian historiography: the NDH was a normal counter-insurgency state at the time; no mass crimes were committed in the NDH, especially genocide; the Jasenovac camp was just a labor camp, not an extermination camp. Croatian textbooks justified the existence of the NDH with an emotional narrative: the ¬ç‚Äúmillennial thread‚Äù of Croatian statehood had been annulled under by ‚Äúthe greater-Serbian regime‚Äôs attempt to destroy all signs of Croatian nationness‚Äù. Futhermore, textbooks relativize terror against Serbs by claiming that was a result of ‚Äútheir previous hegemony‚Äù. Historian Hrvoje Klasiƒá noted that since the independence of Croatia during the Breakup of Yugoslavia, a new approach to the study and teaching of Croatian history was established, which includes downplaying and denying Usta≈°e crimes. He stated that the trend of revisionism and negationism varied in intensity over the next twenty-five years, but was never completely stopped. Historian Rory Yeomans said in 2018 that historical revisionism in the 1990s had ‚Äúits strongholds in the academy and mainstream politics‚Äù and that today's revisionists aim to rehabilitate the Usta≈°e regime in its entirety, comparing it to a Tuƒëman-era when the trend was to minimize the crimes or rehabilitate only certain aspects of it. He also noted that revisionists claim that commemorating the Usta≈°e crimes constitutes an attempt to ‚Äúblacken the name of Croatia, declare the Croats a genocidal people and criminalize the Homeland War‚Äù. In his review of Josip Jurƒçeviƒá's work, The Origin of the Jasenovac Myth, the German historian Holm Sundhaussen notes that while Jurƒçeviƒá is justified in his criticism of communist Yugoslavia's Jasenovac casualty numbers, he \\"willingly and thoughtlessly\\" adopts the term \\"Jasenovac myth\\" and tries to demonstrate, through the omitting of information, that Jasenovac was a \\"labor camp\\" and that genocide in the WW2 Independent State of Croatia did not occur. Jurƒçeviƒá also wrote that concentration camp victims dying from poor hygiene and infectious diseases. Croatia's far-right often advocates the false theory that Jasenovac was a \\"labour camp\\" where mass murder did not take place. Some rights activists say that distortion of World War II crimes exist in Croatia and it was especially prevalent during the 1990s war when anti-Serb sentiment was high. One prominent promoter of this is the far-right NGO \\"The Society for Research of the Threefold Jasenovac Camp\\". Its members include journalist Igor Vukiƒá and academic Josip Peƒçariƒá who have written books promoting this theory. The Ideas promoted by its members have been amplified by mainstream media interviews and book tours. The last book, \\"The Jasenovac Lie Revealed\\" written by Vukiƒá, prompted the Simon Wiesenthal Center to urge Croatian authorities to ban such works, noting that they \\"would immediately be banned in Germany and Austria and rightfully so\\". When asked if the society engaged in genocide denial, Vukiƒá responded by saying \\"When it‚Äôs about genocide, it is often linked to Serbs. If it‚Äôs about that, we do deny it\\". Menachem Z. Rosensaft, the general counsel of the World Jewish Congress, condemned the affirmative column about Vukiƒá's book written by Milan Ivko≈°iƒá in the Veƒçernji list, emphasizing that ‚Äúthere are horrific realities of history that must not be questioned, distorted or denied by anyone‚Äù. In 2016, Croatian filmmaker Jakov Sedlar released a documentary Jasenovac ‚Äì The Truth which advocated the same theories, labeling the camp as a \\"collection and labour camp\\". The film contained alleged falsifications and forgeries, in addition to denial of crimes and hate speech towards politicians and journalists.  High officials' statements  Some Croats, including politicians, have attempted to minimise the magnitude of the genocide perpetrated against Serbs in the Independent State of Croatia. By 1989, the future President of Croatia, Franjo Tuƒëman had embraced Croatian nationalism, and published Horrors of War: Historical Reality and Philosophy, in which he questioned the official number of victims killed by the Usta≈°e during the Second World War. In his book, Tuƒëman claimed that between 30,000 and 40,000 died at Jasenovac. Some scholars and observers accused Tuƒëman of ‚Äúflirting with ideas associated with the Usta≈°e movement‚Äù and downplaying the number of victims in the Independent State of Croatia. Nonetheless, in his book, he did confirm that genocide happened: Franjo Tuƒëman sparked controversy over ‚Äúflirting with the Usta≈°e ideas‚Äù and downplaying the number of victims in the NDH In 2006, a video was leaked showing Croatian President Stipe Mesiƒá giving a speech in Australia in the early 1990s, in which he said that the Croats had \\"won a great victory on April 10th\\" (the date of the formation of the Independent State of Croatia in 1941), and that Croatia needed to apologize to no one for Jasenovac. Vijesti.net: \\"stari govor Stipe Mesiƒáa: Pobijedili smo 10. travnja!\\", index.hr; accessed 4 March 2014. Later on, Mesiƒá apologized for his indecent statement and stated that he undoubtedly considered anti-fascism to be the basis of modern-day Croatia, appreciated Yugoslav Partisans and considered it necessary to \\"reaffirm anti- fascism as a human and civilization commitment in the function of the unavoidable condition for the building of a democratic Croatia, a country of equal citizens.\\" In 2017, two new videos Mesiƒá from 1992 were made public in which he stated that Jasenovac wasn't a death camp and praised Ustashe minister Andrija Artukoviƒá. On 17 April 2011, in a commemoration ceremony, Croatian President Ivo Josipoviƒá warned that there were \\"attempts to drastically reduce or decrease the number of Jasenovac victims\\", adding, \\"faced with the devastating truth here that certain members of the Croatian people were capable of committing the cruelest of crimes.\\" Croatian historian and politician Zlatko Hasanbegoviƒá, who previously served as the country's Minister of Culture in 2016, has been accused of downplaying the crimes of the Usta≈°e and trying to rehabilitate their ideas in his work. In 1996, Hasanbegoviƒá wrote at least two articles in the magazine \\"The Independent State of Croatia\\", edited by the small far-right Croatian Liberation Movement party (HOP), in which he glorified the Usta≈°e as heroes and martyrs and denied crimes committed by the regime. In response, Hasanbegoviƒá denied being an apologist for the regime, stating that Usta≈°a crimes during the Second World War were \\"the biggest moral lapse\\" of the Croatian people in their history and that his words were taken out of context for political manipulation. Since 2016, anti-fascist groups, leaders of Croatia's Serb, Roma and Jewish communities and former top Croat officials have boycotted the official state commemoration for the victims of the Jasenovac concentration camp because, as they said, Croatian authorities refused to denounce the Usta≈°e legacy explicitly and they downplayed and revitalized crimes committed by Usta≈°e. In September 2019, during the meeting with Adama Dieng, the UN Secretary- General's Special Adviser for the Prevention of Genocide, ≈Ωeljko Kom≈°iƒá, the Croat member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina said that the crime of genocide against Serbs, Roma and Jews committed by the Independent State of Croatia is denied through the public and political activity of some individuals in Croatia.  Croatian Wikipedia  The Croatian Wikipedia has received attention from international media for promoting a fascist worldview as well as a bias against Serbs by means of historical revisionism and negating or diluting the severity of the crimes that were committed by the Usta≈°e regime. The controversy erupted in September 2013 when a group of exiled Wikipedians started a Facebook page in order to discuss the takeover of the Croatian Wikipedia by right-wingers, bringing the issue to the attention of Croatian and Serbian news outlets. The issue was reported by Croatia's daily Jutarnji list and even made its print edition's front page on 11 September 2013. In one pertinent example, the Croatian page on the Jasenovac concentration camp refers to the camp as both a ‚Äúcollection camp‚Äù and a labor camp, and it downplays the crimes that were committed at Jasenovac, as well as the number of victims who died there, and it also relies on right-wing media and private blogs as references. Apart from whitewashing the crimes and vices of World War II-era criminals, the same thing is done for contemporary Croatian politicians and public figures.

According to officials, the police and soldiers were fired upon by McAtee, and two Louisville officers and two National Guardsmen returned fire. McAtee was killed by a shot fired from a guardsman. The body cams of the police involved were deactivated during the shooting, in violation of department policy. Hours later, police chief Steve Conrad was fired by Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer.; ; Biography David McAtee was the youngest child of Odessa Riley and James McAtee, and had eight siblings. He owned and operated YaYa‚Äôs BBQ Shack, a popular barbeque restaurant in Louisville's predominantly black West End neighborhood, a food desert, and was a \\"beloved fixture\\" of his community. He had a reputation for generosity, including serving food at no cost in his restaurant to police officers and members of his community who were struggling financially. Having de-escalated potentially violent situations on multiple occasions, he was also known as a calming presence in his neighborhood. He adopted the name YaYa after becoming a Rastafarian around 2010. Incident In the context of a 9 p.m. curfew related to protests concerning the recent violent deaths of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, the LMPD and National Guard were attempting to disperse a crowd of people in and around the parking lot of Dino's Food Mart, a popular social gathering spot at a gas station across the street from McAtee's restaurant. Witnesses in the crowd said the gathering was independent of the protests and was instead part of a weekly neighborhood social occasion at which McAtee served food. They allege that soldiers and police, in their effort to enforce the curfew, had boxed the crowd into the area thus causing a panic, which resulted in people running towards the restaurant. According to an LMPD statement, someone in the crowd opened fire at the armed officers and soldiers, who returned fire. A bullet shot by a National Guard soldier struck McAtee in the chest, killing him at the scene at about 12:15 a.m. Following the shooting, hundreds of people stood near the restaurant, and McAtee's body remained lying at the scene for 12‚Äì14 hours while police investigated. After the coroner removed the body and the police departed, president of the Louisville affiliate of the National Urban League Sadiqa Reynolds recruited a local gospel singer to sing \\"Amazing Grace\\". Investigation On June 1, Governor Andy Beshear ordered Kentucky State Police to investigate the shooting via a joint effort with the FBI Louisville Field Office and the U.S. Attorney Office for the Western District of Kentucky. On June 2, acting LMPD police chief Schroeder said that security camera footage showed McAtee firing a gun as officers approached his business while clearing out a nearby parking lot.; According to Schroeder, questions remained, \\"including why did he fire and where were police at the time he fired?\\" On June 4, videographic analysis by The New York Times' visual investigations unit of surveillance and bystander videos from four separate angles reconstructed a synchronized chronology of the sequence of events leading to McAtee's death. This analysis concluded that police first fired at least two pepper balls from outside McAtee's restaurant toward his relatives and him, in violation of LMPD policy requiring pepper balls be shot into the ground during crowd dispersal operations, and that \\"law enforcement officials shall avoid the use of force\\" when trying to disperse non-violent crowds. One shot hit and pierced a bottle on an outdoor table, knocking it to the ground, and the other struck the doorway, almost hitting McAtee's niece in the head. At the time, the pepper ball shots may not have been distinguishable from other ammunition. In response, McAtee grabbed his gun and appears to have fired. The Guardian wrote that the video shows that McAtee \\"raises his arm in the air\\", which is \\"a motion consistent with firing a warning shot\\". On June 9, the governor's office said that lab tests from the case concluded that McAtee was killed from a single gunshot by a National Guard soldier. In total, two officers and two guardsmen fired at least 19 shots in McAtee's direction. McAtee was determined to have fired twice with a 9 mm pistol. According to officials, McAtee's shots prompted law enforcement's return fire, which killed him. The identities of the soldiers involved in the shooting have not been released. Aftermath Mayor Greg Fischer fired LMPD Chief Steve Conrad after learning that officers involved in the shooting of McAtee did not have their body cameras turned on. Deputy Chief Robert Schroeder was placed in charge of the department as the interim police chief and declared that the officers' decision to not use their body cameras was a \\"clear failure to (follow) our policy\\" and was \\"completely unacceptable.\\" Many residents and protesters raised concerns about why so many officers and troops were at the location, as the most significant protest that night was roughly 20 blocks away. They have also stated that the group wasn't protesting but were, instead, customers of the store and BBQ cart. Others have raised questions about why rubber bullets had been used in the Highlands but real bullets in the West End. One of the officers involved in the shooting, Officer Katie Crews, became the subject of a professional standards investigation on June 2 after she posted a photo of a protester offering her flowers during a protest on May 28. The photo depicts Crews standing in a police line with other officers, while a white female protester holds flowers near Crews' chest. Crews captioned the photo with \\"I hope the pepper balls that she got lit up with a little later on hurt\\" and claimed that the protester was attempting to elicit a reaction from her with taunts and finished the caption with \\"Come back and get ya some more old girl, I'll be on the line again tonight.\\" Reactions Metro Council President David James described himself as a close personal friend of McAtee and described him as a good man who loved his neighborhood and city. McAtee's mother told reporters that he was known by the policemen and the community, and that he had fed all the policemen and would join them for discussions while they ate.

A few years later he was elected to the Board of the Odessa Art Fund. From 1989 to 1992, Nikolai conducted an art experiment, which culminated in the creation of a poetry collection, ¬´Drawings from Words¬ª (Publishing House Versiya, Odessa, 1996). Nikolai first came to Moscow in 1994 to participate in a major art project, ¬´Mystical Reality¬ª. In 1996, the State Tretyakov Gallery's Art Council granted Nikolai Sednin the right to open a personal exhibition in this museum.

In 2002, in the State Duma of the Russian Federation, works from the series ¬´Portraits¬ª were presented in the project ¬´Dee-Art ‚Äì Art of the 21st Century¬ª. In 2012, the portrait of Vladimir Etush ¬´The Great Illusionist¬ª is exhibited as part of the international art project of the Ardena Gallery ¬´Masterpieces of the Future and the Present. The works of outstanding contemporary artists and antique paintings of the XVIII ‚Äì XX centuries¬ª.

The electronic version of the virtual museum, created on the basis of the book, is available in 50 countries of the world.Apple Books Preview  Dee-Art  Dee-Art (Greek dis ‚Äì twice, art ‚Äì art) is a post-modern trend in art, founded by Nikolai Sednin in 1994. The most important component of Dee-Art is not a certain stylist, but the positive perception by artists of the surrounding reality. History of creation In the second half of the 20th century, the following terms were widely used in world psychiatry: bibliotherapy, art therapy, music therapy, passion therapy, creativity therapy. In 1989, the term ¬´therapy with creative expression¬ª was boldly proposed. The author studied the positive impact of the creativity of patients with neurosis, psychopathy and low-grade schizophrenia on their emotional and behavioral disorders. In 1993, the artist Nikolay Sednin conducted a creative experiment in which the task was to test the idea that he designated as ¬´the effect of a released hand¬ª. The works were created blindfolded by brush on paper, and each image was completed within a few seconds. Later, the works were collected in a single cycle, called drawings for meditation. As a result of the experiment, Nikolay Sednin came up with the idea of a possible purposeful change in consciousness in the process of creativity. The author was interested in the specifics of the appearance of visual images in adults with an uncontrolled psyche, which led to the idea of creating a creative group in a specialized institution. In 1994, Sednin volunteered to organize an art studio called ¬´Healing with Art¬ª at the psychoneurological boarding school No. 20 of Moscow. In the process of training, he created the basic principles and practical method of the program for the rehabilitation of the psyche. The result of his creative activity was the opening in 1999 of the Gallery, which most fully represents the works of painting and graphics from those created in the studio ¬´Healing by Art¬ª. In 2000, thanks to the constant updating of the collection of works, the studio received wide publicity in the media and attracted the attention of the Russian Association of Art Critics. Since the author‚Äôs methodology and style of the works was recognized as individual and non-standard, there was a need for definition for the artistic direction. So the term ¬´Dee-Art¬ª appeared. In 2001, under the patronage of the Association of Art Critics, the album ¬´Dee- Art ‚Äì Art of the 21st Century¬ª was released.Dee Art. The art of the XXI century. The results of the program were presented in 2002 in the State Duma of the Russian Federation, where an exhibition of the artist and his students was held.  Sednin N.N. House Museum  In 2018, the Moscow Region non- governmental cultural institution ¬´SEDNIN NIKOLAY NIKOLAYEVICH'S HOUSE-MUSEUM¬ª was created.Museum official site The Nikolai Sednin Museum presents a collection of exhibits and events: exhibitions ‚Äì original works of painting, graphics and sculpture in a constantly updated exposition; presentations ‚Äì the opening of new expositions of works of art; Awarding at the Museum of laureates and diploma winners of the international competition ¬´Art.

The campaign was coordinated by Suraj Vaidya. The folkloric creature Yeti was chosen as the campaign's official mascot. In March 2020, the campaign was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Nepal.  Campaign  Visit Nepal 2020 was the third tourism promotion campaign undertaken by the Government of Nepal, following the first in 1998 and second in 2011. The government aims to attract 1.5‚Äì2 million tourists in 2020. The 2020 campaign was coordinated by Suraj Vaidya alongside members of the Program Implementation Sub Committee. Vaidya wrote: \\"The success of VNY 2020 will depend on our national pride, willingness and ability to contribute\\".  Promotion  To promote the campaign, the team built more than 108 sculptures around Nepal. The official mascot was chosen to be the Yeti, the ape-like creature from Himalayan folklore, and it was created by US-based Nepali artist Ang Tsherin Sherpa. 108 Yeti sculptures were planned to be displayed around Nepal by the end of 2020. Each sculpture measures in height; they were painted by 108 artists, and cost 500,000 Nepalese rupees (approximately US$4,414; ¬£3,380) per piece. Kamal Pariyar of BBC News wrote about the Yeti's design: \\"Most people seem to agree this probably isn't what they imagine a yeti looks like\\". The mascot was met with some negative feedback based on the cost of the statues, and \\"use of religious and cultural motifs\\".  Cancellation  On 22 March 2020, the government announced the cancellation of the campaign due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Nepal.

Its function was to enable workers to learn the basics of proletarian life and struggle, to teach the basic tenets of Marxism. It was co-founded by Hermann Duncker, Johann Lorenz Schmidt and Eduard Alexander. Hermann Duncker became the director of school. The school became very successful and by 1930, it had 4000 students in 200 courses, which prompted KPD officials to build 30 other schools in German cities e.g. Dresden and Chemnitz. After the seizure of power by the National Soclialists in the spring of 1933, the schools were closed. History The school was created in the tradition of the workers cultural movement with its commercial and Workers' Education Associations (\\"Arbeiterbildungsverein\\"). Following the reprisals of the Anti-Socialist Laws, social democratic and worker's associations were newly founded as training associations. Proletarian associations opened workers' libraries, e.g. in 1861 in Leipzig, where August Bebel was chairman of the library commission of the local workers' association. He formulated the goal of taking knowledge, art and culture away from bourgeoisie guardianship and \\"extracting from existing knowledge what benefited the working-class revolutionary struggle for emancipation.\\" After the separation of the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany from the Social Democratic Party of Germany in 1914 and founding of the KPD on 30 December 1918, communists in Germany pursued the goal of a socialist revolution similar to the October Revolution in Russia in 1917. The educational work of the KPD was haphazard in the early years, following its formation. In the party congress of October 1919, leading members of the KPD including Duncker, Clara Zetkin and Edwin Hoernle pointed out the need to train party members. Social Democrat hiking courses, a traditional way to teach while walking, were established, but it was only with the 3rd World Congress of the Comintern and an orientation towards Soviet politics, that worker education really began. From the point of view of the KPD, its supporters had to be politically and intellectually trained, aligned and steeled beyond the previous social-democratic and trade union educational and social goals. As early as 1932, the MASCH had become increasingly targetted, as state repression by the Nazis was started in earnest. On 25 November 1932, the central building was occupied by Schutzpolizei and several people were arrested and the register of teachers confiscated. House searches of lecturers subsequently followed. On 29 March 1933, the central school room in Berlin was closed by the police. Following this, many teachers from the school emigrated, but many teachers and student stayed to fight the Nazisin Germany. Goals * The MASCH saw its tasks in spreading communist ideals. The theoretical foundations of Marxism and emerging Leninism were taught. In other words, the aim was to \\"create a generally accessible school in which the working population of Berlin should be given the opportunity to learn the basic teachings of unadulterated Marxism and its application to all areas of proletarian life and struggle\\". * It was also about disseminating tools for communist agitation and propaganda in the domains of word and art. Interested laypeople were trained in the design and creation of propaganda material by artists from the Association of Revolutionary Visual Artists. * In addition to the historical or current affairs and politics, discussions were held on medical topics, progress in technology and natural sciences and, of course, community affairs. The school held courses in stenography, typing, Russian and English, social and local politics, law. Lectures were also held on culture, arts, literature, film, radio, photography, theatre, music, natural sciences, medicine, sports, sexuality, children, education, the Soviet Union, foreign languages (including Chinese, Japanese and Esperanto), psychoanalysis and individual psychology, rhetoric, library studies, orthography and grammar, arithmetic and problems of women and young people. Fascism in its Italian and German forms was also analysed time and time again. * In individual cases, the MASCH supported foreign visits, such as the 1932 trip to China by the communist sociologist and sinologist Karl August Wittfogel. * Participants in the MASCH in many cases became members of the KPD, under the impression of training and propaganda. * The MASCH should reach the widest possible mass throughout Germany. In 1932, there were MASCH offshoots in 36 major German cities, as well as numerous branches in small towns.

In order to reach workers who could not regularly attend the courses through home studies, Duncker, Wittfogel and Goldschmidt published the booklets of the Marxist Workers Training (MAS) History of the International Labour Movement and Political Economy. The Marxist Workers School was obviously quite undogmatic and practical in its approach, describing itself as the university of the working people. It was also used intensively by members of other social groups such as the intelligentsia and apparently nobody was excluded as they all belonged to the bourgeoisie. The MASCH had 25 students in 1925 and by 1930/1931 had 4000 students. The number of lecturers rose to 160. At one single evening lecture, some 700 were present. In the winter semester of 1929/30 alone, 613 evening lectures were held. In 1932 there were around 2,000 courses. Both the technical staff and the teaching staff worked free of charge. Some of the lecturers were neither KPD members nor bound to a particular political party. The decisive criterion for admission as a MASCH teacher has become more and more: Are you also against fascism? On the 1932 January edition of the MASCH magazine Der Marxist, the slogan was emblazoned: Against Nazi theories!. Connections * Albert Einstein taught at the Marxist Workers School, until his emigration to the United States at the suggestion of Anna Seghers. He was in constant contact with other left-oriented people such as John Heartfield, Egon Erwin Kisch, J√ºrgen Kuczynski, Willi M√ºnzenberg, Erwin Piscator, Annie Reich and Karl August Wittfogel. * From 1932, a group of friends and discussions from members of the Berlin Marxist Workers School gathered around the national economist Arvid Harnack and his wife Mildred. These included the former Prussian Minister of Culture Adolf Grimme, the locksmith Karl Behrens, the couple Greta and Adam Kuckhoff and Leo Skrzypczynski, a proprietor of a firm manufacturing Wireless Telegraphy equipment.

Fisher (March 14, 1921 ‚Äì January 19, 1981) was a highly decorated United States Marine Corps colonel. He was awarded the Navy Cross and two Silver Stars during his career which spanned from World War II to the Vietnam War.  Early life and World War II  Joseph R. Fisher was born on March 14, 1921, in Allston, Massachusetts. He was raised in Westwood and graduated from Dedham High School. Fisher enlisted in the Marine Corps in 1942 and quickly rose to the rank of platoon sergeant. By February 1945, Platoon Sergeant Fisher was assigned to Company C, 1st Battalion, 26th Marines, 5th Marine Division. On the afternoon of February 19, Fisher's battalion made an amphibious landing at Red Beach 1 on Iwo Jima. On the morning of February 21, while his battalion assaulted Airfield No. 1 Fisher's company became pinned down by a Japanese machine gun bunker. Fisher began crawling toward the machine gun with several hand grenades when he was shot through his shoulder and then his chest in quick succession. Despite his wounds, Fisher crawled the rest of the way to the bunker and silenced the position with his grenades. He then refused to be evacuated and continued leading his platoon before he lost consciousness. Fisher was awarded his first Silver Star for his actions. He spent several months in a hospital and returned to duty in July 1945. Fisher was then commissioned as a second lieutenant and took part in the occupation of Japan.  Korean War  When the Korean War broke out, First Lieutenant Fisher was given command of Company I, 3rd Battalion, 1st Marines, 1st Marine Division. Fisher was personally appointed as a company commander by his regiment commander, Colonel Chesty Puller, who remarked that Fisher was \\"one of the best damned company commanders who ever lived.\\" Fisher led his company during the amphibious assault at Inchon and the subsequent recapture of Seoul in September 1950. Outside the city of Seoul, his company defended Hill 105S from a North Korean attack and captured 10 prisoners. During the entire Inchon-Seoul campaign, Fisher lost only one Marine killed and two wounded. At the conclusion of the campaign, the entire 1st Marine Division embarked on Navy ships which sailed around South Korea and landed at Wonsan in October. The division then marched 70 miles north to the Chosin Reservoir area. As the Marines arrived at Chosin Reservoir, the Chinese Communist military encircled the entire division and the coldest winter in 50 years descended on Korea. Temperatures fell as low as ‚àí35 ¬∞F as a blizzard swept the area. On November 25, First Lieutenant Fisher positioned his company on \\"East Hill\\" which strategically overlooked the village of Hagaru-ri. At 10:30 p.m. on November 28, Company I was attacked by a Chinese regiment. Fisher repeatedly exposed himself to the heavy fire to direct mortar fire, direct the fire of his Marines and increase morale. At one point during the night, the Chinese penetrated the perimeter of 3rd Platoon and Fisher led a counterattack and engaged in hand-to-hand combat. The battle lasted for eight hours, concluding on the morning of the 29th. After three failed attempts to take the hill, the Chinese withdrew, leaving approximately 700 of their dead who had been killed during the battle. When Colonel Puller asked Fisher how many of the enemy he had killed, Fisher replied, \\"A whole piss pot full, sir.\\" Puller later evaluated Fisher to be the best company commander in the Marine Corps. For his actions during the battle of Chosin Reservoir, Fisher was awarded the Navy Cross; Puller was awarded his 5th Navy Cross.  Post-Korean War  After one year of service in Korea, Captain Fisher returned to the United States and attended the amphibious warfare course at Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia. He was then assigned to Naval Weapons Station Seal Beach, California, before transferring to the 9th Marine Regiment, 3rd Marine Division in Japan. In 1957, Major Fisher returned to Quantico where he instructed new officers at The Basic School. In 1962, he attended the Armed Forces Staff College in Norfolk, Virginia. Upon graduating the course, Fisher was promoted to lieutenant colonel and stationed at Camp H. M. Smith in Hawaii. Lieutenant Colonel Fisher was then given command of 2nd Battalion, 4th Marines, 1st Marine Expeditionary Brigade on June 4, 1964. At the change of command ceremony at KƒÅne ªohe Bay, Fisher called his new battalion his \\"Magnificent Bastards,\\" a nickname which has stuck to 2/4.  Vietnam War  In May 1965, 2/4 was reassigned to the 3rd Marine Division and deployed to Vietnam, arriving at Chu Lai. On August 18, 1965, Lieutenant Colonel Fisher led his battalion in a helicopter assault near Van Tuong, commencing Operation Starlite. Fisher led his Marines during four days of continuous combat with very little sleep. By August 24, Lieutenant Colonel Fisher‚Äôs battalion had killed more than 300 of the enemy. For his actions during Operation Starlite, Fisher was awarded his second Silver Star.  Later life  In 1968, Colonel Fisher retired from the Marines in North Carolina. Joseph R. Fisher died of a heart attack while playing golf on January 19, 1981, in Whispering Pines, North Carolina. He was buried in Pinelawn Memorial Park in Southern Pines.

The Threepenny Strike took place in Leipzig in 1865, with printers striking for higher pay. The action was partially successful, and inspired other strikes across the country. In May 1866, a German Book Printers' Day was held in Leipzig, and this founded the national union, which adopted the newspaper Der Correspondent as its journal. In order to avoid being banned under the Anti-Socialist Laws, in 1879 it renamed itself as the German Book Printers' Support Club, and it moved its funds to Switzerland. This enabled it to become the first German union to offer a national unemployment insurance scheme, in 1880. From 1888, the union was based in Berlin. In 1891, the Anti-Socialist Laws were repealed, and so in 1893, the union reverted to the name, \\"Union of Book Printers\\". Former headquarters of the union In 1919, the union became a founding affiliate of the General German Trade Union Confederation. Within the federation, it was part of the Graphic Block. By 1928, it had 82,767 members. It was banned by the Nazi government in 1933. After World War II, printers were represented as part of the Printing and Paper Union.

It enforced the closure in England of businesses selling food and drink for consumption on the premises, as well as a range of other businesses such as nightclubs and indoor leisure centres where a high risk of infection could be expected. SI 2020/327 remained in force for five days, until 1pm on 26 March, when it was revoked and its provisions re-enacted with more extensive restrictions by The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (England) Regulations 2020 (SI 2020/350). SI 2020/350 has become the principal delegated English legislation restricting freedom of movement, gatherings, and business closures during the COVID-19 emergency period.  Legal basis  The regulations were introduced by way of a Statutory Instrument made by the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Matt Hancock, using emergency powers available to him under the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984. The regulations themselves state the legal basis for using such powers, namely \\"the serious and imminent threat to public health which is posed by the incidence and spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in England\\"; he also certified that the restrictions \\"are proportionate to what they seek to achieve, which is a public health response to that threat.\\" The regulations came into force immediately they were made, at 2pm on 21 March, and were laid before parliament two days later, on 23 March.. The Secretary of State used section 45R of the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984 to enact the regulations immediately subject to retrospective approval by resolution of each House of Parliament within twenty-eight days.  Scope and review  The regulations (which apply in England only), impose restrictions during the \\"relevant period\\" which is defined as the period between 2pm on 21 March 2020 and such ending date as the Secretary of State may later specify. He is required to review the regulations at least every 28 days, and to terminate the period if he considers the restrictions to be no longer necessary.  Business closures  Pubs were included in the list of businesses which must close. Businesses selling food or drink for consumption on the premises (including restaurants, cafes, bars and pubs) are required to close immediately ‚Äì even where such premises include an adjacent (e.g. outdoor) seating area. Hotels are, however, allowed to continue to provide food to guests via room service. Specific businesses set out in a list are also required to close, namely: cinemas, theatres, nightclubs, bingo halls, concert halls, museums and galleries, casinos, betting shops, spas and massage parlours; as well as indoor leisure centres including fitness studios, gyms, swimming pools and skating rinks.  Offences and enforcement  Contravention of the regulation without reasonable excuse is a criminal offence, punishable on summary conviction by a fine.  Expiry and revocation  The regulations were set to automatically expire after six months, but in the event were revoked only five days later.

Description  The collection of these documents served as a repository used mainly for administrative purposes by the court officials and for private correspondence. The documents thus give some indication of the various procedures and government interactions adopted by the rulers of Gujarat. There has been an abundance of historical resources available for three and a half centuries of Chaulukya rule in Gujarat; however, this source is distinctive, as it was written as a guidebook for revenue officers and professional letter writers in the administration. The Lekhapaddhati is an extensive glossary to many Sanskrit terms used to denote actions and practices to be undertaken by the administrators and the subjects. The document serves as a comprehensive guide to the historians studying the important role played by Gujarat in medieval India. The text provides models for conducting various activities such as economic, sociological, and administrative aspects to the subjects of the state. One set of the documents articulates various socio-economic activities, including the sale of property, the capture of slaves and duties assigned to them, and standards for trade accounting and inventory management. Similarly, another set of manuscripts deals with administrative matters, such as different types of taxes to be levied, punishment by means of confiscation of lands, and conduct of government officers, where it mentions: \\"no one should be harassed and troubled and no one should be spoken [harshly] anywhere\\". The third set of text refers to models relating to correspondence with families, teachers, lovers, and spouses, among others. =Lekhapaddhati as a source of information on trade and society = It provides us information about five department of trade in the contemporary Chaulukya empire. They are \\"Vyapara Karana\\", \\"Velakula Karana\\", \\"Jalapatha Karana\\", \\"Tanka Shala\\" and \\"Mandapika Karana\\" which corresponds to Department of trade, harbours, waterways, custom and mint. It provides further detail regarding the practice of providing sureties for loans or collateral; as it appears to have become necessary for securing loans in the contemporary period. The failure to repay dues could result in selling of the mortgaged property of the debtor. Besides being a source of information on trade, it also provides a glimpse of society under Chaulukya rule. Accordingly, it shows the slavery to be a common feature of the society and people used to sell themselves to evade famine and hunger. It further narrates the story of a girl who wanted to sell herself to evade harassment by the invaders and the hunger. It also provides information on slave trade between India and west Asian countries. The merchant communities of the Gujarat provided charitable help to sufferers in form of food and clothes, which is well documented in the text.  Publication history  Though the author of the Lekhapaddhati is unknown, the original Sanskrit documents were first collected and edited in 1925 by Chimanlal D. Dalal and Gajanan K. Shrigondekar. These scholars compiled the volume using four Sanskrit manuscripts, consisting of around 100 leaves with nine to thirteen lines per page, and dating to around the 15th century. Further, Shrigondekar observes, the work in the original documents was written in \\"mixed Sanskrit\\" during the same period. Some commentators have labeled the language as \\"Jaina Sanskrit\\". Similarly, according to some experts, the imperfect Sanskrit used in the documents provides more information about the vocabulary of old Gujarat and the style of internal administration of contemporary rulers in Gujarat. Other editions The guidebook was translated into English and German by Pushpa Prasad and Ingo Strauch, respectively. The translated versions provide additional details for the terms used in the original work by providing appendices indexing various individuals, places, and castes, as well as a dictionary of various vernacular terms used in the original work.

Unrest in the city began as a response to the killing of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis on May 25, 2020. Numerous protests, rallies and marches have taken place in Philadelphia in solidarity with protestors in Minneapolis and across the United States. These demonstrations call for justice for Floyd and protest police brutality. After several days of protests & riots, Philadelphia leadership joined other major cities, including Chicago in instituting a curfew, beginning Saturday, May 30, at 8 p.m. The protests concluded on June 23, 2020. EventsContext= On May 25, 2020, George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, was killed by a police officer, Derek Chauvin, in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Derek Chauvin, a white police officer, knelt on Floyd's neck for almost nine minutes while Floyd was handcuffed and lying face down in the street, begging for his life and repeatedly saying \\"I can't breathe\\". A second and third officer further restrained Floyd while a fourth prevented bystanders from intervening. Videos of Floyd's death circulated widely, and by the next day protests began in Minneapolis and later spread across the United States, including to Philadelphia, and then internationally. Floyd's death is one of many widely publicized killings of African-American men in the United States by police. The killing has been compared to the 2014 death of Eric Garner. Garner, also an unarmed black man, repeated \\"I can't breathe\\" eleven times after being placed in a chokehold by a New York police officer during an arrest in Staten Island, New York. =May 30= Protests began outside Philadelphia City Hall at noon. At City Hall, protestors knelt and engaged in nine minutes of silence, referencing the amount of time Chauvin knelt on Floyd's neck. At around 1 p.m., protestors marched from City Hall to the Philadelphia Museum of Art for a planned 2 p.m. demonstration. Later protests included the burning of several police vehicles. Several businesses in Center City Philadelphia were looted and a large fire broke out in a three-story building at 17th Street and Walnut Street. A statue of Frank Rizzo, a former mayor and police commissioner known for his antagonistic relationship with the black community, was spray- painted, and unsuccessful attempts were made to tear it down. A number of protesters set fires under the statue using paper and scrape pieces of wood. Removal of the statue has been discussed by Philadelphia officials since at least 2017. A total of 13 police officers were injured and over 200 people were arrested.https://www.inquirer.com/news/philadelphia-riots-aftermath- george-floyd-protests-destruction-black-lives-matter-police- brutality-20200531.html A police officer was hit by a car while attempting to stop looters at 7th Street and Chestnut Street; the officer was taken to the hospital with a broken arm and other injuries. Mayor Jim Kenney issued a curfew effective at 8 p.m. on Saturday night. =May 31= Police and protesters in Philadelphia on June 1 The Pennsylvania National Guard was called into Philadelphia during the second day of protests. Workers and volunteers cleaned broken windows and trash in Center City. Streets in Center City were closed to traffic. Looting and destruction continued in Center City and spread to other parts of the city including Northeast Philadelphia, North Philadelphia, and West Philadelphia. Police cars were set on fire in West Philadelphia. A curfew went into effect at 6 p.m. On this day, Police Staff Inspector Joseph Bologna was videoed lunging at a journalist, and hitting a security guard. He was also involved in other controversial incidents on June 1 and June 2. =June 1= During a large demonstration, hundreds of peaceful protesters split off from the group and marched onto Interstate 676 (Vine Street Expressway). When they were approximately halfway through a tunnel, a SWAT team appeared and began firing rubber bullets at protesters, prompting them to retreat. SWAT officers proceeded to fire tear gas and pepper spray into the crowd. Cell phone footage showed one SWAT officer pepper spraying a protester at point-blank range, while another officer pulled down a protester's mask before pepper spraying her in the face. Amid the commotion, police formed a line under an adjacent overpass, pinning the protesters in and forcing them up a steep fenced-in embankment. Police continued firing tear gas into the crowd as protesters clambered up the hill and over the 10-foot fence to escape. After several minutes, a group of police officers charged up the hill and began dragging down and arresting remaining protesters. The incident sparked outrage across the city. Later that day, Philadelphia mayor Jim Kenney and police commissioner Danielle Outlaw defended the police's use of tear gas, claiming that protesters had charged a SWAT vehicle and threw rocks at officers. However, eyewitness reports from local journalists and protesters, as well as both cell phone and aerial footage, disputed these claims. On June 23rd, state police released dashcam footage from one of the SWAT vehicles contradicting the city's initial claims and featuring one officer specifically referring to the protesters as \\"peaceful.\\" Two days later, the New York Times released a comprehensive video of the incident, demonstrating that the protest had been entirely peaceful and thoroughly debunking the city's claims to the contrary. City Councilmember Helen Gym called the video \\"horrifying and a complete indictment of our city‚Äôs failure to a manage the events surrounding demonstrations against police brutality.\\" Hours after the video was released, Kenney and Outlaw issued a formal apology to the protesters for the use of tear gas, claiming they received \\"bad intel.\\" In response, Outlaw imposed a moratorium on the use of tear gas, demoted the commanding officer who authorized the use of tear gas and suspended the officer who pepper sprayed the protester in the face. Protesters in Fishtown reported being harassed and threatened by a group of 50 to 70 armed white men, one of whom destroyed a protester's sign while using homophobic slurs. On this day, Police Staff Inspector Joseph Bologna, who was also involved in controversial incidents on May 31 and June 2, attacked a student protester with a baton, and the incident was caught on video. Bologna was later suspended and charged with aggravated assault. =June 2= Market Street in Center City Philadelphia on June 2 Some streets in Center City Philadelphia were closed to traffic.

In anticipation of the protests, streets in Center City Philadelphia along with Interstate 676 (Vine Street Expressway) were closed. An African-American couple who had already scheduled their wedding in the vicinity of the protest took their photos in the middle of the large crowd. =June 7= A mural of former Police Commissioner and Mayor Frank Rizzo, located near 900 South 9th Street, in the Italian Market section of South Philadelphia, was painted over starting at 5:00 AM Sunday morning and finishing at about 6:00 AM. \\"We know that the removal of this mural does not erase painful memories and are deeply apologetic for the amount of grief it has caused. We believe this is a step in the right direction and hope to aid in healing our city through the power of thoughtful and inclusive public art,\\" a spokesperson for Mural Arts, the nonprofit that maintains and creates murals around the city, said in a statement. =June 13= A defund the police rally took place in Center City Philadelphia near the future headquarters of the Philadelphia Police Department. Several streets in Center City Philadelphia were closed along with Interstate 676 (Vine Street Expressway). =June 23= Tensions had been rising throughout the month in the otherwise quiet Marconi Plaza as demonstrations aimed at removing the Christopher Columbus statue took place and weeks prior a journalist for Unicorn Riot was attacked.

It is part of the expansion project of Line 2 between Vila Prudente and Dutra (Guarulhos), estimated to be opened in mid-2026. History The first project for a station in Rua do Orfanato was made in mid-2000s as part of the S√£o Paulo Metropolitan Company project \\"Rede Distributiva\\". The proposed station would be located in the surroundings of An√°lia Franco Shopping Mall and would be part of the line Tatuap√©-Berrini. The project \\"Rede Distributiva\\" was abandoned in 2006 for the creation of a new one called \\"Rede Essencial\\", which kept the proposed station in the same location, but in the project of an expansion of Line 2-Green between Vila Prudente and Tatuap√©. In the end of the 2000s, the expansion of Line 2 had its track altered, with the interchange station moved from Tatuap√© to Penha. With that, the original √Ågua Rasa station was renamed to An√°lia Franco, while √Ågua Rasa became a new proposed station. The Metropolitan Company hired the Environmental Impact Studies and the Environment Impact Report, presenting its results in 2012, with the details of the station location. Later, a decree was signed, expropriating an area of . The works of the station were divided in 8 lots and bidded and hired by the company Mendes Junior in September 2014, with √Ågua Rasa included in Lot 3 (next to Orfanato station and its respective ventilation pits). The decree of service order was suspended due to the 2014 economic crisis, which obligated the state government to begin an expenditure containment regime. Only the demolition works of expropriated areas and cleaning of the construction sites were authorized. Between 2017 and 2018, almost all of the properties were demolished. At the same time, Mendes Junior hired the company Infra7 Engenharia to elaborate a project of the future station and its annexed bus terminal. After almost 6 years suspended, the service order was given on 17 January 2020. Toponymy √Ågua Rasa is the popular name of Tatuap√© Brook, which spring is located next to the future station. Because it is not so deep, the population renamed the brook in the 19th century. At the east margin of the brook, the allotment, which created the district, had been founded during the 1930s. Therefore, due to the proximity of the station to the brook spring, the location inside the district of √Ågua Rasa, the projected station was named √Ågua Rasa. Besides that, some residents of the region requested in 2014, through a petition signed with 20 names, the renaming of the station to Santa Clara, name of a borough next to the future station. The proposed became a project made by State Deputy Orlando Morando (PSDB). However, it was rejected for lack of arguments for the renaming. The city of S√£o Paulo only has Sub-Prefectures and district as official administrative divisions, with its divisions regulated by the force of the law. Therefore, the boroughs are non-official denominations without defined borders, created by real state companies for advertising purposes and used by Correios (Post Office Company) for postal addresses purposes. According to Correios' register, the station will be located between the boroughs of Vila Diva and Vila Celes, rather than Vila Santa Clara, as the 20 residents and the State Deputy purposed. In October 2020, the station was renamed to Santa Clara.

Early career McCabe graduated from the University of New Hampshire in 1991 with a B.A. in economics and a B.S. in business administration from the Whittemore School of Business and Economics.

McCabe then succeeded him as president of PFA,Michael J. Malbin, The Election After Reform: Money, Politics, and the Bipartisan Campaign (2006), p. 88.Richard M.

PFA and DCI having close ties, as PFA's fund-raising and ad buying is run by employees of DCI Group. and was very active during the 2004 Presidential Election. Many Republicans were, at the time, criticizing Democrats for exploiting a loophole in campaign finance law using so-called 527 groups. The Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, passed by Congress in 2002, was intended to limit the influence of corporations, labor unions and wealthy individuals by putting strict limits on their contributions to any candidate, political party, or PAC. For example, in 2004 the maximum individual donation to a US presidential candidate was $2,000. Such limits do not apply, however, to a \\"527\\" group like MoveOn.org that maintains independence from regulated committees and does not expressly advocate the election or defeat of a particular candidate. McCabe, as President of the Progress for America Voters' Fund, was a primary public spokesperson for the Republican shift from decrying liberals' use of 527s and starting their own.The Institute of Politics, John F. Kennedy School of Government. Campaign for President: The Managers Look at 2004 (2006), p. 218. \\"We felt it was imperative that we engage in the debate and help level the playing field to counter what the liberal 527s have done over the past year, beating up President Bush\\", he told reporters in August 2004. In May 2004, the Federal Election Commission announced that it would not rule on the legality of the 527 groups until after the 2004 Presidential election. In October, McCabe said that his creation of PFA's 527 was in direct response to that decision by the FEC. By October, 2004, McCabe and the PFA Voters' Fund had raised $32 million, including $5 million each from just two people: Dawn Arnall, the wife of Ameriquest Corp. chairman Roland Arnall, and Alex Spanos, who owns the San Diego Chargers. The PFA Voters' Fund spent more than $20 million on television ad campaigns, including one called \\"Ashley's Story\\" which featured a 15-year-old Ohio girl who had lost her mother in the September 11 attacks hugging President Bush and saying, \\"All he wants to do is make sure I'm safe\\". The ad was considered one of the most successful of the campaign. Later activities In 2005, McCabe noted that \\"half of his group's $18 million war chest remains unspent\\", and that PFA would use those funds \\"during the next nomination process\\".\\"Weekly Report Sept. 26‚Äì30\\", CQ Weekly, Volume 63 (2005), p. 2652. McCabe also used these resources to support George W. Bush Supreme Court candidates. Interviewed by Newsweek, he praised Bush's selection of Samuel Alito to succeed Sandra Day O'Connor on the Supreme Court of the United States, contending that Alito's record would overcome elements of the campaign against his confirmation.Newsweek, Volumes 146-147 (2005), p. 79. Under McCabe's leadership, PFA acted quickly setting up websites and engaging in lobbying for the confirmation of both Alito and John Roberts. McCabe is also \\"one of the founding partners and CEO of CustomScoop, an electronic news clipping service specializing in corporate public policy news tracking\\". He is also on the Brooks School Board of Trustees, and the University of New Hampshire Foundation Board.

He represented the Church and the Holy See in Cuba from 1967 to 1974 and then headed the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy, which trains the Vatican's diplomats, from 1975 to 1985. Biography Cesare Zacchi was born on 28 November 1914 in Ortignano Raggiolo, Italy. He was ordained a priest on 17 October 1937. To prepare for a diplomatic career he entered the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy in 1948. He worked in the Apostolic Nunciatures in Austria, Yugoslavia, Colombia, and Cuba. He had been a councilor in Cuba since 1969 when the nuncio there, Luigi Centoz, was appointed to a post in Rome on 5 July 1962. With Zacchi's appointment as interim charge d'affaires of the Nunciature to Cuba, the Vatican hoped to establish a modus vivendi under the Castro regime. Zacchi said: \\"My principal task is to reduce the distrust between the Cuban clergy and the government.\\" The Cuban government refused to recognize the Catholic bishops in Cuba as anything other than agents of a foreign entity; it therefore ignored them and dealt with Zacchi, whose position identified him as the papacy's representative. Zacchi made occasion positive remarks about the regime to gain some relaxation of government restrictions. With some success he urged the bishops to operate without antagonizing the government and endorse collaboration with government programs. Zacchi told one interviewer: \\"The Cuban Catholic must become part of the popular organizations of the society in which he lives. He must participate in voluntary work, he must join the militia; he must join athletic and cultural organizations. He must also take an active part in the student movement and in professional organizations. This would naturally produce a mutual influence.\\" On 16 September 1967, Pope Paul VI appointed him titular bishop of Zella. He received his episcopal consecration in Havana on 12 December 1967 from Archbishop Emanuele Clarizio, and Fidel Castro attended the reception following the ceremony. On 24 May 1974, Pope Paul raised his rank to titular archbishop of Maura and appointed him Apostolic Nuncio to Cuba; Zacchi presented his credentials to Cuban Foreign Minister Ra√∫l Roa on 20 December 1974. On 1 June 1975, he was named president of the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy. He held that post until the appointment of his successor, Justin Francis Rigali, on 8 June 1985. Zacchi died on 22 August 1991.

Its first-generation tram network first operated as a horse tram system, and was eventually converted to electric trams in the late nineteenth century.  History  The first tram line in Bangkok was built on Charoen Krung Road (New Road as it was then known), Thailand's first road to be built by Western techniques. John Lofton, a British naval officer working with the Royal Thai Navy along with a Danish colleague, saw a profitable tram service on the line, considering travel times were significant in getting from one end of the road to another. They surveyed the area for three days before requesting to operate a tram service under a government concession. They received a fifty-year allowance to operate trams on seven routes in 1887 and thus opened the first horse-driven tram line, the Bang Kho Laem Line on Charoen Krung Road on 22 September 1888. It did not gain popularity due to high fares and high sympathy for the horses used. Four horses were used to haul one carriage on the line. Due to significant losses, Lofton sold the business to the Bangkok Tramways Co.Ltd. in 1889. Bangkok Tramways continued to operate at significant losses. On 23 May 1892, a Danish company took over and electrified the line., with electricity provided by the Electricity Co. Ltd. Eventually, the company was merged into Electricity's and thus it became the operator of the line. In 1901, a new tram line - the Samsen Line opened, taking trams to the north of Bangkok. In 1905, a competing company was given rights to operate trams in Bangkok, namely the Thai Tram Co. Ltd. (Rot Rang Thai Co. Ltd.). Thai Tram opened a line, the Dusit Line; a circular loop line surrounding Rattanakosin Island. It was opened on 1 October 1905 in the presence of King Chulalongkorn. Thai Tram's cars were painted red, while Electricity's cars were painted yellow, and thus locally the lines in which they operated were called by their colours, respective to their owners. In 1908, the operations of both companies were merged into the Siam Electricity Co. Ltd. and all trams painted into the same mix of yellow and red. In the 1920s, more lines gradually came into operation around Bangkok. In 1927, operations were transferred again to the Thai Electricity Corporation. On January 1 1950, the concession on tram operation ceased and operations were transferred to the government. In 1968, tram services were suspended following discussion that it took up road space, coupled with the significant increase in road traffic, as well as cheaper bus operation on the same line. Tram fares ranged from 10 to 50 satang (100 satang = 1 baht), depending on class.  Lines  Charoen Krung Road c. 1910s - 1920s. A tram with its tracks is visible.

Biography  Akahoshi was born in Czechoslovakia to German parents. Her family moved to the United States when she was a young child and she grew up in Hollywood, California. Akahoshi was an engineer by training but soon moved on to other interests. As she once wrote, ‚ÄúI simply cannot commit myself to one thing for any great length of time, and consequently I can never really become an expert at anything, though I came close to it in the engineering field. (I remained in it for seven years and was considered one of the better persons in my trade.) = Correspondent = In 1976, through her involvement with Amnesty International's Group 11 based in New York city, Akahoshi began writing letters of support to the oppressed Ukrainian political prisoner Zenoviy Krasivsky (1929-1991) (sometimes spelled Zenovij Krasivskyj), who was a \\"renowned Ukrainian poet, human rights activist, and defender of Ukraine‚Äôs right to independence.\\" She had no knowledge of Slavic languages. (Persistent letter writing to jailed dissidents has been a successful strategy long favored by the human rights organization Amnesty International.) In 1976, Akahoshi wrote the first of many letters to Krasivsky when he was forcibly detained in a psychiatric hospital (Serbsky Institute, a \\"notorious Soviet psychiatric prison for dissidents\\"), but she did not receive a reply to any of them until he had received the 31st, after he had been temporarily freed and was able to answer. When his reply in Ukrainian was finally received, it said, \\"Dear Iris: In front of me are thirty one of your letters. This is my reply to the first one. The responses to the rest will follow....\\" During the following years of persecution, he was taken to labor camps and then into Siberian exile. Despite his imprisonments, the \\"poignant correspondence\\" between the two continued and they became close friends, even though they were never able to meet and spoke over the telephone only once. (The letters were translated by fellow AI Group 11 member Anna Procyk.) Their correspondence reveals Akahoshi's deep spirituality and overarching love of nature as well as Krasivsky's poetry and musings. Together, the writings been called \\"one of the most touching human documents of the cruel age.\\" Their letters would outlive both of them; ultimately the collection was published in book form by Amnesty International. According to Krasivsky, in a letter to her husband after her death, > ‚ÄúIris has come to me at a moment when I was at the lowest point of my > existence--when it appeared that there were no windows or doors of escape > from my condition‚Ä¶.I had no doubt that she was sent to me by Providence as a > ray of hope, as a bar of salvation for a drowning man‚Ä¶.I resurrected and > Iris became for me a bright star that did not cease to glow for many years > to come. I have not known anyone who would embody so fully the best > humanistic ideals as did Iris. Time may bring about change, but the idea of > hope, the consciousness of something permanent and firm would never leave > you because of Iris. She was like the light within you. Blessed be her > name.‚Äù The relationship was not one-sided as attested by Akahoshi's friends. After she died, her friends wrote to Krasivsky saying, > \\"his correspondence 'opened a new world for her. This is probably was one of > the most important aspects of her life for the last 10 years.'\\" = Legacy = * In 2013, many years of correspondence was translated and edited by Anna Procyk and published by Smoloskyp Publishers. Both Akahoshi and Krasivsky are credited as co-authors of the book. A review of the book by Alexander Motyl in The Ukrainian Weekly, May 18, 2014 says, ‚ÄúReaders of this moving and informative volume will have the privilege of sharing in the lives of an American activist and a Ukrainian dissident, both of whom wanted to live their lives ethically and make a difference ‚Äì and succeeded on both counts.‚Äù * The image of Akahoshi appears in the play \\"UBN\\" of the Lviv Ukrainian Academic Theater named after M.

Scots law classifies compulsory purchase as an involuntary transfer of land, as the owner of the corporeal heritable property (land) does not consent to the transfer of ownership. Compulsory purchase powers are similar, but not identical, to other jurisdictions who share similar concepts and similar terms. In contrast to other jurisdictions, compulsory purchase powers can be exercised by non-public bodies under the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003.  History  The development of powers of compulsory purchase in Scotland originated in the railway mania of the Victorian period within the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland (1801-1921).Scottish Law Commission, Discussion Papers in Compulsory Purchase (2014, SLC DP No: 159), page 2. Available under the OGL via: https://www.scotlawcom.gov.uk/publications/discussion-papers-and-consultative- memoranda/2010-present/. Historically, where the United Kingdom government wished to acquire land without the consent of an owner in Scotland, a private bill had to be introduced into the United Kingdom parliament.Scottish Law Commission, Discussion Papers in Compulsory Purchase (2014, SLC DP No: 159), page 3. Available under the OGL via: https://www.scotlawcom.gov.uk/publications/discussion-papers-and-consultative- memoranda/2010-present/. This bill had to outline the area of land (commonly the extent of the railway track itself) expressly sought and provided a power of compulsory purchase to the constructing entity.Scottish Law Commission, Discussion Papers in Compulsory Purchase (2014, SLC DP No: 159), page 3. Available under the OGL via: https://www.scotlawcom.gov.uk/publications/discussion-papers-and-consultative- memoranda/2010-present/. An example of this private bill is the construction of the Edinburgh-Glasgow railway line under the Making a Railway from Edinburgh to Glasgow, to be called ‚ÄòThe Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway‚Äô, with a Branch to Falkirk Act 1838 (c. 58.). This method of compulsory purchase was viewed as a repetitive and time-consuming process and the United Kingdom parliament enacted the Lands Clauses Consolidation (Scotland) Act 1845 (c. 19), which introduced a standard form process of compulsory purchase into Scots law.Scottish Law Commission, Discussion Papers in Compulsory Purchase (2014, SLC DP No: 159), page 3. Available under the OGL via: https://www.scotlawcom.gov.uk/publications/discussion-papers-and-consultative- memoranda/2010-present/. Subsequent legislation has been introduced to amend and supplement the 1845 Act, leading to criticism that the current legislative framework for compulsory purchase powers are complex and confusing.Scottish Law Commission, Discussion Papers in Compulsory Purchase (2014, SLC DP No: 159), page 3.

Therefore, the 1845 Act provides a common framework upon which compulsory purchase procedures are obtained. The 1845 Act has received subsequent criticism by the Scottish Law Commission in their Discussion Papers in Compulsory Purchase (2014, SLC DP No: 159).

Under Part VIII, the 1997 Act allows land to be compulsory or voluntarily purchased for planning purposes. The procedure for any compulsory purchase acquisition is dealt with by the Acquisition of Land (Authorisation Procedure) (Scotland) Act 1947. The 1997 Act also regulates General Vesting Declarations, discussed below.Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1997 s.195; Schedule 15.  Compulsory Purchase Process by Public Body  As discussed above, the main acts regulating the procedure for compulsory purchase are the Acquisition of Land (Authorisation Procedure) (Scotland) Act 1947. Alternatively, the processes of the Land Consolidation (Scotland) Act 1845 may be used instead. = Exceptions to normal procedure = certain exceptions to the normal procedures are provided for certain land by the following Acts: * Local Acts may provide for certain local authorities to be able to compulsory purchase land with processes specified by that local Act.Acquisition of Land (Authorisation Procedure) (Scotland) Act 1947 s.6. * Opencast Coal Act 1958 provides specific procedures for compulsory purchase of opencast coal mines.Opencast Coal Act 1958 s.4; Schedule 2. * Burial Grounds (Scotland) Act 1855 provides specific procedures for compulsory purchase of burial grounds in Scotland.Burial Grounds (Scotland) Act 1855 s.2 * The Allotments (Scotland) Acts 1892 and the Land Settlement (Scotland) Act 1919 provides procedures for the compulsory purchase of land for use as allotments gardening.

A comprehensive list is available to view online in Scottish Law Commission, Discussion Paper of Compulsory Purchase (2014, SLC DP No: 159), Appendix B. It is anticipated that any further reform in this area will consolidate the vast complex range of procedures laid out in numerous statutes. = Stage One - Identifying and Surveying Land = The acquiring authority should seek to listen to the people affected at every stage of the process. Scottish Government recommends that the acquiring authority should consider appointing a specified case manager to whom people have direct, easy and face to face access. if no voluntary agreement is reached, the Acquiring Authority can identify land it wishes to compulsory purchase under powers given to it by statute, see above. Ultimate permission for the purchase is given by authorisation by the confirming authority, usually the Scottish Ministers (or the UK Government if undertaken by an authority under reserved powers). Thus, Acquiring Authorities cannot unilaterally utilise their compulsory purchase powers. However, where land has been identified for compulsory purchase, under the Lands Clauses Consolidation (Scotland) Act 1845, the acquiring authority has a power to enter the land for purposes of surveying, probing or boring.Lands Clauses Consolidation (Scotland) Act 1845 s.83 However, the acquiring authority must give at least 3 days, but not more than 14 days, notice to the current owner of the land.Lands Clauses Consolidation (Scotland) Act 1845 s.83 = Stage Two - Drafting of Compulsory Purchase Order = In order to create a compulsory transfer of ownership to the acquiring authority, the acquiring authority must prepare a prescribed legal document known as a Compulsory Purchase Order often shortened to CPO. The Compulsory Purchase Order (CPO) must be in a manner prescribed under The Compulsory Purchase of Land (Scotland) Regulations 2003.Acquisition of Land (Authorisation Procedure) (Scotland) Act 1947 Sch 1; current prescribed forms are found under Form 1, reg 3(a) of SSI 2003/446 and Forms 1 and 10, regs 3(b)(ii) and 5(b)(ii) of SI 1994/3097. The CPO must include a map, or a reference to a map, in order to delineate the land sought.Acquisition of Land (Authorisation Procedure) (Scotland) Act 1947 Sch 1, paras 1 and 7. The CPO must then be submitted for confirmation by the Scottish Ministers (for devolved acquiring authorities) or relevant UK Government minister (reserved acquiring authorities).  Public Advertisement  Once the Compulsory Purchase Order has been drafted, the acquiring authority must place a notice in at least one or more local newspapers for a period of two successive weeks to allow residents to have sufficient notice of the compulsory purchase plans.Acquisition of Land (Authorisation Procedure) (Scotland) Act 1947 Sch 1, para 3(a). The notice must inform the newspaper reader expressly the following: * that the draft Compulsory Purchase Order is about to be submitted for confirmation.Acquisition of Land (Authorisation Procedure) (Scotland) Act 1947 Sch , paras 3 - 3B. * the purpose for which the land is required, andAcquisition of Land (Authorisation Procedure) (Scotland) Act 1947 Sch , paras 3 - 3B. * A description of the land sought under the CPO, andAcquisition of Land (Authorisation Procedure) (Scotland) Act 1947 Sch , paras 3 - 3B. * Naming a place within the locality where a copy of the order and the map referred to therein may be inspected, andAcquisition of Land (Authorisation Procedure) (Scotland) Act 1947 Sch , paras 3 - 3B. * specifying the time (not being less than twenty-one days from the first publication of the notice) within which and the manner in which objections to the order can be made.Acquisition of Land (Authorisation Procedure) (Scotland) Act 1947 Sch , paras 3 - 3B.  Notification to Owners  The acquiring authority must also serve on the following individuals a notice of the draft Compulsory Purchase Order and the closing date for objections to the CPO: * every owner, lessee and occupier (except tenants for a month or any period less than month) of any land comprised in the CPO.Acquisition of Land (Authorisation Procedure) (Scotland) Act 1947 Sch , paras 3(b)(i). * Any the holder of any personal real burden affecting that land if registration of the conveyance in implement of the order would vary or extinguish the title condition in question;Acquisition of Land (Authorisation Procedure) (Scotland) Act 1947 Sch , paras 3(b)(ii). * the owner of any land which is a benefited property of a title condition, or encumberance, of land sought under the CPO.Acquisition of Land (Authorisation Procedure) (Scotland) Act 1947 Sch , paras 3(b)(iii). * the owners' association of a development within the land sought under the CPO.Acquisition of Land (Authorisation Procedure) (Scotland) Act 1947 Sch , paras 3(b)(iv). If any of these individuals cannot be identified and contacted, special procedures by way of public advertisement will apply.Para 19 of Sch 1 to the 1947 Act. The Scottish Government recommends acquiring authorities also send a copy of the Guide to compulsory purchase and compensation' for this purpose.  Objections  A minimum statutory period fo 21 days applies for any objections to be made to the draft Compulsory Purchase Order. If any objection is made to the confirming authority, the confirming authority must send the objections to the acquiring authority for their comments. If the objections are not withdrawn, the acquiring authority can negotiate with the objectors. If there is no resolution, the Scottish Government may hold a public local inquiry.Acquisition of Land (Authorisation Procedure) (Scotland) Act 1947 Sch 4, para 1. This is done by way of referral of the draft CPO to the Planning and Environmental Appeals Divisions (DPEA) of the Scottish Government.  Public Local Inquiry  Where an objection is not withdraw, a public local inquiry will be held by the Scottish Government's Planning and Environmental Appeals Division (DPEA).Acquisition of Land (Authorisation Procedure) (Scotland) Act 1947 Sch 1, para 4(2). In practice, the DPEA will appoint a Reporter to hold the inquiry rather than chaired by Scottish Ministers.Acquisition of Land (Authorisation Procedure) (Scotland) Act 1947 Sch 4, para 1. Where an inquiry is held, the DPEA Reporter must inform all objectors and publishes a notice in local newspapers that an inquiry is to be held and the date/location of such inquiry.Acquisition of Land (Authorisation Procedure) (Scotland) Act 1947 Sch 4, para 2. The DPEA Reporter will listen to the objections made and any response from the acquiring authority.Acquisition of Land (Authorisation Procedure) (Scotland) Act 1947 Sch 1, para 4(3). The DPEA Reporter has the power to require attendance of witnesses.Acquisition of Land (Authorisation Procedure) (Scotland) Act 1947 Sch 4, para 3. Any individual who fails to attend or give evidence to the public local inquiry at the request of the DPEA Reporter is guilty of a criminal offence.Acquisition of Land (Authorisation Procedure) (Scotland) Act 1947 Sch 4, para 5. After the inquiry concludes, the DPEA Reporter will produce a report, including recommendations for approval, modification or rejection of the draft CPO.Scottish Law Commission, Discussion Papers in Compulsory Purchase (2014, SLC DP No: 159), page 67. Available under the OGL via: https://www.scotlawcom.gov.uk/publications/discussion-papers-and-consultative- memoranda/2010-present/.  Confirmation  If no objections are made, or the DPEA recommends approval of the draft Compulsory Purchase Order, the Scottish Government, or other confirming authority, can confirm the draft CPO if satisfied all notices (above) have been validly served.Acquisition of Land (Authorisation Procedure) (Scotland) Act 1947 Sch 1, para 4(1). The Scottish Government may impose such modifications on the Compulsory Purchase Order as it thinks fit when approving it.Acquisition of Land (Authorisation Procedure) (Scotland) Act 1947 Sch 1, para 4(2). Following the issuance of confirmation, the acquiring authority must re-notify all previously notified individuals and publicly advertise the confirmation.Acquisition of Land (Authorisation Procedure) (Scotland) Act 1947 Sch 1, paras 3‚Äì3B and paras 6‚Äì6A.  Revocation of Confirmation  It is not possible for confirmation by the Scottish Government to be revoked. The Scottish Law Commission that without revocation of an abandoned Compulsory Purchase Order, owners of land may struggle to sell their house as the CPO will normally appear through buyer's due diligence.Scottish Law Commission, Discussion Papers in Compulsory Purchase (2014, SLC DP No: 159), page 71. Available under the OGL via: https://www.scotlawcom.gov.uk/publications/discussion-papers-and-consultative- memoranda/2010-present/. = Stage Three: Conveyancing = After the confirmation of the Compulsory Purchase Order, ownership of the land must still be transferred through a conveyance. There are two forms of conveyance available, (1) by transfer under a schedule conveyance disposition and (2) by transfer under a General Vesting Declaration.  (1) Schedule Conveyance  A schedule conveyance is a voluntary transfer in which the owner signs a special form of deed, a schedule conveyance disposition. The prescribed form for this deed is found in the Land Consolidation (Scotland) Act 1845.Land Consolidation (Scotland) Act 1845, Schedule A. In order to initiate this process, the acquiring authority must issue a notice to treat with the owner.Acquisition of Land (Authorisation Procedure) (Scotland) Act 1947 Sch 2, para 3.Land Consolidation (Scotland) Act 1845 s.17.  Notice to Treat  A notice to treat is a formal notice sent to the owner of the land, and other parties with similar rights. The notice to treat must contain an adequate description of the land covered by the proposed conveyance. Failure to do so may result in the notice to treat being invalid.Coats v Caledonian Railway Company (1904) 6 F 1042. Service of a notice to treat had historically been taken to create a binding contract, obliging the owner to sign the schedule conveyance deed to transfer ownership.Campbell v Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway Co. (1855) 17 D 613. However, modern analysis now distinguishes Notice to Treats from contracts: > \\"The essence of a contract of sale is that all the terms and conditions are > set out and are made the subject of a binding agreement, whereas in the case > of compulsory purchase, while a notice to treat obliges an acquiring > authority to purchase the land from the person to whom notice has been > given, many of the details at that stage remain unsettled\\"Rush v Fife > Regional Council 1994 SC 104, at page 119. The service of a notice to treat obliges the acquiring authority to go through with the compulsory purchase and obliges the landowners to set out their claims for compensation and an obligation to sign the disposition.Scottish Law Commission, Discussion Papers in Compulsory Purchase (2014, SLC DP No: 159), page 98. Available under the OGL via: https://www.scotlawcom.gov.uk/publications/discussion-papers-and-consultative- memoranda/2010-present/. A notice to treat ceases to have effect after three years or shorter where (a) a General Vesting Declaration is issued, (b) the acquiring authority has taken possession of the land, or (c) the level of compensation payable is referred to the Land Tribunal for Scotland.Scottish Law Commission, Discussion Papers in Compulsory Purchase (2014, SLC DP No: 159), page 98. Available under the OGL via: https://www.scotlawcom.gov.uk/publications/discussion-papers-and-consultative- memoranda/2010-present/.Planning and Compensation Act 1991 s.78  Notice of Entry  Where a notice to treat has been served, the acquiring authority can additionally serve a notice of entry giving the landowner at least 14 days notice that upon expiration of the notice period, the acquiring authority will enter and take possession of the land.Acquisition of Land (Authorisation Procedure) (Scotland) Act 1947 Sch 2, para 3. However, ownership (title) of the land itself will not vest until compensation has been determined and paid to the current owner.Land Consolidation (Scotland) Act 1845 ss83-88.Scottish Law Commission, Discussion Papers in Compulsory Purchase (2014, SLC DP No: 159), page 106. Available under the OGL via: https://www.scotlawcom.gov.uk/publications/discussion-papers-and-consultative- memoranda/2010-present/.  Schedule Conveyance Disposition  The transfer of the land sought under the Notice to Treat is carried out via a schedule conveyance disposition. This deed is authorised by the Land Consolidation (Scotland) Act 1845.Land Consolidation (Scotland) Act 1845 s.80 This must be signed by the current owner and registered in the Land Register of Scotland. Where an owner refuses to sign this deed, a General Vesting Declaration may be used instead. An example disposition can be found on the Registers of Scotland website: > \\"Statutory style of Schedule A conveyance I (design) in consideration of the > sum of paid to me [or, as the case may be, into the Bank (or to A.B. of _, > and C.D. of _, two trustees appointed to receive the same)], pursuant to an > Act passed, &c.;, intituled, &c.;, by the [here name the company], > incorporated by the said Act, do hereby sell, alienate, dispone, convey, > assign, and make over, from me, my heirs and successors, to the said > company, their successors and assignees, for ever, according to the true > intent and meaning of the said Act, all [describing the premises to be > conveyed], together with all rights and pertinents thereto belonging, and > all such right, title, and interest in and to the same as I and my foresaids > are or shall become possessed of, or are by the said Act empowered to > convey. [Here insert the conditions (if any) of the conveyance....\\" Upon registration of the deed in the Land Register, ownership will transfer to the acquiring authority.Land Registration (Scotland) Act 2012 s.50  (2) General Vesting Declarations  Another form of transfer of ownership is the use of General Vesting Declarations (GVD) following the confirmation of a Compulsory Purchase Order. GVDs are regulated by the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1997.Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1997, Sch 15. Unlike a schedule conveyance, a GVD does not require any written consent of the current landowner. = Executing a General Vesting Declaration (GVD) = A GVD can be issued by the acquiring authority following the completion of a Compulsory Purchase Order.Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1997 Schedule 15, para 1.  Pre-GVD Requirements  Before issuing the GVD, the acquiring authority must have provided at least 2 months notice to the owner that they intend to issue a GVD.Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1997 Schedule 15, para 3.  Execution of GVD  The GVD must be made in a prescribed form and it must have at least 28 days minimum period before the vesting taking effect.Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1997 Schedule 15, para 2. However, the current prescribed form of GVDs is contained within The Compulsory Purchase of Land (Scotland) Regulations 2003. An example GVD can be found on the Registers of Scotland website: > \\"We (name of acquiring authority) in exercise of the powers conferred by > section 195 of the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1997 and the > authorisation given to us by the (title of the order) Compulsory Purchase > Order 20 , ) [recorded in the Division of the General Register of Sasines > applicable to the County of on (insert date of recording)] [registered in > the Land Register of Scotland under title number(s) (insert title number/s) > ] HEREBY DECLARE that the land described in the [First (only required if > there is a Second schedule for burdens etc being preserved)] Schedule > hereto, together with the right to enter upon and take possession of the > same shall vest in us on (e) being the end of a period which meets the > requirements of paragraph 1 as read with paragraph 4 of Schedule 15 to the > Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1997. (f) [Registration of the > general vesting declaration [shall not extinguish the real burdens or > servitudes] [shall not disapply the development management scheme] described > in the Second Schedule hereto [but shall vary the real burdens and > servitudes as specified in that Schedule] [shall extinguish all rights to > enforce such real burdens or servitudes other than the rights of those > benefited proprietors and holders of personal real burdens specified in that > Schedule] [shall extinguish the real burdens and servitudes described in the > Second Schedule hereto only in relation to those parts of the burdened > property specified in that Schedule].]\\" When a GVD has been issued, the acquiring authority must again send notice to all owners and occupiers (excluding short lease tenants) affected by the GVD in a prescribed form.Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1997 Schedule 15, para 4. Again, this form is found within the Compulsory Purchase of Land (Scotland) Regulations 2003.  Transfer of Ownership  Following expiration of the notice period specified in the GVD, ownership and possession of the property is able to be acquired by the acquiring authority.Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1997 s.195 However, the acquiring authority must register the GVD in the land's Title Sheet in the Land Register of Scotland in order to validly transfer ownership. = Stage Four: Compensation = Compensation is payable to the landowner who has involuntarily lost land through compulsory purchase. This follows a longstanding principle of Scots law, and other legal systems of the home nations, that the state must compensate for seizures of property.  History of Compensation  Historically, a royal prerogative allowed the Crown to acquire land. However, as Lord Atkinson notes in Attorney-General v De Keyser's Royal Hotel LimitedAttorney-General v De Keyser's Royal Hotel Limited [1920] AC 508; [1920] UKHL 1, at para 3.6.: > ‚ÄúThe conclusion, as I understand it, is this: that it does not appear that > the Crown has ever taken... the land of the subject without paying for it, > and that there is no trace of the Crown having, even in the times of the > Stuarts, exercised or asserted the power or right to do so by virtue of the > Royal Prerogative.\\" In Scots law, the case of Burmah Oil Company (Burma Trading) v The Lord Advocate1962 SLT 347 also made reference to a right to compensation payable to unlawful deprivations. In this case, a company registered in Scotland owned oil installations in Burma (today Myanmar). During the Second World War, Burma had been invaded by the Empire of Japan in 1942. The British Government, which the Lord Advocate then acted as legal officer in Scotland for, had authorised the destruction of the company's oil installations as a consequence.1962 SLT 347 The company sought financial compensation for their property's destruction.1962 SLT 347 In the House of Lords, the law lords held that\\" > \\"there is no general rule that the prerogative can be exercised, even in > time of war or imminent danger, by taking or destroying property without > making payment for it\\"  Rules  In present times, the introduction of the Human Rights Act 1998 also includes protections to owners under Article 1 of Protocol 1 to the Convention for compensation. The current rules for compensation payable under compulsory purchase are largely found in the Land Compensation (Scotland) Act 1963. A full discussion of the rules for compensation in Scottish compulsory purchase can be found in Part 3 of the Scottish Law Commission's Discussion Paper of Compulsory Purchase (2014, SLC DP No: 159), available to view for free online.  Human Rights Considerations  As the United Kingdom is a signatory of the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR), and have introduced the ECHR into UK law under the Human Rights Act 1998. Under Article 1 of Protocol 1 to the Convention: > \\"Every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his > possessions. No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the > public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the > general principles of international law. The preceding provisions shall not, > however, in any way impair the right of a State to enforce such laws as it > deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the > general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or > penalties.\\" Therefore, landowners in Scotland are protected under the right to property from compulsory purchase of land except in accordance with the law. Where the state does exercise compulsory purchase, compensation must be paid. The exercise of compulsory purchase powers are also subject to UK administrative law. A full discussion of human rights considerations in Scottish compulsory purchase can be found in Chapter 3 of the Scottish Law Commission's Discussion Paper of Compulsory Purchase (2014, SLC DP No: 159), available online.  Reform  On 17 December 2014, the Scottish Law Commission (SLC) published a Discussion Paper, Discussion Paper of Compulsory Purchase (2014, SLC DP No: 159), on reform of the law of compulsory purchase. This was welcomed by the legal profession and other compulsory purchase practitioners who had argued that the current legislative framework is outdated. The discussion paper's view on the current law of compulsory purchase runs to 322 pages, but is succinctly summarised in the SLC's news release: > \\"The essential problem is that the law on compulsory purchase is largely set > out in legislation passed between the middle of the nineteenth century and > the middle of the twentieth century. It is accordingly largely out of date. > This Discussion Paper sets out the current law on the matter, and asks > questions about how it could be improved. It also deals with the question of > compensation, with a view to ensuring that the owner of property receives > proper recompense for his or her loss. The Paper suggests that there should > be a new statute setting out the law so that everyone involved ‚Äì public > authorities, practitioners and landowners ‚Äì can see clearly how the system > works.\\"News Release on publication of Discussion Paper (DP No: 159) The Discussion Paper can be viewed on the Scottish Law Commission's website. Following its publication, the Scottish Law Commission opened a consultation on its proposals for reform, closing on 19 June 2015. The responses to this consultation were collated and compiled into a report, which was submitted to the Scottish Government on 22 September 2016. To date, no further action has been taken by the Scottish Government.  Compulsory Purchases Powers held by non-public bodies  Under legislation mainly delivered under the Scottish Government's land reform policies, certain rights to compulsory purchase land have been granted to non-public bodies. These include: = Crofters = Under the Crofters (Scotland) Act 1993, a crofter can apply to the Land Court of Scotland for an order authorising acquisition of the land he/she crofts.Crofters (Scotland) Act 1993 s.12 = Community Bodies = Under the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003, community bodies have powers of compulsory purchase over the following land: * Crofting Communities have the right to compulsory acquire eligible crofitng land under Part 3 of the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003. * Community bodies have the right to compulsory acquire abandoned, neglected or detrimental land under Part 3A of the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003.

She worked with the groups ZooNation and the Bounce Streetdance Company and as a backup dancer for many top performers in the music industry. Bonner played a role in the film StreetDance 3D and danced in Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again and Mary Poppins Returns. Biography Bonner was born in St. Catherine, Jamaica on 31 December 1981. She was the daughter of Yvette Singh and Emanuel Bonner and had four half-siblings, being the eldest child in the family. Bonner was raised by her grandmother until she moved to Peckham in London at age seven to be with her mother and stepfather. She began dancing at Brixton Recreation Centre, and after observing the dance musical Cats aged 13, was inspired to dream for a professional dance career. Bonner had her first open stage auditions with the company RJC Dance and attended local street dance classes, borrowing a key for its drama room to allow her to practice solo during intervals away from school. She joined the BRIT School in Croydon at the age of 16, and obtained her first professional work at 17, performing for the pop singer Dane Bowers, and appearing on the television programmes Top of the Pops and CD:UK, to allow her to pay the school fees. Aged 18, Bonner was awarded a full scholarship to the London Studio Centre by its principal, with her training interrupted by her successfully auditioning for the Bounce Streetdance Company and going on a European and United Kingdom tour of the company's show Insane in The Brain. She was persuaded to completed her scholarship by her teacher after initial hesitance to do so, graduating in 2004. Bonner worked as part of a backup troupes for commercial artists such as Kylie Minogue, Rihanna, Take That, The Black Eyed Peas, Will.i.am and Alesha Dixon on tour. In 2002, she was one of the first dancers on Kate Prince's group ZooNation. Bonner was cast in the lead role of hopeful DJ girl Spinderella in the hip hop show Into the Hoods during its run at the Novello Theatre in the West End in 2008. Luke Jennings, the dance reviewer for The Observer, wrote of her performance \\"The piece‚Äôs star is undoubtedly Bonner, whose dramatic beauty and fluent line compel the attention whenever she‚Äôs on stage\\", and Katie Colombus of The Stage concurred, saying Bonner \\"really steals the show, dancing with an edge, an energy and sharpness that I‚Äôve never seen before. That same year, she performed at the 2008 Summer Olympics closing ceremony. In 2010, Bonner portrayed the hairdresser Shawna in the comedy film StreetDance 3D, and had a featured role in the Sadler's Wells Theatre production of the dance musical Shoes. She danced the role of Kerri in Some Like It Hip Hop at the Peacock Theatre in 2011, earning her the Critics' Choice National Dance Outstanding Female Performance (Modern) Award the following year, the first time the accolade went to a hip-hop dancer. She danced in the closing ceremonies of the 2012 Summer Olympics and the 2012 Summer Paralympics. In 2013, Bonner was featured in a music video of the rapper Ty's song Let's Start. She also played a role in a promotional for the pianist Fabio D'Andrea and toured worldwide with Heartbeat of Home, a Riverdance spin-off. Bonner twice played Queen of Hearts in The Mad Hatter's Tea Party at the Linbury Studio Theatre of the Royal Opera House in both 2014 and 2017. In 2018, she appeared as a dancer in Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again and Mary Poppins Returns, which were her final professional roles. Bonner also taught at ZooNation and helped Prince with television and other ventures.

The fountain rises at a lower elevation than the street level, and is therefore accessed via a staircase. In 2003 the Fondo Ambiente Italiano, on the basis of a popular surveyLauretta Colonnelli, La pi√π amata √® l'Acqua Acetosa, Corriere della Sera, 22 July 2003, identified it as the monument to which Italians are fondest of.  History  The name derives from the source of ferruginous water, known to the Romans of the 16th century as acqua acetosa (Italian for \\"vinegary water\\"; not to be confused with the more famous one in Fonte Ostiense), which flowed here. In 1613 Pope Paul V had it analyzed, and it turned out that it was not only drinkable, but also curative for diseases of the kidneys, stomach, spleen and liver, to the point that someone collected it in bottles to sell it in the cityDintorni di Roma: 1, Antonio Nibby gennaio 1837, Tip. Belle Arti. The water was particularly appreciated by Pope Paul V, who commissioned the architect Giovanni Vasanzio a fountain in 1619, as the plaque on a lower wall still reminds; at the time, the source was a simple wall from which water gushed. The fountain was restored by Innocent X. Fontana celebre d'Acqua Acetosa, engraving by Giovanni Battista Falda (second half of the 17th century). It was Pope Alexander VII who commissioned the current fountain: at the top there is a tympanum with the papal coat of arms and a plaque. The fountain has a staircase leading downwards, where there is an exedra-shaped fa√ßade. The fa√ßade has three niches, each of which shows the coat of arms of the Chigi family ‚Äì six mountains dominated by an eight-pointed star ‚Äì above a small tank fed by a pipe. The attribution to Gian Lorenzo Bernini is probably untrue: it is supposed that the projects are by Andrea Sacchi or by the architect Marco Antonio De 'Rossi. In 1712 there was a new restoration, commissioned by Pope Clement XI and commemorated by another plaque placed in a lower position, above the central niche. There had been protests for the lower water flow of the fountain, which created long queues, and for the quality of the water that had deteriorated. The pontiff appointed a commission which included Giovanni Maria Lancisi, pontifical doctor, and the architect Egidio Maria Bordoni; the commission was chaired by the Cardinal Giovanbattista Spinola, who was also a Camerlengo at the time. The work solved the problems contested by the local population. The stone seats were installed in 1821, thanks to a funding from Ludwig I of Bavaria, a frequent visitor to the area during his Roman stay (it was here that he met his lover Maria Anna Florenzi). Due to the pollution of the aquifer, the fountain was closed in 1959 and later reopened by feeding it with normal drinking water from water mains. Still at the beginning of the 20th century, the street vendors called acquacetosari sold the water from this source around the city; the first mention on this particular profession is reported by Papi in the De agricoltura (1663). Between 2008 and 2009 the fountain has been subjected to an important renovation work, which also included the creation of a small fenced park, with the aim of restoring to the area its original setting.  Transports  It can be reached from the Acqua Acetosa station.

Publication history Cover art, 1977Dimension Six is a board game in which two players battle for superiority by mining supplies of a mineral called Delium, which can be used to build missiles. The game comes with the following components: * a board representing ordinary space, showing planets where Delium can be mined. * a second board representing a parallel plane called \\"Dimension 6\\" space. Players can use it to quickly travel. Only hand-to-hand combat can occur here. * a pad of ships' logs * rules booklet * a six-sided die The object of the game is to destroy the other player or conquer all available planets. The two players travel to various planets prospecting for Delium, which they then transport back to their home planet to manufacture powerful missiles. Players can also use their ships to build defensive space stations in orbit around planets, or defensive outposts on their mining planets. If two scout ships from the opposing players meet, then combat results. Reception In the February-March 1979 edition of White Dwarf (Issue #11), Jacek Gabrielczyk thought the game lacked complexity, saying, \\"Simple isn't it? In fact, too simple.\\" While he thought \\"The game as it stands would be ideal for young SF enthusiasts who would like to try boardgaming\\", he gave Direct Conflict in Dimension Six a below-average rating of only 5 out of 10. In the November 1979 edition of Boys' Life, Jon Halter recommended Direct Conflict in Dimension Six as a good starting place for young readers interested in learning how to play science fiction wargames.

Cristobal then made landfall in the state of Campeche at 13:35 UTC on June 3, 2020, with sustained winds of 60 mph (95 km/h), causing torrential rainfall throughout the region. It slowly curved northward over Mexico and progressed into the Gulf of Mexico. Cristobal then made a second landfall over southeastern Louisiana at 22:10 UTC on June 7, becoming the second-earliest tropical cyclone to make landfall in Louisiana. The system progressed north through the Mississippi Valley, managing to survive over land as a tropical depression until finally becoming extratropical over southern Wisconsin at 03:00 UTC on June 10 . This extratropical low then moved north past Lake Superior and to near James Bay, before heading northeastward toward the Labrador Sea. Cristobal's large size led it to have impacts over much of Central America and southern Mexico, as well as the United States Gulf Coast and Midwest. Combined with Amanda, Cristobal led to nearly a week of devastating rainfall across Guatemala, El Salvador, and southern Mexico. Over 230,000 acres of crops were damaged in the Mexican state of Yucat√°n, leading to a damage estimate of US$184 million. The storm caused the deaths of several people in Mexico and El Salvador. Cristobal also caused multiple tornadoes and waterspouts along the U.S. Gulf Coast, and brought severe weather to the Midwestern U.S. and Eastern Canada. Altogether, Cristobal caused at least US$665 million in damage and 15 fatalities. Meteorological history On May 31, Tropical Storm Amanda, the first named storm of the Eastern Pacific hurricane season, formed off the coast of Guatemala and then made landfall a short while later. Once inland, Amanda brought torrential rainfall to portions of Guatemala and El Salvador that produced flooding and landslides as it rapidly weakened and dissipated. On June 1, as the system moved northward toward the Yucat√°n Peninsula, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) advised that in all likelihood Amanda's remnants would develop into an Atlantic tropical depression within the next few days. At 21:00 UTC that same day, the remnants re-developed into Tropical Depression Three in the Atlantic basin with maximum sustained winds of . Located over the Bay of Campeche, the depression proceeded to slowly intensify throughout the rest of the day. On the morning of June 2, a U.S. Air Force Reserve hurricane hunter aircraft investigated the depression and found the system to be very close to tropical storm strength. Data from a subsequent midday flight indicated that wind speeds had increased to tropical storm force, so the cyclone was provided the name Cristobal. This marked the earliest third named storm in the Atlantic, eclipsing the record set by Tropical Storm Colin in 2016 of June 5. Cristobal strengthened as it stayed nearly stationary in the Bay of Campeche the next day. Its development was reinforced by the moisture and the persistent onshore flow across parts of Central America, steered by a large counter-clockwise wind pattern known as the Central American Gyre. Afterward the storm began moving south, gaining strength quickly as it neared the Mexican coastline, becoming more symmetrical with its barometric pressure dropping. Later, at 13:35 UTC on June 3, reports from a Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicated that Cristobal had made landfall at peak strength near Atasta, Mexico, just to the west of Ciudad del Carmen, with sustained winds of and a central barometric pressure of . Cristobal, beginning to lose its convective activity, began to slowly weaken as the day went on while it pushed further southeast into the Mexican state of Campeche. At 16:00 UTC on June 4, Cristobal was downgraded to tropical depression status, with its satellite appearance continuously degrading. The depression lost most of its banding features due to prolonged interaction with land, and most of its convection was limited to the northeastern quadrant of the circulation. Then near the northwestern tip of Guatemala, Cristobal made a cyclonic loop, and moved back across the Yucat√°n Peninsula, resulting in it getting better organized on satellite imagery. On June 5, 2020, at 09:00 UTC, Cristobal reintensified into a tropical storm. Tropical Storm Cristobal re-intensifying north of the Yucat√°n Peninsula on June 5 Cristobal exited the Yucat√°n on June 5 and entered the southern Gulf of Mexico. The much broader cyclone moved further north as dry air and interaction with an upper-level trough to the east began to strip Cristobal of any central convection, with most of the convection being displaced east and north of the center and thoroughly ridding Cristobal of a typical tropical cyclone structure. Reconnaissance aircraft found Cristobal slightly stronger in the afternoon of June 6, despite being poorly organized. Observations from the NHC suggested Cristobal resembled more of a subtropical cyclone than a tropical cyclone during this period, with the strongest winds and convection displaced well to the east of the center. Tropical Storm Cristobal then made landfall on June 7 at 22:10 UTC in southeast Louisiana, east of Grand Isle at its second peak strength of ; the barometric pressure at landfall was . Cristobal moved along the Mississippi Valley afterward, passing over Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois and Iowa before being declared extratropical by the Weather Prediction Center at 03:00 UTC on June 10 while over southern Wisconsin, the farthest northwest a fully tropical system had traveled in North America. The storm was only the fourth tropical cyclone remnant on record to have moved over Wisconsin, and the first since Gilbert in 1988. Green Bay, Wisconsin recorded an all-time low pressure observation for June when Cristobal caused readings to fall to , breaking a mark set in 1917. Cristobal reached the Upper Peninsula of Michigan as a post- tropical cyclone by the early morning hours of June 10, and the last public advisory issued by the Weather Prediction Center on Cristobal came later that morning at 09:00 UTC. Multiple June low pressure records fell as Cristobal passed through the Marquette area, as did high winds. A peak gust of was recorded at the Stannard Rock Lighthouse, just southeast of the Keweenaw Peninsula, as the storm moved across Lake Superior toward Northern Ontario, Canada. In doing so, it became the first known case of a tropical system encountering Lake Superior. Two days later, the remnant low that was Cristobal crossed over Labrador and later dissipated. PreparationsMexico= In expectation of high winds and heavy downpours, a tropical storm warning spanning from Campeche westward to Veracruz was issued by the government of Mexico on June 1. A total of 9,000 Mexican soldiers and National Guard members were sent to assist with preparations and relief work. Residents in several at-risk communities in the states of Tabasco, Campeche and Veracruz were evacuated on June 2. The Puerto Isla del Carmen terminal at the mouth of the Grijalva River was closed for vessels of all types as Cristobal approached; waves there reached up to 10 feet (3 meters) high on June 2. On June 5, while Cristobal was downgraded to a tropical depression, a tropical storm watch was issued extending from Punta Herrero to R√≠o Lagartos by the Mexican government. =United States= With Cristobal tracking toward the state, Louisiana governor John Bel Edwards declared a state of emergency on June 4, and ordered evacuations for low-lying coastal areas. On June 5, a tropical storm watch was issued from Intracoastal City, Louisiana, to the Alabama-Florida border. A storm surge watch was also issued for parts of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida. The town of Grand Isle, Louisiana, issued a mandatory evacuation order starting June 6 at 11:00 UTC, according to Grand Isle Mayor David Camardelle. Later that day, Amtrak cancelled all trains throughout the area. President Donald Trump declared a federal state of emergency in Louisiana on June 7 as Cristobal approached landfall. Additionally, flash flood and river flood watches were issued from Louisiana in the south to Wisconsin in the north due to rainfall estimates upward of forecast in some areas, and impacting more than 15 million people. ImpactsMexico and Central America= The combined effects of Tropical Storm Amanda and Cristobal brought torrential rains to a large swath of Central America and Mexico. According to the National Hurricane Center, parts of the Pacific coasts of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Mexico's Chiapas state picked up of rainfall. The National Meteorological Service of Mexico reported that of rain fell in Ocotepec, Chiapas between May 30 and June 3. M√©rida, the capital of Yucat√°n, recorded in the same time frame. The widespread rainfall led to some significant flooding across the Yucat√°n Peninsula. Some areas of Yucat√°n received a year's-worth of rain in four days. Cristobal also caused minor damage to a PEMEX oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico and to the terminal at Isla del Carmen (near where it made landfall). At least 619 people were required to be evacuated due to the threat of incoming landslides and flash flooding and 16 individual landslides were reported across Campeche, Chiapas, and Yucat√°n. Around 10,000 people were estimated to have been severely effected by flash flooding. Agricultural damage in Campeche reached 40 million pesos (US$1.84 million). One person drowned while trying to swim through floodwaters in Santa Mar√≠a, Yaxcab√°. Another person died in Chiapas when a tree fell on him. A June 4 landslide in Zacatecoluca, La Paz, in south central El Salvador, killed 10 people. In Yucat√°n, of crops were damaged, which is about 85% of the total crops statewide. The costs were calculated at 4 billion pesos (US$184 million). Further east, in L√°zaro C√°rdenas, Quintana Roo, the heavy rain from Cristobal caused flooding and damaged of papaya. Total loss were estimated at around 1 million pesos (US$46,000). =United States= Tropical Storm Cristobal nearing landfall in Louisiana on June 7 Ahead of the storm's landfall, two children died in Louisiana after being pulled to sea by a rip current, and a third drowned in Texas due to the rough surf. A 5 ft (1.5 m) storm surge caused flooding along much of the Louisiana coast, and flooded the only road leading to and out of Grand Isle, which was under a mandatory evacuation. Torrential rainfall and the storm surge caused a flood event in Grand Isle said to have been the worst since Hurricane Isaac in 2012. A large portion of Louisiana Highway 1 was completely flooded and inaccessible throughout June 7, and around 4,000 power outages occurred across New Orleans on that same day. Infrastructural damage to southern Louisiana incurred a damage estimate near US$150 million. In Florida, several tornado warnings were issued and at least six tornadoes were confirmed in the state between June 6 and June 7 from Cristobal's outer rainbands. A destructive EF1 tornado struck areas just east of Downtown Orlando, starting as a waterspout over Lake Conway before moving ashore, damaging or uprooting multiple trees, some of which fell onto homes. However, the heavy rainfall from Cristobal relieved a seasonal drought in the state, where some parts of North Florida recorded over 10 inches (254 mm) of rain in just a day. Remnants of Cristobal merging with frontal system early on June 10 as it brings severe thunderstorms to Michigan and Ontario. In Mississippi near where Cristobal made landfall, several weather observation sites reported strong tropical storm-force winds.. Weathernation. Retrieved June 12, 2020. A Weatherflow site on Ship Island, Mississippi, observed a sustained wind of 48 mph (78 km/h) and a gust to 64 mph (104 km/h), which was the peak wind gust reported during landfall in the United States. Flooding became severe over Mississippi following Cristobal's landfall, and a state of emergency was declared by Mississippi governor Tate Reeves on June 10 to help speed up relief efforts; preliminary damage estimates in the state reached US$5.2 million. Downgraded to a tropical depression, Cristobal merged with another storm system coming from the west, bringing torrential rainfall and gusty winds across the Midwestern states. The system brought stormy weather to the Great Lakes Region, accompanied by strong winds and high waves along the north end of Green Bay, especially across Big Bay de Noc in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Data retrieved at 06:00 UTC on June 10 from the GPM satellite found the heaviest rainfall occurring in two areas: north and west of Lake Superior, north of Rossport and Red Rock, Ontario, Canada; and over Georgian Bay on the eastern side of Lake Huron. In both places, rain was falling at rates of per hour. The large volume of moisture dragged behind Post-Tropical Cyclone Cristobal as it moved to the north prompted a rare moderate risk of severe thunderstorms to be issued for large portions of Michigan, Indiana and Ohio by the Storm Prediction Center in their categorical outlook. A squall line associated with Cristobal's remnants, later classified as a derecho, brought wind gusts up to around the areas; 650,000 people lost power due to the derecho from Indiana and Michigan to western New York. The derecho produced a damaging EF2 tornado in Beaver County, Pennsylvania and two EF0 tornadoes in Columbiana County, Ohio on June 10. =Canada= The same thunderstorm line also impacted Southern Ontario and Western Quebec. More than 43,000 households lost electrical power in Ontario. In Quebec, the winds resulted in over 130,000 households losing power, about half of which were located in the Greater Montreal Area. Fierce winds and torrential rain accompanied by hail stormed through the District of Muskoka, causing much damage. Wind gusts of up to were reported at the airport in Bracebridge. EF1 tornadoes also touched down near Bracebridge and Baysville, as did an EF2 near Mary Lake. Two additional tornadoes struck the London area: an EF0 in Glencoe and an EF1 in Belmont.

As the first monarch since the islands were unified by her father, In√©s titled herself ‚ÄúQueen of the Canary Islands,‚Äù which she held until the assignment to the Catholic Monarchs to the islands of La Palma, Gran Canaria and Tenerife in 1477. BiographyEarly Life= She was born approximately 1424 in Seville to Hern√°n Peraza the Elder and his wife, In√©s de las Casas (for whom she was named), lords of the Canary Islands. Her father's family was influential in Seville as lords and mayors while her mother's ancestry is of French origin. https://mdc.ulpgc.es/cdm/ref/collection/aea/id/1343https://books.google.com/books?id=vME2AAAAMAAJhttps://mdc.ulpgc.es/cdm/ref/collection/revhistoria/id/48http://fabpedigree.com/s059/f016298.htm While her father and brother built a consolidated lordship in the islands, In√©s remained in Seville for her early life. She was under the tutelage of the Duke of Medina Sidonia, Don Juan de Guzm√°n, through 1447. In the next year, 1448, she married her husband, Diego Garc√≠a de Herrera. Lordship of the Canary Islands In 1445, In√©s‚Äôs father, Hern√°n Peraza the Elder, exchanged her late mother‚Äôs olive estate in Hu√©var, with her (mother's) uncle, Guill√©n de las Casas, for the rights that he had over the lordship of the islands of Tenerife, La Gomera, La Palma and Gran Canaria, which Guill√©n had inherited from his father Alfonso. This was added to the territory Hern√°n Peraza had already acquired from the Count of Niebla Enrique de Guzm√°n in 1430 ‚Äî El Hierro and Lanzarote. Following the death of her father in 1452, as well as the earlier death of his first-born son Guill√©n on La Palma (circa 1447/1448), In√©s remained the sole heir to the lordship of the islands. =Lordship lawsuits= In√©s and her husband, Diego de Herrera, had to fight with the Crown of Castile as well as the Kingdom of Portugal for their rights over the islands. Lanzarote had previously been leased by Guill√©n de las Casas, uncle of In√©s Peraza's mother, to Maciot de Bethencourt, relative of the conqueror Jean de Bethencourt in 1432. He, in turn, sold it to Henry the Navigator of Portugal in 1448, however the islanders revolted against Portuguese power, leaving island disputed and considered \\"kidnapped\\" by King Juan II. The year 1454 was significant as the Peraza-Herrera's received from King Enrique IV of Castile the return of the island of Lanzarote to their lordship by way of a court order confirming their ownership. That same year they successfully removed Henry the Navigator from the part of La Gomera that his vassals occupied. In 1468 Enrique IV was also forced to revoke his concession of the conquest of the unsubmissive islands he had made in favor of several Portuguese nobles in 1464. Later the Catholic Monarchs had granted In√©s and her husband the establishment of a majorat of the islands in 1476, which was later confirmed to their son Hern√°n Peraza the Younger in 1486. =Participation in the conquest of Tenerife= In√©s Peraza participated directly in the conquest of the island of Tenerife, assisting the royal order to the conquering captain Alonso Fern√°ndez de Lugo in 1495 with extensive supplies. This aid had been requested by Alonso de Lugo for his second entry into Tenerife, after his army had been defeated by the Guanches in the \\"Acentejo massacre\\" the previous year. Afterwards, as a guarantee, In√©s held the children of Lugo Fernando and Pedro as hostages for the substantial debt that amounted to 600,000 maraved√≠. =Canary Islands Lordship Division=Uprising in Lanzarote In 1476 the inhabitants of Lanzarote revolted against the stately power of the Herrera-Perazas. The people of Lanzarote asked to be vassals of the Catholic Monarchs before the excesses of In√©s Peraza and her husband, going to court to file complaints and other documents. The lords of the Canary Islands then began to persecute the rebels, exiling or executing them, until the Kings sent Esteban P√©rez de Cabitos, the investigating judge, to Lanzarote to collect information on the lords' rights to the islands. Assignment of the rights of conquest of Gran Canaria, La Palma, and Tenerife In October 1477, In√©s and her husband renounced their rights to the islands that had not yet been conquered, transferring them to the Catholic Monarchs in exchange for financial compensation and the title of Count of La Gomera. Further Lordship Division With the sale to the Catholic Monarchs, the lordship of the Peraza-Herrera was reduced to the islands of Lanzarote, Fuerteventura, La Gomera and El Hierro. However, increased division begins in 1474 as a result of the distribution between their children as they came of age. Pedro, the eldest son, received the island of El Hierro on the occasion of his marriage, and in 1478 Hern√°n Peraza the Younger (named after her father) received La Gomera. In 1482, in the face of Pedro's attempts against the life of his parents, as well as for provoking revolts in the family domain, he was disinherited by In√©s, who then favored the second-born Hern√°n The Younger, giving him control of El Hierro as well. Following Hern√°n The Younger's death in La Gomera in 1488, further internal struggles ensued in the family against his ambitious widow Beatriz de Bobadilla (known as ‚ÄúThe Huntress‚Äù) for control of the islands. Bobadilla would successfully retain ownership of her husband's lands and emerge as ruler of La Gomera and El Hierro. Bobadilla was succeeded by her son, Guill√©n Peraza de Ayala, who was elevated from a lord to a count. In 1502, In√©s divided Lanzarote and Fuerteventura into twelfth parts among her other children: Sancho de Herrera, Mar√≠a de Ayala and Constanza Sarmiento - five for Sancho, four for Mar√≠a and three for Constanza. She died at the beginning of the following year in her birthplace of Sevilla. As a result of her tumultuous reign, In√©s was the last head of the unified seigneury, though the Peraza family would remain a prominent force in the governing and shaping of the Canary Islands. Marriage and Progeny In√©s Peraza married Diego Garc√≠a de Herrera y Ayala in Seville in 1448. Herrera was a \\"Vassal of Her Majesty\\" and a Thirteenth Knight of the Order of Santiago. They had five children: * Pedro Garc√≠a de Herrera * Hern√°n Peraza the Younger, first lord of La Gomera and El Hierro. Married to Beatriz de Bobadilla and Ulloa. * Sancho de Herrera the Elder, first lord of Lanzarote. Married to Violante de Cervantes. * Constanza Sarmiento, first lady of Fuerteventura. Married to Pedro Fern√°ndez de Saavedra. * Mar√≠a de Ayala, who married Diego de Silva y Meneses, first count of Portalegre since 1496.

Houghton Mifflin Company, 1994. The Frosty is the world's smallest racing sailboat class and was designed for lightness and simplicity. It was conceived for after normal season \\"frostbite racing\\", when most owners will have already hauled out their larger racing boats for the winter. The initial construction cost was estimated at less than US$300. Production The design is usually amateur constructed from plans in the eastern United States and Canada and is supported by the Cape Cod Frosty Class Association. Some production boats were built in the past from fiberglass by Sailpower Corp and Star Marine. Star Marine also provided kits for amateur completion at one point. More than 1,000 boats have been completed in total. Design The Frosty is a racing sailboat, usually built of wood, using two sheets of plywood and assembled using an epoxy stitch and glue technique. The design has a pram hull with no chines or internal framing and has only one bulkhead. It features an unstayed catboat single sail rig, with wooden or aluminum spars, a nearly plumb stem, a vertical transom, a transom- hung rudder controlled by a tiller with an extension and a retractable daggerboard. It displaces . The boat has a draft of with the daggerboard fully down. For sailing the design is equipped with flotation bags. To ensure equal competition, the class rules require ballasting to a combined boat and crew weight of , using water-filled plastic jugs. A boom vang, Cunningham and mainsheet traveler are optional. The class association notes, \\"this is not a boat for juniors, in fact, only experienced sailors need apply\\". Operational history In a 1994 review Richard Sherwood wrote, \\"this is the world‚Äôs smallest racing class ‚Äî and all boats are equally slow. But when you put your big boat up for the winter, you may still compete, and perhaps on a more friendly level.\\" The first class championship regatta was held at the Hyannis Yacht Club in Hyannis, Massachusetts on 28 April 1985, with 21 local sailors competing in the six races. The following year it became a two-day event. By 2001 there were 15 fleets racing the design in the eastern United States and Canada, plus an annual North American Championship.

She was the first woman ever to receive the Sterning Fellowship at Yale.  Life and education  Harriet Exline Lloyd was born in Washington in 1909. At the age of sixteen Exline entered Reed College with the intent to study language and literature, however soon became interested in chemistry and biology. After that, she has done six-year graduate study at the University of Washington, spending summers and Fridays at Harbor Biological Station. In 1936, Exline earned her PhD at the University of Washington and was awarded the Sterning Fellowship at Yale for postdoctoral studies in arachnological research with Professor Alexander Petrunkevitch. She was the first woman to receive this scholarship. On 29 August 1938, Exline married a fellow scientist Donald L. Frizzell in Guayaquil, Ecuador. She chose marriage over fellowship renewal and sailed for Peru at the end of academic year. They remained in Ecuador and Peru during next five years working together and individually on arachnology and paleontology researches.  Work  In September 1943, the couple went to Seattle where Exline stayed till the end of WWII working as an instructor in the zoology department at the University of Washington. Having finished the academic year at the university in 1945, Exline joined her husband in Austin. Next three years she worked as guest researcher in spiders in the Department of Zoology at the University of Texas. In 1948, the Frizzels moved to Rolla, where Exline was continuing her research on spiders at the University of Missouri. During this time she was named a Fellow and Research Associate of the California Academy of Sciences. Exline was working jointly with her husband on holothurian sclerites and co-authored with him Monograph of fossil holothurian sclerites, published in 1955. In 1958, Don L. Frizzel wrote that his wife was deeply involved in micropaleontological research and co-authored with him three papers. In 1958-1959 Exline went on a holiday trip to Gulf Coast where she collected spiders and continued her spider studies. From 1960 until 1967, Exline worked as taxonomist and consultant for a National Science Foundation project in spider biology at the University of Arkansas. She was devoting around one third of her time to this project. Exline's work American Spiders of the Genus Argyrodes (Araneae, Theridiidae), published in 1962 was highly appreciated by researcher A. Chickering who called it ‚Äúthe most comprehensive work published to date on this highly interesting but difficult genus of ‚Äúcomb-footed‚Äù spiders.‚Äù After the death of Professor Petrunkevitch in 1964, Exline organized and edited his unpublished works publishing them posthumously. In September 1967, Exline's heath rapidly declined and she was hospitalized. She died in February 1968. After her death, her spider collections were given to the California Academy. The Harriet Exline Frizzell Memorial Fund was created in her honour.  Bibliography (selected)  * 1935. Three new species of Cybaeus. Pan-Pacific Entomol. 11(3):129-132. * 1936.

Publication history In 1976, Wilf Backhaus and Edward E. Simbalist created the fantasy role-playing game Chivalry & Sorcery (C&S;), published by FGU. Backhaus and Simbalist subsequently published several supplements for C&S;, but Rapier & Dagger, published in 1978, was not one of them. This 24-page booklet, written by Backhaus and illustrated by Simbalist, was instead a treatise on the history of fencing, and a set of generic rules by which two players could engage in a role-playing duel. The setting of Rapier & Dagger and the fencing styles used relate to France in the 1600s. There are two sets of rules: simpler rules for pencil-and-paper duels; and a more complex set of rules for use with either 25mm or 54 mm miniatures. Gameplay Rapier & Dagger is a combat rule system which could be played as a skirmish wargame, or combined with fantasy role-playing game systems. As a first step, players create a duellist with abilities generated using random dice rolls. Because the rules system is generic, Rapier & Dagger can be used with any fantasy role-playing system. Reception In the February-March 1979 edition of White Dwarf #12, Don Turnbull liked the production value of the booklet, calling it \\"handsome.\\" However, he found even the simple rules for pencil-and-paper dules \\"quite complicated\\", and noted that with beginning players, \\"duels may take some time to resolve... Even for those to whom rule-reading and comprehension are second nature, these rules are not easy to digest and assemble into a coherent whole.\\" He recommended that players try the simpler pencil-and-paper rules before graduating to the more complex miniatures rules. Once he learned the rules, Turnbull found the action quite realistice, moreso than another FGU duelling game, En Garde! He gave the game a rating of 6 out of 10, concluding, \\"The rules are readily adaptable into existing games such as En Garde, Chivalry & Sorcery or even D&D; if you want to make melee more realistic between opponents using swords. I suspect, however, they will be used more often on their own ‚Äì and they provide the basis for some entertaining and thought-provoking duels.

Born December 8, 1906 in Gravette, Arkansas, Andrews grew up on Spavinaw Creek in rural Benton County. He married Lucille Kinsey of Pineville, Arkansas in 1929, yielding a son Joseph, who also worked as an actor. Career In 1924, seventeen year old Andrews stood 6'8\\" tall and had earned the nickname Slim. He used money earned picking strawberries to buy a Model T Ford, souped the car up and went on the road doing comedy. He joined forces with a traveling showman known as Watso the Musical Wizard, who taught him handsaw and banjo. Tex Ritter encountered Andrews doing a standup comedy routine in a tent in Monticello, Arkansas that was outdrawing Ritter's own performance. Ritter was impressed and invited Andrews to come along and work movies with him. Andrews eventually performed in 15 movies with Ritter. He later hosted numerous children's television programs. Although he acted as a movie cowboy, he had a hatred for horses, which is why he chose to ride a mule in many movies. When western movies began to lose some popularity, Andrews furthered his career by touring with Bob Wills, singing and composing songs before ultimately finding a new career as a host of weekday children's TV, including a role as \\"The Forty Niner\\" for KMJ-TV in Fresno, California and hosting \\"The Fun Club\\" at KOAM in Kansas.

She was a headmistress and catechist, and one of the first to evangelize the Miao people. She was beheaded for her faith on January 28, 1858. Agatha was beatified by Pope Pius X on May 2, 1909, and canonized in 2000. Her feast day is February 18.  Early life  Agatha Lin, born Lin Zhao, was born in the village of Machang in the Qinglong district of Guizhou in 1817. Her father was a salt merchant, and both parents, who were \\"fervent Christians\\", had been converted to Christianity by Zhang Dapeng. Agatha was baptized when she was three days old, though her father was in prison at the time for refusing to renounce his Catholic faith. Her parents taught Agatha to read and write, and her mother trained her to become an expert in needlework. When she was young, Agatha took \\"a private vow of virginity\\". (Her patron was St. Agatha of Cicily, who was martyred in the 3rd century.) Her parents, however, had betrothed Agatha to a man while she was a child, according to custom, but they agreed to annul the marriage when she was 18 because she had consecrated her life to God. A priest, Fr. Matthew Liu, advised Agatha's father to send her to Guiyang, the capital of Guizhou Province, to study at the school for girls founded and run by the consecrated virgin Annie Yuan of Sichuan. Two months later, the school was closed due to persecution, and Agatha went to Longping, near Zunyi, with the school's head teacher and studied there for two years. She returned home to discover that her father had been re-arrested, and she stayed to care for her aging mother.  Religious work  Agatha made her vows when she was 25. After the death of her father, she and her mother moved to the district of Zhenning. There she converted people to Christianity. She moved to Guiyang to become the director of a house of formation for consecrated virgins under Bishop Etienne Albrand. Her father bequeathed her enough money that she was able to buy a house near Xinggi, which served as a chapel and school. Under the direction of Fr. Paul Perny, she moved to Maokou, a Miao village in the Langdai district, to teach women. She was one of the first to evangelize the Miao people. After two years, her pupils were baptized.  Death and canonization  In 1858 the village where Agatha was living was raided. She was arrested alongside another catechist, St. Jerome Lu Tingmei. Both were condemned to death, \\"after they had been denounced as Christians\\". They along with St. Laurence Wang Bing, a successful farmer, were beheaded on January 28th, 1958. She was beatified by Pope Pius X in 1909, and was canonized in 1984. Her feast day is February 18.

It was from 1877 to 1864 part of the Royal Porcelain Manufactory's Christianshavn factory and is now hidden from the street by a school building from 1865. The house was listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places in 1932. It is now part of Christianshavn School and houses the school's after school programmes. HistoryPhilip de Lange's house and nitrary= Gedde's district map of Christianshavn (1757): The Philip de Lange House is seen under the lot number (385) and the long niter beds are seen to the right. Philip de Lange purchased a large site at Prinsessegade in 1755 and was at the same time granted a royal license to establish a nitrary in the grounds. A house for his own use was completed on the property later that same year. His second son, Philip Lange, who would himself become a prominent architect and master builder, was born the following year. Niter was together with charcoal and sulphor from Iceland (then part of Denmark) the main ingredients in the manufacture of gunpowder. The niter was extracted from enriched soil in shallow, rectangular niter beds which was fed with nitrate-rich materials such as urin, dead animals, blood and soil from stables. Lange closed the nitrary after a few years but lived in the house until his death in 1766. His widow Lucia sold the house in 1777. =Cotton, porcelain and tobacco= The new owner, Arnold Piccardi, a textile manufacturer, established a cotton factory with 12 loomss in the building, but it was no success and soon had to close. Piccardi sold the property to the owners of the city's new porcelain factory in 1778. The porcelain factory was in 1780 taken over by the Crown and from then on known as the Royal Porcelain Manufactory (Den Kongelige Porcel√¶nsfabrik, bnow Royal Copenhagen). The scientist Georg Forchhammer, who headed the porcelain factory's dye laboratory, resided in the building from 1825 to 1829. Part of the Royal Porcelain Factory's property (now Prinsessegade 60) was in 1855 sold to the E. Nobel tobacco company. Another portion (now Prinsessegade 62) was in 1862 sold to Aluminia. In 1868, E. Nobel acquired Aluminia's factory in exchange for its factory in Frederiksberg. =Prinsessegade School= Drawing of Prinsessegades Betalingsskole, the building that now hides the Philip de Lange House from the street The southeastern part of the property, with the Philip de Lange House, was in October 1864 sold to Prinsessegades Betalinghsskole. The building that now hides the Philip de Lange House from the street was constructed in 1865. The Philip de Lange House was in the 1850s taken over by Christianshavn School. A new school building was constructed towards the street and the old house was also used by the school. The ground floor was used for gymnastrics. On 1 April 1915, Prinsessegades Betalingsskole was converted into a public boys' school while B√•dmandsgade School was converted into a public girls' school. In 1938, Prinsessegade School was merged with Droningensgade School under the name Christianshavn School. In 1949 the city purchased the former navel hospital at Prinsessegade 45 as a new main campus for the school. The Prinsessegade complex remained part of the school while the building in Droningensgade was ceded to Kofoed's School. Architecture The house is seven bays wide and has a three-bat median risalitr. Today The building is still part of Christianshavn School and is used for the school's after school programmes (Danish: Fritidshjem).

Since 2002, the firm has designed over 350 teaching and learning spaces for post-secondary institutions across Ontario.  Firm History  Both graduates of the University of British Columbia, Valerie Gow and Philip Hastings founded Gow Hastings Architects in 2002 in Toronto after working independently in Vancouver and London. From 2003 onwards, the firm won progressively larger commissions from post-secondary clients across Southern Ontario. In the late 2000s, the firm was considered the ‚Äúvillage‚Äù architect for Humber College, where it completed over 30 projects and cemented its reputation in educational design. At the same time, they became recognized for their postsecondary culinary expertise. Valerie Gow was inducted to the Royal Architecture Institute of Canada (RAIC) College of Fellows in 2016. Philip Hastings was bestowed Fellowship to the RAIC in 2018.  Selected Projects  George Brown College Centre for Hospitality & Culinary Arts & The Chefs‚Äô House Restaurant (2009) = Designed with Kearns Mancini Architects in 2009, the George Brown Centre for Hospitality & Culinary Arts and The Chefs‚Äô House Restaurant introduced transparency and hands-on learning to the design of Canada's culinary schools. To engage passersby and encourage enrolment in the program, both buildings feature a glass wall that exposes the activities of the chefs‚Äô and teaching kitchens to the street. In the culinary labs, cameras and screens help students get close up views of live cooking demonstrations. In 2009, the projects won an OAA Award for Design Excellence from the Ontario Association of Architects, an ARIDO Award, and the Best of Canada Award. = Humber College (2009-2010) = As Humber College's \\"Village Architect,\\" Gow Hastings created numerous hands-on learning environments that closely replicate professional working scenarios. For example, the Centre for Trades and Technology (2009) includes two full scale townhouses in which students can practice woodworking, welding, plumbing and electrical work. Another example is the Music Production & Recording Studio (2009) which required retrofitting the 1980s building to create the optimal environment for music recording. The design team also converted several non- institutional buildings for educational purposes; for example, they converted a car sales centre into the Centre for Justice Leadership (2010), a former ice hockey rink into a Performing Arts School (2010), and a bar into a Fashion Institute (2010). = Durham College W. Galen Weston Centre for Food (2015) = The Durham College W Galen Weston Centre for Food at is an infill building located in Whitby, Ontario. The building embodies the school's farm-to-fork values and nods to its agrarian setting. There is a two-storey edible herb wall on the interior and glass partitions that provide views into laboratories and kitchens. The building also incorporates such sustainable elements as solar panels, an insulating green roof, and a rooftop apiary. The project won a 2016 ARIDO Award for its innovative green design. = Ryerson University Student ServiceHub (2016) = One of several projects completed for the university, the Ryerson University Student ServiceHub is a 1,210 square metre renovation project of a Brutalist-era cafeteria into a unified space for the Registrar's Office. Previously, Ryerson's admissions, enrolment and financial services were scattered across three different buildings on the downtown campus. Gow Hastings designed a hub that integrates environmental graphics and coloured glass space dividers to reflect the school's branding and address the services‚Äô formerly disparate feel. The project won a 2016 ARIDO award for its interior design. = Seneca College Odeyto Indigenous Centre (2018) = In 2018, Gow Hastings completed the Odeyto Indigenous Centre, a multi-purpose facility for First Peoples at Seneca College in Toronto. The Odeyto building takes its name from the Anishinaabe word for ‚Äúgood journey‚Äù and is inspired by the image of a canoe pulling up to a dock. Odeyto was named one of the 10 Best Canadian Architecture Projects of 2018 by Azure Magazine. In 2019, Odeyto received a Toronto Urban Design Award (TUDA) in the category Public Buildings in Context. = Fleming College A-Wing (2019) = In 2019, the firm renovated and upgraded Fleming College‚Äôs A-Wing building at its Sutherland Campus in Peterborough, Ontario, cladding the imposing brutalist institution with yellow and white-coloured folded aluminum panels, and adding extensive glazing to draw natural light indoors. The project was considered an exercise in ‚Äúoverwriting‚Äù a dated building with a contemporary aesthetic.

Works are read primarily through dedicated mobile phone applications, the earliest being Hooked, which launched in 2015. The format became popular among teenagers and young adults, and other competing platforms followed, including Yarn and Tap, among others. History The first chat fiction platform, Hooked, was created by Prerna Gupta and Parag Chordia, who were writing a novel and decided to do A/B testing to gauge reader preferences. They found that most of their target audience of teenagers failed to finish 1,000-word excerpts of best-selling young-adult novels, but read through stories of the same length written as text message conversations. They accordingly developed and launched Hook in 2015. The app gained popularity from late 2016, and reach the Apple App Store's top position among free apps in 2017. Competing apps began launching the same year, including Yarn, which also has a focus on interactive fiction, and Tap, developed by the online publishing platform Wattpad. Format Chat fiction stories are presented as digital text conversations between two or more characters, without any narration. The format limits possible storytelling options, and presents a challenge to authors in conveying narrative only through dialogue. Most popular stories are of the horror and thriller genres. The format has been popular among teenagers and young adults, though it has been criticized as not providing a meaningful reading experience. Applications usually present the story incrementally, with the user tapping to advance the story message by message. Some platforms feature content by paid writers, while others allow or rely on user contributions. Revenue is usually based on a freemium model, with basic access being free while subscribing offers removal of limits and other benefits.

Life Born in Benevento to a modest family, Franco completed humanistic studies at the school of his brother Vincenzo . In his youth he made friends with his compatriot Antonio Delli Sorici . In 1544 he moved to Naples where he undertook legal studies, coming into contact with the jurist Bartolomeo Camerario . In Naples he wrote a hundred Latin epigrams in honor of Isabella di Capua, wife of Ferrante I Gonzaga. In 1536 he moved to Venice, as a guest of Benedetto Agnelli, speaker of the Duke of Mantua. In August of the same year he published the poem Il tempio di Amore in octaves. Carlo Simiani showed that Il Tempio di Amore was actually plagiarised by Franco from the Neapolitan Iacopo Campanile, known as ‚ÄòCapanio‚Äô . The following year he entered the service of the famous writer and poet Pietro Aretino. Given his predisposition to letters, no less than to invective, Franco soon became the secretary of Aretino and, after a few years, he decided to go freelance, offering his services to well-known personages of the day. Aretino was averse to this initiative and after some verbal or written exchanges, the dispute ended with Franco receiving a dagger blow to his face from Ambrogio Eusebi, the friend of Aretino, that left him scarred,, and resulted in his decision to move to another city. He travelled the Italian peninsula offering his services to various gentlemen and lords (Casale Monferrato, Mantua, Cosenza, Naples) arriving in Rome in 1558. While in Rome he thought of starting the career of writer and libelist, putting his pen at the disposal of the various powerful citizens, from whom he was soon hired to produce eulogies, invectives, licentious sonnets and any other literary product requested at the time, including some pasquinade; but shortly after his arrival, on 15 July 1558 he was arrested in the home of Bartolomeo Camerario, then praefectus annonae, who was also arrested for embezzlement, and Franco remained in prison for eight months. He regained his freedom on February 6, 1559 thanks to the intervention of Giovanni Carafa, Duke of Paliano; with his freedom the seized papers were returned to him. He gained familiarity within the social circle of Cardinal Giovanni Morone. His great misfortune was to accept a commission from the Apostolic Tax Prosecutor Alessandro Pallantieri, to produce an infamous pamphlet and some pasquinades addressed to Pope Pietro Carafa, for distribution following his death (\\"Commento sopra la vita et costumi di Giovan Pietro Carafa che fu Paolo IV chiamato, et sopra le qualit√† de tutti i suoi et di coloro che con lui governaro il pontificato\\"). In 1557 Pallantieri had been investigated for tax offenses and imprisoned. Cardinal Carlo Carafa having dismissed him was considered his enemy. Following the death of Paul IV, Pope Giovanni Medici was elected to release Pallantieri, appoint him Governor of Rome and to send to death, after a summary trial, two important members of the Carafa family. Everything seemed to be going well, when in 1566 the sudden death of Pope Pius IV and the electoral alliance between cardinals Borromeo and Farnese, worried by the enormous power of Pallantieri, caused the unexpected election of Pope Antonio Ghislieri, pupil of the family Carafa, with the name of Pius V. As soon as he arrived at the papal throne, Pius V ordered the revision of the \\"Carafa trial\\", dismissed Pallantieri from Rome and began an investigation into the actions of the former governor. It is in the context of this clash between the powerful that the writer was overwhelmed by events. The house of Niccol√≤ Franco was searched, all the papers were seized and he was imprisoned (1st September 1568). Questioned and tortured, Franco confessed to Pallantieri's commission for the creation of the libels against Paul IV and his family, entitled \\"Commento sopra la vita et costumi di Gio. Pietro Carafa che fu Paolo IV chiamato et sopra le qualit√† de tutti i suoi et di coloro che con lui governaro in pontificato\\". Probably to preempt a retraction, which would have prevented Pallantieri's indictment, and despite Cardinal Morone's defense of the writer at trial, Franco was sentenced to death and hanged on 11 March 1570, in Ponte Sant'Angelo in Rome , in accordance with that recent law which, ironically, Pallantieri had strongly wanted and promulgated, as governor of Rome. A road in the Italian city of Benevento is dedicated to him.

The TheravƒÅda Abhidhamma is a scholastic systematization of the TheravƒÅda school's understanding of the highest Buddhist teachings (Abhidhamma). These teachings are traditionally believed to have been taught by the Buddha, though modern scholars date the texts of the Abhidhamma Pi·π≠aka to the 3rd century BCE.\\"Abhidhamma Pitaka.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica.

JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/44362554. Accessed 25 Feb. 2020. TheravƒÅda traditionally sees itself as the vibhajjavƒÅda (\\"the teaching of analysis\\"), which reflects the analytical (vibhajjati) method used by the Buddha and early Buddhists to investigate the nature of the person and other phenomena.Sujato, Bhante (2012), Sects & Sectarianism: The Origins of Buddhist Schools, pp. 108‚Äì109. According to Bhikkhu Bodhi, a modern TheravƒÅda scholar, the Abhidhamma is \\"simultaneously a philosophy, a psychology and an ethics, all integrated into the framework of a program for liberation.\\"Bodhi (2000), p. 3. There are different textual layers of Abhidhamma literature. The earliest Abhidhamma works are found in the Pali Canon. Then there are exegetical works which were composed in Sri Lanka in the 5th century. There are also later sub-commentarial works composed in later historical periods.  Background and sources  Buddhaghosa (c. 5th century), the most important Abhidhamma scholar of TheravƒÅda, presenting three copies of the Visuddhimagga.Kalupahana, David; A history of Buddhist philosophy, continuities and discontinuities, page 206. The primary source for the Abhidhamma is the Abhidhamma Pi·π≠aka, a set of seven texts which form the third \\"basket\\" of the Tipi·π≠aka (also known as the PƒÅli Canon). It is generally accepted by modern scholars that these works began to be composed during the 3rd century BCE.Damien Keown (2004). A Dictionary of Buddhism. Oxford University Press. p. 2. . They therefore cannot be the direct work of the Buddha himself, but of later disciples and scholars.\\"Abhidhamma Pitaka.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Ultimate Reference Suite. Chicago: Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 2008. However, according to some scholars like Rupert Gethin, it is possible that some elements found in Abhidhamma, such as the mƒÅtikƒÅs (lists, matrices of doctrinal terms) are from an earlier date than the books themselves.Foundations of Buddhism, Oxford University Press, 1998, p. 48 This has been studied by Erich Frauwallner, who argues that there are kernels of early pre-sectarian material in the earliest Abhidhamma texts (such as in the Vibhanga, the Dharmaskandha, and the ≈öƒÅriputrƒÅbhidharma). According to Frauwallner's comparative study, these texts were possibly developed and \\"constructed from the same material\\", mainly early mƒÅtikƒÅs (Sanskrit: mƒÅt·πõkƒÅ) which forms the \\"ancient core\\" of early Abhidhamma.Frauwallner, Erich. Kidd, Sophie Francis (translator). Steinkellner, Ernst (editor). Studies in Abhidharma Literature and the Origins of Buddhist Philosophical Systems. SUNY Press. pp. 18, 100. The extensive use of mƒÅtikƒÅ can also be found in some suttas of the Sutta Pitaka, which have been seen as a \\"proto-abhidhamma\\" by scholars such as Johannes Bronkhorst and Frauwallner. These suttas include the Sa·πÖgƒ´ti Sutta and Dasuttara Sutta of the Dƒ´gha NikƒÅya (as well as the Sa·πÖgƒ´ti S≈´tra and Da≈õottara S≈´tra of the Dƒ´rgha ƒÄgama).Tse-fu Kuan. Abhidhamma Interpretations of ‚ÄúPersons‚Äù (puggala): with Particular Reference to the A·πÖguttara NikƒÅya. J Indian Philos (2015) 43:31‚Äì60 DOI 10.1007/s10781-014-9228-5 Tse fu Kuan also argues that certain sutras of the A·πÖguttara NikƒÅya (AN 3.25, AN 4.87‚Äì90, AN 9.42‚Äì51) depicts an early Abhidhamma type method. The Khuddaka NikƒÅya includes a number of Abhidhamma type texts not found in the Abhidhamma Pi·π≠aka. One of these is the Pa·π≠isambhidƒÅmagga.Karunadasa (2010), p. 2. Others include the Niddessa, the Nettipakara·πáa and the Pe·π≠akopadesa. The Sri Lankan branch of the TheravƒÅda school later developed further Abhidhamma texts, including commentaries (A·π≠·π≠hakathƒÅ) on the books of the Abhidhamma and special introductory manuals. Major commentaries include the AtthasƒÅlinƒ´ (a commentary on the Dhammasa·πÖga·πáƒ´), the Sammohavinodanƒ´ (a Vibha·πÖga commentary) and the Pa√±cappaka·πáara·π≠·π≠hakathƒÅ, a commentary on the other books of the Abhidhamma Pi·π≠aka.Karunadasa (2010), p. 2 The Sri Lankan tradition also produced practice manuals, such as Vimuttimagga (\\"Path of Freedom\\") c. 1st or 2nd century CE. The 5th century scholar Buddhaghosa is one the most influential Abhidhammika of the TheravƒÅda. His Visuddhimagga (a manual on spiritual praxis based on the Vimuttimagga) remains one of the most important TheravƒÅda texts.Nyanamoli (2011), p. xxvii. Chapters XIV to XVII are a kind of summary of the Abhidhamma. His commentaries on the suttas also reflect an Abhidhamma perspective.Karunadasa (2010), p. 3. There is also another layer of \\"sub- commentarial\\" (·π≠ƒ´kƒÅ) literature (commentaries to the commentaries). Ledi Sayadaw, one of the great Abhidhammikas of the 20th century. There is also a genre of short introductory manuals to the Abhidhamma, like the 5th century AbhidhammƒÅvatƒÅra. The most influential of these manuals remains the short and succinct Abhidhammatthasangaha of Anuruddha. According to Bhikkhu Bodhi, this text has remained \\"the main primer for the study of Abhidhamma used throughout the Theravada Buddhist world,\\" and various commentaries have been written on it.Bodhi (2000), pp. xxiii‚Äìxxiv. A further period of medieval Sri Lankan scholarship also produced a series of texts called the sub-commentaries (which are commentaries to the commentaries). Abhidhamma remains a living tradition in TheravƒÅda nations today and modern Abhidhamma works continue to be written in modern languages such as Burmese and Sinhala. Abhidhamma studies are particularly stressed in Myanmar, where it has been the primary subject of study since around the 17th century.Braun, Erik (2013). The Birth of Insight: Meditation, Modern Buddhism, and the Burmese Monk Ledi Sayadaw, p. 63. University of Chicago Press. One of the most important figures in modern Myanmar Buddhism, Ledi Sayadaw (1846‚Äì1923), was well known for his writings on Abhidhamma (especially his commentary on the Abhidhammatthasangaha, called the Paramatthadipanitika). This commentary, which critiqued an older 12th-century commentary from Sri Lanka (the Abhidhammattha-vibhavini-tika) led to a lively controversy, as different figures debated on Abhidhamma topics.Braun, Erik (2013). The Birth of Insight: Meditation, Modern Buddhism, and the Burmese Monk Ledi Sayadaw, pp. 50‚Äì63. University of Chicago Press. The books of the Abhidhamma Pi·π≠aka were translated into English in the 20th century and published by the PƒÅli Text Society. The translators were C. A. F. Rhys Davids (Dhammasa·πÖga·πáƒ´, KathƒÅvatthu), U Thittila (Vibha·πÖga), U Narada (DhƒÅtukathƒÅ, Pa·π≠·π≠hƒÅna), B.C. Law (Puggalapa√±√±atti).  Dhamma theory  In the PƒÅli Nikayas, the Buddha teaches through a method in which experience is explained using various conceptual groupings of physical and mental processes, which are called \\"dhammƒÅ\\". Examples of lists of dhammas taught by the Buddha in the Nikayas include the twelve sense 'spheres' (ayatana), the five aggregates (khanda) and the eighteen elements of cognition (dhatu).Karunadasa (2010), pp. xi, 17. Expanding these various models, the PƒÅli Abhidhamma concerned itself with providing a finer and more exhaustive understanding of all phenomenal experience by explaining, analyzing and classifying all dhammas and their relationships.Karunadasa (2010), p. 19. According to Y. Karunadasa, for the Abhidhamma, dhammas are \\"the basic factors into which all things can be resolved\\" and \\"elementary constituents, the ultimate realities behind manifest phenomena.\\"Karunadasa (2010), p. 15. This \\"Dhamma theory\\" is the central theory or cornerstone of the PƒÅli Abhidhamma.Y. Karunadasa, The Dhamma Theory Philosophical Cornerstone of the Abhidhamma, Buddhist Publication Society Kandy, Sri LankaRonkin, Noa (2011). Early Buddhist Metaphysics: The Making of a Philosophical Tradition (Routledge curzon Critical Studies in Buddhism), p. 2. According to various scholars of Abhidhamma, the main point of this theory is to provide a useful schema for meditative contemplation and insight into the nature of phenomena. \\"DhammƒÅ\\" has been translated as \\"factors\\" (Collett Cox), \\"psychic characteristics\\" (Bronkhorst), \\"psycho-physical events\\" (Noa Ronkin) and \\"phenomena\\" (Nyanaponika Thera).Potter, Buswell, Jaini; Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies Volume VII Abhidharma Buddhism to 150 AD, p. 121.Crosby, Kate (2013), Theravada Buddhism: Continuity, Diversity, and Identity, p. 2. Noa Ronkin defines dhammas as \\"the constituents of sentient experience; the irreducible ‚Äòbuilding blocks‚Äô that make up one's world, albeit they are not static mental contents and certainly not substances.\\"Ronkin, Noa; Early Buddhist Metaphysics, p. 41. According to Karunadasa, a dhamma, which can be translated as \\"a 'principle' or 'element' (dhamma)\\", is \\"those items that result when the process of analysis is taken to its ultimate limits\\". However, this does not mean that they have an independent existence, for it is \\"only for the purposes of description\\" that they are postulated.Karunadasa, Y. Buddhist Analysis of Matter, p. 14. They are also said to be not-self (anatta) and thus empty (su√±√±ƒÅ).Karunadasa (2010), p. 9. After all, dhammas are interconnected and interdependent in various relationships. Thus, the Pali Abhidhamma is not a type of pluralism, since it relies on both analysis (bheda) and synthesis (sangaha). According to Karunadasa, this \\"has enabled it to transcend the binary opposition between pluralism (sabbam puthuttam) and monism (sabbam ekattam), or as one PƒÅli commentary says, the binary opposition between the principle of plurality (nƒÅnatta-naya) and the principle of unity (ekatta-naya).\\"Karunadasa (2010), p. 8. That the Pali Abhidhamma sought to avoid both absolute pluralism and monism can be seen in various commentarial statements that warn against a one-sided focus or grasping on the principle of plurality (nƒÅnattta-naya). For example, the sub-commentary to the Dƒ´gha NikƒÅya says that \\"the erroneous grasping of the principle of plurality is due to the undue emphasis on the radical separateness (accanta-bheda) of the dhammas.\\"Karunadasa (2010), p. 21. Likewise, dhammas \\"are not fractions of a whole indicating an absolute unity\\" or manifestations of a single metaphysical substratum, since this would be the opposite error, a one-sided focus on the principle of unity. Instead, they are simply a \\"multiplicity of inter- connected but distinguishable co-ordinate factors.\\" This is said to correspond to the idea that the Buddha's teaching is an ontological middle way between various extremes, such as absolute existence and non-existence, or radical plurality and absolute monism.Karunadasa (2010), p. 22. While dhammas are said to be distinguishable (vibhƒÅgavanta) form each other, they are said to arise together in clusters due to their inseparability (samsatthatƒÅ, avinibhogatƒÅ). This principle can also be seen in the suttas (see: MahƒÅvedalla Sutta,) which state that some dhammas are said to be blended (samsattha) in such a way that they cannot be separated out.Karunadasa (2010), p. 43. The fact that dhammas always arise together is also connected to their conditional dependence on each other. In the Abhidhamma, nothing arises without a cause, from a single cause or as a single effect. Therefore, in Abhidhamma \\"it is always the case that a plurality of conditions gives rise to a plurality of effects. Applied to the dhamma theory this means that a multiplicity of dhammas brings about a multiplicity of other dhammas.\\"Karunadasa (2010), p. 45. = Their nature and characteristics = According to the Atthasalini: \\"Dhammas bear their own particular natures (sabhƒÅva). Alternatively, dhammas are borne by conditions, or according to particular natures.\\"Ronkin, Noa; Early Buddhist Metaphysics, p. 112. The use of the term sabhƒÅva (own nature, own being) in the description of dhammas is not found in the books of the Abhidhamma Pitaka, but does appear in other texts such as the Nettippakarana and in the commentaries.Karunadasa (2010), p. 34. TheravƒÅda commentaries sometimes equate the two terms, such as the Visuddhimagga which states that ‚Äòdhamma means sabhƒÅva ‚Äô. However, it should be remembered that the TheravƒÅda conception of sabhƒÅva does not mean an essence or a substantial mode of being, since dhammas are not permanent, or totally discrete entities. They are always in dependently conditioned relationships with other dhammas and always changing. Therefore, it is only for the sake of description that they are said to have their \\"own nature\\" (sabhƒÅva).Y. Karunadasa, The Dhamma Theory Philosophical Cornerstone of the Abhidhamma, Buddhist Publication Society Kandy, Sri Lanka, http://www.bps.lk/olib/wh/wh412_Karunadasa_Dhamma-Theory--Philosophical- Cornerstone-of-Abhidhamma.html According to Karunadasa, this usage of sabhƒÅva is only of provisional validity, \\"an attribution made for the convenience of definition.\\" It merely refers to the fact that \\"any dhamma represents a distinct fact of empirical existence which is not shared by other dhammas.\\"Karunadasa (2010), p. 36. According to Peter Harvey, the TheravƒÅda view of a dhamma's sabhƒÅva is that it refers to an individualizing characteristic (salakkhana) that \\"is not something inherent in a dhamma as a separate ultimate reality, but arise due to the supporting conditions both of other dhammas and previous occurrences of that dhamma\\".Harvey, in Introduction to Buddhism, p. 87 wrote: This is shown by other definitions given in the commentaries, which state that a dhamma is \\"that which is borne by its own conditions,\\" and \\"the mere fact of occurrence due to appropriate conditions.\\"Karunadasa (2010), p. 37. Similarly, Noa Ronkin argues that in TheravƒÅda Abhidhamma, \\"sabhƒÅva is predominantly used for the sake of determining the dhammas‚Äô individuality, not their existential status\\".Ronkin, Noa; Early Buddhist Metaphysics, p. 111. SabhƒÅva is therefore synonymous with salakkhana (own characteristic), which is what differentiates one type of dhamma from another for the convenience of definition. For example, this mode of description is what allows us to say that the individual characteristic of the earth element is solidity.Karunadasa (2010), p. 39. This is contrast to \\"universal characteristics\\" of all dhammas (sƒÅmanna-lakkha≈Üa), which are those features all dhammas share, such as being impermanent (anicca), unsatisfactory (dukkha), and not-self (anatta).Karunadasa (2010), p. 40. Thus, while in TheravƒÅda Abhidhamma, dhammas are the ultimate constituents of experience, they are not seen as substances (attena), essences or independent particulars, since they are empty (su√±√±a) of a self (attƒÅ) and conditioned.Crosby, 2013, 182. This is spelled out in the Patisambhidhamagga, which states that dhammas are empty of sabhƒÅva (sabhavena su√±√±am).Ronkin, Noa; Early Buddhist Metaphysics, p. 92. According to Ronkin, the canonical PƒÅli Abhidhamma remains pragmatic and psychological, and \\"does not take much interest in ontology\\" in contrast with the Sarvastivada tradition. Paul Williams also notes that the Abhidhamma remains focused on the practicalities of insight meditation and leaves ontology \\"relatively unexplored\\".Ronkin, Noa; Early Buddhist Metaphysics, p. 77. Ronkin does note however that later TheravƒÅda sub- commentaries (·π≠ƒ´kƒÅ) do show a doctrinal shift towards ontological realism from the earlier epistemic and practical concerns.Ronkin, Noa; Early Buddhist Metaphysics, p. 118. = Classification of dhammas = The TheravƒÅda Abhidhamma holds that there is a total of 82 possible types of dhammas, 81 of these are conditioned (sankhata), while one is unconditioned. These dhammas are divided into four main categories:Ronkin, Noa; Early Buddhist Metaphysics, p. 47.Ven. Rewata Dhamma, Process of Consciousness and Matter: The Philosophical Psychology of Buddhism, chapter 1 # Citta (Mind, Consciousness, awareness) # Cetasika (mental factors, mental events, associated mentality), there are 52 types. # R≈´pa (physical occurrences, material form), 28 types. # NibbƒÅna ‚Äî (Extinction, cessation). The only unconditioned dhamma, it neither arises nor ceases due to causal interaction. Since no dhamma exists independently, every single dhamma of consciousness, known as a citta, arises associated (sampayutta) with at least seven mental factors (cetasikas).Crosby, 2013, 187. In Abhidhamma, all awareness events are thus seen as being characterized by intentionality (aboutness, direction) and never exist in isolation. = The conceptual (pa√±√±atti) = From the Abhidhamma perspective, there are really only dhammas and their relations. If this is so, how can one explain common sense reality, the everyday world? To answer this, ƒÄbhidhammikas resorted to the nominalist theory of pa√±√±atti (concepts, designations) as a way to explain such basic universal categories as unity, identity, time and space.Karunadasa (2010), p. 47. The Buddha made use of this term in the suttas, as can be seen in the PotthapƒÅda Sutta, where he explains that even though he uses the word \\"myself\\" (atta), he is not referring to an ultimate essence, only speaking conventionally and that such terms \\"are names (sama√±√±ƒÅ), expressions (nirutti), turns of speech (vohƒÅra), and designations (pa√±√±atti) in common use in the world. And of these the TathƒÅgata makes use indeed, but is not led astray by them\\".Karunadasa (2010), p. 48. Also, the Niruttipatha Sutta states that the division of time into past, present and future are \\"three pathways of expression (nirutti), designation (adhivacana), and concept-making (pa√±√±atti).\\" The first definition of the term in an Abhidhamma text is that found in the Dhammasangani: \\"That which is an enumeration, that which is a designation, an expression (pa√±√±atti), a current term, a name, a denomination, the assigning of a name, an interpretation, a distinctive mark of discourse on this or that dhamma.\\" The pali commentary adds that this means \\"the process of predicating\\", and that things such as \\"I\\", \\"mine\\", \\"another\\", \\"a person\\", \\"a monastery\\" and \\"a chair\\" are all predications. These conceptual designations depend on the mind and are not themselves the dhammas, the ultimate realities, that is to say, they are not the ultimate truth (paramattha).Karunadasa (2010), p. 49. Together, the conceptual and the ultimate reality constitute the whole of the knowable (√±eyya-dhamma). Pa√±√±attis are seen as without sabhƒÅva (asabhƒÅva), are \\"distinct from both mind and matter,\\" do not arise and fall like dhammas do and \\"are not brought about by conditions\\", are ‚Äúnot positively produced‚Äù (aparinipphanna) and are neither conditioned (sankhata) nor unconditioned (asankhata).Karunadasa (2010), p. 50. In Abhidhamma, pa√±√±attis are a \\"merely conceptualized\\" (parikappa-siddha) \\"product of the mind‚Äôs synthesizing function\\", and \\"exists only by virtue of conceptual thought.\\"Karunadasa (2010), p. 51. There are two kinds of mutually interdependent conceptualizations: * nƒÅma-pa√±√±atti (conceptual name), \\"refers to names, words, signs, or symbols through which things, real or unreal, are designated.\\" It is a mode of recognizing things which is \\"created by worldly consent (lokasahketa-nimmitƒÅ) and established by worldly usage (lokavohƒÅrena siddhƒÅ).\\" * attha-pa√±√±atti (conceptual meaning), \\"refers to ideas, notions, or concepts corresponding to the names,\\" it is \\"produced by the interpretative and synthesizing function of the mind (kappanƒÅ) and is based on the various forms or appearances presented by the real existents.\\" Names can be assigned to everything, including dhammas, however, unlike with everyday objects, names given to dhammas do not have a corresponding attha-pa√±√±atti, because dhammas are \\"profound.\\" According to Karunadasa, \\"what this seems to mean is that objects of conceptual thought like tables and chairs are easily recognizable, whereas the dhammas are difficult to be grasped.\\"Karunadasa (2010), p. 52. It is only in deep meditation that one is said to transcend conceptuality and gain direct insight into the dhammas themselves, seeing them as empty (su√±√±a) and impersonal (nissatta, nijjƒ´va).Karunadasa (2010), p. 53. It is not only everyday objects that are conceptual, but also persons (pudgala), time (kala), and the characteristics of dhammas when considered as separate abstractions, including universal characteristics (sƒÅmanna-lakkha≈Üa) such as impermanence (aniccatƒÅ) as well as the principle of dependent origination and the four noble truths.Karunadasa (2010), pp. 53‚Äì55. = Two truths = According Y. Karunadasa, for the TheravƒÅda, the two truths theory which divides reality into sammuti (worldly conventions) and paramattha (ultimate, absolute truths) is a doctrinal innovation of the Abhidhamma, but it has its origins in some statements from the early PƒÅli Nikayas. This can mainly be seen in the distinction made in the A·πÖguttara-nikƒÅya between statements (not truths) that are nƒ´tattha (explicit, definitive) and neyyattha (requiring further explanation).Karunadasa, Y. Theravada Version of the Two Truths Karunadasa notes that in the Nikayas, \\"no preferential value judgment is made between nƒ´tattha and neyyattha. All that is emphasized is that the two kinds of statement should not be confused.\\" Another early source of this doctrine is the Sa·πÖgƒ´ti-sutta of the Dƒ´gha-nikƒÅya, which lists four kinds of knowledge: (a) the direct knowledge of the doctrine (dhamme √±ƒÅna), (b) the inductive knowledge of the doctrine (anvaye √±ana), (c) knowledge of analysis (paricchede √±ana), and knowledge of (linguistic) conventions (sammuti-√±ana). In the earlier Nikayas, as opposed to the Abhidhamma, sammuti (linguistic conventions) is not analyzed down into existents called paramattha (ultimate). In the TheravƒÅda Abhidhamma, the distinction does arise, referring to: > two levels of reality, namely that which is amenable to analysis and that > which defies further analysis. The first level is called sammuti because it > represents conventional or relative truth or what is called consensual > reality, and the second is called paramattha because it represents the > absolute truth or ultimate reality.Tse-fu Kuan, Abhidhamma Interpretations > of \\" Persons \\" (puggala): with Particular Reference to the A·πÖguttara NikƒÅya, > J Indian Philos (2015) 43:31‚Äì60 Therefore, in Abhidhamma, when a situation is explained in terms of what cannot be empirically analyzed further into smaller components with different characteristics (lakkhana) that explanation is paramattha-sacca (ultimate truth), and when it is explained in terms of what is analyzable further due to being dependent on the mind's synthesizing function (i.e. pa√±√±atti), that explanation is sammuti-sacca (truth by convention), which exists in a relative or conventional sense due to mental conception (attha-pa√±√±atti) and linguistic construction (nama-pa√±√±atti). However, even these ultimate components (i.e. dhammas) are dependently originated, \\"necessarily co-existent and positionally inseparable (padesato avinibhoga)\\". Unlike in the Sanskrit-based Buddhist tradition which refer to the conventional truth as samvrti (which has the meaning of concealing or covering), the PƒÅli Abhidhamma term sammuti just means human convention and does not have this connotation of an inferior truth hiding a higher truth. Therefore, as pointed out by K.N. Jayatilleke, the TheravƒÅda version of two truths \\"does not imply that what is true in the one sense is false in the other or even that the one kind of truth is superior to the other\\".K.N. Jayatilleke, Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge, London, 1963, p. 52. As Karunadasa writes: > the distinction between sammuti-sacca and paramattha-sacca does not refer to > two kinds of truth as such, but to two ways of presenting what is true. > Although they are formally introduced as two truths, they are explained as > two modes of expressing what is true. They do not represent two degrees of > truth, of which one is superior or inferior to the other. Nor do they > represent two parallel truths. Because of this, in Abhidhamma, even paramattha-sacca is explained through concepts, though the ultimate itself is not a product of the mind's conceptual function (pa√±√±atti), it cannot be explained without the medium of pa√±√±atti. Furthermore, according to Tse Fu Kuan, the Dhammasa·πÖga·πái, \\"does not appear to uphold that dhammas are ultimate realities as against conventional constructs like persons.\\" This text also states that ‚Äúall dhammas are ways of designation (pa√±√±atti)‚Äù, that ‚Äúall dhammas are ways of interpretation (nirutti)‚Äù and that ‚Äúall dhammas are ways of expression (adhivacana)‚Äù. Therefore, the canonical Abhidhamma Pitaka does not uphold the interpretation of the two truths as referring to primary ontological realities. Karunadasa notes how the Pali commentaries state that \\"the Buddha sometimes teaches the Dhamma according to conventional truth, sometimes according to ultimate truth, and sometimes through a combination of both.\\" This is compared to a teacher using different dialects to teach his pupils. \\"There is absolutely no implication here that one dialect is either higher or lower than another.\\"Karunadasa (2010), p. 12. = NibbƒÅna, the unconditioned dhamma = MahƒÅkassapa pays homage to the Buddha's remains after the final nibbƒÅna (at the death of the body), Burma, mid 19th century. The suttas do not define the nature of nibbƒÅna in a technical and philosophical sense, but focus on explaining it psychologically and through metaphor as the 'blowing out' of greed, hatred and delusion and remain ambiguous about its metaphysical status.Ronkin (2005), pp. 175‚Äì176. The various Abhidharma systems attempted to provide a fuller ontological account of nibbƒÅna. The Theravada position is first found in the Dhammasa·πÖga·πáƒ´, which describes nibbƒÅna as the unconditioned element (asankhata-dhatu), completely outside of the five aggregates. It is a dhamma which \\"is neither skilful nor unskilful, associated neither with feeling nor with cognition, neither resultant nor giving result, does not require any object, is not classified as past, present or future.\\" Ronkin (2005), pp. 177‚Äì178. Though it is not accessible by discursive or conceptual thought, it is a dhamma that can be cognized or attained by the mind.Ronkin (2005), p. 179. The TheravƒÅda commentarial literature also further developed their view of nibbƒÅna, where it is seen as a real dhamma with a specific own nature or characteristic as well as being completely devoid of any conditioned characteristic. According to Buddhaghosa: \\"it is because it is uncreated (appabhava) that it is free from ageing and death. It is because of the absence of its creation and of its ageing and death that it is permanent. He argues against the view that nibbana is unreal or non-existent and quotes a famous verse found in the Itivuttaka and the Udana which states \\"There is an unborn, an unbecome, an unmade, an unconditioned...\\"Ronkin (2005), p. 180. Thus, the commentary to the Visuddhimagga states that nibbƒÅna is the opposite to all conditioned states. In TheravƒÅda Abhidhamma, nibbƒÅna is seen as totally other than the conditioned existents and as the only unique unconditioned dhamma.Ronkin (2005), pp. 180‚Äì181. Therefore, TheravƒÅda Abhidhamma holds that there is only one singular nibbƒÅna, unlike in Vaibhasika or Mahayana Abhidharma, where there are different types of unconditioned elements and different forms of nibbƒÅna (such as the apratistha or non-abiding nirvana of Mahayana and the unconditioned space element in Vaibhasika).Th√≠ch, Thi·ªán Ch√¢u (1984) The Literature of the Personalists, pp. 201‚Äì202.  Analysis of Mind  In Early Buddhism, consciousness is a phenomenon that always arises based on conditions (i.e. it is dependently originated) and it also never arises by itself, but is always found in relationship with the other four aggregates of personality. Likewise, it is also said to be mutually dependent on and arise together with \\"name and form\\" (nama-rupa). Name refers to feeling (vedanƒÅ), perception (sa√±√±ƒÅ), volition (cetanƒÅ), sense-impression (phassa), and attention (manasikƒÅra), while form refers to the four great properties (see section on \\"Rupa\\").Karunadasa (2010), pp. 68-69. In this sense, early Buddhism and TheravƒÅda Abhidhamma, avoids both idealism or materialism, as well as any kind of dualism that sees mind and body as totally separate. Instead, it posits that mind and body are mutually dependent phenomena.Karunadasa (2010), p. 69. Using this perspective as its basic schema, Abhidhamma analyzes the cognitive process into individual cognitive units which have two main components: consciousness events (cittas, an intentional knowing or awareness of an object) and mental factors (cetasikas, mentality that arises in association with cittas).Karunadasa (2010), p. 70. These two components always arise together, and when the Abhidhamma speaks of a citta, it is understood that cetasikas are also present. This is like stating that a king has arrived, one assumes that he has arrived with his retinue as well. These two conjoined (samsattha) principles are said to be subtle and difficult to differentiate, like the different flavors in a soup. They arise yoked (sampayoga) together, have the same object and cease together.Karunadasa (2010), pp. 71‚Äì72 An instance of cognition is therefore a constellation or a complex of various dhammas in various relationships and \\"they are neither derivable from one another nor reducible to a common ground.\\" They also do not inhere in each other as qualities inhere in substances in other philosophical systems.Karunadasa (2010), p. 73. Furthermore, each instance of cognition is also in various relationships with other instances of cognition. Since it is never an isolated event, it is conditioned by past instances and becomes a condition for future events.Karunadasa (2010), p. 74. The various conditional relations are explained in detail in the Pa·π≠·π≠hƒÅna. These cognitive events happen serially, one at a time. At any moment, there is only one of these cognitive acts. Also, according to Karunadasa, \\"what is more, the present cognitive act cannot cognize itself. It is just like the same sword cannot cut itself, or the same finger-tip cannot touch itself. This amounts to a rejection of what is called ‚Äúta√±√±ƒÅnatƒÅ‚Äù, i.e., the idea that the same consciousness has knowledge of itself.\\"Karunadasa (2010), p. 75. = The cittas = Cittas are consciousness events, i.e. those events which constitute the \\"knowing\\" or awareness of an object. These never arise on their own, but are always intentional (i.e. have a cognitive object or direction).Karunadasa (2010), p. 76. In the Abhidhamma exegesis, citta (synonymous with vi√±√±ana) is defined in three main ways: # By way of agent (kattu-sƒÅdhana): ‚ÄúConsciousness is that which cognizes an object.‚Äù # By way of instrument (kara≈Üa-sƒÅdhana): ‚ÄúConsciousness is that through which the concomitant mental factors cognize the object.‚Äù # By way of activity or mode of operation (bhƒÅva-sƒÅdhana): ‚ÄúConsciousness is the mere act of cognizing the object.‚Äù This definition is the only one which \\"is said to be valid from an ultimate point of view\\" (nippariyayato), since, strictly speaking, consciousness is not a thing, but an activity or process. The Abhidhamma provides numerous classifications and categories of consciousness. The most well known is that of the six \\"doors\\" which correspond to the five physical faculties, namely: the consciousnesses associated with the eye, ear, nose, tongue, and body, as well as mind- consciousness (mano-vi√±√±ana).Karunadasa (2010), p. 77. Each of the five cognitive faculties serve as a physical basis (vatthu, i.e. the eye organ, etc) for the consciousness that they support. The TheravƒÅda Abhidhamma also holds that the mind consciousness also has a physical base, a view which is in disagreement with other Buddhist schools, but which finds support in the suttas, which state that consciousness and \\"name and form\\" (nama-rupa) are dependent on each other.Karunadasa (2010), pp. 78‚Äì79. The Pa·π≠·π≠hƒÅna does not give a specific organ or location for this basis, instead defining the base of the mind consciousness as \\"whatever materiality on which mental activity depends.\\" Karunadasa believes that this is because early Abhidhamma considered the physical base of consciousness not to be limited to any one location in the body. Later TheravƒÅda commentaries however do present a single location, which is called the heart-base (hadaya-vatthu), located inside the heart.Karunadasa (2010), p. 79. Whatever the case, it is important to note that the Abhidhamma does not consider the mind to be controlled or determined by the physical basis, which is only seen as a supporting element to the mind.Karunadasa (2010), p. 80. = Types of citta = A list of cittas outlined in the Abhidhammatthasangaha. Though in one sense, consciousness (citta) has the single characteristic of knowing or awareness of an object, it can be classified into various types depending on the various ways it arises as combined with different mental factors (cetasikas). Cittas are thus classified into various groups based on different criteria, one of these is the Buddhist understanding of meditative states and how they correlate with Buddhist cosmology, another criterion is that of a citta's ethical (karmic) quality.Karunadasa (2010), p. 82. The first classification is separated into four classes of citta corresponding to the four planes of existence:Karunadasa (2010), pp. 82, 91‚Äì96. * The sense sphere (kƒÅma-bhava), refers to cittas of the realm of the senses. * The fine material sphere (r≈´pa-bhava), cittas experienced in the four r≈´pajjhƒÅna (meditations in fine material realm) and in the r≈´pa-loka, a higher, more refined plane of existence. In these states, the five obstacles (nƒ´varana) are not present, and the corresponding factors of each of the four jhƒÅnas are present. * The immaterial sphere (ar≈´pa-bhava), cittas of the four ar≈´pajjhƒÅnas and the formless realms. * The supra-mundane (lokuttara), a consciousness that transcends the world of conditioned experience (i.e. the five aggregates) and \\"directly leads to the realization of NibbƒÅna.\\" These four classes of citta are not exclusive to their planes, they are merely the most commonly found in each plane. Therefore, for example, a person can exist in the sensual sphere, but through meditation, generate a consciousness of the immaterial sphere. The second widely used classification, basing itself on kamma, divides consciousness into four classes:Karunadasa (2010), pp. 83‚Äì90. * Skillful or wholesome (kusala). This refers to those pure and healthy cittas rooted in non-greed (alobha), non-hatred (adosa), and non- delusion (amoha). They are further divided into sub-classes depending on various factors such as the emotions that they are associated with (like joy or equanimity), whether they are associated with knowledge (√±ƒÅ·πáa-sampayutta) or not, and whether they are prompted (by some external influence or one's own deliberation) or unprompted (spontaenous or asankhƒÅrika, i.e. habitual). * Unskillful or unwholesome (akusala), these are always in the sense sphere and are rooted in either greed, hatred or delusion (the three unwholesome roots). They are also further divided into sub-classes depending on various factors, such as the emotions that they are associated with (such as joy, displeasure, equanimity, etc). * Resultant (vipƒÅka), refers strictly to the results of kusala and akusala cittas and are thus neither kusala nor akusala. They are also said to be rootless because they are not rooted in the three unwholesome roots (or the three wholesome roots) since they are merely the results or fruits of karma. * Functional (kiriya) cittas which do not generate karma (have no karmic potency) and are also neither kusala nor akusala. Some are rootless, and these are purely functional elements of the mind. Some are rooted in the three wholesome roots, these types are experienced only by those that have reached liberation. Another classification is that of the ‚Äúbeautiful consciousness‚Äù (sobhana-citta), which \\"is an expression for all types of consciousness other than the twelve unwholesome and the eighteen rootless.\\" They are called beautiful because they are always accompanied by beautiful mental factors (see below).Karunadasa (2010), p. 97. = The cetasikas = A list of cetasikas outlined in the Abhidhammatthasangaha. The mental factors are those mental formations or fabrications (sa·πÖkhƒÅra) which arise conjoined with cittas. There are different classes of these mental events, the main ones are:Karunadasa (2010), pp. 98, 115, 126. * Universals (sabbacittasƒÅdhƒÅra·πáa cetasikas), which are basic and rudimentary cognitive functions \\"common to all types of consciousness\\". They are phassa (contact), vedanƒÅ (feeling), sa√±√±ƒÅ (perception), cetanƒÅ (volition), ekaggatƒÅ (one-pointedness), ar≈´pa- jƒ´vitindriya (psychic life-faculty), and manasikƒÅra (attention). * Occasionals (paki·πá·πáaka cetasikas), \\"ethically variable ‚Äúmiscellaneous‚Äù mental factors found only in particular types of consciousness, not in all.\\" These can be \\"wholesome or unwholesome depending on the kind of consciousness with which it is associated.\\" They are: vitakka (application of thought), vicƒÅra (examination), adhimokkha (decision), viriya (energy), pƒ´ti(rapture) and chanda (desire to act). * Unwholesome (akusala cetasikas). They are accompanied by one or another of the three unwholesome roots. There are fourteen of them: ** Moha - delusion ** Ahirika - lack of shame ** Anottappa - disregard for consequence ** Uddhacca - restlessness ** Lobha - greed ** Di·π≠·π≠hi - wrong view ** MƒÅna - conceit ** Dosa - hatred ** IssƒÅ - envy ** Macchariya - miserliness ** Kukkucca - regret ** Thƒ´na - sloth ** Middha - torpor ** VicikicchƒÅ - doubt * Beautiful (sobhana cetasikas), accompanied by the wholesome roots. ** Nineteen are universal beautiful factors (sobhanasƒÅdhƒÅra·πáa) which occur in all beautiful cittas: *** SaddhƒÅ - faith *** Sati - mindfulness *** Hiri - shame at doing evil *** Ottappa - regard for consequence *** Alobha - lack of greed *** Adosa - lack of hatred *** TatramajjhattatƒÅ - balance, neutrality of mind *** KƒÅyapassaddhi - tranquility of mental body *** Cittapassaddhi - tranquility of consciousness *** KƒÅyalahutƒÅ - lightness of mental body *** CittalahutƒÅ - lightness of consciousness *** KƒÅyamudutƒÅ - malleability/softness of mental body *** CittamudutƒÅ - malleability/softness of consciousness *** KƒÅyakamma√±√±atƒÅ - wieldiness of mental body *** Cittakamma√±√±atƒÅ - wieldiness of consciousness *** KƒÅyapƒÅgu√±√±atƒÅ - proficiency of mental body *** CittapƒÅgu√±√±atƒÅ - proficiency of consciousness *** KƒÅyujukatƒÅ - straightness/rectitude of mental body *** CittujukatƒÅ - straightness/rectitude of consciousness ** The others are those which do not necessarily arise with every beautiful consciousness: *** SammƒÅvƒÅcƒÅ - right speech *** SammƒÅkammanta - right action *** SammƒÅ-ƒÅjƒ´va - right livelihood *** Karu·πáƒÅ - compassion *** Mudita - sympathetic joy *** Pa√±√±ƒÅ - wisdom = The Cognitive Process = The Abhidhamma sees cognition as a continuum of momentary mental events without any enduring substance or self behind the process. This process begins with sensory contact and each momentary event in the mental stream (santƒÅna) is conditioned (paccaya) by the immediately preceding one. These momentary events and their relationships are themselves the mind (citta).Karunadasa (2010), p. 138. The Abhidhamma cognitive process relies on the theory of the bhavanga (\\"ground of becoming\\", \\"condition for existence\\"), an innovation of the TheravƒÅda Abhidhamma. It is a passive, process-free mode of consciousness. According to Rupert Gethin, it is \\"the state in which the mind is said to rest when no active consciousness process is occurring\\", such as that which prevails during deep, dreamless sleep.Gethin, Bhava·πÖga and Rebirth According to the Abhidhamma It is also said to be a process conditioning future rebirth consciousness. It is not an uncaused nor it is an objectless consciousness however, neither is it a substratum, since it must be interrupted for the process of cognition to begin. It is merely what the mind is doing when there it is not engaged in the active mental process of cognition.Karunadasa (2010), p. 140. The six types of cognitive processes (citta-vithi) begin when one of the sense faculties (five senses and the sixth faculty, the mind) is activated by an object (which could be of varying levels of intensity). The basic elements of a full cognitive process (which is said to take 17 \\"mind moments\\") with an intense object of one of the five senses is outlined as follows:Karunadasa (2010), pp. 142-143. * One moment of passive past bhavanga * The bhavanga begins to vibrate due to the impact of the object on the sense door. * The bhavanga is interrupted in one moment. * The \\"five-door adverting consciousness\\" arises, attention moves towards the sense door * A sense consciousness arises, which is mere awareness of the sense object. * According to Karunadasa, the next step are \\"three types of consciousness (citta) performing the functions of receiving (sampaticchana), investigating (santƒ´rana), and determining (votthapana) the object.\\" Each one takes one mind moment. * Next comes the \\"javana\\" (literally: \\"running swiftly\\") stage. This is when the mind \\"'runs swiftly' over the object in the act of apprehending it.\\" This process has cognitive, volitional and affective elements. It is the only part of the cognitive process that can include an act of will (cetana). Unlike the previous events which lasted for just one mind moment, this one is said to last 7 mind moments. * The final stage is one called \\"having the object\\" or registration, it is a process which takes that which has been previously apprehended as its intentional object. This takes two mind moments. Regarding their theory of sense perception and the nature of the cognitive object, the TheravƒÅda Abhidhamma view is a kind of direct realism that says we do perceive external physical objects. According to Karunadasa, the Abhidhamma view is that \\"the object of sensory consciousness is not a mere collection of atoms, but a conglomeration of atoms assembled together in a certain manner.\\"Karunadasa (2010), p. 149. Regarding mind sense cognitive processes, it is similar to the above, but purely mental. It happens when an idea or mental image comes into the range of the mind sense. Ideas can be generated either due to a physical object or\\"naturally\\", i.e. directly generated by the mind.Karunadasa (2010), pp. 150-151.  R≈´pa (matter)  The Abhidhamma Pi·π≠aka there is no formal definition of matter of form (r≈´pa) itself, instead one finds individual definitions for material dhammas which make up material existence. In the commentaries, r≈´pa is defined as that which is mutable or alterable (vikara), in the sense of being able to be ‚Äúdeformed, disturbed, knocked about, oppressed, and broken‚Äù.Karunadasa (2010), p. 152. According to Karunadasa, this is traceable to a sutta passage where the Buddha says: ‚ÄúAnd why, monks, do you say material form (r≈´pa)? It is deformed (ruppati), therefore it is called material form. Deformed by what? Deformed by cold, by heat, by hunger, by thirst, by flies, mosquitoes, wind, sunburn, and creeping things‚Äù. Orthodox TheravƒÅda's position on the nature of the physical (r≈´pa) is that it is one of the two main dependently originated processes of a person (as part of the mind-body complex called nama-r≈´pa). However, there is no dualism between these two, they are merely clusters of interacting processes, each depending on the other.Harvey, Peter; The mind- body relationship in Pali Buddhism: A philosophical investigation, Asian Philosophy, Vol. 3 No. 1 1993, pp. 29‚Äì41 As noted by Buddhaghosa (Vism. 596), each can only occur \\"supported by\\" (nissaya) the other, they are like a blind man that carries a crippled man, or two sheaves of reeds which lean on each other and support each other. In TheravƒÅda Abhidhamma, all matter is resolved into material dhammas. R≈´pa dhammas are all based on the combination and interaction of the four mahabhuta, the four 'primary' or 'elementary' physical phenomena:Karunadasa (2010), pp. 152-153, 164-167. * Earth (prthivi): represents the characteristic of solidity, hardness, heaviness and extension. * Water (ap): represents the characteristic of liquidity, fluidity, oozing, trickling, binding and cohesiveness. * Fire (tejo) represents heat and warmth, when there is the absence of heat, there is \\"cold\\". * Air (vayu) refers to distention and fluctuation, restless and dynamic movement. In the Abhidhamma, the characteristic of the element and the element itself are the same thing, thus hardness is the same as the earth element, which is just a designation for the characteristic of hardness, extension, heaviness, etc. The earth element is also the same as softness or lightness, which is just the lack of hardness or heaviness.Karunadasa (2010), p. 164. In the PƒÅli Abhidhamma, the four primaries began to refer to the irreducible factors or data that make up the physical world. These basic phenomena come together to make up secondary physical phenomena, such as the sense organs. Thus, according to Y Karunadasa, PƒÅli Buddhism does not deny the existence of the external world and thus is a kind of realism. However, TheravƒÅda also follows the view that r≈´pa, like all skandhas, is void (su√±√±a), empty (ritta) and essence-less (asara).Karunadasa, Y. Buddhist Analysis of Matter, p. 169. R≈´pa dhammas are not atomic ontological substances and are merely outlined as pragmatic descriptions of the world of experience.Karunadasa, Y. Buddhist Analysis of Matter, pp. 14, 172; \\"If we base ourselves on the Pali Nikayas, then we should be compelled to conclude that Buddhism is realistic. There is no explicit denial anywhere of the external world. Nor is there any positive evidence to show that the world is mind-made or simply a projection of subjective thoughts. That Buddhism recognizes the extra-mental existence of matter and the external world is clearly suggested by the texts. Throughout the discourses it is the language of realism that one encounters. The whole Buddhist practical doctrine and discipline, which has the attainment of Nibbana as its final goal, is based on the recognition of the material world and the conscious living beings living therein.\\" According to Karunadasa, this steers a middle course between the view that \\"all is an absolute unity\\" (sabbam ekattam) and that it is absolute separateness (sabbam puthuttam).Karunadasa, Y. Buddhist Analysis of Matter, p. 175. While material dhammas are often spoken about as distinct individual entities, this is only for the purpose of conventional description, since they always exist in a state of association and relationship with other material dhammas. They always arise together, and are always dependent on each other. All instances of matter thus includes all four primary elements, just in different intensities (ussada) or capabilities (samatthiya).Karunadasa (2010), pp. 168‚Äì169. The smallest unit of matter, called a kalapa (literally ‚Äòpackage‚Äô), is a collection or cluster of material dhammas.Ronkin, Noa; Early Buddhist Metaphysics, p. 58. The term kalapa only became standard in the sub- commentarial literature and it is not a singular particle, but a collection of rupa-dhammas which are inseparable from each other and always occur simultaneously (sahajata). The Abhidhamma lists 27 material dhammas, besides the four primary dhammas, there are various other derived or secondary dhammas (upƒÅdƒÅ-r≈´pa) that are conditioned and supported by the primary material dhammas.Karunadasa (2010), p. 161. These include the five sense organs, the sense elements (like sound, smell, etc), the space element, the material faculty of vitality (r≈´pa-jƒ´vitindriya) and the four phases of matter: production, continuity, decay and impermanence of matter (aniccatƒÅ).Karunadasa (2010), p. 154. Most of these (such as the four phases and space) are actually only knowable by the mind faculty (manƒÅyatana), through a process of inference.Karunadasa (2010), p. 155. The main difference between the four primary dhammas and the derived dhammas is that the primaries only arise in dependence on each other, while derived matter arises in dependence on the four primaries.Karunadasa (2010), p. 162.  Space and Time  According to Karunadasa: > \\"On the subject of time the Abhidhamma Pitaka is relatively silent, perhaps > because here time is not assigned the status of a dhamma. If time is not a > dhamma, conditioned or unconditioned, this obviously means that it is a > mental construct with no objective reality.\\"Karunadasa (2010), p. 224. Thus, in the TheravƒÅda Abhidhamma, time is mainly a conceptual construct, specifically it is a concept-as-name (nƒÅma-pa√±√±atti) and does not exist in a real sense since it is a notion based on the continuous flow of phenomena. Time is just a conceptual construction, a mental interpretation, based on the production, change and dissolution of dhammas. Time has no own-nature (sabhƒÅvato avijjamƒÅna), unlike dhammas.Karunadasa (2010), p. 226. The same is also true of space (ƒÅkasa) which is described as a nominal (anipphanna) existent, which strictly speaking it is not material, nor an actual dhamma, but is simply the absence of matter.Karunadasa (2010), pp. 230, 233. In this, they disagree with the SarvƒÅstivƒÅda-VaibhƒÅ·π£ika school which held that space is an unconditioned dhamma.Karunadasa (2010), p. 232. On the philosophy of time, the TheravƒÅda tradition holds to philosophical presentism, the view that only present moment dhammas exist, against the eternalist view of the SarvƒÅstivƒÅdin tradition which held that dhammas exist in all three times ‚Äì past, present, future.K. L. Dhammajoti, SarvƒÅstivƒÅda Abhidharma, p. 66 = Theory of moments = The early TheravƒÅdins who compiled the KathƒÅvatthu rejected the doctrine of momentariness (Skt: k·π£ƒÅ·πáavƒÅda, PƒÅli: khƒÅ·πáavƒÅda) upheld by other Buddhist Abhidharma schools like the SarvƒÅstivƒÅda. This theory held that all dhammas lasted for a \\"moment\\", which for them meant an atomistic unit of time, that is the shortest possible time interval.Ronkin, Noa, Early Buddhist Metaphysics: The Making of a Philosophical Tradition (Routledge curzon Critical Studies in Buddhism) 2011, p. 62. The idea that the temporal extension of all dhammas lasts only for a miniscule \\"moment\\" is also not found in the suttas.Karunadasa (2010), p. 234. According to Noa Ronkin, early TheravƒÅdins (in the Abhidhamma Pitaka) did use the term \\"moment\\" (khƒÅ·πáa) as a simple expression for a \\"short while\\", \\"the dimension of which is not fixed but may be determined by the context\\". In the Khanikakatha of the Kathavatthu, the TheravƒÅdins argue that \\"only mental phenomena are momentary, whereas material phenomena endure for a stretch of time\\". This was against the view of other schools like the SarvƒÅstivƒÅda, which held that both material and mental dhammas are equally momentary. The Kathavatthu also argues against the idea that a mental state could last for a long period of time (and thus, not be momentary). This view was defended by some Buddhist schools, like the Andhakas, which apparently held that a single unit of consciousness could last for as long as a day (referring particularly to a deep state of meditation).Karunadasa (2010), pp. 236‚Äì237. Thus, the idea of a \\"moment\\" does appear in the Abhidhamma Pitaka, but not widely. Out of these early ideas, the later commentarial TheravƒÅda developed a more technical formal theory of moments, which held that each consciousness has three moments, the moment of origination (uppƒÅdakkha≈Üa), the moment of duration (thitikkha≈Üa), and the moment of dissolution (bhahgakkha≈Üa).Karunadasa (2010), pp. 238‚Äì239. These moments correspond with the three characteristics of the conditioned: jati (birth), decay (jarata) and bheda (dissolution).Karunadasa (2010), pp. 249‚Äì250. The commentaries explain the changing nature of a dhamma by stating that they have definite temporal boundaries (its origination and cessation). Therefore, a dhamma is a momentary phenomenon that arises, exists for one moment, and totally disappears in the next. According to Karunadasa, \\"the sub-commentary to the Visuddhimagga defines viparinƒÅma (change) as sabhƒÅva-vigamana, that is, as the disappearance of own-nature.\\"Karunadasa (2010), p. 252. As has been noted above, in TheravƒÅda, material dhammas last longer than mental ones. Karunadasa explains: > Thus, in introducing the doctrine of momentariness the Visuddhimagga says > that the cessation of matter is slow (dandha-nirodha) and its transformation > is ponderous (garu-parivatta), while the cessation of mind is swift > (lahuparivatta) and its transformation is quick (khippa-nirodha). > Accordingly the duration of matter in relation to mind is calculated to show > that during one moment of matter seventeen mind-moments arise and cease. The > moments of arising and ceasing are temporally equal for both mental and > material dhammas. But in the case of material dhammas the moment of presence > is longer.Karunadasa (2010), p. 259.  Conditional relations  Aside from the analysis of dhammas, the other main element of the TheravƒÅda Abhidhamma is the study of how dhammas come together in a synthesis (sangaha) to form an interdependent web of relationships. This is presented in a theory of the various conditional relations that exist between the various dhammas which is presented in the last (seventh) book of the Abhidhamma Pi·π≠aka, the Pa·π≠·π≠hƒÅna.Karunadasa (2010), p. 262. The main goal of this theory of conditionality remains the explanation of the samsaric process of how suffering arises. According to TheravƒÅda Buddhism, no temporal beginning is discernable and thus, the Abhidhamma doctrine of conditionality \\"dissociates itself from all cosmological causal theories which seek to trace the absolute origin of the world-process from some kind of uncaused trans- empirical reality.\\"Karunadasa (2010), p. 263. TheravƒÅda Abhidhamma considers three key axioms of conditionality: * Everything arises due to causes and conditions, nothing arises without a cause. * Nothing arises from a single cause (this rules out monism or monotheism). * No phenomenon arises by itself as a single or solitary thing. According to Karunadasa, this leads to the core Abhidhamma understanding of causality, which can be summarized as follows: \\"from a plurality of causes a plurality of effects takes place...a multiplicity of dhammas brings about a multiplicity of other dhammas.\\" Thus, dhammas always arise in clusters, for example, every instance of consciousness always arises together with at least seven mental factors: contact (phassa), feeling (vedanƒÅ), perception (sannƒÅ), volition (cetanƒÅ), one-pointedness (ekaggatƒÅ), psychic life (arupa-jivitindriya), and attention (manasikƒÅra). Likewise, every basic unit of matter is a cluster of eight material factors.Karunadasa (2010), p. 264. Another important principle in the TheravƒÅda Abhidhamma is that dhammas do not exist or arise through their own power, they are devoid of own-power or own-sway. This is a rejection of the principle of self-causation Likewise, no dhamma can be brought into being by a power external to the dhammas either. These two rejections means that dhammas arise only by the help of other dhammas. The TheravƒÅda Abhidhamma teaches that there are twenty four kinds of conditional relation. There are three main factors involved in any relationship between dhammas: that dhamma which is doing the conditioning (paccaya-dhamma), that which is being conditioned (paccayuppanna-dhamma) and the conditioning force (paccaya-satti), which is really not different from the dhamma doing the conditioning (however, a dhamma can have more than one conditioning force).Karunadasa (2010), pp. 264‚Äì265. A conditioned is defined as \\"a dhamma which is helpful (upakƒÅraka) for the origination (uppatti) or existence (thiti) of another dhamma related to it. This means that when a particular dhamma is activating as a condition, it will cause other dhammas connected to it, to arise, or if they have already arisen, it will maintain them in existence.\\" Notably, there are no conditions for the cessation of a dhamma, only for their origination and maintenance.Karunadasa (2010), p. 265.  Spiritual practice and progress  The most influential presentation of the TheravƒÅda Abhidhamma path to liberation is found in the Visuddhimagga ('Path of Purification') of Buddhagho·π£a.PV Bapat. Vimuttimagga & Visuddhimagga ‚Äì A Comparative Study, lvii The Visuddhimagga doctrine includes several interpretations not found in the earliest discourses (suttas).Kalupahana, David J. (1994), A history of Buddhist philosophy, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass Publishers Private Limited The text uses meditation on kasina (colored disks) as the key practice from which it models the entrance into jhana. Kasina a kind of focusing meditation which is not widely found in the earlier suttas.Bhikkhu Thanissaro, Concentration and Discernment The Visuddhimagga also describes the four jhanas and the four immaterial states in detail. It also describes forty meditation subjects (kamma·π≠·π≠hƒÅna) and advises that one should ask a knowledgeable person to figure out which meditation suits one's temperament.Sarah Shaw, Buddhist meditation: an anthology of texts from the PƒÅli canon. Routledge, 2006, pp. 6‚Äì8. A Jataka tale gives a list of 38 of them. . The Visuddhimagga analyzes the practice of the Buddhist path as divided into three main aspects: Sƒ´la (ethics or discipline); 2) SamƒÅdhi (concentration achieved through meditation); 3) Pa√±√±a (spiritual understanding, wisdom). It also gives a more extended overview of the path to liberation, which is divided into seven major stages which are called the \\"Seven Stages of Purification\\" (satta-visuddhi).Gunaratana, Henepola (1994). The Path of Serenity and Insight, pp. 143‚Äì174. Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass Publishers Private Limited These stages are based on the Rathavinita Sutta (\\"Relay Chariots Discourse,\\" MN 24).Shankman, Richard (2008). The Experience of Samadhi: An In-depth Exploration of Buddhist Meditation, p. 53. Shambhala The section on wisdom also provides an indepth overview of the process of vipassanƒÅ (\\"insight\\", \\"clear-seeing\\") meditation, and its progressive stages or \\"progress of insight\\" (visuddhi√±ana-katha). This progress is explained through a total of sixteen stages of insight or knowledge, called the vipassanƒÅ-√±ƒÅ·πáas.Mahasi Sayadaw; Nyanaponika Thera (1994).

History The Banu Nu'aym was the dominant tribe among the 1,122 Bedouin households in the Lajat lava field of the Hauran in the 16th century.Bakhit 1972, p. 227. They also accounted for 51 and 120 households in the nahiya (subdistrict) of al-Hula in 1523 and 1543, respectively.Bakhit 1972, p. 229. The Banu Nu'aym were also the second largest Arab tribe in the Beqaa Valley in 1551, accounting for 76 households.Bakhit 1972, pp. 230‚Äì231.

At present, the Banu Nu'aym have largely urbanized and are one the four largest tribal groups in the governorates of Daraa and Quneitra in southern Syria. The three other largest tribal groups in the region, the Zu'bi, Hariri and Rifa'i (the first two are large than the Banu Nu'aym) are generally considered to have originally stemmed from the Banu Nu'aym, though members of the Zu'bi and Hariri tribes are doubtful of the association. At the onset of the Syrian Civil War in 2011, the Banu Nu'aym predominated in the towns and villages of northwestern Daraa Governorate, namely the area between Shaykh Maskin and Nawa and Jasim in the Izra District and the north-central part of al-Sanamayn District, as well the abutting Quneitra Governorate to the west. During the civil war, the supreme commander of the Free Syrian Army's Southern Front, Brigadier-General Abdel-Illah al-Bashir, Colonel Abdo Na'imeh, belonged to the tribe.

It was released in May 2020 for Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux, and is described as \\"a short game about sharply dressed demon girls.\\"  Plot  The plot follows a man named the Helltaker, who has a dream in which he has a harem of demon girls. Waking up, he decides to journey down into Hell to make his dream come true. He convinces the girls to join him throughout the events of the game, and after succeeding, although it is stated his time with them will be short and painful, he decides that he still enjoys it.  Gameplay  The player proceeds through a series of puzzle stages with the end goal of reaching a demon girl, answering her question appropriately, and incorporating her into the player's demon harem. Each puzzle stage involves pushing stones and skeleton soldiers around a two-dimensional top-down grid akin to Sokoban while keeping within a set turn limit, while also avoiding spike traps and collecting key items. After reaching the goal, the demon girl for that particular stage will ask a question in which the player must infer the correct answer based on her personality, and an incorrect answer may result in a bad ending such as death, taking the player back to the beginning of the stage. The final boss level (featuring the demon Judgement, the High Prosecutor) includes phased bullet hell-like mechanics with chains across the screen.  Development  ≈Åukasz Piskorz, known on Twitter as \\"vanripper\\", developed the entirety of the game by himself over an estimated one-year period and was the game's artistic director. According to Piskorz, Helltaker is somewhat reminiscent of the Leisure Suit Larry video game series, as the main characters of both games have characteristics reminiscent of each other. The game can be played for free, and an art book and the recipe for the pancakes that appear in the game are sold separately. Although the video game is only officially available in English, Piskorz has supported the translations made by the community, explaining how to make them and making one in Polish himself.

Biography  Tsyrkunov was born on March 28, 1948 in a large family of farmers in the village of Liasa≈Ñ, ≈Ωlobin district, Gomel region, Belarus. He grew up in orphanages Dziamjanki, Dobru≈° district; Pireviƒçy, ≈Ωlobin district; and Vietka. He started painting under influence of Siarhiej Harobƒçanka and Chviedar ≈†klara≈≠. In 1964-67, Tsyrkunov studied and worked in the Petro-Donetsk mine in the Luhansk region of Ukraine. At the same time, he joined a distance course at the Krupskaya People's University of Arts in Moscow. In 1967-69, Tsyrkunov was conscripted for military service. Tsyrkunov developed his painting skills in Anatol Barano≈≠ski's studio. In 1970-76, he studied at the Belarusian State Institute of Figurative and Theater Arts (currently - the Belarusian State Academy of Arts) where among his teachers were such artists as Chaim Li≈≠≈°yc, Barys Arakƒçeje≈≠, Mai Dantsig and Piotr Krochale≈≠. He started participating in exhibitions in 1975. In 1983, he joined the Union of Belarusian Artists. He was a member of the Niamiha group of artists which he left to co-found the Pahonia association. In 1979-82, Tsyrkunov taught drawing and painting at the Belarusian Polytechnic Institute, and in 1983-84 - at a specilist art school (school no. 75) in Minsk.  Works  Predominantly, Tsyrkunov works in oil painting, mainly in portrait, historical and landscape genres, and still life. His earlier works leaned towards rigorous style. Later, Tsyrkunov has moved to a symbolic-realistic style, which shows the clear aesthetics of formal painting with characteristic colour dynamic. The artist likes painting portraits, often - of the outstanding Belarusian personalities. This work is characterised by a combination of spiritual and character-typological features. The created images are devoid of a literary plot, they are perceived on the level of sincere and light personal emotion, of intuitive spirit and creative genius. Many his works are dedicated to history and the present day of Belarus, including the Second World War and Chernobyl tragedy. A number of Tsyrkunov's solo and group art exhibitions have taken place in Belarus, Lithuania, Latvia, Russia, Ukraine and more. His works have been acqyuired by the Belarusian National Arts Museum, Belarusian Museum of Modern Arts, Belarusian National History Museum, Belarusia≈Ñn Great Patriotic War Museum, Mahilio≈≠ Arts Museum, Hrodna State Historical Archaeological Museum, Polack Museum of Local Lore, Vietka Museum of Folk Art, ≈Ωlobin Museum of History and Local Lore, Pastavy Regional Museum of Local Lore; for private collections in Belarus, Russia, Italy, Poland, Ukraine and more. Since 1998, alongside painting, Tsyrkunov has started practicisn sculpture. Since 2000, he has produced a number of monumental and memorial works dedicated to historical events and distinguished personalities in Belarus, for example: a monument to Florian Danowski, a participant of the 1863-64 uprising, near the Kaniabiƒçy village (2002); a commemorative cross of Rev Vincent Hadle≈≠ski in Trostyanets Tract, later reinstalled near St. Roch Church in Minsk (2009); and others. Some of them were created in collaboration with other artists.

Life Sati-un-Nissa was born in the Mazandaran province of Persia in a family of scholars and doctors. Taleb Amoli was her younger brother, while her maternal uncle was chief physician to the Safavid Shah Tahmasp I. Little is known of her early life in Iran. She was likely born in or before 1580 as she is known to be older than Taleb whose birth is given around that year. Her brother had made his way to India, eventually becoming Emperor Jahangir's poet laureate (malek al-≈°o øarƒÅ) in 1619. On his death in 1626 or 1627, Sati-un-Nissa adopted his two young daughters and brought them up as her own. There is a letter from Taleb to Jahangir asking permission to welcome his sister to India. Upon her husband Nasira's death in India, she joined the service of Mumtaz Mahal, the empress of Shah Jahan. With her knowledge of medicine and courtly etiquette, she was promoted to the head of the Empress' establishment, and named muhr- dar, the bearer of her seal. She was a tutor to Jahanara Begum, Mumtaz's daughter, whom she taught the Persian language. Under her tutelage, Jahanara became a respected poet. Sati-un-Nissa was an acclaimed reciter and teacher of Quran recitation. Sati-un-Nissa was appointed as Sadr-i-Nath, an officer in charge of grants to the needy, by Shah Jahan. In particular, she was responsible for the disbursement of support to indigent women, especially unwed virgins who needed dowry for marriage, and to answer petitions by widows, scholars and theologians. As mahaldar (or chief matron), she was expected to be the Emperor's eyes and ears in the imperial harem. She would read to him the reports received from the public (waqia-nawis) and private (khufyan-nawis) news writers, and respond to them on his dictation. At Mumtaz Mahal's death during childbirth in 1631, Sati-un-Nissa escorted her body to Agra for burial. It is reported that Shah Jahan, bereft with grief, was unable to look on his newborn daughter, Gauhar Ara, who was then raised by Sati-un- Nissa. Jahanara became the female head of the imperial family. As her chief assistant, Sati-un-Nissa was expected to convey presents to the brides of the royal princes. Returning with the gifts from the brides' families, she organised displays of the amassed gifts in public exhibitions at Agra Fort. Her younger daughter died from complications following childbirth. A broken- hearted Sati-un-Nissa did not recover from this grief, and died a few days later in Lahore on 23 January 1647. Shah Jahan ordered Rupees 10,000 to be spent on her funeral. A year later, her body was moved to Agra to be interred in a tomb built especially for her, near the outer quadrangle of the Taj Mahal. The tomb is extant today, east of the Fatehpuri Mosque and southwest of the Taj's forecourt. In popular culture Nina Epton's novel Beloved Empress, Mumtaz Mahal is written from the point of view of Sati-un-Nissa. She also appears in Kathryn Lasky's Jahanara, Princess of Princesses.

She learned piano at church, and received her first piano at age 16. When her parents divorced, Landis moved with her mother to Texas, and she dropped out of high school before her senior year. She began performing open mic shows, while also learning music production with the digital audio workstation Reason. She began shadowing at a studio after someone found her at an open mic show and wanted to record some of her material. Through a friend, Landis found out about an available part of a play in Los Angeles. She won the part and performed in the play for 13 weeks. She then began writing for other artists, but decided to write songs for herself, stating: \\"That was the number one thing I found: All these people would come in and they had a great voice or something about them was special, but they had nothing to say. I was like 'I'm not doing this anymore. If I'm going to write these songs 100%, I might as well just release them. These people don't care what they're saying.'\\" After turning down offers from studios and record labels, Landis began working on her debut extended play, Memories Speak, released in 2012. Landis signed to Epic Records two months after Memories Speak was released. Landis was then discovered by Chicago-based blog Fake Shore Drive, which in turn led Chicago producer J. Hill to sample the Memories Speak song \\"Someone Like You\\" in an instrumental; the instrumental was subsequently used for a Mac Miller song of the same name, and was featured on Miller's second studio album, Watching Movies with the Sound Off (2013).

The group was originally formed by Jesper Dahl (\\"Jokeren\\"), Nicholas Kvaran (\\"Coldhands\\"), Rasmus Berg (\\"B\\"), and Lasse Bavngaard (\\"\\").  History  From 1992 until 1995 the group performed in Los Angeles under the name Madness 4 Real, where they worked as freelance producers for Solid Productions. The manager of Solid Productions, Carsten Willer, swindled the group and they made no financial gains during their stay in California. They produced songs for names such as Eazy-E, MC Ren, Rakim, Ice Cube, MC Clemens, and Outlandish. During their stay in the United States, they released 33 tracks in total, including four remixes on various records. Several of these releases have received American gold, platinum, and double platinum awards. Lasse Bavngaard, who performs under the stage name Bl√¶s Bukki, left Madness 4 Real to join Malk de Koijn. The group returned to Denmark in 1996 under the name Den Gale Pose. Their first album, Mod Rov, was released that same year. In 1998 they released the album S√•dan Er Reglerne, which sold over 38,000 copies. The album contained the track \\"Sp√¶ndt Op Til Lir,\\" which contained a sample from the song \\"Music & Lights\\" by Imagination. Though the group informed Warner Music Group that they had sampled from the song, they did not get it cleared with the record label, and the group has never made money on their song because of it. Three years later, in 2001 their third album Definitionen af en stodder was released. In 2002 the group stopped working together. Jesper Dahl emerged as a solo artist performing under the name Jokeren. Jesper Dahl (Jokeren), February 2013 On March 3, 2011, Den Gale Pose announced that the group had gotten back together again on Go' Morgen Danmark. They gave a performance at Copenhagen Central Station in collaboration with the vocalist Szhirley. Rasmus Berg, also known as Rasmus B, died November 6, 2018, from cancer. The two remaining members of the group, Jesper Dahl and Nicholas Kvaran, released the song \\"Indtil vi ses igen\\" as a tribute. It was the first time the group had released new music since they had reunited in 2011.

It derives from the fifth line of a sestet which appears on the title page of the anthology only. Compiled by Jean-Louis Chevalier from Welch's papers held at the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin, and published by the Enitharmon Press, the anthology contains 58 poems, none of which had appeared in print before. As such, it is the last wholly new volume of Welch's writing to be issued to date. Background Welch had written poetry since childhood, but had an abiding sense of doubt as to his skill. In September 1938 he mentioned to his friend Maurice Cranston that he had some which he would like to get typed; according to Cranston this was the first inkling he ever had that Welch regarded himself as a poet.Cranston, Maurice (1951) Readers News, Vol. 14, No. 5, p. 4 Nonetheless, his first ever published work was a poem, and during his lifetime nineteen appeared in variousThe range and frequency of his poetry's appearance would seem to belie Welch's fairly low opinion of his work. During his lifetime they appeared in Abinger Chronicle, Decachord, Poetry Quarterly, Kingdom Come, The Spectator, Opus, Modern Reading, Wartime Harvest, The Adelphi, Life and Letters, Dint, Phoenix Quarterly and Orion. journals and magazines. Despite this modest success, he noted in his journal, \\"I keep on wondering if I'm producing semi-demi A. E. Housman. I should hate this, although he is a lovely poet.\\"De-la-Noy, Michael (1984a) The Journals of Denton Welch, Harmondsworth: Penguin Books, , p. 91 He also wrote to the poet Henry Treece in 1943 that he felt that something was 'wrong' with his poetry but could not identify what.Quoted in De-la-Noy, Michael (1984b) Denton Welch: The Making of a Writer, Harmondsworth: Viking , p. 157 He confessed to Treece that: > I just want to do it; and consequently what comes out of me will probably be > rather shapeless, rather sexy and probably rather trite.De-la-Noy (1984b) His concerns were echoed by both Cranston (who stated that Welch \\"was not the poet he wished to be\\",Cranston, Maurice (1952) \\"Denton Welch\\", in Spectator Harvest, ed. Wilson Harris, London: Hamish Hamilton, p. 75) and Jocelyn Brooke, who edited the first edition of The Denton Welch Journals in 1952. After Welch's death, two further poems appeared in an edition of Penguin New Writing in 1950, and sixty-seven were included in A Last Sheaf (1951). This collection included all but six of Welch's previously-published poems. Welch also included poems in his journals, and these were reproduced in the Brooke edition of the Journals.These were not included in the 1984 edition. It was not until the early 1970s that Jean-Louis Chevalier uncovered almost a thousand short poems in the Ransom archive, the majority of which were contained in seven dated notebooks (dating from 1940 to 1948), and he set about having some of them published. One poem, \\"The Needled Worm\\" - unusually for Welch in blank verse - appeared in Words Broadsheet No. 11, published privately in 1975 as part of a sequence of seven Welch issues.\\"The Needled Worm\\" does not appear in this collection. Words Broadsheet 11 (1975, Bramley, Surrey: Words Press) seems to be its only appearance in print anywhere. The sequence of broadsheets focusing on Welch are numbers 9 and 11-16, the last issue comprising an afterword by Chevalier. Content Dumb Instrument appeared the year after the Words series, containing fifty-nineFifty-eight in the body of the text and one on the title page. further short poems. According to Chevalier, many of the poems \\"are concerned with mortality: Welch was a condemned man and he knew it from his early twenties.\\"Chevalier, Jean-Louis (1976) Introduction to Dumb Instrument, London: Enitharmon Press. , p. ix. Chevalier's stated criteria for selecting the poems include: clearly completed works rather than unfinished, those not \\"privately personal\\" Chevalier (1976), p. ix. and those which are not in some way a repetition of another. Chevalier does point out, as others have done, that Welch's \\"virtuosity\\", so evident in prose, sometimes appears \\"unsteadily so\\"Chevalier (1976), p. viii His ability to structure a piece, never a strength in his prose, is all the more exposed here, and his deployment of striking imagery is sometimes hobbled by clich√©: > Dark heron pass > Across the sky > And never think > Or reason whyWelch, Denton (1976) \\"Hard wrapt day\\" in Dumb Instrument, > London: Enitharmon Press. , p. 28-9 Generally, Welch does not use titles, and Chevalier admits to being unclear as to whether some apparent titles, sometimes inserted at the end of a poem, are indeed titles, epigraphs or even the beginning of an unfinished stanza.Chevalier (1976), p. 56n42 As with his prose, Welch's poetry is highly solipsistic, with his disability often to the fore, matched by an strong sense of isolation. > O I lie here > On my bed in the dark > And out beyond > The lights are burning > Lights on the road > Across the fields > Speeding on and never returning > Welch (1976), p. 30 Another feature of Welch's poems, almost absent from his prose, is a sense of the ongoing war. It features either implicitly, and often contrasted to his own personal circumstances, as in \\"Evil lives in men's hearts\\"Welch (1976), p. 22 or as a backdrop to his experiences in the Kent countryside, in \\"Mushroom heart\\": > I was all alone > In the fields > By the concrete pill-box > House where no fighting > Was ever doneWelch (1976), p. 32 One of the longest, and perhaps one of the most ambitious poems in the collection is \\"The Fear and the Monkey\\", dated Monday 24 February 1947, just under two years before his death. In the long (for Welch) 23-stanza poem, he conceives of his spirit as a monkey-cum-pug dog, which he keeps as \\"a secret in my jacket\\". It co-exists happily with Welch's physical being, and revels in his active life (\\"He was my doll, my manikin\\"). When ill-health sets in, the creature turns on him, devouring him from the inside out, before abandoning him. (\\"He never paused, he never turned / Cold, cold now where his claws had burned\\")Welch (1976), pp. 36-7 Welch's biographer, James Methuen-Campbell, quotes the poem in full, identifying the yawning chasm between Welch's physical and mental condition: his full, horrifying comprehension of the progressive deterioration of his body and what it would ultimately mean.Methuen-Campbell, James (2002) Denton Welch: Writer and Artist, Carlton- in-Coverdale: Tartarus Press , p.184 Chevalier identifies that this poem had two further suppressed stanzas, perhaps indicating that Welch harboured even bigger ambitions for it, already exceeding in length as it does any of his other surviving poetry. A final, incomplete stanza reads: > (And) I was left forever to watch the stones > To feel the turning of the bones > Under [...] > Oh all was wasted, all was gone.Welch (1976), p.56n42 Dumb Instrument is illustrated with a number of Welch's 'decorations' taken from his poetry notebooks, including the cover from the notebook dated 1943 (frontispiece) and an unidentified full-page illustration as a tailpiece bearing the legend 'The End' surrounded by familiar, if bleakly rendered, Welch motifs (shells, shrouded figures, mythical beasts). 660 copies of the book were published in 1976, the first 60 being specially bound and numbered. Unusually for such a limited print run, some of the copies were clothbound and some were issued in card covers. Critical Response The low print run, and the scarcity in print of Welch's other work at the time meant that reviews were similarly few in number. In The Times Literary Supplement, George Sutherland Fraser identified two features missing from Welch's poetry generally: any sense of \\"impersonal structure\\", and the effects of Welch's apparent reticence to ask for others' opinions. But as a consequence of these very absences, Fraser found \\"a quite unusual intimacy with his own joy and pain.\\"The Times Literary Supplement, 30 December 1977, p. 14 Fraser hoped the collection would see a re-publication of Welch's prose, but it would be almost a decade before most of his output was before the book-buying public again.

Studies have continuously shown that while pediatric cancer survival rates have gone up, the survival rate for adolescents and young adults has remained stagnant. While many clinical trials exist for adults with cancer and children with cancer, AYAs underutilize clinical trials. Most pediatric clinical trials serve patients up to age 21. Additionally, AYAs face problems that adults and children rarely see including college concerns, fertility, and sense of aloneness. Studies have often shown that treating young adults with the same protocols used in pediatrics is more effective than adult oriented treatments. In countries like the US and the UK, specialized AYA units have started to be built in children's and adult hospitals to cater to the need of these age groups. AYA wards are designed to be bright and welcoming with many games and televisions to keep patients busy. The need for these spaces come from the findings that AYAs tend to prefer pediatric wards over adult wards, but do not like to be treated like children. AYA teams are usually made up of specialists that specialize in both pediatric and adult medicine.  United States  Internationally, different countries tend to treat the AYA age group in different environments. Most AYA treatment centers in the US are within larger children's hospitals. The organization, Teen Cancer America was created to establish more AYA wards in hospitals across the US, and currently there are about 21 hospitals affiliated with Teen Cancer America, and many more with AYA programs. The American Academy of Pediatrics' opinion is that children should be under the care of a pediatrician until they deem not necessary, and children's hospitals in the US are increasingly treating older patients well into their twenties as a part of AYA and other adult programs.  United Kingdom  The UK is seen to be one of the pioneers of AYA cancer care at its hospitals. Teenage Cancer Trust is a cancer care and support charity in the UK that exists to improve the cancer experience of young people aged 13‚Äì24. Founded in 1990, the charity's key service is providing specialist teenage units in NHS hospitals. It also trains and funds staff who are teenage cancer specialists. The units are dedicated areas for teenage and young adult patients, who are involved in their concept and creation. Medical facilities on the units are equipped with computers, TVs, game consoles, and bright colored design. The UK has over 28 units in children's hospitals and adult hospitals dedicated to AYAs aged 13‚Äì24.

Description  The Zacapu acocil is a species morphologically very similar to the Chapala acocil (Cambarellus chapalanus). Males of C. zacapuensis have an average length of 26 millimeters, with a 12 millimeters long and 5.5 millimeters wide cephalothorax, while females have an average length of 32 millimeters, with a 14.5 millimeters long and 7 millimeters wide cephalothorax. C. zacapuensis has a pigmented body, well- developed eyes, and a rostrum with marginal spines. Its shell lacks a cervical spine or a branchial spine.  Conservation status and habitat  The Zacapu acocil is found mainly in Zacapu Lagoon and in some of its drains such as the Angulo River. It is usually found at a shallow depth, between submerged roots and in the aquatic substrate. The introduction of invasive species such as common carp and grass carp pose a threat to the Cambarellus zacapuensis population, as has happened to other species of the Cambarellus genus elsewhere. The exploitation of the water resources of their habitat by human action also represents a threat to the small crustacean, which is why it could be considered endangered under IUCN criteria.

Life  Vogel was born in Zwickau (Saxony) was born and grew up as the son of the dentist Helmut Vogel and his wife Lisa, n√©e Leupold, in Hartenstein in the Erzgebirge. From 1966 to 1970 he visited the Extended Secondary School. (EOS) in Aue in Saxony, where he simultaneously completed vocational training as a lathe operator in the Blema company. After Abitur in 1970, even before taking up his studies of Art history and at the Humboldt- Universit√§t zu Berlin, he did (HUB) will complete eighteen months of basic military service as part of compulsory military service. In 1976 he completed his studies with the professors Peter H. Feist and Harald Olbrich with the diploma.  Professional activity  Vogel started his career as a research assistant at the Centre for Art Exhibitions of the GDR-Neue Berliner Galerie (ZfK) in the Altes Museum in Berlin, where he co-curated about 35 international art exhibitions, which were realized in Berlin and other cities of the GDR within the framework of cultural agreements of the GDR with other states. They provided him with practical experience in the exhibition business and gave him insight into a diverse spectrum of artistic work from antiquity. (e.g. gold treasure of the Thracians) up to the international contemporary art (e.g. Denmark). He was confronted with almost all art genres and art epochs, which ensured his openness and interest in art phenomena of all kinds. At the same time he gave guest lectures on Old Dutch painting at the HUB, so as not to lose the connection to research and teaching during his practical work in the exhibition field. From 1979 to 1982 Vogel graduated from the Ernst-Moritz- Arndt-University Greifswald (EMAU) a Aspirantur, which he completed with a doctorate to pursue a university career at this university. Through the research focus on the \\"Art of Romanticism\\" set here by his doctoral mother Hannelore G√§rtner, Vogel was involved in this specialisation from his time as an assistant. He took part in the III to VI International Greifswald Romanticism Conference with corresponding research topics. A research stay at the Vrije Universiteit (Amsterdam) with Professor Ilja Veldman offered him the prerequisites for his habilitation. (1989) \\"The dream of Batavian Arcadia.

Since 1994 he has revived the tradition of the \\"International Greifswald Romantic Conferences\\" to further research the history of art at the University of Greifswald and thus organized the VI. to XII. Romanticism Conference, for which he also edited the scientific conference volumes. Gradually he was able to establish an extensive network of international research, with which he realised various publication projects at home and abroad.

This led him to many international congresses in France, Japan, China, Brazil, Finland, Czech Republic, Latvia, Turkey and Great Britain. A six-week travel grant from the Kachima Foundation to Japan also enabled him to conduct comparative research on garden design, which has resulted in numerous publications. After the expiry of his temporary contract with EMAU, Vogel went to the Estonian Academy of Arts in 1999 and 2001 as Guest Professor for one semester at a time to Tallinn. In the meantime, he has organised various art exhibitions with the museums in Zwickau, Jena, Greifswald, G√ºstrow, Cottbus, Pozna≈Ñ, etc. During research stays in the Strang Print Room of the \\"University College\\" in London, in the Witt Library of the Courtauld Institute of Art , in the Department for Illuminated Manuscripts at the British Library and in the Natural History Museum. In London he extended and deepened his international scientific experience. In 2005 he was offered the Department Design at the Zurich University of the Arts (ZHdK) to develop an independent course in the theory and history of scientific illustration for the course Scientific Visualization, which he ran until his retirement in 2016. At the same time he has since then been active in Germany as a freelance art historian and works as curator of exhibitions, as organizer of the Zurich Symposia on Scientific Illustration and the International Symposia on Art as well as a publicist of numerous publications on art history.  Main areas of research  Vogel concentrated his extensive research activities in particular on the following areas: * Art of the Enlightenment and Romanticism in Europe * Garden art * Regional art history of Saxony, Pomerania and Estonia * Poster art * History and aesthetics of scientific illustration * Phenomena of international cultural exchange (especially with the Far and Middle East) * Dutch painting. These research foci are reflected in nearly 40 book publications as well as in about 200 specialist publications.  Publications  * Otto Carl Friedrich von Sch√∂nburgs Park 'Greenfield' zu Waldenburg.

Violence and looting also broke out in the suburb of Irondequoit. Monroe County Executive Adam Bello and Rochester mayor Lovely Warren have since issued a state of emergency and have set a county-wide curfew for 9 PM. Bello, Warren, and Rochester police chief La'Ron Singletary have now claimed that the violence was incited by \\"professional protesters\\" and \\"anarchists\\" from outside the city. The next day on May 31, an elderly couple who owned a store on Monroe Avenue were beaten by masked assailants as part of continued looting, with the incident caught on camera.  Buffalo police shoving incident  On June 4, in Niagara Square in Buffalo, police officers from the Buffalo Police Department pushed 75-year-old Martin Gugino, causing him to fall to the ground and leaving him bleeding from the head. He was brought to the hospital and was in a \\"serious but stable condition.\\" He was later described as \\"alert and oriented.\\" The incident was quickly condemned in the media, by the New York Civil Liberties Union, and two officers were suspended. The police initially claimed Gugino had been \\"injured when he tripped & fell\\". Cuomo asked why the officers' actions were necessary, described their behavior as \\"just fundamentally offensive and frightening\\", and said the city of Buffalo should consider firing them and should carry out a criminal investigation. The Buffalo police union was angered by the suspensions of the two officers, and it retaliated on June 5 by withdrawing its legal fees support for any other Buffalo officers for incidents related to the protests. The police union's president claimed that the suspended officers \\"were simply following orders\\" and \\"simply doing their job\\", while also saying that the victim \\"did slip\\". 57 police officers from the Buffalo Police Department resigned from an emergency response team, leaving the team empty, although they did not resign from the department. According to the police union's president, the mass resignations were a show of solidarity with the two suspended officers. On June 6, officers Robert McCabe and Aaron Torgalski were charged with second-degree assault, a felony. In a virtual arraignment, they pleaded not guilty and were scheduled for a July 20 felony hearing. On the day of hearing, the District Attorney's office rescheduled it for September 14, 2020.

He is known primarily from inscriptions and non-literary papyrus. The career of Valerius Proculus is documented in an inscription recovered from M√°laga in Spain. = ILS 1341 His earliest imperial appointments were military commissions as praefectus or commander of cohors IV Tracum in Syria, then as military tribune in Legio VII Claudia. It is likely his commission with the VII Claudia coincided with that of his brother, Gaius Valerius Florinum; Dessau argues for this relationship based on the shared praenomen of their fathers (Lucius) and tribe (Quirina). Proculus then was appointed prefect of the Classis Alexandriae et Potamophylaciae‚Äîa combined command of the Roman fleet based at Alexandria, and the officials who policed the Nile and collected customs. At this point the civil track of his career begins. First Proculus was appointed procurator or governor of the province of Alpes Maritimae. After being given the task of recruiting office in an unknown province (the inscription is broken here), he went to serve as procurator, or overseer of imperial estates, in these provinces: Baetica, Cappadocia, Asia, and the Three Gauls. Proculus then advanced to two senior appointments. First was as praefectus annonae, or overseer of the grain supply of Rome; he held this position from 142 to 144. The second was the related but more prestigious post of prefect or governor of Roman Egypt, which he held from 144 to 147.Guido Bastianini, \\"Lista dei prefetti d'Egitto dal 30a al 299p\\", Zeitschrift f√ºr Papyrologie und Epigraphik, 17 (1975), p. 289 Apparently after concluding his service in Egypt, Valerius Proculus retired to M√°laga, for the inscription that details his career was set up to honor him and his wife Valeria Lucilla as civic patrons.

Alternate splicing of the MRAP mRNA generates two functionally isoforms MRAP-Œ± and MRAP-Œ≤. MRAP is an accessory protein to a family of five receptors called the melanocortin receptors (MC1-5). It was previously known as fat tissue- specific low molecular weight protein (Falp). MRAP was thought to be involved in adipocytes differentiation. MRAP assists in the transport of the melanocortin 2 receptor to the cell membrane from the endoplasmic reticulum and assist in the generation of cAMP by the activated receptor. MRAP is also considered essential for the trafficking of MC2 to the cell surface and facilitate the MC2 response to Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) in the adrenal gland leading to stimulation of glucocorticoid synthesis. Human MRAP is found mainly in the adrenal gland and adipose tissue. It was also, located in the brain, heart, ovary, testes, and breast. Genetic variants of MRAP are linked to an autosomal recessive condition called Familial Glucocorticoid Deficiency type 2 (FGD-2).  Structure and functional domains  The cytogenetic location of MRAP gene is 21q22.11 and is composed of 6 exons that encodes a single-pass transmembrane protein. The protein is made of three domains: a transmembrane domain that is responsible for the attachment of the MRAP molecule in the cell membrane and facilitates the interaction with the receptor. The second domain assists MRAP expression on the cell membrane as well as the expression of MC2. The third and final domain that is near the amino- (N-) terminal enables the homodimerization of MRAP molecules. The N-terminal and the transmembrane domains are highly conserved between species. In contrast, the carboxyl-(C-) terminal is found to be diverging between the MRAP isoforms and also between different species. That said, the whole genome of human MRAP shares lower similarity with mouse Mrap, and that is mainly in the N-terminal and transmembrane domain. The alternate splicing of the MRAP mRNA generates 4 isoforms: two functional isoforms which are MRAP-Œ± (173 amino acids); MRAP-Œ≤ (102 amino acids); non-functional isoforms, isoform 3 (113 amino acids); and isoform 4 (172 amino acids). MRAP, and its ortholog MRAP2, is the dual topology where either the C- or the N- terminal is oriented extracellularly. This dual topology feature was revealed using epitope immunoprecipitation and live cell imaging studies. MRAP is partially glycosylated and this is dependent on the N-terminal being facing the luminal surface of the endoplasmic reticulum. This unique feature enables MRAP to form an antiparallel homodimer that is essential for the MRAP interaction with the melanocortin receptors. The expression of MRAP was found to be regulated by ACTH as well as lipopolysaccharides and, in rats, is affected by diurnal variation. Phylogenetic studies revealed the existence of MRAP orthologs in different piscine species such as zebrafish and tetrapod and has also been detected in mammals and chicken. MRAP is thought to be originated as a result of R2 genome duplication event.  Cellular activity  MRAP was found to mainly regulate the surface expression and signalling of MC2. Cell surface ELISA and Immunofluorescence studies showed the co-expression of MC2/MRAP in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and also on the cell membrane, which indicates that MC2 needs MRAP to reach the cell membrane. In addition to cell trafficking, in vitro studies conducted on HEK293 cell revealed that MRAP enhances MC2 response to ACTH stimulation and the effect of MRAP-Œ≤ was more pronounced than that of MRAP-Œ±. The activated MC2 activates cAMP production which, in turn, stimulates the protein kinase A (PKA) pathway leading to glucocorticoid synthesis in the adrenal gland. In fat cells, where MC2 is expressed, MRAP was found to facilitate MC2 activated lipolysis and therefore regulating energy expenditure. The transmembrane domain of MRAP mediates MRAP/MC2 interaction, and that suggests an interaction with the transmembrane domain of one of the seven domains of MC2 . Once the interaction is established, MRAP uses its tyrosine-rich region to escort MC2 to the cell membrane. However, MRAP needs to be in the antiparallel homodimer status.The MC2/MRAP complex expression on the cell membrane culminates in MRAP assisting MC2 to respond to ACTH stimulation, and that is through the same MRAP tyrosine rich area mentioned earlier. In addition to regulating MC2 surface expression and signalling, MRAP was found to modulate the function of the other melanocortin receptors. Immunoprecipitation assays reported the interaction of MRAP with MC4and MC5 and had no effect on the surface expression of MC1 and MC3. Unlike MC2, MRAP is not essential for these receptors as they were located on the cell surface in the absence of MRAP1. The interaction between MCs and MRAP was found to reduce the former response to the melanocortin synthetic ligand NDP-MSH  Familial glucocorticoid deficiency (FGD)  The familial glucocorticoid deficiency occurs as a result of poor adrenal response to ACTH stimulation which leads to glucocorticoid deficiency. The mutations in the MRAP gene caused the congenital disorder familial glucocorticoid deficiency type 2 (FGD-2). FGD-2 is an autosomal recessive disease with early childhood onset of recurrent infections, hypoglycaemia, skin hyperpigmentation, and failure to thrive due to low glucocorticoids levels. If left untreated, it could be fatal. MRAP mutations were found to disable the movement of MC2 to the cell surface of adrenal gland cells; this would make MC2 irresponsive to ACTH stimulation causing a deficiency in glucocorticoids production. The mutations in the MRAP gene were found to be mostly homozygous nonsense or splice-site mutations that caused the truncation of MRAP protein. Few FGD-2 cases were reported to have homozygous missense MRAP gene mutations that led to replacing tyrosine with aspartame at position 59 or the substitution of valine with alanine at position 26. These missense mutations cause a milder form of the disease and a later onset. The mutations in the MRAP gene sequence that cause FGD-2 are considered rare compared to the effect of chronic corticosteroid treatment that leads to adrenal insufficiency disrupting the MC2/MRAP stimulation by ACTH. The adrenal cortex is made of three zones: zona glomerulosa, zona fasciculata and zona reticularis. The main zone that expresses MC2 and MRAP is the zona fasciculata. Both proteins are also found in the undifferentiated region of the adrenal gland, where there is a small population of adrenal stem cells The use of MRAP knockout transgenic mice revealed under-developed adrenal gland with loss of the adrenal zonation, which indicates another mechanism for FGD-2. There is still no profound evidence of the involvement of MRAP in disorders beyond the adrenal gland. However, MC2 lipolytic activity was disturbed in the adipose tissue in the presence of mutated MRAP. Nevertheless, the MRAP mutations that caused FGD-2 did not seem to affect fat metabolism in the affected patients. This might indicate a compensatory mechanism to the loss of MRAP function in adipocytes. The presence of MRAP in regions with no or low MC2 levels might indicate a role of MRAP beyond MC2 and the other melanocortin receptors. Ongoing studies using transgenic mice and array genotyping could give insight into the physiological processes involving MRAP.

Early life and career Smith was born in Grand Rapids, Michigan in 1966. In high school, she was a member of the Black Student Union as well as the track and cheerleading teams. At 17, she began attending Oregon State University, from where she graduated with a degree in communications in 1987. Soon after graduating college, Smith got a job as a staffer for then-U.S. Representative Ron Wyden. She remained on his staff for 21 years, eventually becoming his field representative. Political career Smith began her own political career by running for Multnomah County Commissioner in 2010. She came in second place in the initial election, and advanced to the runoff, which she won by 26 percentage points. During her first term, Smith focused on investments in programs helping poor youth. She served on the Portland Metro Workforce Development Board, which aims to curb the unemployment rate especially among people of color. Smith won reelection in 2014 with little opposition. During her second term, Smith generated some controversy relating to her finances. A Willamette Week investigation discovered that Smith disproportionately spent her office budget on travel and nonprofit contributions.

Also in 2017, Smith was accused by several former staffers of harassment and creating a hostile work environment. She was also accused of using county funds for personal expenses such as grocery shopping.

Smith ran for Portland City Council in 2018. She came in second place in the initial election and lost to Jo Ann Hardesty in the runoff. Smith picked up several prominent endorsements, including from all four of Oregon's black state legislators at the time and from former County Commissioners Jules Bailey and Diane McKeel.

Organized on April 28, 1862, the regiment was unengaged at the May 9 Battle of Farmington and the September 19 Battle of Iuka. As part of Brigadier General Martin E. Green's brigade, the regiment participated in three charges against exterior Union lines on October 3, 1862, during the Second Battle of Corinth. On October 4, the regiment joined Green's brigade in attacking the inner Union lines. Despite initial success, the attack was repulsed by a Union counterattack. On November 7, 1862, the regiment was combined with the 1st Missouri Infantry to form the 1st and 4th Missouri Infantry (Consolidated), the 4th Missouri Infantry ceased to exist as a separate unit. Background and organization Lieutenant Colonel Waldo P. Johnson When the American Civil War began in 1861, the state of Missouri was politically divided. Governor Claiborne Fox Jackson supporting secession and the Confederate States of America, and mobilized elements of the state militia in an effort to capture the St. Louis Arsenal. On May 10, Jackson's men were dispersed by Brigadier General Nathaniel Lyon of the Union Army; a pro-secession riot in St. Louis followed. Jackson responded by forming the Missouri State Guard (MSG) and appointing Major General Sterling Price as its commander. In June, Lyon evicted Jackson, the MSG, and the pro-secession elements of the state legislature from the state capital of Jefferson City. The secessionist retreated to southwestern Missouri, all the while pursued by Lyon. On August 10, Lyon attacked the combined camp of the MSG and Confederate States Army elements commanded by Brigadier General Benjamin McCulloch; in the ensuing Battle of Wilson's Creek, Lyon was killed and his army routed. Price followed up on his victory leading the MSG north towards the Missouri River; by winter, Union reinforcements had chased them back into southwestern Missouri. In the Battle of Pea Ridge, fought on March 7 and 8, 1862, Price and the MSG suffered another defeat while serving under Major General Earl Van Dorn. After Pea Ridge, Van Dorn's army was transferred east of the Mississippi River. Eventually, many of the men of the MSG would join Confederate Army units. The 4th Missouri Infantry Regiment was formed on April 28, 1862, at Memphis, Tennessee. Two previously-existing battalions, commanded by Archibald A. MacFarlane and Waldo P. Johnson, were combined with a small element of the MSG; many of MacFarlane and Johnson's men were MSG veterans. MacFarlane was appointed the regiment's first colonel, Johnson was the first lieutenant colonel, and Stephen W. Wood was the regiment's first major. On April 28, the regiment contained ten companies, all Missouri-raised; they were designated with the letters AI and K. Almost all of the regiment's soldiers were of Anglo-Saxon descent. Service history Map of the IukaCorinth campaign After formation, the regiment was transferred using local railroads to Corinth, Mississippi as part of the Army of the West. A muster performed on May 5 counted 547 men in the regiment. On May 9, the 4th Missouri Infantry was near the action at the Battle of Farmington, but did not see combat. After the Confederates evacuated Corinth due to Union pressure, the regiment trained in various locations in northern Mississippi. At this time, Price was in command of the Army of the West, which he had stationed at Iuka, Mississippi; Van Dorn had troops further to the south. At the time, the Confederates were conducting an offensive into Kentucky, and Price and Van Dorn were expected to move into Tennessee to support it. Major General Ulysses S. Grant, who was the Union commander in the region, decided to attack Price before he was joined by Van Dorn. Grant divided his 17,000 men into two wings to attack Price from multiple directions. On September 19, Price fought his way past one wing of Grant's army in the Battle of Iuka; the other wing did not hear the sound of fighting due to an acoustic shadow and did not participate. The 4th Missouri Infantry, which was in the brigade of Brigadier General Martin E. Green, was held in reserve and did not fight at Iuka. After escaping, Price joined Van Dorn, who commanded the combined force. Together, the Confederates moved against Corinth, which was strategically important to Union plans in the region. On October 2, Union Major General William S. Rosecrans occupied Corinth with 23,000 men; that same day, he learned of Van Dorn's approach. After arriving near the city, the Confederates deployed in an arc northwest of the Union defenses with 22,000 men. At 10:00 on October 3, Van Dorn attacked, beginning the Second Battle of Corinth. At Corinth, the 4th Missouri Infantry was in Green's brigade of Brigadier General Louis H√©bert's division of Price's corps of the Army of West Tennessee. On October 3, the 4th Missouri and the rest of Green's brigade (except for the artillery) attacked an outer Union position held by Brigadier General Thomas A. Davies' division. The initial attack was repulsed, but Green ordered a second charge. The second charge was again repulsed, this time by a Union counterattack led by the 2nd Iowa Infantry. Later in the afternoon, Green's brigade made another charge against Davies' line, although this attack was supported by elements of Colonel Elijah Gates' brigade and Brigadier General Charles W. Phifer's brigade. After heavy fighting, the Union line was broken. Despite a clear line of attack against the inner Union line being open, Price decided not to press the attack with the 30 remaining minutes of daylight and to wait for the morning of the 4th to resume the battle. On October 4, Green was promoted to division command due to H√©bert falling ill. Command of Green's brigade then fell to Colonel William H. Moore. Moore's brigade charged the inner Union line, with the objective of the attack being a fortification known as Battery Powell. The Union line was defended by men of Davies' division, who were quickly routed by the Confederate charge. After breaking through Davies' line, Moore's brigade aimed for the town of Corinth itself. Moore's brigade, along with elements of Phifer's brigade and the brigade of Brigadier General John C. Moore, entered Corinth, and penetrated as far as the Tishomingo Hotel. However, a Union counterattack drove the Confederates out of Corinth, ending the threat. At Second Corinth, the 4th Missouri lost 15 men killed, 87 wounded, and 27 missing, for a total of 129. MacFarlane suffered a serious head wound during the battle. Legacy Van Dorn battle flag similar to the one carried by the 4th Missouri On November 7, the regiment consolidated with the 1st Missouri Infantry, as a result of losses in both units. The consolidation of the two regiments formed the 1st and 4th Missouri Infantry (Consolidated). Companies B, C, E, H, and I of the new regiment were composed of men from the 4th Missouri; Companies A, D, F, G, and K were composed of men from the 1st Missouri Infantry. MacFarlane and Colonel Amos C. Riley of the 1st Missouri Infantry came to an agreement where McFarlane became colonel of the unit unit and Riley lieutenant colonel; the latter commanded the unit while MacFarlane recovered from his wounds. In 1863, the new regiment fought at the Battle of Grand Gulf, Battle of Champion Hill, Battle of Big Black River Bridge, and the Siege of Vicksburg, where the regiment was captured during the Confederate surrender. The men of the regiment were then exchanged, and rejoined the Confederate army. In 1864, the regiment was engaged at the Battle of New Hope Church, Battle of Kennesaw Mountain, Siege of Atlanta, Battle of Allatoona, and the Battle of Franklin. On May 9, 1865, the 1st and 4th Missouri Infantry (Consolidated) surrendered at the Battle of Fort Blakely.

Hicks served in various public offices throughout his life. He served as City Attorney of Meriden (1869‚Äì1874) and Attorney for New Haven County (1873‚Äì1876). In 1866 he was elected to the Connecticut General Assembly, the youngest legislator at that time, and remained in office for twenty-nine years. He was a member of the Democratic Party. In 1891, Hicks chaired the House Committee on Women's suffrage and supported a bill granting women the right to vote in local school board elections. When passed, it became the first such law enacted in New England. He also spoke against capital punishment. Hicks' father-in-law passed away in 1881, and Hicks became the executor of the Stearns estate. In 1882, Hicks withdrew from his law practice to become president of the Canfield Rubber Company of Bridgeport. By 1896 he had built the company into a manufacturing enterprise with $250,000 in capital (versus a mere $10,000 in 1882) and $1 million in annual sales. During this commercial period, Hicks made twenty voyages to Europe, chiefly to sell his rubber to overseas concerns. Hicks married Elizabeth \\"Lizzie\\" Canfield Parker (1844‚Äì1889) on December 17, 1879. She was the widow of Wilbur Parker and daughter of Jared and Mary Canfield of Middletown, Connecticut. The Hickses had one daughter, Elizabeth, born February 19, 1884. Mrs. Hicks died in Paris on June 7, 1889. Ratcliffe remarried on October 19, 1895, to Isabella Wormer of Chicago. Isabella sued for divorce in September 1896 on the grounds of \\"intolerable cruelty.\\" The divorce was granted along with alimony of $50,000 in cash in early 1897. Ratcliffe Hicks died of pleuropneumonia in Interlaken, Switzerland, in 1906.  Philanthropy  During his lifetime, Hicks established annual prizes for public speaking at Brown University, Storrs Agricultural College (later the University of Connecticut), and Meriden High School. On his death in 1906, he left major bequests to area institutions. He was reportedly so incensed at Brown's misspelling of his given name on his diploma that he cut the university out of his will, with the exception of a student scholarship. He did bequeath $10,000 to Yale University to fund student scholarships. Hicks' largest gift was in the form of a charitable trust (worth a quarter of his estate) to start a school of agriculture and forestry in Tolland County. Administered by the Meriden Trust & Safe Deposit Company, trust monies were to be invested for twenty-five years before building the school. In 1936 the estate established scholarships, grants, and loans for assistance to boys and young men pursuing education in agricultural subjects. The long-awaited school opened in 1941 as part of the University of Connecticut. The Ratcliffe Hicks School of Agriculture and the Ratcliffe Hicks Building & Arena are named after him. Hicks Memorial Municipal Center and Library in Tolland, CT Hicks also left substantial bequests to the Town of Tolland. He left $10,000 to the Tolland Public Library and a similar sum to build the Ratcliffe Hicks Memorial School (now the Hicks Memorial Municipal Center and Library) in the Tolland Green Historic District. The school was built on the site of a former school where Hicks had studied until the age of 13. Built in 1908 for a cost of $13,000, the school comprises a two-story brick building with stone trimmings. Ratcliffe's sister, Minnie Helen Hicks, contributed additional monies. The opening ceremony was marked by speeches from the presidents of Brown University and Trinity College.  Elizabeth Hicks  Elizabeth Hicks Residence Hall, University of Connecticut The only child of Ratcliffe and Elizabeth \\"Lizzie\\" Canfield Hicks, Elizabeth Hicks (1884‚Äì1974) became a philanthropist in her own right. She continued to dwell in the family home on Tolland Green after her father's death in 1906. She worked very closely with the University of Connecticut to develop the Ratcliffe Hicks School of Agriculture. She spoke at the dedication ceremony for the school in 1950 and was known for hosting formal teas each spring with the students and campus leaders. Dedicated in 1951 and built with state funding support, the Elizabeth Hicks Residence Hall, a women's dormitory on the UConn campus, is named after her. She also served on many local boards and committees, including the school's and library's, but never ran for political office. She died in 1974 and is buried in Tolland's North Cemetery. Elizabeth bequeathed the Tolland family home to a charitable trust to convert into a museum, now the Hicks- Stearns Family Museum. The museum features Victorian-era family heirlooms and furnishings.

In 2019, 3500 agencies in 35 U.S. states used Lexipol manuals or subscribed to their services. Lexipol states that it services 8,100 agencies as of March 2020. Lexipol retains copyright over all manuals that they create, even those modified by local agencies, but does not take on the status of policymaker. Critics note that a decision made by Lexipol becomes policy in thousands of agencies and that there is little transparency into how the policy decisions are made. Founding Bruce Praet, a California attorney and former law enforcement officer, began Lexipol in 2003 with Gordon Graham, a former law enforcement officer and law school graduate, and Dan Merkle, a corporate executive who became Lexipol's first Chairman and CEO. As a partner in the law firm of Ferguson, Praet and Sherman, Praet had worked with the Fullerton, California police department to create a California law enforcement manual, which he then used as a model to create a policy manual for the Escalon, California police department. As the number of manuals being supported grew, Praet set up Lexipol and transferred the policy development work to his new company. In May 2020, Richard DeFrancisco was appointed CEO. Expansion Marketing its products and services to law enforcement agencies and to municipal liability insurers, Lexipol's focus is on reducing liability risks and avoiding litigation. From 40 California agencies in 2003, Lexipol's business has expanded to 3500 agencies in 35 states in 2019, including police, sheriff, fire department, and other public safety agencies, making it the dominant private provider in the market. More than 90 percent of law enforcement agencies in California are Lexipol clients. Graham said the Lexipol concept became successful when police liability insurers became interested. Initially creating law enforcement manuals, Lexipol added policy manuals and subscriptions for fire departments; the Minnesota State Fire Chiefs Association endorsed a Minnesota Fire Policy Manual from Lexipro in 2014. In 2020, the Marine Corps Fire and Emergency Services at Marine Corps Logistics Base Barstow became the first USMC agency to subscribe to Lexipol. Orange County Business Journal ranked Lexipol the 24th fastest-growing private company in Orange County in 2010, and Deloitte ranked it 387 on its list of Technology Fast 500 in 2012. The Riverside Company, a private equity firm, purchased Lexipol in 2014. In 2019, Lexipol merged with Praetorian Digital. Madison Pauly, writing in Mother Jones, states that Lexipol founder Praet alluded to working with members of the California legislature on the California Act to Save Lives that was enacted in 2019, and quotes Praet as saying \\"We‚Äîlaw enforcement‚Äîgot 95 percent of what we needed out of [the bill].\\" Services Lexipol offers policy manuals with an updating service, daily training bulletins, and implementation services. Although officer participation in the training component is verifiable, the daily training bulletins were not certified by California's Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training \\"as sufficient to satisfy their minimum standards for state law enforcement training\\". Lexipol's services are widely used by small- and medium-sized departments that lack the resources to create or update their own policy manuals. Departments see Lexipol as a mean of mitigating risk. The policy manuals provided by Lexipol can be customized by the contracting agency, however subscribers are advised that the regular updates provided by the company will overwrite any customizations. Lexipol holds the copyright to all policies, even those modified or amended by the contracting agency, and Lexipol requires contracting agencies to sign an indemnification clause, stating \\"We only suggest content\\". Lexipol's contracts state that Lexipol is not the policymaker. The City and County of San Francisco Sheriff's Department retained Lexipol to consult on a new use of force policy, but ended the deal on advice from San Francisco City Attorney's Office which told Lexipol, \\"Lexipol's ownership of copyrighted material and related derivative works language was unacceptable.\\" Through its PoliceOne Academy, Lexipol offers online training courses, certified by the International Association of Directors of Law Enforcement. Criticism UCLA law professors Ingrid Eagly and Joanna Schwartz, in a study published in Texas Law Review, note that scholars and experts \\"have viewed police policies as a tool to constrain officer discretion and to improve officer decision making. Lexipol, in contrast, promotes its policies as a risk management tool that can reduce legal liability.\\" They identify the lack of transparency in the decision- making process and development of policies as a major concern as local jurisictions get little information on why decisions were made, what evidence was considered in drafting them, or what plausible alternatives might be. A journalist for The Desert Sun states \\"While Lexipol can boost small departments' confidence that their policies are effective, working with a private company poses challenges to transparency in policymaking.\\" The study by Eagly and Schwartz also calls out the danger of \\"mass standardization of police policies across jurisdictions and less opportunity to assess the efficacy of different approaches\\". Because of the wide adoption of Lexipol manuals, \\"policy decisions [by Lexipol] have an oversized influence on American policing.\\" Policy and data analyst Samuel Sinyangwe observes that any decision made by Lexipol then becomes policy in thousands of agencies. Scott Morris writes in The Appeal, \\"a large portion of American police policy is now being drafted by a little-known private company with no public oversight\\" and quotes Andrea Pritchard, a police review commissioner and the founder of Berkeley Copwatch, saying the Lexipol policies are \\"designed for maximum protection against civil liability. It‚Äôs not maximum protection of civil rights.\\" Morris also notes that Lexipol responded to the model policy on use of force produced by eleven law enforcement organizations, National Consensus Policy on Use of Force, by recommending that its clients make no changes to Lexipol's policies. In a report on fatal shootings by police in Citrus Heights, California which uses Lexipol policies, reporters stated that federally recognized use-of-force expert Ed Obayashi said \\"off-the-shelf\\" policies may be legally sound but not reflect community values or expectations. In 2017, ACLU of California sent a letter to Lexipol demanding changes in some of its policies that the ACLU states \\"can lead to racial profiling and harassment of immigrants\\", identifying several examples of unclear or misleading language. The Los Angeles Times reported that even sanctuary cities are using Lexipol policy manuals that contain guidance on immigration enforcement, including language to consider lack of English proficiency as a possible criterion, although some departments removed that language. In 2018, Spokane settled a lawsuit for unlawful detention. According to the letter sent to Washington agencies by ACLU of Washington and Northwest Immigrant Rights Project, \\"Spokane‚Äôs Lexipol policy incorrectly authorized officers to seize individuals and extend detentions for purposes of investigating and aiding in potential civil immigration enforcement, unnecessarily exposing the City to liability\\". After a white South Bend, Indiana police officer shot and killed Eric Logan, an African-American man, in June 2019, then-mayor Pete Buttigieg was drawn from his presidential campaign to focus on the emerging public reaction. Body cameras were not turned on during Logan's death, based on South Bend's Lexipol policy manual. In an interview, Samuel Sinyangwe, a policy and data analyst focused on police reform, said \\"There were some shortcuts taken by the city of South Bend to write their policy that many cities across the country are taking but that, frankly, are not consistent with a commitment to ending police violence. What they did was they decided to contract with a private corporation called Lexipol to write the policy for them. Lexipol is a company that makes money selling policies to police departments.\\" Bill McAuliffe, speaking for Lexipol, said \\"The whole philosophy of Lexipol policy content is we give them a solid foundation of well-written, legally researched and vetted policy. And then the agency needs to take it the next step and customize it to make sure that it's applicable, practical and functional for their organization's purposes.\\" Although agencies can customize the boilerplate manual that they receive, HuffPost says \\"Lexipol has a reputation for pushing back against stricter policing standards in its manuals, whether around body cameras or when it‚Äôs appropriate for officers to use force.\\" Meeting notes from the Tawas City, Michigan Police Authority Board on its implementation of the Lexipol policy quote the Chief of Police telling the Board, \\"it‚Äôs legally defensible, so we don‚Äôt want to change much\\" and that though the Authority Board can have input, Lexipol advised against any Authority Board member having editing abilities. Several departments in Ohio are rewriting their Lexipol policies in order to meet the certification standards of the Ohio Collaborative. In Peekskill, New York, when the police chief requested to hire Lexipol, a city council member opposed the request on the basis that Lexipol's policies prioritize avoiding discipline for violent police officers rather than increasing accountability, and said \\"We don‚Äôt need policies that decrease our settlement payout amounts, we need policies that will put the financial burden on the individuals causing the harm and stop holding taxpayers hostage to defending their abuse of power.\\" See also *Privatization in criminal justice References Category:Law enforcement in the United States Category:Privatization in the United States ","title":"Lexipol"},{"id":"64156999","text":"Barshabba, whose name means \\"son of the deportation\\",Jean Maurice Fiey (2004), Saints Syriaques (Darwin Press), no. 81, pp. 50‚Äì51. was the first recorded East Syriac bishop of Merv. He attended the synod of Patriarch Dadisho ø in 424.David Wilmshurst (2011), The Martyred Church: A History of the Church of the East (East and West Publishing), p. 40. Barshabba, or at least his name, lies at the root of an elaborate legend about the introduction of Christianity to eastern Iran and central Asia. The surviving versions of the legend of Barshabba are from no earlier than the 7th century. The only complete account of the legend is found in the Arabic Chronicle of Se øert. An abbreviated Arabic version is in the Book of the Tower by MƒÅrƒ´ ibn SulaymƒÅn. These all derive from a Syriac original. Fragments of a Syriac version and 350 fragments of a Sogdian translation have been found in the East Syriac monastic complex of Bulay√Øq.Baum and Winkler (2003), p. 74. He was venerated from eastern Iran to China, but no further west. He was venerated both in the Church of the East, with which the historical bishop was associated, and among the Melkites of central Asia. According to al-Bƒ´r≈´nƒ´, the Melkites of Khwarazm kept his feast on 21 June. A Sogdian gospel lectionary attests to the celebration of his feast in the Church of the East in China. The martyrology of Rabban ·π¢alƒ´ba gives his feast as 20 August. In the legend, Barshabba was a descendant of Christians deported by Shapur I () from Roman Syria to Iran. He was raised a Christian in Ctesiphon. He exorcised and converted Shirran, the sister or wife of Shapur II (), around the time of Shapur's peace treaty with Rome (363). To get her away from Barshabba's influence, Shapur sent Shirran to the oasis city of Merv and ordered her to marry the local marzban, Shirvan. From Merv she sent for Barshabba and he became its first bishop. Together they evangelised the city and region. He strove to convert the Magi,Barbara Kaim and Maja Kornacka (2016), \\"Religious Landscape of the Ancient Merv Oasis\\", Iran 54(2): 47‚Äì72, at 60‚Äì61. built churches and founded a school. He died and was buried, but by a miracle came back to life and lived another fifteen years before dying a final time. In the Sogdian version, he is credited with founding monasteries in Fars, Gorgan, Tus, Abarshahr, Sarakhs, Marw al-Rudh, Balkh, Herat and Sistan. The legend, combined with the evidence of the synod, would give Barshabba a pontificate of at least 69 years. The legend is consistent with the archaeological evidence for the introduction of Christianity to Merv in the 4th century.

A decorated veteran of the Imperial Russian Army, Managarov fought as a cavalryman in the Russian Civil War and rose to division command by the late 1930s. After commanding a rifle and cavalry corps in the Soviet Far East and front reserve in 1941‚Äì1942, Managarov briefly commanded the 41st Army before being appointed commander of the 53rd Army in early 1943. He led the army for most of the rest of the war, and commanded the Soviet forces fighting in the city during the Siege of Budapest. After the end of the war in Europe, he commanded the army in the Soviet invasion of Manchuria. Postwar, Managarov held army command, but retired in the early 1950s due to his health.  Early life, World War I, and Russian Civil War  A Russian, Ivan Mefodyevich Managarov was born on in the settlement of Yenakiyevo, Yekaterinoslav Governorate. The son of a Donbass coal miner, he worked at the Donetsk Mine No. 20 and the Yenakiyevo Metallurgical Plant after completing primary school. Joining the Imperial Russian Army during World War I in September 1914, Managarov was assigned to the 5th Reserve Cavalry Regiment at Balakleya as a ryadovoy. He was then sent to the front, serving with the mounted reconnaissance platoon of the 9th Finland Rifle Regiment of the 22nd Army Corps. Managarov was wounded and invalided out in June 1915, awarded the Cross of St. George thrice for his actions. After the February Revolution, Managarov joined the Yenakiyevo Red Guard Detachment, formed from miners, in August 1917, and was chosen as its commander due to his combat experience. Following the transfer of the Red Guards to the Red Army in February 1918, Managarov became commander of the Proletarian Regiment of the 1st Steel Rifle Division in May of that year. The division was merged with the 1st Don Soviet Cavalry Brigade in late November to form the 1st Consolidated Cavalry Division, which was renamed the 4th Cavalry Division in March 1919. With the division, Managarov continued as commander of the Proletarian Regiment before leading the 1st Ukrainian Steel Regiment from March 1919. Further reorganization of the division left him as assistant commander of its 22nd Cavalry Regiment in May. With the 4th Cavalry Division, Managarov fought on the Southern and Southeastern Fronts at Tsaritsyn and in the Don Host Oblast. Managarov was transferred in July 1919 to serve as assistant commander of the 2nd Taman Cavalry Regiment, which joined the 2nd Stavropol Cavalry Division in November. With the regiment, he fought on the Southern, Southeastern, and Caucasian Fronts in the operations of the 9th Army and 2nd Cavalry Corps. Becoming a cadet at the 5th Cavalry School in Taganrog in July 1920, Managarov fought in the suppression of the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine with a cadet detachment.  Interwar period  Upon his graduation from the cavalry school in September 1923, Managarov was appointed a platoon commander in the 21st Cavalry Regiment of the 4th Cavalry Division, now stationed in the Petrograd Military District. Transferred to serve in the same position with the 46th Cavalry Regiment of the 8th Cavalry Division of the Turkestan Front in March 1925, he fought in the suppression of the Basmachi movement. Managarov shifted to political work when he became secretary of the party bureau of the 47th Cavalry Regiment of the 11th Cavalry Division at Troitsk in April 1926, and for further political education studied at the Military- Political Academy between 1928 and 1931. Following his graduation from the academy, he was appointed political commissar of the 7th Mechanized Regiment of the 7th Cavalry Division at Minsk. Managarov soon returned to command positions, serving as commander and commissar of the 3d Cavalry Regiment of the 1st Cavalry Division at Proskurov from 1932, and became a colonel in 1935 when the Red Army introduced personal military ranks. After a stint as a military advisor in Xinjiang from January 1936 to June 1938, he returned to the Soviet Union to command the 8th Cavalry Division of the 1st Separate Red Banner Army of the Far Eastern Front. Promoted to kombrig on 20 November 1938, he became a major general on 4 June 1940 when the army introduced general officer ranks.  World War II  After Operation Barbarossa began, Managarov remained in the Far East with the division, and was appointed commander of the 26th Rifle Corps of the army in November 1941. Sent west in January 1942 to command the 16th Cavalry Corps of the front, forming in the Moscow Military District, he took command of the 7th Cavalry Corps of the Bryansk Front on 27 March. The corps spent the rear in the front reserve and in December Managarov became commander of the 41st Army, which he led in the Rzhev-Vyazma Offensive. In March he was transferred to command the 53rd Army, which he led for most of the rest of the war in the Belgorod‚ÄìKharkov Offensive, the Uman‚ÄìBoto»ôani Offensive, the Jassy‚ÄìKishinev Offensive, the Budapest Offensive, and the Prague Offensive with the 2nd Ukrainian Front. He was promoted to lieutenant general on 29 August 1943. While at the observation post of the 116th Rifle Division during fighting to the northeast of Kirovograd on 5 December, Managarov was severely wounded by a German shell that killed the army artillery commander and the chief of the operations department. After recovering, he returned to command of the army on 28 February 1944. In July, front commander Army General Rodion Malinovsky evaluated Managarov as an \\"observant and disciplined commander\\" and a \\"brave and decisive general with strong willpower and steady character\\" who showed initiative in both defensive and offensive operations, but tempered this praise with the statement that Managarov exhibited \\"insufficient operational thinking\\". During the Siege of Budapest, Managarov succeeded to command of the Budapest Operational Group, tasked with the assault on Buda, on 22 January 1945 following the wounding of Major General Ivan Afonin. The group, which was composed of the 75th Rifle and 37th Guards Rifle Corps, captured the city in brutal street fighting by 13 February. Managarov received the title Hero of the Soviet Union and was awarded the Order of Lenin on 28 April for his \\"skillful command of the army\\" and \\"personal courage and heroism\\" in the fighting to break through German defenses in the area of Hodon√≠n and the crossing of the Morava, being promoted to colonel general on 29 May. After the end of the war in Europe, Managarov and the 53rd Army were relocated to the Far East to participate in the Soviet invasion of Manchuria with the Transbaikal Front. During the invasion, the army broke through the Japanese border fortifications to cross the Greater Khingan, capturing Dandong and Chaoyang.  Postwar  Managarov, c. 1950s After the end of the war, Managarov was placed at the disposal of the Main Personnel Directorate when the army was disbanded in December 1945. After completing the Higher Academic Course at the Higher Military Academy between March 1946 and February 1947, he was appointed commander of the 4th Army of the Transcaucasian Military District. Relieved of command for health reasons in April 1949, Managarov was appointed commander of the Kiev Air Defense Region two months later. Retiring for health reasons on 5 September 1953, Managarov lived in Yalta, giving speeches to students and other organizations. His memoirs, focusing on the part of the 53rd Army in the Belgorod‚ÄìKharkov Offensive, were first published in 1975. Managarov died in Yalta on 27 November 1981, and was buried at the Old Cemetery of the city.  Awards and honors  Managarov was a recipient of the following decorations: * Gold Star Medal awarded to Heroes of the Soviet Union * Order of Lenin (3) * Order of the October Revolution * Order of the Red Banner (3) * Order of Suvorov, 1st class * Order of Kutuzov, 1st class * Order of Bogdan Khmelnitsky, 1st class * Order of the Red Star * Medals * Foreign awards * Cross of St. George, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th classes (not worn after 1917)  References  Citations  Bibliography = * * Category:1898 births Category:1981 deaths Category:People from Yenakiieve Category:People from Yekaterinoslav Governorate Category:Soviet colonel generals Category:Heroes of the Soviet Union Category:Recipients of the Order of Lenin Category:Recipients of the Order of the Red Banner Category:Recipients of the Order of Suvorov, 1st class Category:Recipients of the Order of Kutuzov, 1st class Category:Recipients of the Order of Bogdan Khmelnitsky (Soviet Union), 1st class Category:Recipients of the Cross of St. George Category:Russian military personnel of World War I Category:Soviet military personnel of the Russian Civil War Category:Soviet military personnel of World War II Category:Lenin Military Political Academy alumni ","title":"Ivan Managarov"},{"id":"64157016","text":"Roddam is a surname.

The full-length portrait depicts Lord Ribblesdale in his hunting clothes. It measures and has been held by the National Gallery in London since 1916.  Background  Thomas Lister became the fourth (and last) Baron Ribblesdale on the death of his father in 1876, when he was aged 22. He supported the Liberal Party in the House of Lords, served as a lord-in-waiting at the Royal court, and was a trustee of the National Portrait Gallery and the National Gallery. He was Master of the Queen's Buckhounds from 1892 to 1895. Although Sargent was already a popular society portraitist, the painting was not commissioned by the sitter. Rather, Sargent saw Ribblesdale speaking in public in 1894, and the artist approached Ribblesdale to propose painting his portrait. However, Sargent did not start the proposed portrait until 1899; he completed it in 1902.  Description  Sargent's original intention was to paint Ribblesdale in formal court livery as Master of the Buckhounds, but the completed painting shows him more informally, in his more practical \\"ratcatcher\\" clothes. He stands on a plain parquet floor against a white painted wall, holding a hunting whip in his grey-gloved left hand, with the other hand on his right hip. He is wearing a black top hat, with a black silk muffler knotted to his right side of his neck, and polished black boots. Over his yellow waistcoat, dark brown jacket and buff breeches, Ribblesdale is shrouded by a voluminous black Chesterfield overcoat. The tall hat and the fluted pilaster of the wall behind Ribblesdale, the clear silhouette of his long coat, and subtle changes that Sargent makes to the sitter's physiognomy ‚Äì such as an elongated nose, and the head disproportionately small in comparison to the body ‚Äì all emphasise Ribblesdale's thinness and height. A preliminary oil sketch depicts Ribblesdale standing on steps, before a column, but the final painting has him standing casually before the white panelling of Sargent's studio in Tite Street, Chelsea, London. The composition ‚Äì a full- length portrait of a man standing in a long Chesterfield coat with hand on hip against a vertically delineated background ‚Äì echoes Sargent's 1894 painting of W. Graham Robertson, shown with a walking cane against a dark doorway. The painting was selected by the historian David Starkey as \\"my favourite painting\\" in an article published in Country Life in 2015, in which he praises its \\"angular, elongated format and black-and-white palette, like a super-size Japanese print\\" as \\"Capturing the quintessence of understated aristocratic style ‚Ä¶ the portrait of an age as well as the man.\\"  History  The painting was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1902, and at the Paris Salon in 1903. Ribblesdale found himself living up to the patrician reputation established by the painting, later saying that it \\"forced greatness upon me\\" as \\"wherever I go, I am recognised\\". The painting is sometimes known as \\"The Ancestor\\", reflecting a soubriquet for Ribblesdale created by Edward VII, on account of the former's archaic speech and dress, and his aristocratic lineage, as exemplifying a typical old-fashioned English gentleman. Lord Ribblesdale presented the portrait to the National Gallery in 1916, in memory of his first wife Charlotte (n√©e Tennant), and their two sons, Captain Thomas Lister and Lieutenant Charles Lister. Charlotte had died in 1911, Thomas was killed in action in the 1903‚Äì04 Somaliland campaign, and Charles died of wounds in 1916 at the Battle of Gallipoli in the First World War. Ribblesdale later remarried, but with no male heir, the barony became extinct on his death in 1925.

Biography Pietro Benedetti was born on 19 May 1867 in Falvaterra, Italy. He joined the Missionaries of the Sacred Heart in 1883 and was ordained a priest on 21 December 1889. He taught for a decade in Barcelona, developing a personal relationship with the Catalan poet Jacint Verdaguer. He translated Verdaguer's poems and published them in his parish bulletin during the First World War. His Italian translation of a collection of Verdaguer's poems was published in 1921. He moved to Rome in 1901. On 31 October 1908, he was named vice director and in 1909 director of the Acta Apostolicae Sedis. Beginning in 1910 he was a member of a commission on revising catechism instruction in response to Pope Pius X's decree Quam singulari admitting children to the Eucharist. He was provincial (procurator) of his order when, on 21 December 1914, Pope Benedict XV named him Bishop of Ozieri in Sardinia. He was not consecrated and someone else was named to this position in April 1915. On 10 March 1921, Pope Benedict XV appointed him titular archbishop of Tyrus and Apostolic Delegate to Mexico. He received his episcopal consecration on 10 April 1921 from Cardinal Basilio Pompilj. In Mexico the Church was contending with the government‚Äôs anti-clerical campaign, which posed a challenge for the Holy See's representative. On 22 July 1921, Pope Benedict reassigned him, naming him Apostolic Delegate to Cuba and Puerto Rico. He resigned as delegate in 1925 or 1926, apparently because of his health.

It is often associated with surface-level activism, referred to as slacktivism. The term gained an increased usage on social media in the wake of the George Floyd protests, although the phrase predates the killing of George Floyd. \\"Performative wokeness\\" and \\"performative allyship\\" are related terms. History and usageEarly uses of the term= In 1998, St. Martin's Press published Spectacular Confessions: Autobiography, Performative Activism, and the Sites of Suffrage, a work by Barbara Green about Federation era women's suffrage in Australia. The term appeared online in 2015 articles by Hyperallergic and Atlas Obscura, but referred to the activism that involved an element of performance art. The Hyperallergic article referenced the Greenham Common Women's Peace Camp, and how some women protested nuclear weapons by decorating a fence \\"with pictures, banners, and other objects,\\" and added that \\"they blocked the road to the site with dance performances. They even climbed over the fence to dance in the forbidden zone.\\" In February 2017, The Outline writer Jeff Ihaza wrote that \\"one of the most crippling tendencies of modern liberals is their obsession with being seen, whether it be at a protest wearing a fuzzy pink hat alongside Madonna or in viral tweets totally owning the president. This preoccupation with optics is more often than not frighteningly self-centered,\\" and later adding that \\"From 'performative' activism to a fixation on clever protest signs, modern liberals know better than anyone else how to cash in on a political movement, but they know very little about how to harness the power of one.\\" Also in 2017, following the Charlottesville car attack, Philadelphia writer Ernest Owens included the term performative activism without interrupting punctuation, criticizing it as an activism \\"about making cheap symbolic gestures and catchy remarks to center yourself instead of the issue.\\" In September 2018, Lou Constant-Desportes, the editor-in-chief of AFROPUNK.com resigned, citing \\"performative 'activism' dipped in consumerism and 'woke' keywords used for marketing purpose.\\" In October 2018, Jenna M. Gray of The Harvard Crimson published an article using the term \\"performative wokeness\\", defining it as \\"drowning your lecture comments with a host of social justice buzzwords ‚Äî try favorites like intersectionality, marginalized, discourse, subjectivity, or any -ism ‚Äî without regard to whether other people understand you.\\" In 2019, the Columbia Daily Spectator and the Washington Square News, the student newspapers of Columbia University and New York University, respectively, published articles addressing on-campus discourse surrounding performative activism and students participating in social media activism. =In relation to the George Floyd protests= The term rose in popularity following the Killing of George Floyd, with many high school and college student activists using the term pejoratively. The Los Angeles Times wrote that students have warned against engaging in performative activism online. On May 28, 2020, Rice University student Summar McGee founded Rice For Black Life to help promote fundraising for Texas-based non-profits and to not go through bureaucratic processes of other organizations on-campus. McGee and Kendall Vining, another member of the organization, expressed that this type of \\"nonhierarchical activism helps avoid performative allyship and activism.\\" On June 1, while expressing support for the Black Lives Matter movement in the wake of the George Floyd protests, singer Lorde stated, \\"One of the things I find most frustrating about social media is performative activism, predominantly by white celebrities (like me). It's hard to strike a balance between self-serving social media displays and true action.\\" On June 2, many Instagram users participated in the \\"Blackout Tuesday\\" movement, which involved users posting a completely blacked-out square image in order to show support of the George Floyd protests. Celebrities and general users alike received criticism by other social media users for engaging in \\"performative activism\\" via these Blackout Tuesday posts. Performative allyship is a related term that has appeared in media publications following the George Floyd protests. An example of a government official being criticized for \\"performative\\" activism sprung up later in June, when Washington, D.C. mayor Muriel Bowser had the phrase Black Lives Matter painted on 16th Street in front of the White House. Bowser was criticized for this, as some brought up her presiding over law enforcement practices that have been called harmful to the black community in D.C.

The line operates in the weekday peak direction only every 8-20 minutes during the AM weekday peak hours and 30 minutes during the PM peak hours. Route D1 trips are roughly 40 minutes long. Background Route D1 operates during weekday peak hours only in the peak direction between Glover Park and Franklin Square. The route is basically an extended route D2 as the D2 ends at Dupont Circle station. The line connects Glover Park, Burleith, and Georgetown residents to Downtown as there is no Metrorail station near Georgetown. Route D1 currently operates out of Western division with a few trips operating out of Southern Avenue division. History Route D1 was created as a new route in 1999 under the Sibley Hospital‚ÄìStadium Armory Line operating alongside the D3, and D6 as a weekday peak-hour supplement service to route D2. The new route D1 operated between Glover Park and Washington Union Station via Federal Triangle and Franklin Square mostly operating along Q Street NW, K Street NW, E Street NW, and 13th Street NW. The line would connect the growing Georgetown and residents in Glover Park and Burleith to Downtown as there were no Metrorail station that was built in Georgetown. =2009 Changes= On December 27, 2009, route D1 was shortened to Federal Triangle with service to Washington Union Station being replaced by routes D3 during the weekday peak-hours. It was also split from the Sibley Hospital‚ÄìStadium Armory Line and operated on its own as the Glover Park‚ÄìFranklin Square Line. According to WMATA, it says: The route will be changed to operate between Glover Park and Federal Triangle. Eastbound buses will follow the regular route from Glover Park to 13th and E Streets, NW, then continue via 13th Street onto Pennsylvania Avenue to the terminal stand on the west side of 10th Street, NW. The westbound route will begin at this terminal stand and continue via Constitution Avenue, 12th Street, Pennsylvania Avenue, 13th Street and resume the regular route. Two new buses will be scheduled to leave eastbound from Glover Park at 9:05 a.m. and westbound from Federal Triangle at 7:05 p.m. The bus schedule will change. =2015 Proposed Changes= In 2015, WMATA proposed to eliminate the D1 segment between Franklin Square and Federal Triangle as the portion suffers from low ridership. Alternative service is provided by routes 42, 80, D6, S2, S4, and X2. =2016 Changes= On June 26, 2016, route D1 was shortened even further from Federal Triangle to Franklin Square due to low ridership. =Proposed Discontinuation= In 2019, WMATA proposed to eliminate the D1 and replace it with a proposed G2 reroute due to alternative service available. The proposal was met with controversy with residents due to service being lacking in Georgetown if the proposal goes through. WMATA later backed out of the proposal due to major customer opposition. The proposed elimination was brought back up on September 26, 2020 due to low federal funding. Route D1 has not operated since March 13, 2020 due to Metro's response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Background Route D2 operates daily between Glover Park and Dupont Circle station connecting Glover Park, Burleith, and Georgetown residents to Metrorail as there are no stations in Georgetown. Route D2 currently operates out of Western division. The line primarily uses 30ft Orion VII BRTs since the line primarily uses small buses due to ridership and DC's Small Bus Program, but sometimes utilizes regular 40 ft buses from Western. During its times, the line would use Orion IIs and 30 ft Orion Vs prior to the 30 ft Orion VIIs. History The Glover Park Line was originally operated under the Washington Railway & Electric Company prior to it merging with the Capital Traction Company in 1933. Route D1 originally began operating between Glover Park and Downtown under the Capital Street Company. The line at first were operated by streetcars, but then formed into buses on March 1, 1925.

The new route would be named route G2 and would operate on the D2 and G2 routing between Glover Park and Howard University along Q and P streets. Service to Georgetown on route G2 would be discontinued. This was in order to consolidate all services operating between Dupont Circle and Wisconsin Avenue into one alignment on Q Street NW, which would allow customers to wait at Q Street bus stops for multiple services and to eliminate inefficiencies of operating services one block from each other on P and Q Streets NW. The proposal was met with controversy with residents due to service being lacking in Georgetown if the proposal goes through.

It is currently part of the collections of the Austrian National Library, in Vienna, shelfmark Ms. 1783. History King Manuel I in the gradual. The artists that produced the codex have not been conclusively established. It was previously incorrectly and anachronistically attributed to Francisco de Holanda, although his father Ant√≥nio de Holanda, then a young man, is not outside the realm of possibility. More recent scholarship attributes part of the codex to calligrapher and music scribe Martin Bourgeois, based on the inscription \\"hinc Burgos\\" found within one of the litterae cadassae, and on stylistic similarities to the c. 1504-06 Choirbook of Philip the Fair and Juana of Castile (Royal Library of Belgium, MS 9126), which has been attributed to him.

Von Damm joined the faculty at the University of New Hampshire (UNH) in Durham, New Hampshire, in 1992. She was a professor of geochemistry in the UNH Department of Earth Science and as a researcher at UNH's Institute for the Study of Earth, Oceans and Space. Von Damm's research is cited as the cornerstone of understanding sea floor hydrothermal systems, specifically for changing pre-existing paradigms for the chemical budget of the ocean, the accretion of oceanic crust along the mid-ocean ridge, the biology of the deep sea, and the origin of life on earth. She made measurements on vent fluids during hundreds of submersible dives in the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans. Starting in 1991, Von Damm studied how the fluid chemistry at hydrothermal vents changes with time before, during, and after mid-ocean ridge volcanic eruptions.  Leadership  In the late 1980s, Von Damm was named as an advisor to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration VENTS program. From 1995-1998, Von Damm served as Chair of the RIDGE (Ridge Interdisciplinary Global Experiments) Steering Committee, funded by the National Science Foundation‚Äôs Ocean Sciences Division. In addition, she served on the National Science Foundation‚Äôs Geoscience Advisory Board and as chair of a committee to design a 21st-century research submersible for the U.S. science community.

Producers, semi- fabricators, consumers, recyclers, and merchants can use Zinc futures contracts to hedge Zinc price risks and to reference prices. As of December 31, 2019, LME Zinc contracts are associated with 51,200 tonnes of physical zinc stored in LME approved warehouses around the world, or around 0.4% of 2019 world zinc production of 13 million metric tonnes. Despite the small share of physical zinc associated with LME Zinc contracts, their prices act as reference prices for physical global Zinc transactions. This practice started in the 1970s, when base metals producers started using LME futures contract prices as reference prices for spot market transactions. Contract description LME Zinc contracts trade on the London Metal Exchange. The contracts require physical delivery of the asset for settlement, and deliverable assets for the contracts are 25 tonnes of high grade primary Zinc. The contracts prices are quoted in US dollars per tonne. LME prices have minimum tick sizes of $0.50 per tonne (or $12.50 for one contract) for open outcry trading in the LME Ring and electronic trading on LMEselect, while minimum tick sizes are reduced for inter-office telephone trading to $0.01 per tonne (or $0.50 for one contract). Carry trades involving Zinc futures also have reduced minimum tick sizes at $0.01 per tonne. Contracts are organized along LME's prompt date (or delivery date) structure. =Prompt date structure= LME offers three groups of LME Zinc contracts with daily, weekly, and monthly delivery dates. Contracts with daily settlement dates are available from two days to three months in the future, which means that on 2020-05-12, contracts with daily delivery dates for 2020-05-14, 2020-05-18, 2020-05-19 ... 2020-08-10, 2020-08-11, and 2020-08-12 are available for trading. Contracts with weekly settlement dates are available from three months to six months in the future, which means that on 2020-05-12, contracts with weekly delivery dates for 2020-08-12, 2020-08-19, 2020-08-26 ... 2020-11-12, 2020-11-18, and 2020-11-25 are available for trading. Contracts with monthly settlement dates are available from six months to 123 months in the future, which means that on 2020-05-12, contracts with monthly delivery dates for 2020-05-20, 2020-06-17, 2020-07-15, ... 2020-06-19, 2020-07-17, and 2030-08-21 are available for trading. Price discovery LME Zincfutures contract prices serves as a platform for Zincprice discovery because futures markets are more publicly visible and more accessible, due to lower transaction costs, for a larger number of buyers and sellers than the cash market. A larger number of buyers and sellers in the futures market allows those market participants to incorporate more demand and supply information into the futures price compared with the cash price. Empirical tests have shown that LME Zinc spot and futures markets are closely linked, although sometimes the spot market serves as a source of price discovery for the LME Zinc futures market rather than the reverse. As a financial asset LME Zinc futures prices are also a part of both the Bloomberg Commodity Index and the S&P; GSCI commodity index, which are benchmark indices widely followed in financial markets by traders and institutional investors. Its weighting in these commodity indices give LME Zinc prices non-trivial influence on returns on a wide range of investment funds and portfolios. =Related derivatives= LME also offers other derivatives related to primary Zinc. Options, TAPOs, Monthly Average Futures, and LMEminis. Zinc contracts are also available for trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME). The CME Zinc futures contract are for 25 metric tonnes of primary Zinc and prices are quoted in US dollars per tonne; 12 consecutive monthly CME Zinc contracts are available for trading. Financial market conventions and empirical studies have grouped Nickel futures contracts with other base metals futures contracts together as an asset class or a sub-asset class. The Base Metals grouping usually includes futures contracts on Aluminium (sometimes including Aluminium Alloy contracts), Copper, Lead, Nickel, Tin, and Zinc, and they are also sometimes called Industrial Metals, Non-ferrous Metals, and Non-precious Metals. All of the metals in this group have associated LME contracts available for trading.

Subsequently, this role was assumed by the French National Committee.  Creation and legitimacy  On 26 June 1940, four days after the requested the armistice, General de Gaulle submitted a memorandum to the British government notifying Churchill of his decision to set up a Council of Defense of the Empire and formalizing the agreement reached with Churchill on 28 June, which allowed the Free French forces to be This memorandum led to an agreement on 7 August, but provided for the creation of a French Committee or Council as of 26 June. The agreement of 7 August between de Gaulle and the UK, known as the \\"Chequers agreement\\", gave General de Gaulle all the financial independence and resources of a government in exile. The British government considered it to have taken effect 11 July 1940, the day Marshal P√©tain took full powers and signed into law the end of the Third Republic. By this act, the British government wished to indicate that it recognized that Free France, still being formed at the time, was the legitimate successor to the Republic that had just died, and was an ally of Great Britain in the war. It also undertook to reconstitute the entire French territory and \\"the greatness of France\\" after the war was over. The formal recognition of the Empire Defense Council as a government in exile by the United Kingdom took place on 6 January 1941; recognition by the Soviet Union was published in December 1941, by exchange of letters.  Geographical base  In his view, General de Gaulle was ensuring the continuity of the rule of law and national defense against the Axis powers. This was made possible by the legitimacy he obtained from his appeal of 18 June, as well as by the rapid rallying of military units and French territories that wished to continue the fight (from 22 June, in the case of the Franco-British territory of New Hebrides). De Gaulle's support grew out of a base in colonial Africa. In the fall of 1940, the colonial empire largely supported the Vichy regime. F√©lix √âbou√©, governor of Chad, switched his support to General de Gaulle in September. Encouraged, de Gaulle traveled to Brazzaville in October, where he announced the formation of the Empire Defense Council in the Brazzaville Manifesto, and invited all colonies still supporting Vichy to join him and the Free French forces in the fight against Germany, which most of them did by 1943. At the time, Free France had the bulk of its territorial base in its colonial empire, thanks to the rallying of various colonies : French India was the first to rally, followed by most of the territories of French Equatorial Africa, followed by the New Hebrides Condominium, French Polynesia and New Caledonia.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/jso_0300-953x_1945_num_1_1487 Le ralliement √† la France Libre des colonies du Pacifique, Journal de la soci√©t√© des oc√©anistes, year 1945 F√©lix √âbou√©, governor of Chad, announced his support on August 26. He quickly received the support of Edgard de Larminat, Pierre Koenig and Philippe Leclerc. At the end of the summer, most of French Equatorial Africa, newly designated \\"Free French Africa\\", was in support of Free France.  Government of Free France  On 27 October 1940, General de Gaulle announced the creation of the Empire Defense Council as the decision- making body of Free France in the \\"Brazzaville Manifesto\\", from the capital of French Equatorial Africa. This was part of his strategy to give the movement a political as well as a military character, both to attract supporters, and to provide support for his claim as a political as well as military leader of the French resistance. In the ordinances of 27 October 1940, De Gaulle defined the powers of the Council, including: external and internal security, economic activity, negotiating with foreign powers (in article 2), as well as the \\"establishment of organs that would exercise the powers of jurisdiction normally devolved to the Council of State and the Court of Cassation\\" (article 4). However, the decision-making power rested with the head of the Free French (article 3), the Council exercising only an advisory role. Ministerial powers were exercised \\"by agency directors appointed by the Head of the Free French\\". This gave the Defense Council the nature of a consultative and representative body in the territories that joined with it. The Administrative Conference of the Free French (), created by decree of 29 January 1941, served as the government, bringing together all the agency directors and the members of the Empire Defence Council.

Early years and education Harold Jackson \\"Jack\\" Pickup was born on 17 January 1919 to William Samuel Pickup and Dorothy Mary Aylward. He had one sister, Zoe. Two years after he was born, the Pickup family relocated to Fort William, Ontario. Pickup graduated from high school early, at age 16. Jack Pickup attended Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario and graduated in 1942 as a surgeon and general practitioner. Though he intended to serve as a physician in the Royal Canadian Navy, Pickup was instead relegated to working at the tuberculosis sanatorium in Fort William for the remainder of the Second World War. Pickup briefly worked in Ontario, and had a practice in Dryden. Career Piper PA-12 Super Cruiser The village of Alert Bay purchased a decommissioned military hospital formerly operated by the Royal Canadian Air Force in Port Hardy and transported it to Cormorant Island by barge in 1947, creating St. George's Hospital. Advertisements circulated across Canada for a doctor willing to service not just the community but more than a thousand isolated communities across Vancouver Island and mainland British Columbia as well, an area of over 10,000 km2. Jack Pickup became very interested in the job in 1949 despite never having been to Alert Bay or even knowing where it was. Two days after Pickup arrived in the village to consider the opportunity, the doctor who had until then been caring for the community disappeared, prompting Pickup to take the position for a five-year term. Upon arrival in the region, Pickup encountered difficulties transporting injured patients to the hospital in Alert Bay, as far as Kelsey Bay ( from Alert Bay) to the south and Bella Bella ( from Alert Bay) to the north. With sea travel proving too prolonged and land travel too difficult, Pickup made the decision to take flying lessons and become a pilot in order to better tend to his patients. His lessons were taken over the course of a three-week leave of absence and in September 1950 he received his pilot's licence flying a Luscombe 8A at Vancouver International Airport. With little time left to acquire a plane, Pickup looked at three available floatplanes before purchasing a Piper PA-12 Super Cruiser (CF-EFC) for $3,500; he had also considered a Stinson Reliant and a Republic RC-3 Seabee. After purchasing the aircraft he flew the to Kenora to receive his floatplane endorsement, and then flew back to British Columbia and returned to Alert Bay. The trip to and from Ontario took Pickup twenty hours across five days and required nine stops on lakes and rivers for refuelling. On the return flight Pickup used the Yellowhead Pass between Jasper and T√™te Jaune Cache to traverse the Rocky Mountains, following the Thompson and Fraser Rivers to the ocean and often flying lower than the granite cliffs on either side of the region's valleys. Along the way, Pickup used telephones to check in and allow others to monitor his progress westward, as there was no radio aboard his plane. Waco ZQC-6, similar to the Waco AQC-6 used by Pickup Pickup continued to use the Piper for three years, and its red and yellow colour scheme made it the best-known airplane in the region. Though he eventually installed a radio in its cockpit, the only signal he was usually able to pick up was from RCAF Port Hardy (now the Port Hardy Airport). Pickup would later remark that the Piper was his favourite to fly. Pickup became embroiled in a protracted two- year battle to convince Revenue Canada to accept money spent on maintaining and fuelling his aircraft as legitimate tax expenses; ultimately, he became the only doctor in Canada to be allowed to expense 80% of his air travel costs. In 1953, after 300 hours of flight, he sold the plane and upgraded to a Waco AQC-6 (CF-CCW) biplane for $6,000. Pickup took the Waco on test flights between Vancouver and Nanaimo before returning with it to Alert Bay, where it would continue to service the communities tended to serve Pickup for 27 years under the name \\"Big Red\\". The Waco sank after striking a submerged log on take-off in 1958, but was soon raised and Pickup adopted a sideslipping technique for landing. As the most established pilot in the community, Pickup helped Alert Bay Air Services train their first pilots and acquire their first aircraft - a floatplane variant of the Cessna 170 - in 1958. Among other things, the Alert Bay Air Services provided medevac support for injured or killed loggers in remote areas in the region, and continued to do so after being amalgamated into Air BC along with a number of other aircraft companies in 1980. Pickup also became a part-owner of Altair, a short-lived aircraft company in Pitt Meadows, where he had his own aircraft serviced. In 1970, he purchased a Republic RC-3 Seabee while Bird Red was undergoing repairs and used it in place of the Waco for four years. Republic RC-3 Seabee Pickup earned a reputation for his expertise at flying, and became a legendary pilot to the communities he serviced. In a 1997 interview he suggested that most of the stories ascribed to him were untrue, citing one story in which he flew wearing nothing on his feet but slippers as particularly egregious as he \\"never owned a pair\\". An account by former Alert Bay dispatcher and pilot Villi Douglas tells that Pickup managed to evacuate a sick lighthouse keeper from Pine Island and achieve an inexplicable take-off in spite of massive swells. In another story relayed by Pickup himself, he had been forced to take a sick and intoxicated man from a remote camp to the hospital in Alert Bay, but was forced to take off at night. After take-off his patient regained consciousness and attacked him twice before Pickup knocked him out with a fire extinguisher and transported him the rest of the way to Alert Bay. Pickup racked up thousands of flight hours across 31 types of planes over the course of his career, almost always conducting take-offs and landings on water. In 1954, Pickup became a founding member of the College of Family Physicians of Canada. In the 1970s, he served as mayor of Alert Bay for six years. =Death of Renee Smith= Among the First Nations communities serviced by Jack Pickup, including those on Cormorant Island, he earned a reputation for providing substandard medical care. On 22 January 1979, 11-year-old Renee Smith of the  ºNamgis First Nation died of appendicitis. Smith had been brought to St. George's Hospital suffering from severe abdominal pain on 18 January and died five days later after Pickup failed to either conduct a full medical examination, perform an appendectomy, or issue her the correct medications. Smith's death sparked two years of controversy and government inquiries surrounding Pickup's medical malpractice, especially amid accusations that Pickup's heavy drinking habit had affected his ability to provide proper treatment. The practice was not unaccustomed to physicians behaving poorly: at the time of Smith's death, two doctors Pickup had worked with in Alert Bay had had their medical licences made conditional due to alcoholism and another's had been suspended outright. The controversy also split the community along racial lines, with many white residents of Alert Bay defending Pickup, who at the time was not just a doctor and pilot but also the former mayor and incumbent president of the board of trade, and a number of letters to the editor were sent to local newspapers proclaiming his innocence. As the rift in the community grew, the administrator of St. George's Hospital, James Quigley, said resolving the issue would take \\"everyone working together, tolerance, co- operation, [and] understanding\\". After conducting an investigation, College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia issued a statement stating that Pickup had made \\"a regrettable and serious error in judgement\\", but took no action to stop him from practising medicine. In a statement made to the band government in June 1979, Dr. June Mills of North Battleford, Saskatchewan testified that Pickup's handling of Smith's illness was \\"on the level of malpractice\\". Pickup himself blamed the controversy on a small group of band council members having their distrust for him blown out of proportion by the media. Pearl Alfred, the contemporary band manager for the 'Namgis First Nation (then \\"Nimpkish First Nation\\"), was one of Pickup's primary opponents, and was quoted as saying: > Pickup's only part of the problem. We're looking at the whole queetion of > Indian health statistics, which are pretty grim. Minister of Health and Welfare David Crombie announced in September 1979 that a commission would be established to investigate claims of medical abuses in Alert Bay. The investigation was led by Dr. Gary Goldthorpe, and became known as the \\"Goldthorpe Inquiry\\" as a result. The Goldthorpe Inquiry began on 3 March 1980, and found that First Nations people were 25% more likely to die in Alert Bay than elsewhere in Canada and that at least three patients (including Smith) had died of neglect or errors in judgement on Pickup's part. Testimony given by a local woman during the inquiry blamed Pickup for the death of Edna Alfred, who Pickup had misdiagnosed with having \\"gas\\"; Alfred died days after Pickup refused her treatment of a uterine infection. The Goldthorpe Inquiry recommended Pickup resign and that a health centre be created on the island to better serve the 'Namgis First Nation. The proposal was met by resistance from the non-Native community in Alert Bay, St. George's Hospital staff, and the College of Physicians and Surgeons. As a representative of the federal government Goldthorpe had no official power to remove Pickup, who refused to resign and would continue working at St. George's Hospital for another 12 years. However, Pickup's ability to operate without oversight and accountability came to an end. Dr. Katherine A. Wotton, an associate of Dr. Gary Goldthorpe and a physician with four years of experience treating Indigenous patients in Manitoba, began working as Alert Bay's second doctor on 3 July 1980. As well, increased scrutiny and tighter restrictions were enacted on St. George's Hospital in 1981 in order to limit the kind of surgeries Pickup could perform, including those related to child birth. Nonetheless, a new hospital was constructed on the reservation and staffed by two doctors and three nurses from Island Health, all paid for by the band government. =Retirement and final years= After more than 40 years at St. George's Hospital, Pickup retired in late 1992 at the age of 73. Pickup was involved in the creation of an airport in Alert Bay, and was one of seven members of the Village of Alert Bay Airport Committee established on 13 January 1994. Jack Pickup died on 11 February 1996. Personal life While practising in Alert Bay, Jack Pickup married his secretary, Lila. Outside of flying for work, Jack Pickup also flew light aircraft as a hobby and continued to do so until the age of 67. Before attending medical school, Pickup had been interested in becoming a musician. Despite opting for a career in medicine, Pickup remained passionate about music and was known to be a skilled pianist. He was also adept at sailing. Legacy Jack Pickup was modest when reflecting on his medical career. When asked in a 1997 interview with Aeroplane Monthly about the lives he impacted, Pickup replied: > I just treat ‚Äòem: the Lord heals ‚Äòem. No-one ever had a baby in my > aeroplane. Dr. John Ross, an early aviator and medevac pilot for Air BC, held Pickup in high regard, commenting: > Jack Pickup was at Alert Bay. He flew himself out to accidents. He was quite > an interesting man. I met him a few times. He was a saint really. He worked > up in Alert Bay for about forty years. He was the only doctor and he did > everything. I don‚Äôt think he was appreciated as much as he should have been. > Why he did it, I don‚Äôt know. I guess he just liked being a bit different. Pickup is viewed more critically by Dr. Dan Cutfeet, an Alert Bay doctor originally from Kitchenuhmaykoosib Inninuwug First Nation. Dr. Cutfeet, in an interview with APTN, discussed the unique challenges posed to healthcare workers in the community during the COVID-19 pandemic by recalling the medical abuse Native people endured from Pickup, who he described as \\"on many occasions clearly and obviously drunk while performing as a doctor\\" and \\"verbally abusive, and disrespectful, toward Indian patients\\". A number of physicians in British Columbia were taught or mentored by Pickup, including pediatrician Basil Boulton. \\"Physician Spotlight: Dr. Basil Boulton\\", Basil Boulton, Pediagogue, Issue 7, Winter 2007, p. 11-12. CF-CCW (\\"Big Red\\"), the Waco AQC-6 biplane that Pickup piloted for 27 years, was donated to the Canadian Museum of Flight in Langley in 1980 and is now on display there. The plane underwent decades of refurbishments and repairs before being deemed flight-worthy again after a successful test flight on 13 February 2002. The plane was flown many times in demonstrations throughout the 2000s before undergoing repairs in 2013 and relaunching in 2019. A similar red biplane is also depicted in the museum's official logo. Dara Culhane Speck, a member of the 'Namgis First Nation by marriage, published a book in 1987 reflecting on the death of Renee Smith and ensuing controversy around Jack Pickup: An Error in Judgement: The Politics of Medical Care in an Indian/White Community. Marilyn Crosbie, a personal friend of Pickup, published a memoir of her encounters and memories of him in 2012: Memories of Jack Pickup - Flying Doctor of British Columbia. Crosbie had originally conceived of the book in 1974 but held off on writing it until after both Pickup and Lila, his wife and the main objector to the project, passed away. Pickup was posthumously awarded the Freedom of the Municipality Award by the municipal government of Alert Bay. Alert Bay Airport, which Pickup helped establish but died before it was completed, was named \\"Dr. Harold Jackson Pickup Airport\\" in his honour.

It is native to Australia (New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania), and to New Zealand. It was first described in 1800 by Daniel Solander as Geranium pilosum, from a specimen found in New Zealand. However, the name was illegal (having already been used in 1787 by Antonio Jos√© Cavanilles) and it was renamed in 1965 by Roger Charles Carolin, with the species epithet, solanderi, honouring Solander.  Description  Geranium solanderi is a perennial, spreading herb with the ends growing upward. The stemas are up 50 cm long, and coarsely hairy. The taproot is swollen and often like a turnip. The leaves on the flowering stems are opposite and palmatisect ( leaf cut into lobes to up to more than halfway in a palmate form). They are 1‚Äì3 cm long by 1.5‚Äì5 cm wide, with 5‚Äì10 lobes, and hairy on a stalk (petiole) up to 5 cm long. The flowers are paired (rarely solitary) on an inflorescence stald (peduncle) which is 1‚Äì4 cm long, with each flower on a flower stalk (pedicel) which is 2.5‚Äì5 cm long. The sepals are 5‚Äì9 mm long, and the pink petals are 5‚Äì12 mm long, pink and often have yellowish veins. The anthers are yellow. The fruits are 12‚Äì25 mm long and the seeds are black.  Conservation status  In New Zealand, in both 2004 and 2009 it was declared \\"Not threatened\\", but in 2012, under the New Zealand Threat Classification System it was declared \\"At Risk - Declining\\", with the qualifiers SO (safe overseas) and DP (data poor), and this status was reaffirmed in 2017.  Aboriginal uses  The Noongar people of south west Western Australia used the older red tuberous roots (after cooking) to treat diarrhoea.

These fortifications were located near vital road and waterway routes, or were built within a day‚Äôs journey of one another. Fort Hanson was primarily built for the protection of the St. Augustine area in the Florida Territory. St. Augustine had become refuge for many white settlers and their slaves that had fled from nearby settlements and plantations for safety in the city. In addition to St. Augustine being an important shipping port and supply center for the war effort the additional civilians made the city a key stronghold requiring a substantial military presence for its defense. The fort originally stood about thirteen miles southwest of St. Augustine.Jaye, Randy. Second Seminole War (1835-1842) Fortifications in the Present-day Volusia and Flagler County Area.

Brief History Fort Hanson was established in 1838 by R.H.K. Whitley, 1st Lt., and was garrisoned by regular U.S. Army troops. It was also tasked with providing reconnaissance and communications to warn U.S. Army troops stationed in St. Augustine of any Seminole Indian activity in its general vicinity. After only two years of service Fort Hanson was ordered abandoned on May 13, 1840 by the United States Secretary of War Joel Roberts Poinsett (1779-1851). Poinstett sent a correspondence to General Walker Keith Armistead (1773‚Äì1845), commander of the U.S. Army from 1840-1841, with orders to abandon two St. Augustine area forts: Fort Hanson and Fort Peyton. Three new forts were being planned as their replacements. Only one fort, Fort Fulton, (which was in active service prior to Poinsett's letter) actually served as a replacement for Fort Hanson and Fort Peyton. The other two replacement forts were never established. Fort Hanson was abandoned in 1840 and later burned to the ground by the Seminoles, and Fort Peyton was abandoned in May 1840 and burned to the ground on February 14, 1842.

He served as Bishop of Amiens from 31 October 1987 to 10 March 2003. Biography Noyer was born on 17 April 1927 in Le Touquet on Rue de Londres. After his secondary studies in Boulogne-sur-Mer, Noyer studied at the University of Lille. He then entered a seminary in Arras before continuing his Catholic training at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome, where he earned a degree in scholastic philosophy. Noyer became a professor at the Coll√®ge Haffreingue in Boulogne-sur-Mer in 1952. He left this position in 1963 to teach in Arras, where he stayed until 1970. He was a priest at the St. Joan of Arc Catholic Church in Le Touquet, where he became rector in 1976. Noyer left Le Touquet in 1987, when he was appointed Bishop of Amiens. He stayed at the Amiens Cathedral, and became Bishop Emeritus on 10 March 2003. Ideology In 2002, Noyer actively advocated against the election of National Rally party nominee for President, Jean-Marie Le Pen, saying that his rhetoric leads to \\"false security of banter, isolation, racism and xenophobia\\". On 23 April 2010, Noyer published an article in T√©moignage chr√©tien, where he examined the difficulty for his contemporaries to accept the idea of the resurrection of Christ. This article raised numerous allegations from religious leaders that Noyer doubted the story of Jesus' resurrection. He addressed these concerns in J.

Arrest and death On 19 July 2016, Adama Traor√©'s 24th birthday, Traor√© was out with his older brother Bagui in the Paris suburb of Beaumont- sur-Oise. Police approached the pair, seeking Bagui who was accused of extortion with violence. The officers requested to check their IDs, but Traor√© did not have his and fled.

The arresting officer was attacked and knocked to the ground by an unknown third party who fled the scene, allowing Traor√© to escape again to hide in a nearby house. Three officers of the National Gendarmerie found him hiding under a sheet without the handcuffs and pinned him down to arrest him.

After an hour, Traor√© was declared dead at the scene. After his death Traor√© was found to have been in possession of ‚Ç¨1,330 in cash and a bag of cannabis. Traor√© had previously been convicted of various offenses‚Äìincluding rebellion and violence against the police, extortion, drug related offenses, and stealing‚Äìand had been incarcerated twice. He had been released from prison in May 2016, two months before his death. =Post-mortem reports= A total of four autopsy reports were issued for Traor√©. Initially, experts failed to agree whether the cause of death was suffocation after the police pinned him to the ground, or other underlying medical conditions (such as sickle cell disease) or hyperthermia caused by the chase in a heat wave. Others suggested the possibility of presence of drugs in his body contributing to his death, but an initial toxicology report on his vomit was negative for marijuana and alcohol. An additional toxicology report showed a high concentration of THC in his system, demonstrating that he had consumed cannabis at most up to 12 hours, and likely within 2 to 3 hours, before his death. A French legal report in 2020 also maintained there was THC in his blood. The official medical report eventually listed heart failure as cause of death. A second autopsy commissioned by the Traor√© family, however, listed asphyxiation from sustained pressure as the cause of death. 2 hours after his death his body temperature was measured at 39.2¬∞C (102.6¬∞F) which the arresting officers' defense attorneys claim to be proof of hyperthermia. Aftermath A lawyer who sp√©cialises in police violence suggested that state medical examiners will tend to try and protect the system and lack independence. A subsequent internal police investigation exonerated the officers. In interviews Traor√©'s sister has stated that she believes that his death was the direct result of excessive use of force by the police whereas the 2 autopsies and 4 medical reports ordered by the magistrates conclude that the police officers were not responsible for his death. On July 10, 2020 the magistrates in charge of investigating the death of Traor√© ordered a new medical report but this time to be carried out by doctors in Belgium. His death sparked major protests in Paris, Lyon, and Toulouse under the slogan Justice pour Adama (Justice for Adama). The protests styled themselves after the American Black Lives Matter movement, and similarly focused on the grievance voiced that Black and Arab communities in France suffer disproportionately at the hands of the police. Legacy On 2 June 2020 in Paris. Traor√© became a major symbol for anti-police brutality activists. His older sister, Assa Traor√©, became an anti-racism activist as a result of his death. On 29 May 2020, French legal authorities released a final report clearing the three officers involved of wrongdoing, triggering renewed protests. Protesters also expressed solidarity with the George Floyd protests that erupted in the United States and elsewhere beginning in late May. Demonstrations in Paris, Marseille, Lyon, and Lille, honoured both Floyd and Traor√©. On 2 June, over 20,000 protesters marched again in Paris, along with 2,500 in Lille, 1,800 in Marseille, and 1,200 in Lyon. On 23 July 2020, French authorities recognized as proven charges of sexual assault by Traor√© that had been the subject of a complaint in 2016 from a cellmate, some months before Traor√©'s death.

She was born in a Catholic family. She married a eunuch; her bishop advised her to separate from her husband, and she went to live with St. Agatha Kwon Chin-i because her mother was too poor to support her. She converted her family to the Christian faith, visited and helped many Catholics, and wanted to be a martyr for her faith. Agatha was arrested with Chin-i and a servant girl, and placed under house arrest. Their guards, \\"who had pity on them\\", helped all three women escape. The servant girl, however, was re-captured, and told her captors where the other women were hiding; they were re-arrested and the guards who helped them escape were punished by their superiors. They were severely tortured and beaten, \\"but they would not give up their faith\\". At the age of 27, Agatha was beheaded on January 31, 1840, with five other Catholics, including Chin-i, in Danggogae in what is now the Yongsan district of Seoul. St. Agatha was part of the persecution of Catholics in Korea that took place over the course of 100 years. Up to 10,000 Catholics were martyred for their faith because they were perceived as a threat to local Confucian ideals, over five main waves of persecution. She was executed during \\"the infamous 1839‚Äì1840 Gihae Persecution\\", with a group of ten prisoners, including St. Mary Yi Seong-rye. Nine of the Danggogae martyrs, including St. Agatha, were canonized by Pope John Paul II in 1984, when he canonized 103 martyrs and French missionaries killed during the waves of persecutions in Korea. There is a shrine dedicated to the martyrs at Danggogae, which honors the third-highest number of martyred saints in Korea.

He was a nephew of the physicist Henri Becquerel and taught at the Faculty of Sciences in Nancy and at the University of Poitiers. Becquerel was the son of Andr√© Paul Becquerel (1856-1904), a farmer. Paul was a grandson of Edmond Becquerel and a nephew of Henri Becquerel. He studied science in Paris in 1903 and obtained a doctorate in 1907. He taught at Nancy and then at the University of Poitiers. He began to study the viability of cells and demonstrated that spores and seeds became resistant after losing water and that rehydration could revive them. Paul Becquerel had studied under Gaston Bonnier in Paris. Bonnier had refused to accept the evolution of life from inorganic matter and considered the idea of seeding from outer space as a more plausible origin of life. Becquerel experimented with bacteria, fungal spores and seeds to test if they could withstand the conditions of space such as radiation and concluded that panspermia could not be supported. Becquerel tested the viability of seeds obtained from French museums. He was able to germinate seeds of Cassia multijuga (now Senna multijuga) which was 158 years old.

He was the CEO of General Dynamics from 1962 to 1970 and was the first CEO of Amtrak from 1971 to 1975. From 1953 to 1955, he was the Assistant United States Secretary of the Air Force. Biography Roger Lewis was born in Los Angeles and graduated from Stanford University in 1934. After college, he worked at Lockheed in the sheet metal shop. He remained with Lockheed in progressively higher positions through World War II when he was the company's director of materiel. After Lockheed, he went to Canadair and, in 1950, took a job as vice president of sales and management for Curtiss-Wright. In 1953, President Dwight Eisenhower nominated him as the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Materiel. The Senate confirmed his nomination on April 3, 1953 and he was sworn in on April 4. Eisenhower awarded him the Medal of Freedom for his service. After leaving the government, he went to work for Pan Am in its defense projects. In 1962, Henry Crown, the majority shareholder of General Dynamics recruited Lewis to take over as the president of the company, which had experienced sharp losses in 1960 and 1961 after the company wrote off development costs in its jet program. General Dynamics suffered some setbacks over Lewis' tenure. He worked to push Crown off the company's board and borrowed heavily to buy Crown's preferred stock for $100 million. The F-111 program suffered from safety concerns and the United States Navy cancelled its orders for F-111B's in 1968. In 1970, the company's reported net earnings of only $2.5 million for 1969. That figure was challenged by associates of Crown, who had bought back shares in the company at depressed prices and regained a broad seat. An analysis by Crown suggested that the financials should have shown a $12.1 million loss. The allegations led to a shareholder lawsuit against the company. As the company's Quincy Shipbuilding Division, which Lewis acquired in 1964, and its Stromberg-Carlson divisions weighed on the financial results in 1970 and the dividend was pulled, Crown proposed hiring David S. Lewis to the board as the new Chairman and CEO. In 1971, Lewis was nominated as the first CEO of Amtrak, taking the reins of the passenger rail operations of the major railroads. Although the initial year of Amtrak was troubled as the company ran out of funds and had little left over for capital expenditure, by the end of 1972, passenger traffic was up 11% and revenues were up. Lewis ordered UAC TurboTrains, improved reservations and on- board services. However, Lewis was criticized as the company shed half of its passenger routes after they were assumed. Lewis announced his resignation from Amtrak in 1974 and was succeeded by Paul Reistrup. After leaving Amtrak, Lewis worked with companies in finance and telecommunications. Lewis died on November 12, 1987 at the age of 75.

Beginning on May 29, 2020, demonstrators took to the streets throughout the city for marches and sit-ins, often of a peaceful nature but which also devolved into riots. Participants expressed opposition to systemic racism, police brutality and violence against people of color. By June 8, there had been eleven straight days with major protests in Seattle. The Capitol Hill neighborhood experienced a week-long series of clashes between demonstrators and police near the East Precinct that culminated in the formation of the Capitol Hill Organized Protest (CHOP) area, after police abandoned the precinct on June 8. The month of June brought further protests including a Black Lives Matter general strike and silent protest march with 60,000 people on June 12 and several actions throughout the city for Juneteenth. After several shootings and deaths, the CHOP zone was reclaimed by police on July 1. It was followed by a fatal vehicle collision with protesters on Interstate 5 over the July 4 holiday. Major protests reemerged in opposition to the deployment of federal law enforcement in the city by the Trump administration. Additional actions occurred on July 19, July 22, and again on July 25, when several businesses were vandalized and five construction trailers were set on fire at a youth jail.  Events  On May 29, a small protest happened in Downtown Seattle and Capitol Hill, damaging windows of several stores, including Amazon Go, Old Navy, Nordstrom and Cheesecake Factory in the Pike- Pine Corridor. = May 30 riots = A larger demonstration was organized and held on May 30 at Westlake Park, joined by thousands from a protest at police headquarters, and evolved into a standoff between protesters and police. Leading to acts of looting and arson all around Seattle, among them the Nordstrom flagship store. Protesters also blocked Interstate 5 in both directions. Protesters removed two AR-15 rifles from an abandoned police cruiser. Q13 Fox News correspondent Brandi Kruse reported that a rioter was firing one of the weapons into vehicles. A security guard hired by the news crew drew his pistol on the protesters and seized the weapons. Seattle Police Department reported that two rifles were returned without having been fired; KIRO TV and other media reported that at least one of the rifles was fired during the riot while out of police control. A KIRO reporter reported hearing \\"explosions\\" during the afternoon of May 30. Sometime in the afternoon a child was allegedly maced by a police officer. The incident was reported as under review by the Seattle Office of Police Accountability on June 2, though as of July 18 the officer involved had not been disciplined or officially identified. A week later Seattle police arrested Evan Hreha, a hot dog stand operator who recorded a video of the child who had been sprayed, on suspicion of unlawfully discharging a laser. He was later released without charge. On this day, while Seattle police were attempting to detain looters, a white suspect was restrained with an officer's knee on his neck for 13 seconds while bystanders urged the officer to stop. This continued until a second officer intervened to push the first officer's knee to the suspect's back. This was documented on video. George Floyd himself had died after being restrained with a knee on his neck during an arrest. According to The Huffington Post, further video footage showed that the same Seattle officer had just used his knee on the neck of another white looting suspect. Protests continued on May 31. A cleanup effort was organized to support businesses in Downtown and the International District. = Capitol Hill clashes = On June 1, police and protesters clashed in Cal Anderson Park on Capitol Hill after hours of demonstrations and a march to the Seattle PD East Precinct. Protesters on Capitol Hill began using umbrellas to shield themselves from tear gas, adopting a tactic used during Hong Kong's Umbrella Revolution. A pink umbrella used by a protester was taken by police, causing more umbrellas to appear the following day. On June 2, a protest led by activists Rashyla Levitt and David Lewis marched from Westlake Park to Seattle City Hall with the intention of forcing Mayor Jenny Durkan to exit the building and talk to the activists. After an hour and a half Durkan spoke to the protesters and agreed to meet with leaders of the movement the next day. This was the first time Durkan had spoken to protesters after five days of demonstrations. Many protesters were unfamiliar with Levitt and Lewis; Black Lives Matters released a statement that they had no affiliation with the pair. Suspicions over Levitt and Lewis were first reported by Seattle journalist Erica C. Barnett and quickly escalated to accusations of Lewis and Levitt being either police \\"plants\\" working against the movement, or simply naive novices who were \\"in over their head.\\" Both Levitt and Lewis denied being police collaborators and no evidence proving their guilt has been provided. Levitt stated that she did not initially intend to be a leader and it happened organically; she had been receiving death threats since the rumors began. After the June 3 meeting with leaders of the protests that Levitt and Lewis initiated, Durkan ended the citywide curfew and announced the city's withdrawal from ending the consent decree on the SPD. On June 29 Levitt had a physical altercation with Fox News reporter Dan Springer and was arrested on July 1 during the police clearance of the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone. Community activist Andr√® Taylor referred to Lewis and Levitt as \\"youngsters\\" and chastised Lewis when demonstrators refused to comply with his demand that they evacuate CHOP. On June 5, Mayor Durkan announced a 30-day ban on police use of tear gas, saying officers \\"do not need to be using tear gas at protests as a crowd management tool.\\" Protesters in downtown Seattle In light of the 30 day ban on tear gas, on June 6 Seattle police used pepper spray and blast balls to disperse protesters outside the East Precinct on Capitol Hill. City Council President Lorena Gonz√°lez criticized the police response, tweeting \\"This is NOT what de- escalation looks like!\\" Also on June 6, the Seattle Police Department posted photographs of a candle on Twitter which it described as an \\"improvised explosive\\" and an \\"incendiary device\\" that had been thrown at officers. On June 7, during a demonstration at the East Precinct on Capitol Hill, a man, later identified as Nikolas Fernandez, drove a black Honda Civic into the crowd. As the vehicle was in motion, protester Daniel Gregory reached in the driver's side window. Fernandez then shot Gregory in the arm, exited the vehicle and ran past the barricades to the police line. Fernandez, whose brother works at the East Precinct, shot Gregory with a Glock 26 that had extended magazines taped together jungle style. Later that evening (on June 7), police \\"unleashed a barrage of tear gas and flash bangs\\" on a crowd outside the East Precinct on Capitol Hill despite the 30 day ban on tear gas. Aubreanna Inda, a 26-year-old protester, experienced cardiac arrest after being shot repeatedly with flash grenades by police while kneeling. Police Chief Carmen Best defended the use of tear gas, saying that the 30 day ban exempts SWAT officers and ‚Äúlife safety issues.‚Äù City Councilwoman Kshama Sawant was among the victims and claimed that there was no provocation from protesters before tear gas was deployed. The following day, Kshama Sawant alongside fellow Councilwomen Teresa Mosqueda and Tammy Morales, called upon Mayor Jenny Durkan to resign over the way the city has handled the protests. Police use of flash grenades and tear gas continued and grew in intensity over the subsequent days. = Police retreat from the East Precinct = Early in the afternoon on June 8, police began removing all items of value from the East Precinct on Capitol Hill, preparing for the possibility that the East Precinct may need to be abandoned, as happened on May 28 in Minneapolis. The streets surrounding the precinct were reopened and protesters marched up to the precinct that evening. After police withdrew from the East Precinct of Seattle, six blocks adjacent to it were walled off by protesters with barricades to prevent another vehicle attack.https://www.democracynow.org/2020/6/9/headlines/protesters_establish_autonomous_zone_around_seattle_pd_building_as_police_retreat The six blocks around the East Precinct were declared by protesters to be the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone. On June 9, hundreds of protesters temporarily occupied City Hall calling for the resignation of Mayor Jenny Durkan. An expos√© by The Seattle Times on June 12 found that Fox News had digitally altered photographs of the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone to include a man armed with an assault rifle. The Fox News website also used a photograph of a burning scene from the Minnesota protests to illustrate their articles on Seattle's protests. = June 12 general strike = After meeting with Mayor Jenny Durkan on June 6, Black Lives Matter Seattle-King County called for a statewide general strike and silent protest march on June 12. The demands of the protest would be for police to keep their body cams on during protests and stop the sweeps of homeless camps, and for the City of Seattle to divest $100 million of the police budget used for militarization of police and invest the money into social services, to drop their lawsuit against King County over the inquest process, to require that \\"'Community Oversight' be a part of the police contract bargaining process,\\" and to develop and fund a Black Commission to address racial issues going forward. In the days leading up to the protest, occupiers of the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone painted a giant colorful mural spelling out \\"Black Lives Matter\\" on East Pine Street. Many Seattle businesses closed for the day or closed early because of the general strike and to allow their employees to leave work and attend the protest. About 60,000 joined Black Lives Matter Seattle/King County for the silent protest march on June 12. = Juneteenth demonstrations = CHOPalt=left Hundreds gathered on June 18, the eve of Juneteenth, for a vigil in Magnuson Park in remembrance of Charleena Lyles, a pregnant mother of four who was shot and killed at home in her apartment by Seattle police exactly three years prior in 2017. Local activist Andre Taylor, whose brother was killed by Seattle police in 2016, held a rally on June 19 in Judkins Park which was attended by Mayor Durkan and King County Executive Dow Constantine. Thousands of people marched through the historically black Central District to Jimi Hendrix Park chanting \\"black lives matter.\\" The march was organized by the King County Equity Now Coalition, a group which called upon the City of Seattle to divest $180 million from the police budget and invest $50 million of that into the local black community. While the Central District is historically black due to redlining and racial covenants, in recent years much of the neighborhood's black community has been pushed out by gentrification and a rising cost of living in the city. Late that night, at 2:20 a.m., two people were shot in Cal Anderson Park within the boundaries of the Capitol Hill Occupied Protest zone. A 19-year-old man died and a second man was in critical condition in the Intensive Care Unit with life-threatening injuries. Seattle police attempted to respond but were, according to the police blotter, \\"met by a violent crowd that prevented officers safe access to the victims.\\" A later investigation by KUOW showed that miscommunication between Seattle police and Seattle Fire delayed city response to the victim. The victims were taken by a CHOP medic to Harborview Medical Center. As of June 21, the suspect remains at large and Seattle police have not released any description of the suspect. = July 4 freeway protest = On the early morning of July 4, a car drove onto a closed section of Interstate 5, where several people were protesting, and struck two white protesters. 23-year-old Summer Taylor from Seattle was killed, while 32-year-old Diaz Love of Portland, Oregon, who was live-streaming the protest on Facebook, remained for a time in critical condition at Harborview Medical Center; by July 13, Diaz Love self-reported being \\"in stable, satisfactory condition\\". Troopers from the Washington State Patrol (WSP) said that the driver drove the wrong way on the Stewart Street off-ramp in order to enter the closed section of I-5. A graphic video posted on social media showed the driver, a black man later identified as Dawit Kelete of Seattle, speeding into the crowd around 1:40a.m. in a white Jaguar. After the driver fled the scene, a protester chased him by car for about a mile where they both waited for the arrival of police. Kelete was arrested on two counts of vehicular assault. The WSP announced it would no longer allow protesters to enter I-5, which had been closed off late at night in downtown Seattle (between I-90 and Washington State Route-520) for 19 nights prior to the collision. Kelete pled not guilty.https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle- news/crime/seattle-man-accused-of-killing-one-protester-and-injuring-another- on-i-5-enters-not-guilty-pleas/ = Mid-July and August events = rainbow crosswalk on Capitol Hillalt=left After several weeks of calm with low-key protests, demonstrators returned to downtown Seattle on July 19. Police reported that peaceful demonstrators began to gather in the morning at Westlake Park but three hours later they were joined by a second group that was organized and more intent on property destruction. Several buildings were vandalized and police officers were injured, before the protesters dispersed after marching to Cal Anderson Park. The Capitol Hill neighborhood experienced vandalism, fires, and the looting of several businesses when a group of 150 people returned to the area at late at night on July 22. One of the businesses targeted was owned by a relative of the officer who fatally shot Seattle resident Charleena Lyles, a pregnant black woman, at home in 2017. On July 25, several thousand protesters gathered in the Capitol Hill neighborhood of Seattle for demonstrations in solidarity with Portland, Oregon. Tensions escalated in the neighboring city in early July after the Trump administration deployed federal forces against the wishes of local officials, stirring controversy and regenerating the protests. The Department of Homeland Security deployed an undisclosed number of federal agents to Seattle on July 23, without notifying local officials, adding to anxieties for the city's residents. A July 25 march by the Youth Liberation Front gathered peacefully for several hours in the early afternoon, but was later designated a riot by the SPD after the protest devolved into property destruction towards several businesses and fires were started in five construction trailers near a future juvenile detention center. Many marchers reportedly participated out of an understanding that the two central issues of the protest, police brutality and federal overreach, were deeply connected. Among the businesses vandalized was the Starbucks at 12th and Columbia Street, which had all windows shattered, merchandise stolen, and profanity spray painted throughout the building. The personal vehicles of several employees at the youth jail were vandalized with broken windows, graffiti and slashed tires. KIRO reported that 47 people were arrested and 21 police officers were injured. On July 26, around 5 p.m. protesters returned to Capitol Hill and gathered at Seattle Central College with ‚ÄúBlack Lives Matter‚Äù and ‚Äúdefund police‚Äù signs. About an hour and a half later protesters marched toward the East Precinct and set up a line on East Pine Street near 12th Avenue using signs, recycling and garbage bins. No arrests, clashes, or property damage was reported. On August 9, hundreds of pro-police and \\"Back the Blue\\" supporters gathered at Seattle City Hall to protest and to call on City Council to not defund the SPD. A group of counter- protesters gathered across the street from City Hall to support defunding the police. Police kept the two groups separate. Later that evening, a group of around 100 people marched along Broadway from Cal Anderson Park. Vandals within the group damaged 8 businesses in Seattle's First Hill neighborhood with much of the damage occurring along Madison Street over to Broadway. Police arrested 6 individuals.  Office of Police Accountability complaints from June 1  On June 1, Seattle's independent Office of Police Accountability announced that it received some 12,000 individual complaints about police behavior during the first few days of George Floyd protests in the city. The following is a list of ten specific incidents that received the highest number of complaints. # \\"Pepper spraying a young girl (Saturday)\\" # \\"Punching a person on the ground who was being arrested (Friday)\\" # \\"Placing a knee on the neck area of two people who had been arrested (Saturday)\\" # \\"Covering up badge numbers\\" # \\"Failing to record law enforcement activity on body-worn video\\" # \\"Pepper spraying peaceful protestors (Saturday)\\" # \\"The use of flashbangs, including causing a significant thumb injury (Saturday)\\" # \\"Failing to secure rifles in the rear of a patrol vehicle (Saturday)\\" # \\"Punching a person on the ground who was being arrested (Sunday)\\" # \\"Officers breaking down windows of a Target store\\"  Government response  Washington State Governor Jay Inslee ordered the activation of the Washington National Guard on May 30 in response to the riot. As a consequence of the May 30 events, all Seattle-bound service by Washington State Ferries, Kitsap Fast Ferries and the Seattle Water Taxi was suspended, with Colman Dock loading westbound traffic to Bainbridge Island and Bremerton only; many downtown streets were closed and bus service was halted; the Westlake and Pioneer Square light rail stations were also closed by Sound Transit. The Washington State Department of Transportation rerouted Interstate 5 freeway traffic away from Downtown Seattle in a 20-mile detour across the Evergreen Point Floating Bridge and Interstate 90 floating bridges, and through the Eastside.President Donald Trump criticized the response of Governor Inslee and Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan, claiming that they have not been effective in dealing with protesters, especially regarding the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone and the Seattle police's abandonment of the East Precinct. Trump threatened to retake the city if local leaders did not reassert their authority. Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan issued an executive order, declaring an end to the zone and authorized police to clear the area. On July 1, the police cleared the protest zone and retook the East Precinct soon-after. = Procedural changes = Following a large and peaceful demonstration on June 3, the City of Seattle announced several changes to its policing protocols, including restrictions on badge coverings for officers. The Seattle City council voted unanimously on June 15 to demilitarize the police department by banning the purchase and use of crowd control weapons including tear gas, pepper spray, flashbang grenades and rubber bullets. The city council also voted to prohibit the use of \\"choke holds\\" by Seattle Police. On July 24, in response to a request the U.S. Department of Justice, U.S. District Judge James Robart issued a temporary restraining order, blocking the law from taking effect. City Attorney Pete Holmes announced that the city would withdraw its request to lift a federal consent decree that had been imposed following a U.S. Department of Justice investigation in 2012. The city government also announced a 30-day ban on the use of tear gas by police on protesters in response to outcry from Capitol Hill residents who had been affected by its use. The ban did not apply to SWAT and other special officers. The Seattle Public Schools voted on June 24 to terminate contracts with the local police departments. = Arrests = Police and National Guard on Capitol Hill in Seattle on June 3 At least 55 people were arrested in Seattle during the May 30 riots. A man was arrested near the East Precinct in Capitol Hill on June 7, after he drove into a protest and shot a protester. On June 11, federal authorities in full SWAT gear arrested Margaret Channon, a 25-year-old Tacoma woman, for allegedly setting fires in five police vehicles during the May 30 riot in Seattle. Channon was charged with five counts of arson in U.S. District Court in Seattle. On the morning of July 1, there were 44 people arrested in Seattle for refusing to disperse as Seattle police retook the East Precinct and cleared the Capitol Hill Organized Protest zone. That night, 25 more people were arrested near Broadway and East Pine. The following night, on July 2, three people were arrested outside the West Precinct in the Denny Triangle and then later that night seven more were arrested near Broadway and East Pine Street. A man was arrested on July 4 and charged with two counts of vehicular assault after driving into a crowd of protesters on I-5 in Seattle, killing one protester and critically injuring another. On July 25, after declaring a riot, police made more than two dozen arrests for \\"assault on officers, obstruction and failure to disperse\\" during a protest in the Capitol Hill neighborhood near the former CHOP zone. = FBI surveillance = In order to find violent and destructive agitators the FBI monitored the protests and provided intelligence to the Seattle Police Department. The FBI monitored both alleged threats within and against the protests, and they worked with Seattle police when the Capitol Hill Organized Protest zone was cleared.

Shelide being placed on leave for inflammatory social media posts; he called for \\"body bags\\" for \\"vicious subhumans\\" involved in nationwide protests over George Floyd's murder at the hand of Minneapolis police officers.

Traverse City police chief Jeff O'Brien stated \\"I used to think there's no problem here, but there really is a problem. This issue really is our nation's original sin and we've got to get over that. We have to make sure that equality prevails.\\" He went on to acknowledge that change would have to begin with law enforcement officers holding each other accountable to eliminate the origin of racial inequality and showing loyalty and commitment to the rule of law over loyalty to fellow officers.

Speakers asked each demonstrator to support the cause with their vote for their city government. =Troy= On June 1, police blocked off traffic on Big Beaver Road as hundreds of protesters marched to the Troy police station while chanting \\"Black Lives Matter\\" and the names of people recently killed by police.

The bill was drafted before the death of George Floyd in response to the broader problem of police brutality. It passed the State Senate unanimously on June 4. Governor of Michigan Gretchen Whitmer released a statement on June 1, writing \\"To those who have taken to the streets to peacefully protest the structural inequities Black Americans face every day ‚Äì I‚Äôm with you. Tonight, I urge you to stay home and stay safe. Tomorrow, find a peaceful protest to join and make your voice heard\\" On June 3 she called for the passage of legislation to require de-escalation and implicit bias training for police officers, and the implementation of policies which would require them to intervene when they saw a colleague doing something \\"inappropriate or illegal\\". Lynn Afendoulis, a Republican member of the Michigan House of Representatives representing the 73rd district in Grand Rapids, proposed a bill to punish those who participate rioting with terrorism charges up to a 20-year felony sentence in, with Afendoulis stating \\"We want prosecutors to be able to charge them as terrorists.

Known for her psychological novels, her characters called into question conservative societal behaviors. Her novel Terug naar het eiland was one of the first lesbian literary works published in The Netherlands. It was unique in that it did not evaluate lesbianism on a binary trajectory or in relationship to masculinity or masculine traits. There are several streets named in her honor throughout The Netherlands. Early life Gerardina Anna Reuling, known as Josine, was born on 29 September 1899 at #36 Daniel Stalpertstraat, Amsterdam to Anna Catharina Taatgen and Hermanus Reuling. Her parents were opera singers and left The Netherlands for Russia when Reuling was two years old. She spent most of her childhood in Russia attending various schools in Eastern Europe. Her mother was ill for much of her childhood, and Reuling helped care for her. The glimpses of her nomadic family contained in her later autobiographical works, rarely mention her father. They were forced to evacuate from Latvia at the beginning of World War I in 1914 and returned to the Netherlands. Career When she completed her schooling, Reuling worked as a secretary for a wholesale paper producer, G. H. B√ºhrmann and wrote in her spare time. She published her first book, Siempie (Always), in 1927. She had written it when she was 22 and much of it was based upon her own life experiences, which would be woven into all of her works. Musicians, singers, and life in foreign places are chronicled in Siempie and Senta Meloni (Look Melons, 1938). Russian characters and a mother suffering from tuberculosis appear in Sara Vierhout. An office secretary appears in Intermezzo met Ernst (Interlude with Ernst, 1934), De verwachting (The Expectation, 1948), and De jaren zijn als vogels (The Years Are Like Birds, 1951). A friendship with a Paris fashion designer is reflected in De verwachting, as well. Because of illness, Reuling left B√ºhrmann's and finished Sara Vierhout (1932) in Switzerland. From there, she went to France, living first in Paris and then in Tourettes, near Vence in the Provence-Alpes-C√¥te d'Azur region. In the 1930s, the first books about lesbianism were published in the Netherlands. As there was no lesbian subculture in the Netherlands in the period, support networks consisted of friendship circles. Within Reulings circle were Anna Blaman and Marie-Louise Doudart de la Gr√©e. Reuling's Terug naar het eiland (Back to the Island, 1937) was among the first Dutch literary works to explore lesbian themes, as was A. H. Nijhoff's Twee meisjes en ik (Two Girls and Me, 1930). Written as an answer to The Well of Loneliness by Radclyffe Hall, the heroine, Brita, has no gender or identity crisis and rejects scientific concepts about homosexuality. Terug naar het eiland is unique, in that it rejected a depiction of lesbian desire as masculine behavior, instead championing feminine homosexual women's desire for other women. From her first publication, Reuling received critical acclaim and was noted for her \\"authentic and original depictions of modern life\\". The publication Sara Virhout was also well received, but as Reuling began shifting to more psychological explorations, which challenged conservative social norms, critical reception changed. Intermezzo met Ernst was criticized for depicting abnormal lifestyles and behaviors in which women characters were independent actors. When she published Teraug naar het eilan, critics labeled the work as pornographic. In 1958, Dutch critic Victor E. van Vriesland called her talent for writing unique and curious, because her characters showed the visible manifestation of their psychology. Instead of exploring the psychic soul of her character, Reuling evaluated their interior through observing their experiences and external interactions in a modern context. At the outbreak of World War II in 1940, Reuling returned to the Netherlands, but two years later was back in France, living in the Lot department near Brive-la- Gaillarde. She had undertaken the risky journey with a Jewish girlfriend who went on to Switzerland. Reuling lived in seclusion for nearly two years in Brive-la-Gaillarde, but after the Liberation of Paris in 1944, went to work at the Dutch Consulate General until it was safe to return to the Netherlands. She settled in Laren, where she wrote De verwachting and a children's book, Heks Pimpelnose (Pimplenose Witch) in 1948. Reuling began working as a secretary to the director of the Public Reading Room in Amsterdam in 1949. The following year, with a stipend from the Ministry of Culture, she returned to France and completed her novel De jaren zijn als vogels (1951). Returning to Amsterdam, she worked for Vrij Nederland (Free Netherlands) magazine, producing the column \\"Bij ons in de stad\\" (With Us in the City), but stopped after a few months, as she didn't like the work. She published her last book, Poeder en parels (Powder and Pearls) in 1953. Her health began to decline and she stopped writing. She eventually was mentally unable to interact with her colleagues. Death and legacy Reuling died on 19 or 21 October 1961 in Amsterdam in a care home on Eeghenstraat. Both Apeldoorn and Groningen have honored her with a Josine Reulingstraat (Josine Reuling Street), and Josine Reulinglaan (Josine Reuling Lane) is found in Vlissingen.

On June 5 another rally was held in Phoenix Park followed by a march of reportedly thousands through the streets of downtown Eau Claire. = Green Bay = On the evening of May 30 and the afternoon of May 31, there were peaceful protests held in downtown Green Bay. However, on the evening of the 31st, a Marathon gas station was looted, and several shots were fired. The police began firing rubber pellets at the protesters, at which point, the crowd began throwing rocks at the police. Police dispersed the crowd with gas. On June 7, an estimated 1,000-2,500 people showed up to march across the Walnut Street Bridge and protest police brutality after the killing of George Floyd, making it the largest protest in recent Green Bay history. The crowds were so big that the intended path for the protest, walking from Leicht Memorial Park to the Green Bay Police Department, needed to be scrapped. Organizers stated that activists from groups that were not previously familiar with one another united as a form of grieving and solidarity in the hope to achieve wide-scale police reform. The protest was completely peaceful, with no arrests or incidents of looting and vandalism reported. Activists later took to City Hall looking to remove a curfew put in by Green Bay police, mayor Eric Genrich and the majority of city council members; the curfew was set to curb looting and vandalism that had occurred at times from previous protests. = Kenosha = Between 100 and 125 demonstrators peacefully marched through downtown Kenosha on May 31. Members of the City Council supported the peaceful protests while condemning the violent ones in Milwaukee. After the shooting of Jacob Blake on August 23, further protests broke out in Kenosha which resulted in 2 protesters being shot and killed. = La Crosse = On the evening of May 29 and 30, 2020, there were peaceful protests held in downtown La Crosse. June 3: Nearly 700 protesters marched from Riverside Park and to City Hall. Demonstrators kneeled for nine minutes and speakers talked about their own local experiences of racism. In response the Lac Crosse Police Department launched a \\"transparency tab\\" on their website to better inform the public on how they operate. = Madison = On May 30, there was a peaceful demonstration at the State Capitol with around 1,000 attendees. As the evening progressed, it evolved into a minor riot with some storefronts on State Street being damaged, and a conflict with police that was met with tear gas. A neighborhood curfew was declared by Mayor Satya Rhodes-Conway. On June 23, in response to the arrest of activist Devonere Johnson, who had caused a disturbance in a restaurant with a baseball bat and a bullhorn, around 300 protesters blocked traffic, caused damage to several buildings, and toppled two statues. State Senator Tim Carpenter was also attacked by protesters. = Marinette = On the early afternoon of June 3, a peaceful protest was held on Stephenson Island, which is on the state line between Wisconsin and Michigan and alongside US HWY 41. Close to 100 protestors attended. Some local businesses were boarded up and closed for the day, and another business had volunteer personal in army camouflage, armed with semi-automatic rifles standing-by. Many drove by flipping the bird and swearing at protestors but no violence erupted. = Milwaukee = In Milwaukee, as of June 9, protesters have been demonstrating for 12 days. On May 29, hundreds of protesters blocked highways and organized a vehicle procession that traveled several miles. There were reports of looting and mild arson at a Walgreens pharmacy, as well as the looting of a Boost Mobile store. Several other businesses were damaged. In addition, one police officer was mildly injured by gunfire. Protests over the killing of Joel Acevedo by an off-duty Milwaukee police officer were prompted by the George Floyd protests. = Shorewood = On , thousands of people protested peacefully in a march from Shorewood to Whitefish Bay and back. Hand sanitizer, masks, snacks, and bottles of water were handed out by volunteers. Residents along the route showed their support by standing in their yards holding up signs.https://shepherdexpress.com/news/happening-now/saturday-protest-hits- streets-of-shorewood-and-whitefish-bay/ A 64-year-old white probate lawyer interrupted the protest by parking in the middle of the street and then spat on a 17-year-old black high school student. The spitter was arrested and faced both \\"charges of battery and disorderly conduct\\" and \\"a professional misconduct complaint as a lawyer\\". The following day, the spitter confronted protesters outside her house, and police arrived at her home to arrest her. Resisting arrest, the spitter kneed one of the officers in the groin, and faced \\"additional charges of battery of a law enforcement officer and resisting arrest\\".https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/06/09/shorewood- protest-spitting-arrest/ = Wausau = On the afternoon of May 29, approximately 150 to 200 people participated in a protest near the Marathon County Courthouse in downtown Wausau.

In a letter found in the Archives of the Society of Jesus (S.J.) dated December 19, 1561, Anrique Anriquez the first Mannar parish priest (1561-1564) gives details to how rapidly the island was converted, and churches and hospital built all around the island. The Christians of the island of Mannar were held up as a model. He wrote since their arrival, over a thousand people converted to Christianity. The zeal of the inhabitants of Mannar to become Christians In their book on the life of St. Francis Xavier, Daniello Bartoli and Giovanni Maffei stated ‚Äúthat of the many various States which sent to ask Xavier to come and impart the light of Gospel none is so deserving of remembrance, none deserving of praise as we say of a holy envy as the Mannarese who prove themselves the beautiful models and masters of patience and heroic fortitude to the whole of that new Eastern Church. With them the reception of Baptism and shedding of their blood, the birth unto Christ and their death for Christ went hand in hand. So rapidly did the fruit ripen of which God has blessed the seed, that they who yesterday were idolaters and today Christians and would be tomorrow be Martyrs‚Äù. Jesuit historian Fern√£o de Queir√≥z expressed similar admiration towards the deputation. ‚ÄúThe chief men of Mannar moved by Divine Spirit send deputation to St Francis Xavier to signify to him the disposition that were therein and the importance of his visiting and account which he would have to give to God if he failed to visit.‚Äù They had heard of the devotion and the earnestness and personal holiness of St. Francis and of the conversion of those in India. The deputation from Mannar came from the homogenous community in Careapatao. Since the saint was engaged in baptising and pastoral care of new converts he was unable to go at that time. St Francis Xavier chose a native cleric, Francis Xavier and told him ‚ÄúI entrust to you the enterprise of Mannar. Wherein I trust in the Lord you will reap such great fruits. Go my son, and may God help you‚Äù. Cleric Francis set out at once with the envoys, who though they regretted not to take the saint with them were greatly relieved to learn from him they would have him later on in that island. Cleric Francis Xavier reached Mannar where he was well received and in a short time catechised a vast number of inhabitants of Mannar. He baptised up to six hundred person with usual ceremonies, thoroughly well grounded in the Faith as their constancy showed. The Martyrdom The temple priests learned the reports of a new religion and marched to Nallur to represent to the King Cankili I the outrage of a Minister of another religion going about his territories perverting the people and setting against him. They told the king new converts razing temples and idols and an unknown God was worshiped in their place. They told him unless he took prompt action, he would soon find himself without a kingdom, idols and temples. The king issued an edict ‚Äúrenounce Christianity or die‚Äù. The new converts many who were in the service of this King in Mannar could have foreseen the consequence they would face by becoming Christians because they were aware the tyrant king who seized the throne in 1519 hate of Portuguese and Christianity. The king immediately mustered five thousand men from the coast of mainland and Jaffnapatnam and set out for Mannar. He met with no other resistance than that of tears which some shed out of consolation and joy at seeing the constancy with which others died. The smallest children crying out when their mothers tried to hide them from seeing their companions beheaded, they offered their throat to the executioners with the wonderful power of faith. The king known for his other tyrannies was their Captain and spared neither sex nor age. Daniello Bartoli & Giovanni Maffei provide a similar account about the martyrdom. The edict was executed with as much cruelty as it was given, without distinction of age, sex or rank. Men, women, youth and infancy, in a word whoever received baptism were ruthlessly slaughtered. The king swore not to leave one of them alive. Admirable indeed were the effects of Grace of Baptism. As each one in turn was asked whether he or she were Christian, whereas a negative answer would at once have placed their lives in a safety so generous were these neophytes that far from having recourse to subterfuge, they boldly confessed the Faith. Fathers and mothers answering for their little ones to whom age has yet denied the power of speech. Between six and seven hundred were slain on this occasion. The place of their Martyrdom called Pasim(Patim) deserve a more noble name and accordingly from this date it has been called the Land of Martyrs. Queiroz mentioned Cleric Francis Xavier and Uraccinga (llam Singai) a sort of Governor- tributary prince were martyred. There is also an old tradition recorded by Dr. Bonjean in the Missions Catholiques of Lyons that the king and his executioners were on hot pursuit for a convert named Santa Cruz as he had been going about among the Christians comforting and encouraging them to lay down their lives joyfully for God. Executioners severed his head with one stroke of the sword. Martyrdom likely occurred between October 1544 and December 1544, most likely in November or early December. The Portuguese called Mannar Island Illa dos Martyres. Henrique Henriques in his letter dated December 19, 1561 wrote ‚Äúhalf a league from the Fortress is place which they called Patim‚Äù. He stated in it were the Christians of the same island who were already Christians before they came to this Island. He further wrote ‚Äú It is true that at the time we came to inhabit it they were out of the said island on account of the injuries (cruelties) done by the king of that country with whom we were at war and are so now‚Äù. He stated there were two villages where Christians lived and a little more than a league from Patim there is a larger village of Christians Some of the converts who had escaped by boats to Mantota in mainland returned to their village at Patim when Jesuits of the Fishery Coast came to Mannar with their flocks in 1560. Carea patao according to Georg Schurhammer, refers to the little village of Patim. Christians of the smaller village were the first converts of Cleric Francis Xavier. In 1945 Fr. Antoninus, O.M.I. using ancient maps of Mannar from Survey Department find the site known to local residents as Paddi Theravai (open plain of Patti) about half a mile west of the 2nd mile post on Mannar- Talaimannar Rord to be the location of Patim. Excavation carried out by Fr. Antoninus in that location found ruins of a Church, a broken down altar, and several skeletons lying in all directions , some belonging to children , others with heads got separated. Also a skeleton lying with head slightly turned and part of the bones on the edges showed reddish colour. New converts would have congregated for prayers and were massacred and place of worship destroyed to wipe out Christianity. Fr. Antoninus also found a coin and Dr. Paranavitana then archeologist identified it as a Roman coin with words \\"Claudius Imperator\\" that suggest the possibility of Christian community in Mannar during Roman time when Mantota was the centre of International trade route. In 2018, while excavating for building construction near Mannar Fort over 300 human skeletal remains including children were found. Hundreds of people also died due to pestilence few years after the killing of new converts. Investigations are being carried out to find the cause of death. According to Carbon dating done by Beta Analytic, the samples belong to a period 1400 AD to 1650 AD. Cause for Canonization The Vatican Congregation for the Causes of Saints had given the go-ahead for the diocesan inquiry for the canonisation. Prior to the establishment of Congregation in 1588 , martyrs were recognised for their heroic virtue were declared saints by local churches. St Francis Xavier, under the Padroado agreement was the ambassador of the Pope Paul III and King John III missionary to the East Indies. Since St Francis Xavier and missionaries considered Mannar Martyrs as Blessed and sought Martyrs intercession before God, Mannar martyrs thus seemed to meet the criteria of that time to be considered as martyrs of Catholic church. St. Francis Xavier in his letter dated January 27, 1545 to Jesuit fathers in Rome wrote ‚ÄúThanks be given to God our Lord because we do not lack martyrs in our time. And that while he sees so few souls themselves of all his divine mercy and indulgence to work out their salvation. He permits in the mystery of his providence that human barbarity should fill up the destined ranks and number of the Blessed.‚Äù Miguel Vaz, the Vicar General of Goa when he reached Portugal in October 1545, gave detail account of the Martyrdom to king John III as he heard from St. Francis Xavier. King immediately wrote to Jesuit Superior asking for more missionaries to be sent to India. Fr. Le Fevre, the Visiting General of the Jesuits exclaimed ‚ÄúI do not know to give expression to all that my soul has felt in Jesus Christ on learning about the glorious death of the six hundreds Martyrs of India. How happy we would be if we could possess in Europe the relics of their bodies and of their blood- we who are the elders in Faith.\\" Dominique Bouhours in his book, the life of St.Francis Xavier mentioned about St Francis Xavier visit to Mannar and praying to God offering the merits of the Martyrs to end pestilence in Mannar. When Saint Francis Xavier visited Mannar after the martyrdom, he reverently kissed the ground which had been moistened with the blood of martyrs of Pasim (Patim). While he rejoiced at the happiness of the dead, he had the reason to be afflicted at the misery of the living as a contagious disease laid waste the island and daily carried off a hundred persons. When Manarese were told that the great father so celebrated throughout India was at Pasim, three thousand of them most of whom were pagans assembled and most earnestly besought him to deliver them from the pestilence. Xavier demanded three days that he might ask of God the favour which they sought. During this time his prayer principally consisted in offering up to God the merits of the blessed Martyrs who had suffered for his name at Pasim. Before the termination of the three days, his prayers were heard. The plague ceased and all the sick were simultaneously restored to health. So visible an interposition of God‚Äôs power caused them to believe in Jesus Christ and demand baptism which they received from the Apostle. ReferencesExternal references * 1.

Life  Born in Potsdam,Steinhausen studied medicine in Berlin and became chief physician and corps doctor of the XVI Corps (German Empire). Stations of his career were Hannover. (1903), Gda≈Ñsk (1907) and Metz (1908). As a violinist by birth, he dealt with questions of music making at an early age and sought new, scientifically sound forms for the optimal handling of this instrument.His works on piano technique, which are still significant today, were created in collaboration with the pianist Tony Bandmann. (1848-1907) and were directed against the outdated ideas of regarding this as a pure \\"finger technique\\". Steinhausen's more complex, body-related view found numerous supporters, including the physiologist Otto Fischer. (1861-1916) and the piano teachers Ludwig Deppe (1828-1890), whose pupil Elisabeth Caland (1862-1929) and Rudolf Maria Breithaupt (1873-1945), even if they did not always share all of Steinhausen's views. Steinhausen studied for years the movements of the violinists' shoulder and arm, also on the basis of his practice as an amateur of the instrument. In 1903 he published the fruit of his research in a book published in Leipzig: Die Physiologie der Bogenf√ºhrung auf den Streich- Instrumenten (Physiology of the conduct of the bow on stringed instruments). Already in this study there are references to piano technique, to which he dedicated a specific and fundamental treatment in the volume √úber die physiologischen Fehler und die Umgestaltung der Klaviertechnik (On Physiological Errors and the Transformation of Piano Technique), also published in Leipzig in 1905. In the history of piano technique Steinhausen plays an essential role: he illustrated the physiological foundations of the modern \\"weight technique\\", which between the nineteenth and twentieth centuries replaced (or at least corrected) the traditional technique based on the \\"articulation of the fingers\\" and their \\"independence\\" (which was at the time the basis of all the \\"piano methods\\", such as the widespread one of Lebert and Stark). Steinhausen's work on piano technique was due to the insistence of the pianist (a pupil of Ludwig Deppe), teacher and painter, Tony Bandmann, who already in 1893 in a study on the formation of piano sound (Tonbildung und Technik auf dem Klavier) had stressed the importance of the use of weight and the \\"shoulder-arm-hand chain\\". Steinhausen exerted a great influence on numerous pianists, teachers and scholars of piano technique between the 19th and 20th centuries, among them Breithaupt.  The Physiological Basics of the Weight Technique  The technique of the great pianists has very little to do, according to Steinhausen, with the technique that was then theorized in the \\"methods\\". The first, based on the use of \\"weight\\", is simply the \\"natural\\" or \\"physiological\\" technique, while the second, which considers the digital movement fundamental, constitutes an artificial and antiphysiological construction. The traditional digital technique aimed at the \\"articulation\\" and \\"independence\\" of the fingers is based on three erroneous assumptions: it misunderstands the organological characteristics of the piano, distorts the true nature of \\"exercise\\", understanding it as merely mechanical \\"gymnastics\\", and completely misunderstands the physiological movements that preside over the piano movements, identifying them with the only digital movementFriedrich A. Steinhausen, √úber die physiologischen Fehler und die Umgestaltung der Klaviertechnik Leipzig, 1905, p. 81. In order to obtain from the piano all the rich range of sounds the instrument is capable of, it is necessary instead to use, as great pianists have always done and do, the great muscles of the arm and shoulder, which \\"occurs without stiffening anything, but in a state of relaxation and passivity of the muscles: The \\"mass\\", i.e. the shoulder-arm- hand-drop system, is in fact set in motion by fully exploiting gravity, i.e. the inertial weight (\\"fall\\"); the impulse is thus given by a movement of momentum (\\"Schwungbewegung\\") of the entire arm mass from the shoulder down; the muscular work (contraction) is therefore of very short duration, it simply gives the impulse and then immediately abandons the mass to its moments of inertia; before and after the impulse there is an identical state of passivity, relaxation and absence of contraction of all the muscles\\" Paolo Spagnolo - Giovanni Stelli, Pianosophia. Tecnica e arte, Naples, 2008, Guide, p. 40.. Playing in a natural way means \\"carrying\\" or \\"unloading\\" the weight on the fingertips which act as supports. The weight or the \\"load used in playing\\" (Spielbelastung) lies between the two purely theoretical boundaries of the \\"maximum load\\". (Maximalbelastung), in which all muscles work actively to unload the shoulder-arm-hand system downwards, and the \\"zero load\\" (Nullbelastung), in which the muscular work equal and contrary to the weight of the arm keeps the limb suspended without support and moves it upwards. The experienced pianist is able to use infinite degrees of \\"weight\\", dosing each time the amount of weight to be transferred to the fingertips in order to obtain the widest and richest range of sounds Ivi, pp. 40 sg.; Friedrich A. Steinhausen, √úber die physiologischen Fehler und die Umgestaltung der Klaviertechnik Leipzig, 1905, . It is therefore clear that the fingers do not have an independent function at all: they are, first of all, supports. However, in order to transfer the weight from one finger to the other, especially at speed, the forearm rotation must intervene in order to help the movement of momentum (\\"Schwungbewegung\\"). Understanding the essential function of forearm rotation \\"sweeps away all false precepts about the \\"articulation\\" of isolated fingers and the consequent myths of \\"independence\\" and \\"equality\\" of the fingers. In reality the articulation of the isolated fingers is physiologically impossible; the fingers behave not as hammers, but as spokes of a wheel rotating around the axis of rotation constituted by the elbow-wrist line, so their agility on the fingerboard depends only on the rotation movement of the forearm\\", they are fingertip-rotation \\"on which the mass of the arm momentarily rests and then discharges again into the momentum (Schwung)\\"Friedrich A. Steinhausen, √úber die physiologischen Fehler und die Umgestaltung der Klaviertechnik], Leipzig, 1905, . Steinhausen died in Boppard at the age of 51.

Plot  The show potrays the Leelas of the Hindu goddess Adi Parashakti, the wife of Lord Shiva and (sister of Lord Vishnu in her avatars as Goddesses Sati and later Parvati). The story begins with Shiva's questions on The Self and how he discovers that it was the Supreme Goddess Adi Parashakti who created him, Vishnu and Brahma. She reveals herself after Shiva destroys Brahma's arrogance; and imparts true wisdom of who She is to the Tridevas. She then assumes three different forms: Saraswati - who weds Brahma, Lakshmi - who weds Vishnu and Shakti - who becomes Shiva's beloved and resides with them in their respective abodes. The show then solely focuses on Shakti's journey from Kailasha to Earth as Sati, the daughter of Daksha, who, prompted by his daughter Diti, separates Shiva and Shakti. After Sati discovers Shiva, who Daksha disapproves of and abhors, she falls in love with him. He gives up Sati and she moves to Kailasha where she marries Shiva. In an attempt to humiliate Shiva and Sati, Daksha performs a yagya inviting the residents of all the realms, with the sole exceptions being the residents of Kailasha. Sati, however, goes to the yagya, is humiliated, and immolates herself in the presence of all those gathered. Angry, Shiva and Shakti kill Daksha, thus avenging Sati by assuming the terrible forms of Veerabhadra and Bhadrakali. Later on, Daksha is resurected, Sati's body is cut up into fifty-two peices - which becomes Shakti Peethas, and a sorrowfull Shiva self-isolates in the caves of the Himalayas. In due course of time, an Asura named Tarakasura, a son of Diti, obtains a boon from Brahma that he would only be killed by an offspring of Shiva. Thinking of himself as immortal in light of Shiva becoming a hermit after Sati's death, he displaces the Devas, the mortal enemies of the Asuras. At the behest of Vishnu, the Devi takes birth once again as Parvati, the daughter of the Himalayas. She too, just like in her previous life as Sati, falls in love with Shiva. She finds him in the caves of her father's kingdom and sits at his feet, meditating upon him. In a rush to awaken Shiva so that he would fall in love with Devi again and have a son who could kill Tarakasura, the Devas deploy Kama, the God of Love, who is burnt to ashes by Shiva for disturbing his trance. Shiva, although aware of Parvati's devotion and love towards him, behaves indifferently to her. When she tries to speak to him, he informs her that only after she passed some of his tests would she obtain the desire of her hearts. Parvati takes him on his challenge, and Shiva puts her through various trials, in Kashi and in Kailasha, all of which she passes, impressing Shiva, who agrees to marry her.

His views and influence on policies have set off controversies on the task force. Early life and education Atlas received a Bachelor of Science degree in biology from the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign and his MD from the Pritzker School of Medicine of the University of Chicago.  Career and views  Atlas is the Robert Wesson Senior Fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution, a conservative public policy think tank. From 1998 to 2012, he was Professor and Chief of Neuroradiology at Stanford University Medical Center. He is the editor of Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain and Spine, a 2,000-page illustrated textbook with 83 contributors. He has also written four books on health care policy. Atlas served as a senior advisor for health care to the Republican presidential campaigns of Rudy Giuliani in 2008 and Mitt Romney in 2012. He has advocated eliminating the Affordable Care Act (the ACA or \\"Obamacare\\") and replacing it with modified tax deductions and incentives. He has also called for changes to Medicare and \\"aggressive reforms\\" to turn Medicaid \\"into a bridge to private insurance\\" and encourage health savings accounts. Atlas views the Medicaid expansion as \\"one of the most misguided parts\\" of the ACA. He opposes proposals to establish a public health insurance optionScott W. Atlas, Public Option Kills Private Insurance, Wall Street Journal (July 16, 2019). or single-payer healthcare.Scott W. Atlas, The Dangers of Medicare for All. The New York Times (March 9, 2020).  Trump administration  On August 10, 2020, President Donald Trump announced that Atlas would join his administration as an advisor on COVID-19. News articles pointed out that Atlas, a radiologist, is not a specialist in public health or infectious diseases. Atlas has advocated for physical school reopening and resumption of college sports during the pandemic. The Washington Post reported that Atlas was the leading proponent within the Trump administration for a \\"herd immunity\\" approach to the virus. In an interview with Fox News's Brian Kilmeade in July, Atlas said: \\"These people getting the infection is not really a problem, and in fact, as we said months ago, when you isolate everyone, including all the healthy people, you're prolonging the problem because you‚Äôre preventing population immunity. Low-risk groups getting the infection is not a problem. In fact, it's a positive.\\" Atlas denied later that he advocated for the herd immunity strategy,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dr-atlas-denies-promoting-herd- immunity-coronavirus said \\"there's never been a desire to have cases spread through the community,\\" and said it \\"has never been the president's policy.\\" Atlas has claimed that children \\"have virtually zero risk of dying, and a very, very low risk of any serious illness from this disease\\" and \\"children almost never transmit the disease\\" although children can carry, transmit, and be killed by the COVID-19 virus. He has argued that only symptomatic individuals should be tested for the coronavirus, and pushed for the CDC's August 2020 recommendation that non-symptomatic people not be tested; this position was opposed by many public health experts, as 40% of people infected with the virus are asymptomatic and can transmit the virus. He has expressed skepticism that face masks are effective \\"scientifically\\" to halt the spread of the virus, although the broad scientific consensus is that face masks do prevent the spread of the virus. Atlas quickly became influential within the administration, and Trump has welcomed his recommendations such as faster reopening and less testing, which are in accord with Trump's own preferences. Atlas was the only doctor to share the stage at Trump's pandemic briefings in the week after his appointment was announced, and he has also prepared Trump's briefing materials. Trump has publicly disagreed with or reduced the roles of his other COVID-19 medical advisors, Deborah Birx and Anthony Fauci. Atlas has denied any intention of replacing Fauci or other task force members. Atlas is said to have alienated Birx and Robert R. Redfield of the CDC with his controversial ideas. Redfield was heard privately commenting on Atlas that \\"everything he says is false\\". When Fauci was asked whether Atlas was providing misleading information to Trump, Fauci replied, without naming Atlas, that \\"sometimes there are things that are said that are really taken either out of context or actually incorrect\\". During stimulus negotiations in fall 2020, Atlas opposed funds for widespread COVID-19 testing; in an email to an economist, Atlas wrote that the push for testing was \\"a fundamental error of the public health people perpetrated on the world.\\" Atlas's influence on policy has alarmed many doctors and health experts. In September 2020, 78 of Atlas's former colleagues at the Stanford Medical School signed an open letter criticizing Atlas, writing that he had made \\"falsehoods and misrepresentations of science\\" that \\"run counter to established science\\" and \\"undermine public health authorities and the credible science that guides effective public health policy.\\" Atlas's lawyer Marc Kasowitz threatened to sue the researchers. After Trump was diagnosed with coronavirus, Atlas appeared on Fox News on October 2, 2020, predicted a \\"complete and full and rapid recovery\\" for Trump, and urged viewers not to panic. On October 18, 2020, Twitter removed a tweet by Atlas for \\"falsely claiming masks don't work to prevent the spread of coronavirus.\\" Later that day, a more senior member of the administration, Assistant Secretary of HHS Adm. Brett Giroir, tweeted, \\"#Masks work? YES!\\" Dr. Deborah Birx, another member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, was reported to be \\"relieved\\" by the removal of Atlas's tweet.

Geology Fiery Creek begins in hills that contain granite and erode to produce granitic sand. Much of its course is across almost-flat farmland. Towards the end of its course, it reaches a former lava flow which interrupts the course and leads it west to Lake Bolac.

Stream flow at Streatham has been recorded for over 100 years. It has increasing periods of zero flow, but the record flow was over in January 2011. Gold rush Fiery Creek was involved in the Victorian gold rush in the 1850s. The diggings were in the upper reaches near Raglan. The post office that is now Streatham was named Fiery Creek, and mail was regularly addressed and sent to the wrong place. Gold was discovered near Beaufort in 1852, in tributaries of Fiery Creek, and north of Beaufort in Fiery Creek from 1854. The population on the fields was 50,000 in 1855 and reportedly reached approximately 100,000 people at its height in the late 1850s and produced 450,000 ounces of gold over a two-year period, 1855‚Äì1856.

Along with it a small gopura, in a different style is found. It is presumed that there might have been a gopura earlier and might have been destroyed. In due course it might have been built. As Varaha saved the earth from the asura, Kali in order to save from asuras, as Varahi appeared and worshipped the presiding deity. Kamadhenu did penance in this place. So many places were identified by cows. This is one such sacred place. The presiding deity was worshipped by the cow and so the Goddess was known as Palvalanayaki.

From 1864 to 1920, like the rest of Southern Jutland, Toftlund was a part of Prussia. But it first in 1870 that it became more than a few houses and farms. The Prussians needed an administrative center and chose Toftlund as the site for a new town where they could house and employ German administrators from the south. Many of the buildings in Toftlund survive from this time, with many being built in a German stylehttps://toender.dk/sites/default/files/borger/udviklingsplan_toftlund_2020.pdf. From 1904 to 1939, Toftlund had a train station that connected it to nearby Haderslev. There are bunkers in the forest from the first world war which were a part of a network of bunkers (Security Position North) across Southern Jutland. Before the Municipal Reform of 2007, Toftlund was the administrative center of N√∏rre-Rangstrup Municipality.  Music and Theater House  Toftlund's Music and Theater Performance House In 1990, as an extension of the folk high school, plans were completed for the construction of performance hall in the center of Toftlund. The architect Carsten Hoff and Susanne Ussing were hired to design it, and construction was completed in 1990. The building is made mainly of wood, but with a frame and walls of cement. The total area is 1430 m2, including a foyer and second basement stage for theater productions.  Brundtland City  Brundtland Center In 1990, Toftlund started an EU-supported project on energy efficiency in partnership with the German town Bredstedt in the border state of Schleswig-Holstein. Toftlund was declared Denmark‚Äôs first Brundtland city by the Brundtland Commissionhttps://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/NNE5-72-1999. The Brundtland Center was built with the funds. Located at the southern end of the town, the center housed several different companies dedicated to producing energy efficient products.  Development Plan Toftlund  In 2018, T√∏nder Municipality approved 17 million Danish kroner for a renewal project for the city of Toftlund. The plans are to be developed together with the various organizations within Toftlund, with the aim being to make Toftlund a more desirable place to live and raise a family. The former city council was disbanded and replaced with a new council with representatives from the various segments of society.

M√∏ller's research has been focused on neuroplasticity, intraoperative neurophysiology and teaching topics such as the biology of pain and fear, anxiety and other emotions. Some of his research has dealt with auditory neurophysiology, neuroplasticity, and tinnitus. He has written over 210 peer-reviewed journal articles, 112 chapters in professional books, 11 books, and, has edited nine others. In 1977 he founded the international journal, Hearing Research, Elsevier Science Publishers, and remained the journal's Editor‚Äëin‚ÄëChief for 27 years. M√∏ller is a fellow of the Acoustical Society of America and the American Neurotology Society. In 2006, he was honored by a special issue of the journal Hearing Research.  Early life and education  M√∏ller was born in Finderup, Denmark on April 16, 1932 and grew up in rural Denmark. After being drafted for military service in the Danish Army, servicing radar equipment, he moved to Sweden where he attended the Karolinska Institute earning the degree of Doctor of Medicine. In 1965, he passed the certification exam required for teaching at a university in Sweden. After his doctoral dissertation, he got the position as Docent (assistant professor) at the Karolinska Institute where he taught and did research in auditory neuroscience, studying the function of a nipple pattern on insect eyes and human chromosomes. From 1972 to 1978, he had a position of Research Physician at the Swedish Medical Research Council. M√∏ller had fellowships at the Research Laboratory of Electronics Massachusetts Institute of Technology Cambridge, and The Johns Hopkins University Department Biomedical Engineering Baltimore.  Career and research  In the 1960s, when M√∏ller came from Denmark to the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) as a technician, he began his own research related to the function of the middle ear and he developed a model of the transmission properties of the middle ear and the acoustic middle ear reflexes. In 1961, M√∏ller designed a sound stimulating system for animal research. In 1963, M√∏ller moved to the Department of Physiology II at the Karolinska Institute doing auditory neurophysiological studies supported by private grants and grants from the Swedish Medical Research Council. At the Karolinska Institut, he studied the dynamic properties of a neural system.M√∏ller, A.R. (1972) Coding of sounds in lower levels of the auditory system. Quart. Rev. Biophys. 5, 59-115. PMID: 4556809 DOI: 10.1017/s0033583500000044 He conducted some of the first studies of the neural coding of complex (speech-like) sounds in the cochlear nucleus and showed that neural processing in the auditory nervous system is far more complex than earlier believed. He used different kinds of speech-like sounds as stimuli including pseudorandom noise in connection with Winer kernel. He also showed that the frequency selectivity of the cochlea depends on the intensity of the sounds that reached the earM√∏ller, A.R. (1974) Coding of sounds with rapidly varying spectrum in the cochlear nucleus. J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 55, 631-640.

PMID: 893812 DOI: 10.1121/1.381495 M√∏ller studied how exposure to loud noise may become a health hazard and he gave several presentations about \\"Noise as a health hazard\\" at national and international conferences such as at the Congress \\"Science in the Americas\\" Mexico city in 1973.M√∏ller, A.R. (1975) Noise as a health hazard. Ambio 4, 6-13. https://www.jstor.org/stable/4312099 M√∏ller became involved in legal regulations of noise exposure, and 1975 he served as a Witness for a US Department of Labor's Hearing on Noise Standards, Washington, DC. From 1972 to 1978, he was the Director of Research on Acoustic Communication in Insects, International Center of Insect Physiology and Ecology, Nairobi, Kenya, where he studied the sounds of the tsetse flies as a possible communication that could be interfered with for the purpose of controlling tsetse flies which are a pest in Africa.Erickson, C. and M√∏ller, A.R. (1975) The tsetse fly Glossina morsitans produces ultrasound related to behavior. Experientia 31, 788-790. doi: 10.1007/BF01938467 While at the Karolinska Institut in the late 1960s, M√∏ller worked with Carl Gustaf Bernhard and William Miller who earlier had found that some night insects had a peculiar pattern of protuberances on the corneas, and M√∏ller found that this pattern on the surface of night moths corneas functions as a very efficient antireflection coating of the insect eyes. This work was done using models of the insect eyes made from beeswax and the reflection from the model with the protuberances were compared with the reflection after the protuberance were removed.Bernhard, C.G., Miller, W.H., and M√∏ller, A.R. (1963) Function of the corneal nipples in the compound eyes of insects. Acta Physiol. Scand. 58, 381-382. PMID: 14078656 DOI: 10.1111/j.1748-1716.1963.tb02661.xBernhard, C.G., Gemne, G., and M√∏ller, A.R. (1968) Modification of specular reflection and light transmission by biological surface structures.

PMID: 4885735 DOI: 10.1017/s0033583500000470 The reflection of the model with 3 cm protuberance were measured with electromagnetic (radar) waves in the 3-cm wavelength range. In the early 1970s, M√∏ller worked with Torbj√∂rn Casperson and Lore Zech at the Medical Cell Research and Genetics Department at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm on the identification of human chromosomes. Casperson and Zech had earlier developed a new way of staining the chromosomes using a quinacrine mustard stain that made chromosomes fluorescence with a band pattern that they believed was unique for each of the 24 different types of human chromosomes.Caspersson, T. and Zech, L. (1972) Mammalian Chromosomes, European Journal of Endocrinology S67‚ÄìS85 Volume 71 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1530/acta.0.071S0067 M√∏ller created a computer algorithm that, for the first time, made it possible to automatically distinguish between individual chromosomes,M√∏ller, A.R., Nilsson, H., Caspersson, T., and Lomakka, G. (1972) Identifi¬¨cation of human chromosome regions by aid of computerized pattern analysis. Exp. Cell Res. 70: 475 478. DOI: 10.1016/0014-4827(72)90171-1 which also proved that the band-pattern on the quinacrine mustard stained chromosome was unique for each of the 24 human chromosome pairs. M√∏ller joined the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine in 1978, first as a research professor at the Department of Otolaryngology and later as a tenured full professor of neurological surgery at the Department of Neurological Surgery, where he did research in the area of neurosurgery and intraoperative neurophysiology. He developed methods for reducing the risks of neurological deficits after neurosurgical operations using electrophysiological recording during neurosurgical operations.M√∏ller, A.R. (2010) Intraoperative Neurophysiologic Monitoring, 3rd Edition, Springer, 403 pages. Working with the neurosurgeon Peter Jannetta in the 1980s, M√∏ller used electrophysiologic recordings from brain structures that were exposed during neurosurgical operations to study the pathophysiology of a disorder known as hemifacial spasm. M√∏ller found evidence that the spasm was created by the facial motor nucleus probably through the process of activation of neuroplasticity and not by the pathologies of the facial nerve where it was in contact with a blood vessel. M√∏ller, A.R. and Jannetta, P.J. (1984) On the origin of synkinesis in hemifacial spasm: Results of intracranial recordings. J. Neurosurg. 61, 569-576 doi: 10.3171/jns.1984.61.3.0569. These studies also improved the outcome of operations for hemifacial spasm. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, M√∏ller was one of the founders of a new subspecialty of neurological surgery and orthopedic surgery that is now known as Intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (IONM). The purpose of this subspecialty is to reduce the risk of postoperative deficits from inadvertent damage to structures in the brain and the spinal cord by using electrophysiological techniques to detect changes in functions that occurs during surgical manipulations in the removal of brain tumors and other surgical operations. Together with another neurosurgeon, Laligam Sekhar, M√∏ller introduced the use of intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (IONM) in surgical operations for large skull base tumors reducing the risks of postoperative deficitsM√∏ller, A.R. (1987) Electrophysiological monitoring of cranial nerves in operations in the skull base. In: Tumors of the Cranial Base: Diagnosis and Treatment, Chap. 7. L.N. Sekhar and V.L. Schramm, Jr. (eds.). Futura Publishing Co., Inc., Mt. Kisco, New York, pp. 123-132. and other improvements of the outcome of surgical treatment of large brain tumors, including preservation of the function of the facial nerve in operations for tumors on the balance nerve.M√∏ller, A.R. and Jannetta, P.J. (1984) Preservation of facial function during removal of acoustic neuromas: Use of monopolar constant-voltage stimulation and EMG. J. Neurosurg. 61, 757-760. DOI: 10.3171/jns.1984.61.4.0757 Before the use of IONM techniques, surgical removal of large acoustic tumors almost inevitably led to a paralysis of the mimic muscles of the face of the side of the tumor. M√∏ller joined The University of Texas at Dallas School of Human Development in 1997. There he was elected to the Margaret MF Jonsson Endowed Chair. In Dallas, M√∏ller working with Janet Kern, found that some persons with autism spectrum disorder seemed to use their non-classical sensory pathways in the brain to a greater extent than persons who did not have autism.M√∏ller, A.R. Kern, J.K. Grannemann B. (2005) Are the non-classical pathways involved in autism and PDD? Neurol Res, 625-629. PMID: 16157013 DOI: 10.1179/016164105X25117 Working with Pamela Rollins, he found signs that children seem to use the non-classical auditory pathways more than adults.M√∏ller, A.R and P. R. Rollins (2002) The non- classical auditory pathways are involved in hearing in children but not in adults, Neuroscience Letters, vol 319 (1) p 41-44. PMID: 11814649 DOI: 10.1016/s0304-3940(01)02516-2 In other studies, M√∏ller, together with M. Yokata and M√∏ller, M.B found signs that the non-classical ascending auditory pathways are involved in creating the symptoms of tinnitus.M√∏ller, A.R., M√∏ller, M.B., and Yokota, M. (1992) Some forms of tinnitus may involve the extralemniscal auditory pathway. Laryngoscope 102: 1165-1171. DOI: 10.1288/00005537-199210000-00012. PMID: 1405968 In 2011, he became a distinguished lecturer in behavioral and brain sciences at the University of Texas at Dallas and was elected to the Founders Endowed Chair.

Afterwards she studied piano with Marie Ja√´ll in Paris and 1884-86 with Ludwig Deppe in Berlin, after which she continued her education with Anna and Horace F. Clark-Steiniger (both were also students of Deppe), and 1895-96 with (music theory). She first taught piano in Wiesbaden, since 1898 in Berlin and since 1915 in Gehlsdorf and Rostock. She represented Deppe's conception of piano playing by means of coordinated movement of the whole arm instead of an isolated finger movement that emerged from harpsichord playing. She advocated this way of playing, which was in confrontation with the usual way of playing at the time. She was the first to establish the conscious lowering of the shoulder blade as an art movement to develop the back muscles as a source of strength when playing the piano, which she taught practically. She also introduced the shaking movement from the shoulder into the methodology as a systematic basis for the execution of tremolo figures and trills. She wrote several books on piano technique, in which she described the \\"Deppe's method\\", as well as articles in the journal Musikp√§dagogische Bl√§tter. Caland died in Berlin at the age of 57.

Michel Ney attacked the Swedish bridgehead at the Elbe, to stop the Army of the North from crossing the river. The Swedish commander Johan August Sandels counterattacked and chased the French for before being forced to retire himself. About 350 Swedes were dead and wounded while the French had at least 1,500, according to Swedish sources. The battle had no strategic effects, but it was one of very few times in the war that a Swedish force was fully committed in battle. Background A French force under Michel Ney had received orders from Napoleon I to attack the Swedish bridgehead over the Elbe river, at Ro√ülau, to stop the Army of the North (under the Swedish Crown Prince Charles John) from reaching Leipzig. After having fought a couple of skirmishes for control over Dessau, Ney marched his troops of about 7,000‚Äì8,000 men towards the Swedish left flank. The Swedes had around 4,000‚Äì4,500 men in the vicinity, led by Johan August Sandels; consisting of the Skaraborg (3 battalions), √Ñlvsborg (3 battalions) and V√§stg√∂ta (2 battalions) infantry regiments, along with one battalion of the V√§rmland j√§gers. Ney attacked on 29 September and ordered a vanguard of three battalions forward, in an attempt to quickly capture the Swedish bridgehead at Ro√ülau. Battle The Swedish outposts infront of the bridgehead were attacked early in the morning and, after several hours resistance, forced to retreat; Sandels organized his men during this time and, instead of receiving the attack behind the cover of the entrenchments‚Äîas was instructed by Crown Prince Charles John‚Äîcommenced a counterattack. One Skaraborg battalion and a detachment of j√§gers marched straight on the French forces in the open and stopped at a distance of just over before firing; shaken by the initial volley the French withdrew slightly to seek cover at a forest a distance away, by which time an intense firefight began. After receiving two additional Skaraborg battalions, the Swedes felt confident enough to launch a bayonet-attack, which threw the French forces back into the forest. The Swedes pursued for almost before the French, who progressively received more reinforcements the further back they went, were able to halt their advance; the outnumbered Swedes were in turn forced to withdraw towards the bridgehead, while the French were able to deploy a battery shooting at their flank and causing significant casualties among their ranks. Aftermath The Swedish casualties in the battle were about 350 killed and wounded; with 44 killed and 241 wounded attributed to the Skaraborg regiment alone. According to Swedish sources, the French had lost at least 1,500 men, most of whom were killed as they were pursued through the forest; between 700 and 800 of the killed French soldiers were reportedly buried inside Dessau. The Skargaborg infantry regiment had distinguished themselves especially. Some time later, as Ney returned to the Swedish bridgehead with his army, he disregarded an assault and instead attempted to blockade the Swedish entrenchments. Some progress was made but the operation was eventually cancelled with the news of the allied crossing of the Elbe, at Wartenburg, on 3 October. Having crossed the river, the allied armies were then able to encircle the French emperor and decisively defeat him at the Battle of Leipzig, on 16‚Äì19 October 1813. Because of Charles John's unwillingness to commit his Swedish troops on the battlefield‚Äîto save them for a forthcoming campaign in Norway‚Äîthe performance of the Swedes was often disregarded in German literature; as has been the case with this lesser-known battle. While it had no strategic effects at all, it was one of very few times in the war that a larger Swedish force was fully committed in battle.

He was initially concerned with accurate portrayals of native costumes, adornments and tattoos; knowledge that he would put to use with illustrations for the works of , a physician and ethnographer. Later, he would develop a greater interest in the character of the people themselves who, despite being poor and uneducated were, in his opinion, beautiful and noble, whereas cultured people were \\"ugly, petty and inelegant\\". He held numerous exhibitions in France, as well as in Tunis, and some of his paintings were purchased by the government. Many of his works may still be seen at official residences. Later in his life, he would find himself in competition with the increasingly popular group of artists known as the , led by . He died of tuberculosis at the French hospital in Tunis and was interred in the Russian section of the . In 1984, a major retrospective was held at the Ch√¢teau de Bagatelle, in Paris, in connection with the 100th anniversary of his birth. In 2010, he was paid homage in Tunisia with an exhibit called \\"Roubtzoff et la M√©dina\\"; 48 drawings he made in 1944, as well as a few paintings. Some of his works have been used for Tunisian postage stamps.

Life  Born in Hamburg, as a student of Ludwig Deppe, Bandmann was one of the first to have a clear theoretical understanding of the use of weight in piano technique. Since 1893, with a Study on tone formation and technique on the piano, she brought important reasons for the use of weight and the \\"shoulder-arm-hand chain\\" in tone formation, in contrast to the piano technique of the 19th century, which emerged from harpsichord playing and was based on \\"articulation\\" and \\"independence\\" of the fingers (described in the then famous piano school by Lebert and Stark). She collaborated with Friedrich Adolf Steinhausen, who wrote his fundamental work on the physiological principles of piano technique (1905) at her suggestion. She herself described the principles of weight technique in her 1907 treatise Die Gewichtstechnik des Klavierspiels,Die Gewichtstechnik des Klavierspiels on WorldCat in whose introduction Steinhausen writes: \\"Bandmann's work forms the continuation and completion of my study\\". Together with other pianists and piano pedagogues - mostly students of Deppe, such as Amy Fay, Elisabeth Caland, Hermann Klose and Horace F. Clark-Steiniger - Bandmann made a decisive contribution to the transformation of piano technique from the \\"finger technique\\" to the \\"weight technique\\": a transformation that took place at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century and had its most important supporters (although often with the most different positions) in Rudolf Maria Breithaupt in Germany, Blanche Selva in France, Tobias Matthay in England and in Italy. Bandmann died in Hamburg at the age of 69.

It was developed as the information management component of the ten year Census of Marine Life (CoML) (2001-2010), but is not limited to CoML- derived data, and aims to provide an integrated view of all marine biodiversity data that may be made available to it on an open access basis by respective data custodians. According to its web site as at July 2018, OBIS \\"is a global open-access data and information clearing-house on marine biodiversity for science, conservation and sustainable development.\\" 8 specific objectives are listed in the OBIS site, of which the leading item is to \\"Provide [the] world's largest scientific knowledge base on the diversity, distribution and abundance of all marine organisms in an integrated and standardized format\\".OBIS website (visited 18 July 2018) History and current status Initial ideas for OBIS were developed at a CoML meeting on benthic (bottom-dwelling) ocean life in October 1997. Recommendations from this workshop led to a web site (http://marine.rutgers.edu/OBIS) at Rutgers in 1998 to demonstrate the initial OBIS concept.Grassle, J.F. and Stocks, K.I., 1999. \\"A Global Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS) for the Census of Marine Life.\\" Oceanography 12(3): 12-14. An inaugural OBIS International Workshop was held on November 3‚Äì4 1999 in Washington, DC, which led to scoping of the project and outreach to potential partners, with selected contributions published in a special issue of Oceanography magazine,Oceanography Volume 13, no. 3, November 2000. Special Issue: Ocean Biogeographic Information System. within which OBIS founder Dr. J. F. Grassle articulated the vision of OBIS as \\"an on-line, worldwide atlas for accessing, modeling and mapping marine biological data in a multidimensional geographic context.\\"Grassle, J.F. 2000. \\"The Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS): an on-line, worldwide atlas for accessing, modeling and mapping marine biological data in a multidimensional geographic context.\\" Oceanography 13(3): 5-7. In May 2000, US Government Agencies in the National Oceanographic Partnership Program together with the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation funded eight research projects to initiate OBIS. In May 2001, the US National Science Foundation funded Rutgers University to develop a global portal for OBIS. Also in 2001, an OBIS International Committee was formed and its first meeting was held in August 2001.Zhang, Y. and Grassle, J.F. 2003. \\"A portal for the Ocean Biogeographic Information System.\\" Oceanologica Acta 25(5): 193-197. The production version of the OBIS Portal was launched at Rutgers University in 2002 as the web site http://www.iobis.org, serving 430,000 species-based georeferenced data records from 8 partner databases including fish records from FishBase, cephalopods from CephBase, corals from Biogeoinformatics of Hexacorals, mollusks from the Indo-Pacific Mollusc Database and more. By May 2006, the OBIS Portal was able to access 9.5 million records of 59,000 species from 112 databases, and by December 2010 (at the conclusion of the Census of Marine Life) provided access to 27.7 million records representing 167,000 taxon names.www.obis.org: archived version, 13 December 2010 As at July 2018, the OBIS website states that the system provides access to over 45 million observations of nearly 120,000 marine species (the reduced number of names cited being as a result of synonym resolution, i.e. reduction of taxa recorded under multiple names to a single accepted name), based on contributions from 500 institutions from 56 countries.About OBIS: archived version, 5 July 2018 In 2009 OBIS was adopted as a project by International Oceanographic Data and Information Exchange (IODE) programme of the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) of UNESCO and in 2011, with the cessation of funding for the Rutgers-based secretariat and portal from the Sloan Foundation, an offer of hosting by the Flanders Marine Institute (VLIZ) in Oostende, Belgium was accepted to become the long term host for the system and also the OBIS secretariat moved from Rutgers University to the IOC Project Office for IODE in Oostende from where OBIS is presently maintained and additional development is carried out, without change of web address. OBIS is thus now located in Oostende, in the same building which is also home to VLIZ. VLIZ maintains two taxonomic databases, the World Register of Marine Species and IRMNG, the Interim Register of Marine and Nonmarine Genera, both of which feed into taxonomic decisions used to control the display of species-based information in OBIS and also provide the taxonomic hierarchy via which OBIS content can be navigated. OBIS is currently under the direction of IODE with advice from a steering group, the IODE Steering Group for OBIS (SG-OBIS); operational activities are directed by an OBIS Executive Committee (OBIS-EC) with support from 6 OBIS Task Teams. The OBIS secretariat, hosted at the UNESCO/IOC project office for IODE in Oostende (Belgium), includes the OBIS project manager and data manager and in addition to maintaining the OBIS system also provides training and technical assistance to its data providers, guides new data standards and technical developments, and encourages international cooperation to foster the group benefits of the network.About OBIS: Governance Data available via OBIS cover all groups of organisms that have any association with marine or estuarine habitats, also including shorelines and the atmosphere above the ocean, such as marine vertebrates (fishes, marine mammals, turtles, seabirds, etc.); marine invertebrates (including zooplankton); marine bacteria; and marine plants (e.g. phytoplankton, seaweeds, mangroves). OBIS portal As available web technologies have developed, the OBIS Portal has been through a number of iterations since its inception in 2002. Initially the system retrieved remote data in real time in response to a user query and used the KGS Mapper to visualize the results. In 2004, centralized metadata indexing and cacheing was introduced leading to faster and more reliable results, and the c-squares mapper was added to options for data visualization.Tony Rees and Phoebe Zhang, 2007. \\"Evolving concepts in the architecture and functionality of OBIS, the Ocean Biogeographic Information System\\". in Vanden Berghe, E. et al.

IOC Workshop Report, 202, VLIZ Special Publication 37: pp. 167-176. In 2010, a full web GIS based system was introduced for the first time along with a new version of the web site which resulted in considerably more detailed and flexible presentation of search results along with a number of new search options.Ei Fujioka et al., 2012. \\"Advancing global marine biogeography research with open-source GIS software and cloud computing.\\" Transactions in GIS 16(2): 143‚Äì160. In April 2018, funding was announced to develop a new \\"2.0\\" version of OBIS with improved capabilities.\\"IOC invests in OBIS2.0, a major re-engineering of the OBIS platform\\",, and is released on 29 January 2019.\\"OBIS 2.0 released\\",. The website URL changed from iobis.org to obis.org. Regional OBIS nodes Over the period 2004‚Äìpresent, an international network of Regional OBIS Nodes has also been established, that are facilitating the connection of data sources in their region to the master OBIS data network and also increasingly provide specialised services or views of OBIS data to users in their particular region. *Antarctic OBIS :Hosted by Belgian Biodiversity Platform, Brussels and by Flanders Marine Institute, Oostende.

He came to Thazhamangai and worshipped the presiding deity and got his curse cured. As Chandra worshipped the deity, the presiding deity is known as Chandramouleesvarar. The presiding deity in the garbhagriha is represented by the lingam known as Chandramouleesvarar. The Goddess is known as Rajarajesvari. The complete structure of garbhagriha is made of brick. No granite is found. The architectural style which is generally found in the temples of Thanjavur could not be seen here. The presiding deity might have been taken from the dilapidated structure which was in existence through so many centuries and is kept now.

Within the church he came to prominence as a controversialist, notably on account of his long- standing record of theological and very public feuding with F√©lix Orsi√®res to whose polemical Liberal Catholicism G√©rard, alongside his colleagues within the Aosta cathedral establishment, he was strongly opposed. His church career culminated in his appointment as diocesan archpriest. It is, however, on account of his activities as a prolific writer, in particular of religious and regional publications,that he came to wider prominence. In 1859/1860 Aosta became part of Italy. Despite an energetic campaign of population shifting and language suppression under Mussolini, the French language is still very widely spoken in the Val d'Aoste. In the nineteenth century variations of French dominated overwhelmingly. In his published output G√©rard used French.  Biography  L√©on Cl√©ment G√©rard was born in Cogne, a small iron mining town in the mountains a short distance to the south of Aosta. Jean-Joseph de Jean- Antoine Gaspard, his father, was an agricultural smallholder. His mother's birth name, Marie Buthier, indicates that she, like her husband, came from an established local family.Acte de d√©c√®s n¬∞110 Aoste du 1 novembre 1876 G√©rard studied for the priesthood and was ordained on 23 September 1833. His first posting following ordination was as Vicar of Ayas between 1833 and 1835. That was followed by a longer incumbency, between 1835 and 1843, at the little spa resort of Saint-Vincent. He then undertook a curacy at La Salle between 1843 and 1856. Here he was able to consecrate the newly rebuilt little church on 17 August 1847. During his time at La Salle, on 4 July 1845 he was recruited as a member of the chapter at the cathedral in Aosta, some 20km / 12 miles down the valley, undertaking both jobs simultaneously. On 22 January 1856 he was transferred from La Salle to Saint-Jean-Baptiste, a city-center parish for which the cathedral also serves as the parish church: here he held the curacy till his death some twenty years later. He was appointed deputy archpriest on 10 April 1856 and then diocesan archpriest on 4 January 1860.  Polemicist and author  G√©rard's first published works were poems included in \\"Feuille d'Annonces d'Aoste\\", the leading local newspaper before 1848. This involved working with the progressive canon F√©lix Orsi√®res (among others). At the Feuille d'Annonces, G√©rard and Orsi√®res became two of the seven contributing poets identified collectively as the \\"Pl√©iade vald√¥taine\\" (literally, \\"Pleiades of the Aosta Valley\\"). The 1848 Statute of [King] Charles Albert triggered a political change towards liberalism which was followed swiftly by a succession of upheavals in the newspaper industry. The catholic conservative \\"Ind√©pendant\\" was launched on 1 March 1849, in part as a reaction to the more liberal tone being adopted by the existing mainstream regional media: G√©rard he was one of those who switched from the Feuille d'Annonces, becoming instead a regular contributing editor to the new newspaper for the four years until 1853 when its \\"radical anticlericalism\\" led to its cessation. During 1850/51 G√©rard emerged as the principal press interlocutor of the Bishop of Aosta, Andr√© Jourdain and of the more conservative among the regional churchmen more generally. This, along with aspects of his own views and temperament, set up an long-standing and increasingly intense hostility between G√©rard and the progressive Canon Orsi√®res with whom he had worked on the \\"Feuille d'Annonces d'Aoste\\". Their differences were played out in print and centred on the role of the church in society. The dispute came to an end only in 1855, when Orsi√®res, threatened with excommunication, was persuaded to sign a retraction and agree to submit to the \\"holy congregation\\" - in effect a quasi-judicial tribunal of priests set up by the bishop, which had robustly rejected Orsi√®res' position on a series of social and ecclesiastical matters on which Bishop Jourdain followed the robustly traditionalist views of the church under the leadership of the recently elected Pope Pius IX. The twenty-first century commentators Joseph-Gabriel Rivolin and Omar Borettaz find G√©rard's polemical approach and theology a little \\"old fashioned\\" (\\"...d√©mod√©s\\"). Old-fashioned or not, according to the Val d'Aoste scholar Abb√© Henry, the surviving published legacy of L√©on-Cl√©ment G√©rard comprises more than 50,000 verses, which together constitute an important element in the Vald√¥tain literary heritage.  Memberships  On 22 April 1856 G√©rard became a member of the Saint-Anselme Academy.

In 2020, Oriuwa became the first Black woman to be chosen sole valedictorian at the University of Toronto, Faculty of Medicine and the first female valedictorian in 14 years. Oriuwa has spoken internationally about her experiences as the only Black student in her class, diversity in medicine, and the importance of shared narrative. Oriuwa is well known for her spoken word poem, ‚ÄúWoman, Black‚Äù, published in 2017.  Early life and education  Oriuwa was born in Ontario, Canada. She grew up with her parents who both immigrated to Canada from Nigeria. She attended a Catholic elementary school and then pursued high school at St Thomas Aquinas Secondary School in Brampton, Ontario, where she became valedictorian in 2011. After completing high school, Oriuwa pursued her undergraduate studies at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, focusing on the health sciences with the aim of becoming a physician. While she was at McMaster University, she began to develop her passion for advocacy. Oriuwa graduated from McMaster University with a bachelor‚Äôs degree in Health Sciences in 2015, and took a gap year to study for the Medical College Admissions Test (MCAT) and apply to medical school while pursuing her artistic passion, poetry. She joined the Hamilton Youth Poets slam poetry label and competed at the national level in slam poetry, making it to the national slam poetry finals two years in a row. In 2016, Oriuwa began a combined medical degree and Master of Science at the University of Toronto Faculty of Medicine. She focused on system leadership and innovation within the Institute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation at the University of Toronto. As the only Black student in a class of 259 medical students, Oriuwa was faced with significant challenges, which motivated her to advocate for diversity, equity and inclusion in medicine. After the Black Student Application Program (BSAP) was founded in 2017 at the University of Toronto, Oriuwa became an ambassador and leader in the program, which is an optional application stream for Black applicants to the University of Toronto Faculty of Medicine, providing a culturally safe environment where Black applicants can have their files reviewed by members of the Black community in an effort to break down barriers and increase diversity at the university. Through speaking and engaging with future University of Toronto applicants, she became the face of the BSAP and helped to increase the diversity of incoming medical classes so that future Black students had a community with which to share their experiences and narratives. Her efforts have manifested themselves in increased Black student matriculation and BSAP acknowledges Oriuwa for her recruitment efforts resulting in the 2022 incoming class having 14 Black students and the 2023 class having 15 Black students. As of 2020, the incoming class of 2024, has the largest number of Black students in history: 24 students. Oriuwa became co-president of the University of Toronto Black Medical Students' Association and in her second year, she co-founded the Black Interprofessional Students' Association (BIPSA) with her colleague, Josh Lokko, in the law-MBA program at University of Toronto. BIPSA brings together Black graduate students across the campus to enhance networking and build a supportive community. Oriuwa was motivated to make the experience of future Black U of T students supportive from first matriculation. On 2 June 2020, Oriuwa graduated from University of Toronto as valedictorian. She was the first solo black female valedictorian at University of Toronto, the second overall black female valedictorian and the first woman in 14 years. She gave her valedictory address online to the class of 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Career  Medicine = Oriuwa‚Äôs passion for addressing mental health and the damage caused by structural racism has led her to pursue her residency in psychiatry. = Advocacy = Oriuwa is an advocate for diversity in medicine and medical education reform to prepare trainees for discrimination and racism in the medical profession. She has delivered international keynote speeches on the health of women and immigrants, and has discussed global health topics with a focus on Nigerian healthcare. Oriuwa has also focused her public education on how to become empowered as a racialized individual in medicine. She was a speaker at the 2018 International Women and Children‚Äôs Health Conference at McMaster University as well as the keynote speaker at the Leading Women in Science Conference at Women‚Äôs College Hospital. Oriuwa is also actively involved in outreach, health education, and public communication. She is on the Executive Committee of the Healthy Debate, a platform to provide the public with accurate and accessible information about Canadian healthcare and to give the public an opportunity to provide their voice in policy decisions made surrounding healthcare. Through the Healthy Debate, Oriuwa has written about the importance of diversity and equity in medical school admissions to create a healthcare field that can provide the best services to its diverse patient population.
