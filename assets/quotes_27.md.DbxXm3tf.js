History The organization was founded by Winnipeg businessman Sam Katz in 1997 to create a leasehold stake in the proposed CanWest Park stadium that eventually housed his Winnipeg Goldeyes baseball team.Bartley Kives, \\"Fair Ball?\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 11 October 2008, A6. Katz himself served as the company's first president, and took part in negotiations with different levels of government concerning the stadium's construction.\\"Infrastructure funding announced for Riverside Park\\", Manitoba Government, 4 May 1998. Riverside Park later leased the stadium grounds and surrounding lots from the city for $1 per year plus payments equal to property taxes, and sublet the land to the Goldeyes. CanWest Park, now known as Shaw Park opened in 1999. In July 2004, the Goldeyes and Riverside Park had the same directors.David O'Brien, \\"No conflict, says Katz\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 16 July 2004, A1. Katz was elected as Mayor of Winnipeg in 2004, and remained president of Riverside Park until April 2008.Bartley Kives, \\"Conflict of interest clear to all except the mayor\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 20 September 2008, B2. He has said that he ended his involvement with the day-to-day management of the company after his election.Bartley Kives, \\"'There can't be an issue,' says Katz\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 18 September 2008, A3. His successor as president is Jason McRae-King.Bartley Kives, \\"'There can't be an issue,' says Katz\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 18 September 2008, A3. =Conflict-of-interest controversy= Riverside Park became involved in a local controversy after appealing a steep 2006 property tax reassessment for a parking lot next to the arena. Two years after the appeal was launched, Winnipeg's property department asked city council to renegotiate the lease on terms favourable to the company.Bartley Kives, \\"Conflict of interest clear to all except the mayor\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 20 September 2008, B2. The city's executive policy committee (i.e. the municipal cabinet) heard evidence that the reassessment occurred because of confusion between two city departments, after Riverside Park was informed that there would be no significant increase.Bartley Kives, \\"'Bumbling,' 'incompetence' revealed at EPC meeting\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 18 September 2008, A3. Some journalists and councilors argued that Katz was involved in a conflict-of-interest over this situation, as he was both Mayor of Winnipeg and president of Riverside Park from August 2005 to April 2008, while the two sides were engaged in a financial dispute. Winnipeg Free Press journalist Bartley Kives argued that the conflict was clear, although he added that there was nothing to suggest the mayor misused his position for personal benefit.Bartley Kives, \\"Conflict of interest clear to all except the mayor\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 20 September 2008, B2. Other concerns were later raised about Riverside Park. Councillor Dan Vandal, a frequent critic of Katz, said that the city should have access to its financial records to determine if it was properly fulfilling its role as a non-profit corporation.Bartley Kives and Geoff Kirbyson, \\"How Riverside Park plays ball\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 29 September 2008, B1. Russ Wyatt, a member of Katz's cabinet, expressed concern that Riverside Management did not provide any payments to the city from 2001 to 2004 because its land did not officially appear on assessment rolls, and called for the parking lot controversy to be referred to an outside lawyer.Bartley Kives, \\"Parking lot a recurring headache\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 24 September 2008, B1. After a rancorous and divisive debate, city council voted 8-6 to revise the lease and retroactively eliminate $233,000 from Riverside Park's back taxes in late 2008. Katz recused himself from both the vote and debate.Bartley Kives, \\"Rancorous 8-6 vote ends Riverside spat - Katz's former outfit the beneficiary\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 25 September 2008, B1. A subsequent investigation by the Winnipeg Free Press raised further concerns about Riverside's financial arrangements with the Goldeyes. In an article entitled \\"Fair ball?\\", Bartley Kives wrote that \\"[l]egal, accounting, ethics and non- profit governance experts\\" suggested that the relationship between the two entities was \\"unusual from a business perspective\\". Kives noted that Riverside Park was then leasing four parcels of land from the City of Winnipeg (covering the stadium and surrounding parking lots), which it then sublet to the Goldeyes. Riverside Park also made regular payments to the Goldeyes, which Kives indicated were \\"presumably to pay back part of the construction debt\\". Riverside Park reduced its debt to the Goldeyes by $1.3 million between 2000 and 2005, while the Goldeyes increased their annual rent payments to Riverside Park from $75,000 to over $1 million in the same period. Kives further noted that the Free Press was unable to draw any conclusions regarding the accelerated rent payments, as Riverside Park refused to turn over its books for investigation. A corporate lawyer hired by the Free Press said that he had never seen such an arrangement, while the Manitoba director of the Canadian Taxpayers Federation said the city should have leased the land directly to the for-profit company without going through Riverside Park.Bartley Kives, \\"Fair Ball?\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 11 October 2008, A6. Shortly after city council voted to eliminate Riverside Park's back taxes, the City of Winnipeg took over the parking lot that was the source of the controversy.\\"Parking lot controversy not over yet\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 24 October 2008, W1. Katz has repeatedly argued that there was nothing improper about his activities, and has accused the media of sensationalizing the controversy.Bartley Kives, \\"Mayor weathers toughest year\\", Winnipeg Free Press, 29 December 2008, B1.

It was founded in 1961 by Bob and Marian Brown of Orinda, California, who were known as Amee and Niha, Pomo language for \\"Father\\" and \\"Mother,\\" in honor of the native Pomo People. CBB took campers from age 7 - 17. 15-17-year-olds were given helper roles through a \\"Campers in Leadership Training Program\\" (CILT, pronounced \\"silt\\"). Camp activities included riflery, archery, horseback riding, hiking, nature walks, backpacking, arts and crafts projects, drama (the camp regularly produced several musicals each summer), swimming, water skiing at nearby Clear Lake, music, volleyball, boating and overnight canoe trips on the Russian River. Campers, known as \\"Beaverbods\\", were mainly from the San Francisco Bay Area, though some came from as far away as Europe, Mexico, Canada and Japan. A unique feature of the camp was a relative lack of competitiveness. Campers were rarely put into direct competition with one another, rather, a supportive and mutually nurturing environment was cultivated. Thousands of youngsters attended the camp, and a Yahoo! interest group exists for them to stay in touch with one another as well as a dedicated Facebook group. Like most sleep away summer camps, Camp Beaverbrook lived and thrived as an isolated community, cut off from the outside world. Campers were deprived of television, radio, candy, hair dryers, and many other creature comforts. While a rigid daily structure was in place, there was also an abundance of choice and each day included several unstructured \\"free time\\" periods. Each camper could select his or her own activities for the day at the beginning of each activity period with as many as seven or eight choices. The staff used nicknames like Jasmine, Trooper, Stage, Opus, Truckee, Spring, Strider, Slim, Sparky, Lucky, Poozle, Flash, Kelsey, Fritz, Lupin, Buckwheat and Bedaz. Campers never knew their counselors real names, and even if they learned them, they would scarcely dare to utter them aloud, not only because it was strictly forbidden, but because the campers, even the youngest campers, on some level understood that the magical isolated environment would be jeopardized. A large contingent of campers came back year after year and some stayed for several sessions each summer. Many campers came for three or four or even five summers in a row. A few campers returned for more than ten summers, many went on to become counselors. In June 2010, Matthew C. \\"Flash\\" Callahan, who attended Camp Beaverbrook from 1977‚Äì1985, completed a 68-minute documentary film about Camp Beaverbrook entitled \\"Beaverbrook\\". Through interviews, archival footage and stills, the film characterizes Camp Beaverbrook as a place where \\"kids could just be kids\\". In 2011 \\"Beaverbrook\\" screened at three film festivals; the Black Hills Film Festival in Hill City, South Dakota; DocUtah in St. George, Utah; and San Francisco IndieFest's DocFest 2011. The film won awards at each festival. \\"Beaverbrook\\" was broadcast in the San Francisco bay area on public television's KQED in the summer of 2012. The film continues to be broadcast on local stations throughout the western United States.

Bedacht is best remembered as the long-time head of the International Workers Order, a Communist Party- sponsored fraternal benefit organization. BiographyEarly years= Max Bedacht, Sr. was born in Munich, Germany to an ethnically German mother on October 13, 1883. He was the son of a single mother who worked as a domestic servant and was raised Catholic by a maternal aunt and uncle. =Early labor activities= Bedacht apprenticed and worked as a barber in Germany and Switzerland, working in the towns of Gossau and Herisau. He organized fellow journeymen barbers into a union during his European years. In 1905 he joined the Social Democratic Party of Switzerland. In 1907, Bedacht was elected president of the Swiss National Barbers' Union and edited the organization's newspaper. That same year he took part in his first labor action, a sympathy strike held for the striking chocolate workers on the banks of Lake Geneva. During a barbers' strike the following year, Bedacht rented a building for a cooperative barber shop in his name. In the settlement of the strike, the plan for the cooperative facility was abandoned, however, and Bedacht was sued for breach of contract by the building's landlord. While the union's members offered to pay the money for him, Bedacht decided to emigrate to the United States rather than allow this to take place. =Activities: New York City= Bedacht immigrated to the United States in 1908 and joined the Socialist Party of America (SPA) during that same year. He lived and worked in Manhattan from 1910 to 1912, cutting hair by day while spending his evenings as a German- language socialist agitator. After this he spent a brief period in Detroit as editor of both German-language and English-language Socialist newspapers. =Activities: San Francisco= In June 1913 he moved to San Francisco to become the editor of the German-language labor newspaper Vorw√§rts der Pacific K√ºste (Forward of the Pacific Coast), a job which he retained until the paper's termination in 1917 due to draconian postal regulations being placed on the foreign language press during World War I. He briefly moved to South Dakota to edit a paper called The New Era following the demise of the Vorw√§rts, but soon returned to San Francisco when he found that publication unviable, taking up the barbers' shears again. Bedacht was long an adherent of the so-called impossibilist wing of the Socialist Party, placing his faith in socialist revolution rather than the ameliorative reform of elected officials. As was the case with many radicals in America, Bedacht was inspired by the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 and was an early adherent of the 1919 Left Wing Manifesto written by Louis C. Fraina and the Left Wing Section of the Socialist Party, which emerged in conjunction with that document. Bedacht was a Left Wing candidate for the SPA's governing National Executive Committee in 1919 and a delegate to the SPA's pivotal 1919 Emergency National Convention. =Chicago convention of 1919= At the Chicago convention in August 1919, the Left Wing California delegation was challenged at the time the gathering was convened, placing the delegates in limbo, their fate held in the mercy of a committee firmly controlled by the \\"Regular\\" faction of National Executive Secretary Adolph Germer and James Oneal. The Credentials Committee, headed by Judge Jacob Panken of New York City, stalled the hearings on the California delegation until after the convention was underway and until it was clear that a safe majority of delegates were in the Regulars' camp. As a result, although they were ultimately approved by the committee, the California delegation refused to take their seats in protest and went downstairs to attend the parallel convention of the Communist Labor Party (CLP) convened by NEC members Alfred Wagenknecht and L.E. Katterfeld. Bedacht was elected at the founding convention to the 5 member National Executive Committee which governed the CLP. During the Palmer Raids in California and Chicago, Bedacht was arrested and tried for conspiracy. However, despite conviction, he avoided prison. Soon afterwards, he traveled to Europe and Russia as an international delegate for the Communist Party. In 1924, Bedacht was a delegate of the Workers Party of America to the 5th World Congress of the Communist International. Bedacht lived in Chicago at 3101 North Nordica Avenue, from 1923 to 1928, according to his testimony before HUAC in 1949. =Activities: New York City= In 1929, Bedacht took over as liaison with the Soviet underground after the expulsion of Jay Lovestone from the Party in 1929. In the summer of 1932, Bedacht invited Whittaker Chambers to join the Soviet underground. Chambers described Bedacht's approach as follows: In 1934, he ran on the Communist ticket for U.S. Senator from New York and received 45,396 votes (1.23%).Our Campaigns ‚Äì NY US Senate Race ‚Äì Nov 06, 1934 In 1937, he said under oath in 1948, \\"I went to Spain with a committee of eight to the International Brigade in Spain. I think it was 1937.\\" In 1939, Time Magazine cited Bedacht in connection with the arrest of Party leader Earl Browder on charges of indicted a Federal Grand Jury in New York City on two counts connected to passport: \\"Possible was the bagging by Frank Murphy of such Reds as Executive Committeeman Max Bedacht, Publisher Alexander Trachtenberg.\\" =International Workers Order= In the 1930s, Bedacht became general secretary of the International Workers Order (IWO), a Communist Party-affiliated insurance, mutual benefit, and fraternal organization (1930‚Äì1954), whose membership peaked in the late 1940s at 200,000 members. In the mid-1940s, Bedacht appeared under subpoena before the Special Committee on Un-American Activities of the US House of Representatives (or \\"Dies Committee\\"). = Expulsion = In November 1948, Bedacht was expelled from the national CPUSA. In November 1949, Bedacht appeared before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). Regarding his activities, he answered when asked: > Mr. Tavenner: Will you please state for the committee the official positions > which you have held in the past in the Communist Party of the United States? > Mr. Bedacht: Almost everything up to secretary. I was never the editor of > the Daily Worker. Regarding his expulsion from the CPUSA, he held this exchange: > Mr. Tavenner: I believe you have recently been expelled from Communist > Party, have you not? > Mr. Bedacht. Yes, sir. > Mr. Tavenner. On what grounds did this expulsion take place? > Mr. Bedacht: I don't know that I know myself, but, anyway, this committee > is surely not a court of appeals against my expulsion, and my explanation > for it would take quite a while, and you would have to listen to the other > side, too. > Mr. Tavenner: I will not go into that. It was the result of a factional > dispute within the party; is that substantially right? > Mr. Bedacht: You may say so. Personal life and death Bedacht was married and had four children, three daughters and a son: Elsie, Edith, Ethel, and Max. His eldest daughter worked for a time in the National Office of the American Communist Party in the early 1930s. Max Bedacht died on July 4, 1972.

Cambridge/New York: Cambridge University Press, 2008. pp. 239‚Äì241 In November 1979 the Supreme National Committee of the Democratic July 14 Movement published a manifesto in Baghdad, titled 'A Project for a National Pact'. The manifesto called for the overthrow of the Ba'athist government, right of self-determination of the Kurds through the possibility of a referendum, democratizing the Iraqi Armed Forces, economic and eventually political integration of the Arab states and re-orientation of the national oil policy. The Democratic July 14 Movement proved short-lived, as differences erupted between its leaders. Al-Fakhri projected himself as the main leader of the movement, in contradiction to the agreed principle of collective leadership. In July 1980 he held separate negotiations with the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan leader Jalal Talabani, for the construction of an Iraqi national front against Saddam Hussein's rule. Other constituents of the Democratic July 14 Movement questioned al-Fakhri on what mandate these negotiations had been taken place. By early 1981, the movement had broken apart and ceased to function.

Although the fall was seen by a number of people, its exact date has not been established. Bright meteors were seen to be moving roughly from west to east. Stones were subsequently recovered from over a large area, about long by wide. Because the Tenham meteorites were recovered quite soon after they fell, from a remote and dry region in which weathering and other alterations had not set in, they have been invaluable for scientific study of meteorites and their mineral contents. They are examples of chondritic meteorites, containing a high level of organic compounds, and rich in silicates, oxides, and sulfides. Many scientific studies have explored the mineralogy of these meteorites and their non-terrestrial features. Because the Tenham meteorites show evidence of high pressure deformations, they have been used to infer chemical and mineral changes that might occur within Earth's mantle. Ringwoodite, the high pressure forsterite polymorph named after Ted Ringwood was discovered in fragments of the Tenham meteorite. In 2014, a team of scientists at Argonne National Laboratory studied a sample of bridgmanite, a silicate perovskite ((Mg,Fe)SiO3), taken from the Tenham meteorite. The team used micro-focused X-rays for diffraction analysis and fast-readout area- detector techniques to avoid damage to the sample. The study yielded results not seen when using synthetic samples, including a higher than expected presence of sodium and ferric iron.

His name remains attached to the lithographing of portraits of famous and lesser-known figures from Belgium, France and England. They are politicians, senior officials, prominent clergy, both from the Roman Catholic and Anglican Church, industrialists, professors, artists, musicians, actors, and people from the vaudeville world. Biography Spring's New Arrivals He was born in Brussels and attended the Acad√©mie Royale des Beaux-Arts in Brussels during 1827‚Äì29, where he studied under Joseph Paelinck and Florent Willems. His first attempts lithography date from 1827, and his reputation grew steadily with the appearance of his first portraits in the magazine L'Artiste in 1833. He collaborated with from 1835 until 1842 in producing a series of portraits of the Belgian House of Representatives. Louis Huard finished only 6 portraits, Baugniet doing the remainder. This was followed in 1836 by a series of 30 portraits of contemporary artists‚Äî\\"Les Artistes Contemporains\\". Included were portraits of Louis J√©hotte, Louis Gallait, Nicaise De Keyser, Jean-Baptiste Madou, Eug√®ne Simonis, Charles-Louis Verboeckhoven, Horace Vernet, Paul Delaroche and Hippolyte Bellang√©. He was commissioned to do portraits of the Belgian Royal Family, and this led to his appointment as court painter in 1841. In 1843 he moved to London where he became a leading society portrait painter, creating a portrait of Prince Albert in 1851. Later he often returned to London to do portraits of celebrities such as Charles Dickens and the French composer Hector Berlioz. Baugniet also designed the first Belgian postage stamp (the so-called Epaulettes type) brought into circulation on 1 July 1849. The stamp depicted Leopold I of Belgium after a painting by . Baugniet settled in Paris in 1860. Almost overnight the invention and development of photography strangled the traditional market of lithographic portraits, forcing many of Baugniet's colleagues to become professional photographers. Baugniet however concentrated on producing paintings and portraits which displayed the studied elegance of the Second French Empire, a genre that enjoyed great popularity.

This species is found widespread across much of sub-Saharan Africa. In tropical Africa it is found outside of the humid forest zone from Senegal to Ethiopia.In Eastern Africa it is found to occur from Ethiopia all the way down to northern South Africa. The genus formerly contained several Asiatic species, but these are now generally considered to be better suited to other genera (primarily Dendrocalamus or Gigantochloa but see also Bambusa Cephalostachyum Pseudoxytenanthera Schizostachyum Yushania);Das, M., Bhattacharya, S., Singh, P., Filgueiras, T.S. and Pal, A. 2008.

From 1997 to 2003 he served as the director of the Saint Petersburg Branch of the Institute of Oriental Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences (now the Institute of Oriental Manuscripts of the Russian Academy of Sciences). Biography Evgenij Kychanov was born 22 June 1932 in Sarapul, Udmurtia. Evgenij Kychanov graduated from the Oriental Department of Saint Petersburg University (known at the time as Leningrad University) in 1955, majoring in the history of China. He did his graduate work at the Leningrad Branch of the Institute of Oriental Studies, and in 1960 he defended his PhD thesis on the Xi Xia State. He has been working at that institute ever since, spending many years as the head of the Tangut research group, and, later, as the head of larger units. From 1997 to 2003 he was director of the St Petersburg Branch (now the Institute of Oriental Manuscripts). Kychanov is the author of around 300 articles and books on the history and culture of peoples of China and Inner Asia, including a number of pioneering research papers on the Xi Xia state and translations from the Tangut language, summarizing works on the history of Tibet and nomadic civilizations of Inner Asia, as well as popular books about Tibet, Genghis Khan and other steppe leaders. In May 2011 Kychanov was awarded the S. F. Oldenburg Award in recognition of his achievements in the field of Central Asian studies, in particular his role in the decipherment of the Tangut script. In June 2012 a conference in his honour, entitled The Tanguts in Central Asia, was held at the Institute of Oriental Manuscripts to mark Kychanov's 80th birthday. A collection of 34 papers written by scholars from Russia, China, Japan and other countries was published as a Festschrift with the same title. He died in St Petersburg in May 2013.

Plot Two old classmates, Rosario (Malena Alterio) and Milagros (Esperanza Pedre√±o), who meet again after many years of not seeing each other since high school. After several failures with their own jobs, they end up working together as trash handlers, sweeping the streets of Madrid. The story begins when they have to travel to Milagros' village to bury her dead cat. The film was shot in Madrid and Huertapelayo (Zaorejas). After many years without seeing each other, Rosario meets Milagros, her friend from childhood who works as a taxi driver using a car from her uncle's taxi company. Milagros starts driving her to the bank each morning where she works as a cleaner. Together, they spend lots of time going to restaurants and pubs, but Rosario gets worried about missing so much work and one day she is fired. Milagros admits later that she never had a driving licence, which, combined with her excessive kindness to Rosario, leads her to also be fired. After that, the two women find jobs as street cleaners. In that job, Rosario meets Morsa (Antonio de la Torre), with whom she starts a carnal relationship. Meanwhile, Rosario lives with her mother whose physical and mental health are quickly deteriorating. One day, when Rosario arrives home from work, she discovers that her mother was going to have dinner in the bathroom. After that, Rosario sees more strange behavior from her mother. She begins to forget important things, such as that her other daughter is married. This fact confirms for Rosario that her mother suffers from Alzheimer's disease. Rosario feels very worried and alone. She keeps finding her mother hiding in Rosario's wardrobe; on the first day that Rosario brings Morsa home from work to have sex, she watches her mother walk out of her closet, horrified. As her mother's condition worsens, Rosario calls both her sister and Milagros over to the house. After burying Milagros's cat, Morsa, Rosario and Milagros return to Madrid to keep working. Rosario's mother is dying and her sister comes from Barcelona to stay some days with her. Rosario's sister never took any responsibility for their mother, which is motive for tension between the sisters. Rosario reproaches her sister for always being distant towards her and her mother, while her sister gets angry with Rosario for letting Milagros stay at her home. Both women remember their childhood together, talking about the funny moments and the painful ones. Soon after, their mother stops breathing. After her mother's death, Rosario sees the image of her mother everywhere, to a point that it scares her and doesn't let her sleep. She visits the priest of the church where her mother used to go. There, she tells him her problem and he concludes that perhaps she sees the image of her mother everywhere because she didn't want her daughter to be alone. One night whilst sweeping and washing a plaza, Milagros and Rosario are bickering over whether or not Milagros should keep some of the trash she finds when Milagros hears a baby's cry inside of a dumpster. She reaches in and discovers a baby inside a box. Rosario insists on taking the baby to a hospital emergency room, but Milagros wants to keep him at her home. They have a heated discussion where Rosario says Milagros would not be a good mother and Milagros confesses that she is sterile. Milagros says that she loved Rosario to a point that she felt jealous because she had her own life with Morsa, and that Rosario was cold and lonely and bitter, destined to be alone. Rosario finally realizes her terrible problem of loneliness and lack of confidence with other people, though she could not admit it. Days after this incident, Rosario's boss realises that Milagros had been out for a lot of time. Rosario decides to visit her, taking some flowers and chocolates. In Milagros' home, Rosario is horrified to discover that the baby Milagros took in is already dead, in an advanced state of decomposition. Completely devastated and depressed, both women and Morsa return to the village to bury the baby in the cemetery, and Rosario recites the 51st Psalm. Rosario and Morsa returned to Madrid, but Milagros wants to stay, something her two friends cannot understand. Worried, Rosario says that she would be all alone with nobody beside her, but Milagros insists and decides to stay in that village for good. Some days later, Milagros is telephoned by her uncle Cosm√©. He informs her that his niece has been found dead in the house of the village. This fact further devastates Rosario, who goes with Milagros's uncle to assist in the burial. During the trip to the village, Cosm√© tells Rosario that his niece's mother died because of overdose when she was a little child. There, Rosario sees how her friend is buried in the cemetery, in a funeral where all the village people attended. After the hard journey to the village, Rosario admits that she must not be alone anymore, so she decided to go to Fuenlabrada, where her friend Morsa, lives. Rosario makes her way to the playground, and sees all the mothers with their children. Morsa's van stops nearby, and after a short chat, the film ends with a kiss between Morsa and Rosario.

Khwaja Mahmud Gilani, from the village of Gawan in Persia, was well-versed in Islamic theology, Persian language and Mathematics and was a poet and a prose writer of repute. Later, he became a minister in the court of Muhammad III (1463-1482). A storehouse of wisdom, Mahmud enjoyed the trust and confidence of rulers, locals as well as that of foreign kingdoms, who had great respect for Mahmud. His characteristics are as follows: competent and successful general, capable administrator, learned man, patron of art and poetry Career He was very capable and efficient. He was a gifted administrator and a skilled general. Greatly impressed with his military genius, Sultan Humayun Shah had taken him in his service. After Humayun's death, he became the guardian of his minor prince Nizam Shah. He had the reigns of Government in his hands. When the young Sultan died in 1463 and his brother Muhammad III aged 9 succeeded him, Mahmud Gawan served as the prime minister. He effectively put an end to the havoc wrought on the pilgrims of Mecca and on merchants by the fleets of Rana Shankarrao Surve and Rana Neelkanthrao Surve of Khelna (Vishalgarh) and Sangameshwar which were part of Shringarpur jagir of Surve Maratha clan respectively. In 1474, a terrible famine known as \\"famine of Bijapur\\" devastated the Deccan. Large number of people fled to Gujarat and Malwa. For 2 years the rains failed and when they came in the third year, scarcely any farmers remained in the country to cultivate the lands. He instated a land revenue system and drastically reduced the power of the nobles. =Campaigns against Vijayanagar= Mahmud Gawan served the state most faithfully and enlarged the kingdom to an extent never achieved before. He conquered Kanchi or Kanjeevaram during the course of campaign against Vijayanagar. He fought successful wars against rulers of Konkan, Sangameshwara, Orissa and Vijayanagar. He captured Goa and Dabhol, the best part of Vijayanagar empire. Mahmud Gawan Madrasa was built by Mahmud Gawan, the Vizier of the Bahmani Sultanate as the center of learning in the Deccan. =Education= He built the great university in Bidar which is known as Mahmud Gawan Madrasa. Almost at the centre of Bidar's old Town stand the graceful buildings, which bear testimony to the genius and eclecticism of Mohammad Gawan. A linguist and a mathematician, he, together with carefully chosen scientists, philosophers and religious seers, created a distinguished religious school. His extensive library boasted of 3,000 manuscripts. This madarasa had a 242 ft length, 222 ft width and 56 ft height three-storied building with a monumental minaret, a mosque, labs, lecture halls and students' cells overlooks an immense courtyard with arches on every side giving it a graceful facade. Many of the blue tiles on the mosque's outer walls have been pilfered. The minaret is elegant with Samarkhand-like domes here and there. Death There were two factions of nobles: The Deccanis (Of local origin) and Afaqis. (Of Foreign origin). Mahmud was an Afaqi, so he faced many challenges. Unfortunately, plots were hatched to topple him by the Deccanis, the nobles forged a treasonous document purportedly from him. In a drunken state, the Sultan ordered him executed in April 1481. \\"With him departed all the cohesion and power of the Bahmani Sultan.\\" Later the Sultan regretted his hasty decision and buried his Prime Minister with honors. The treasonable documents presented by the critics of Mahmud Gawan were the letters written to the king of Vijayanagar, which were claimed to have been written by Mahmud. Though Mahmud asserted that the letter was forged, his statement was not given value as the Sultan Muhammad Shah III was himself wary of his growing power and influence. Thus, despite his old age, he was executed. One year after the death of Mahmud, Sultan also died at the age of 29. It was said that the Mahmud haunted the Sultan during the last days of his life as he used to scream on his death bed that Mahmud was slaying him. Legacy A Russian traveler, Athanasius Nikitin, who visited Bidar, has recorded that Mohammad Gawan's mansion was guarded by a hundred armed men and ten torchbearers.

Culin III memorial in his hometown of Cranford, New Jersey Sgt Curtis Grubb Culin III (February 10, 1915 - November 20, 1963) was a World War II soldier credited with the invention of a hedge-breaching device fitted to Allied armored vehicles during the Battle of Normandy. As they moved inland after the D-Day landings, the Allies found their tanks were unable to operate easily or safely in the Normandy bocage countryside. Instead of breaking through the thick, high hedges the tanks rode over them, which exposed their thinly armored undersides to attack while their own guns could not be brought to bear. A native of Cranford, New Jersey, Culin was serving as a tanker with the 102nd Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron (New Jersey National Guard, the \\"Essex Troop,\\" 2nd Armored Division)Battle of the Hedgerows: Bradley's First Army in Normandy, June‚ÄìJuly 1944 de Stephen Hart et Leo Daugherty, p 101 when he came up with the four-pronged plow device created from scrap steel from a German roadblock. When attached to the front of his tank it was successful in rapidly plowing gaps in the hedgerows.GI Ingenuity, p 125, par James Jay Carafano, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2006 . Military historian Max Hastings notes that Culin was inspired by \\"a Tennessee hillbilly named Roberts\\", who during a discussion about how the bocage could be overcome said \\"Why don't we get some saw teeth and put them on the front of the tank and cut through these hedges?\\" Rather than joining in the laughter that greeted this remark, Culin realised the idea's potential and put together a prototype tusk-like assembly welded to the front of a tank. In due course this was demonstrated to General Bradley, who \\"watched in awe as a hedgerow exploded ... to make way for the Sherman bursting through\\". According to Hastings, Culin, \\"an honest man\\", attempted to give credit to Roberts but this was forgotten in the publicity surrounding the invention. Hastings concludes: \\"[Culin] became a very American kind of national hero\\". Bradley ordered that as many Sherman tanks as possible be fitted with the device.The Fall of the Reich, p. 96, by Duncan Anderson, √©d. MBI Pub. Co., 2000 By the launch of Operation Cobra, some 60 percent of First Army tanks were so equipped. Culin received the Legion of Merit. Four months after his invention, he lost a leg to a land mine in the Huertgen Forest. When he returned to the United States, he became a salesman for Schenley Industries, Inc., liquor distributors. Eisenhower speech Culin was mentioned in one of the last addresses by Dwight D. Eisenhower as President of the United States, in a January 10, 1961, speech to the American Society of Mechanical Engineers: Eisenhower repeated this story about Sergeant Culin in 1964 in a television interview with CBS correspondent Walter Cronkite on the 20th anniversary of the D-Day invasion taking place in the actual hedgerow country of France.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R_dj2aba1hE Personal life Curtis G.

She previously raced swamp buggies, and finished second in the Immokalee Raceway points series in the IHRA Drag Racing Combo class, two places ahead of her father. Both of her parents are racers, and her sister Candice Jolly is also a professional monster truck driver and is a former World Karting Association national go- kart racing champion. Two other sisters are horse barrel racers. Her introduction to the world of monster trucks came when she sang the National Anthem at a Monster Jam event at Florida Sports Park in her hometown of Naples. She was given a pit pass and subsequently met driver Alex Blackwell, who let her sit in his truck. She immediately decided that she wanted to drive a monster truck, and returned the next day hoping to drive a truck into the venue before singing the anthem. Monster Jam Senior Director of Operations Mike Wales later arranged for her to test drive a monster truck in North Carolina and he decided that she had what it took to drive competitively. Wales has referred to Jolly as the Danica Patrick of the monster truck circuit. She began driving professionally in the Monster Jam circuit while still attending college at Florida Gulf Coast University. Jolly lost most of the function in her right hand in a go-kart crash at age twelve. The accident broke her right arm above the elbow, requiring eight inches of steel and eight screws to repair it, and severing a few nerves. The handicap forced her to switch from doing everything right-handed to left-handed, including racing. Pastrana 199 was one of two trucks on the Monster Jam tour with controls built for lefties..

Robert Oppenheimer on the Manhattan Project), or for another role that requires scientific training and methods. In some countries other terms such Technical officers is also used for scientists. Australia In Australia, most government scientists are employed by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. A Chief Scientist is appointed to advise the government through the Office of the Chief Scientist. Singapore In Singapore, government scientists are classified according to the Departmental Titles (Alteration) (Amendment) Act 1996, which amended the Departmental Titles (Alteration) Ordinance of 1950. United Kingdom In the United Kingdom, government scientists are part of the Scientific Civil Service. However, that was not always the case. Before the Second World War, government scientists were recruited and employed by the Civil Service on an ad hoc basis, with grades, job titles, and organizations that varied between departments. In 1930, the Carpenter Committee was appointed to investigate the organization of civil service scientific and technical staff, and its report proposed a reorganization that covered the entire Service. This report was endorsed by the Tomlin Commission, however it was impossible to reach agreement with the relevant staff associations, who wanted other professional groups within the civil service to be similarly reorganized, and nothing ended up happening. World War Two changed this by causing a far greater number of scientific and technical staff to be employed by the government. The Barlow Committee on Scientific Staff in Government Departments reviewed the positions of government scientists during wartime, issuing a report on 1943-04-23. This report spurred the creation of a government white paper, entitled The Scientific Civil Service, which resulted in a reorganization of government scientisgts across the entire Service. This reorganization classified governmenvnt scientists across the entire Service into three major classes similar to those civil servants for the Treasury had already been classified in: ;Scientific Officer class:Grades of scientific officer began with Scientific Officer, and progressed through Senior, Principal, Senior Principal, Deputy Chief, and Chief Scientific Officers. ;Experimental Officer class:Grades of experimental officer began with Assistant Experimental Officer, and progressed through Experimental Officer to Senior and then Chief Experimental Officers. Experimental officers were either university graduates or people who had qualifications such as the Higher National Certificate, and were support staff for Scientific Officers. ;Scientific Assistant class:This class of civil servant undertook the routine work, and was largely equivalent to the Treasury's Clerical Class. United States In the United States, the employment of scientists by state and federal governments was, like in the U.K., affected by the Second World War. President Roosevelt first created the National Defense Research Committee under Vannevar Bush. This was then expanded to the Office of Scientific Research and Development, also led by Bush. The OSRD employed scientists on a contract basis, with the OSRD as client and individual scientists as contractors. Scientists were contracted to research (through study and experiment) a specified subject, without constraints as to method, and to issue reports to the OSRD. After the war, scientific research was continued by agencies such as the Office of Naval Research established in 1947, which again employed scientists as contractors. Scientific research was published in the normal way. The Atomic Energy Commission, established in 1946, and the National Institutes of Health, established in 1930, also paid scientists for scientific research, and were major sources of government research funding. The National Science Foundation was eventually established in 1950. Defence research was explicitly excluded from its charter, even though Dr Bush had originally envisioned the NSF as including that as well. The armed forces established their own research departments, such as the Office of Ordnance Research for the Department of the Army, established on the campus of Duke University in June 1951. U.S. local, state, and federal governments also employ scientists directly. The federal government employs them in departments such as the Department of Agriculture, Department of the Interior, and the Public Health Service. States and cities employ scientists in similar roles, including at fish and game commissions, parks, aquariums, arboretums, and museums; and at agencies such as environmental inspection agencies, crime laboratories, and public health monitoring agencies.

Life He was born on 10 February 1591, the second son of Edmund Skinner, rector of Pitsford, Northamptonshire, and Bridget, daughter of Humphrey Radcliff of Warwickshire. After attending Brixworth grammar school, he was admitted scholar of Trinity College, Oxford in 1607. He graduated B.A. in 1610, and M.A. in 1614. In 1613, he was elected fellow of his college, and until his death interested himself in its welfare. He proceeded B.D. in 1621, and became preacher of St. Gregory's Church, near St. Paul's Cathedral. In 1628, he succeeded his father as rector of Pitsford, and shortly after was chosen by Laud to be chaplain-in- ordinary to the king. He was vicar of Launton from 1632. In 1634, Oxford University granted him a D.D. at the request of William Laud, without the formalities, a move criticized by John Prideaux.Kenneth Fincham, Early Stuart Polity, p. 210 in Trevor Henry Aston, Nicholas Tyacke (editors), The History of the University of Oxford: Volume IV: Seventeenth-Century Oxford (1984). He was diplomated or actually created as such on 14 August 1636. In the 1630s, Skinner was known for his sermons before Charles I asserting Arminian doctrines.Kenneth Fincham, The Early Stuart Church, 1603-1642, p. 40. In 1636, he became bishop of Bristol and rector of Greens Norton, Northamptonshire. He retained the living of Launton, to which were soon added those of Cuddesdon, Oxfordshire, and Beckenham, Kent. In Bristol, he was active in preaching against Calvinism.Kenneth Fincham, The Early Stuart Church, 1603-1642, pp.81-2. In 1641, he was translated to become Bishop of Oxford. He was one of the bishops who subscribed the protest of 17 December 1641, declaring themselves prevented from attendance in Parliament, and was consequently committed by the lords to the Tower, where he remained eighteen weeks. Released on bail, he resided at Launton. In 1643, he was deprived of Greens Norton \\"for his malignity against the parliament.\\" He was also sequestered from his livings of Cuddesden in 1646 and Beckenham in 1647. During the Commonwealth, he secured a licence to preach, and continued in his diocese. He also conferred holy orders throughout England. It is stated by Thomas Warton, in his ‚ÄòLife of R. Bathurst‚Äô (p. 35), that Ralph Bathurst secretly examined the candidates, and officiated at Launton as archdeacon.Roger Kenneth French, Andrew Wear (editors), The Medical Revolution of the Seventeenth Century (1989), p. 32. At the Restoration, he became one of the king's commissioners of the University of Oxford, and in 1663 was translated to Worcester. He died on 14 June 1670 and is buried in a chapel at the east end of the choir of Worcester Cathedral. At the head of the inscribed stone, which is now in the crypt, is the arms of the family impaled with those of the see. He married Elizabeth, eldest daughter of Bernard Bangor, esquire bedell of Oxford, and left six sons and four daughters. Skinner's eldest son Matthew became a fellow of Trinity. The latter's grandson was Matthew Skinner, serjeant-at-law; while from the bishop's fourth son was descended John Skinner, the antiquary.

It was established in 1929 at Bagbazar, Kolkata.History of Ramakrishna Math and Mission- Swami GambhiranandaSwami Nirmalananda- His Life and Mission - Ottapalam Ramakrishna Ashrama. History In 1929, an internal dispute arose within the ranks of Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Mission. The then manager of the Udbodhan Office, Bramhachari Ganendranath, had been accused of financial irregularities by the Mission authorities. Those charges were never established. Ganendranath was an ardent 'sevak' of the Holy Mother Sri Sarada Devi. It can be seen in the biographies of the Holy Mother how deeply the Mother loved Ganendranath. Most of the photographs of the Mother were taken by him. Ganendranath was also an associate of Sister Nivedita. Kiran Chandra Dutt was one of the leading figures in Calcutta at that time. He belonged to the famous 'Dutt' family of Baghbazar. His family along with the family of Balaram Bose, a householder disciple of Sri Ramakrishna, contributed much in the initial days of the Ramakrishna Order. Kiran Chandra and other lay devotees of the Math and Mission including Shyamadas Bachaspati, an ayurvedic practitioner who treated the Holy Mother and Bhutnath Mukherjee, a renowned chartered accountant, were opposed by the Belur Math administration during a general assembly session of the Mission in March, 1929. Owing to difference of opinion with the then Belur Math authorities, 22 monks and 107 householder devotees of the order decided to form a new Math at a meeting at the legendary house of Pasupatinath Bose at Baghbazar to carry on the works on their own, based on the ideals of Sri Ramakrishna, the Holy Mother and Swamiji. The Math was named Sri Ramakrishna Sarada Math and the philanthropic Mission was named 'Vivekananda Mission'. The Math and Mission were registered according to government regulations on 13 December 1929. By 1931 the Math and Mission had moved to its own house at 10, Ramakrishna Lane, Baghbazar. Presidents The first president of the Math was Swami Nirmalananda (Tulsi Maharaj), one among the direct disciples of Ramakrishna and who devoted his life spreading the message of his Master in South India especially Kerala. He was also instrumental in developing the Bangalore centre and establishing 18 Ashramas across Kerala mostly, two in present-day Tamil Nadu and one in Karnataka. But he held the post in a nominal way, while continuing to function as a representative of Ramakrishna Mission, founding new centres and developing the existing centres. The first secretary of the Math was Kiran Chandra Dutt. The Vivekananda Mission did splendid relief work in the 1934 Nepal‚ÄìBihar earthquake. After the demise of Tulsi Maharaj in 1938, Swami Amritananda, a disciple of the Holy Mother became its president till his death in 1941. Then Swami Chandreswarananda, a disciple of the Holy Mother and a brilliant orator became the president till he died in 1946. Swami Asitananda, a disciple of the Holy Mother, was the next president and he led the organisation till 1951. Swami Tripurananda, a disciple of Swami Bramhananda, became the fifth president. He died in 1978. His disciple, Swami Vishnudevananda is the current president. This Math used to publish a weekly magazine, 'Bharat'. Saralabala Sarkar, a leading Bengali writer, was associated with it and 'Sanjeevani' was the monthly organ.

Brun was born in Lucerne. He was a student of Franz W√ºllner at the conservatory at Cologne, and studied piano and theory there until 1902. The following year he became a piano teacher at the music school in Bern. From 1909 until 1943, he led the symphony concerts of the Bernischen Musikgesellschaft, and was conductor of the choral society and lieder group there. From 1926 to 1940, additionally, he was the vice-president of the Swiss music society Tonk√ºnstlerverein. In June 1941 Brun retired, except for occasional returns to conducting. He dedicated his first violin sonata to violinist Adele Bloesch-St√∂cker. In 1912 Brun married Hanna Rosenmund; they had three children. Brun died in Grossh√∂chstetten.

History  The home of Holmegaard Glassworks is located in the town of Fensmark, Holmegaard. The company was founded in 1823 after Count Christian Danneskjold-Sams√∏e petitioned the Danish king for permission to build a glassworks at Holmegaard Mose (\\"Holmegaard Bog\\"). He died before permission was granted. But after his death when permission was finally received his widow, Countess Henriette Danneskjold-Sams√∏e pursued the project and began production in 1825 of green bottles, moving on to table-glass within its first decade. Much of its early work was derivative and inconsequential, but between the 1930s and 1980s its fortunes were transformed by the designs of Jacob E. Bang (1899-1965), Per L√ºtken (1916-98), and Bang's son, Michael (1944-2002). Today the company is known for its high-quality products of Danish design. = The L√ºtken Era = Danish glassmaker Per L√ºtken worked at Holmegaard from 1942 until his death in 1998, creating some of the factory's finest pieces and all-time classics, such as the \\"Idelle\\" series, the \\"Ships glasses\\" and the \\"Provence\\" bowls. The work of Per L√ºtken is still highly rated, especially throughout Scandinavia, and in Denmark and Sweden in particular. The arrival of L√ºtken at Holmegaard marked a new beginning in the history of the factory, which once again bloomed after several years of suffering. His aesthetic creations, in timeless designs, appealed to the fashion of the 1960s Denmark, and his creations became a great success throughout the decade and the 1970s. On September 9, 2008, Holmegaard Glass Factory announced that unless a buyer was found within three months it would be closed due to bankruptcy. This threatened to bring an end to 183 years of glassmaking tradition, widely renowned in Denmark and abroad. The crisis was initially handled in a way that saw the exhibition centre close, while the glass production remained. In 2009, however, all production ceased.

National Hydrography Dataset high- resolution flowline data. The National Map , accessed April 1, 2011 tributary of the James River in central Virginia in the United States. Originating on the eastern slope of the Blue Ridge Mountains in Nelson County, and fed by the Piney and Buffalo rivers, by way of the James River it is part of the watershed of the Chesapeake Bay. Although normally it is one of the more minor tributaries of the James River, in August 1969, the Tye River was at the center of one of Virginia's worst natural disasters. In the aftermath of Hurricane Camille, which had devastated the Gulf Coast of Mississippi a few days earlier, the remnants of the Category 5 hurricane stalled over mostly rural Nelson County, causing an unprecedented deluge of rain, mostly within a 3-hour period as people slept unaware of the threat. In the flash flooding and mudslides, entire communities were virtually wiped out, killing hundreds of Virginians, some of whose bodies were never found. Bridges, roads, railroads, and communications were severed for days, resulting in an estimated $140 million in property damages. In Massies Mill, one of the hardest hit communities in the Camille disaster, the Sierra Club erected a memorial in a small park which is dedicated to those who lost their lives and families in 1969. In modern times, the Tye River has become one of the more scenic and popular recreational waterways in Virginia. Course The Tye River rises at the confluence of the North and South forks of the river(), at the village of Nash in northern Nelson County, Virginia, on the eastern slope of the Blue Ridge Mountains. The North Fork rises near the Blue Ridge Parkway () at Tye River Gap and flows east, then southeast, to its confluence with the South Fork. The South Fork also rises along the Blue Ridge Parkway (), southwest of the village of Montebello, and flows east to the North Fork at Nash. From Nash, the Tye River proper flows generally southeastward through central Nelson County. The Piney River is a tributary of the Tye. Each forms a portion of Nelson's western border with Amherst County. The Tye River enters the James River from the northwest near Norwood, adjacent to James River State Park in Buckingham County.http://www.dcr.virginia.gov/state_parks/jam.shtml Towns and communities along the Tye River include Tyro, Massies Mill, Roseland and Tye River, all in Nelson County. History Much of the upper course of the Tye River was bordered by the Virginia Blue Ridge Railway, a short line railroad built in 1915. Originally, the area was heavily forested with chestnut trees, which were harvested for lumber transported by the railroad. However, these were largely decimated by chestnut blight in the 1920s. Later, the railroad was used to transport several types of minerals mined nearby in small quantities, but that activity ended by 1970. Passenger train service had ended in 1939, although State Route 56 was built nearby. In the 1980s, the tracks were abandoned. Flood damage along the Tye River, in the aftermath of Hurricane Camille On the night of August 20, 1969, the headwaters of the Tye River were near ground zero during one of the worst natural disasters in Virginia history. A few days earlier, Hurricane Camille had come ashore on the Gulf Coast near the mouth of the Mississippi River as a Category 5 storm, one of only three to strike the US mainland during the 20th century. The hurricane flattened nearly everything along the coast of Mississippi, and caused additional flooding and deaths inland. The storm had lost strength as it crossed hundreds of miles of land, and was downgraded by the National Weather Service to tropical storm status as it moved northward along the eastern side of the Appalachian Mountains and into Virginia. It still carried incredible amounts of moisture and contained sufficient strength and low pressure to pull in additional moisture.Ernest Zebrowski and Judith A. Howard, Category 5: The Story of Camille, Lessons Unlearned from America's Most Violent Hurricane, University of Michigan Press, 2005, As the remnants of the hurricane reached the area centered on Nelson County, the storm unexpectedly stalled on the eastern side of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Mostly within only a three-hour period, it dumped a record quantity of of rain. The rainfall was so heavy there were reports of birds drowning in trees and of survivors who had to cup their hands around mouth and nose in order to breathe through such a deluge. As many people slept unaware, the ensuing flash floods and mudslides killed 153 people, 22 in Massies Mill alone.http://hurricanewatch.mgnetwork.com/index.cfm?SiteID=TFP&PackageID;=9&fuseaction;=article.main&ArticleID;=66&GroupID;=17 Across Nelson County, 133 bridges were washed out, while some entire communities were under water. Waynesboro on the South River saw of water downtown, and Buena Vista on the Maury River had more than . Every bridge across the Tye River was severed, including the major highway bridge for U.S. Route 29 at the Amherst County line and the Southern Railway's main line bridge near Norwood. Just below the latter crossing, the waters of the Tye River flowed into the James River. Joined by massive flooding from other tributaries, the James crested in Richmond at at the City Locks, swamping downtown areas and a substantial portion of South Richmond, which had formerly been the separate city of Manchester.http://www.discoverrichmond.com/dis/sports/recreation/james_river/article/flood_wall_park/1457/ In Nelson County, the bodies of some people were never found; other washed as much as downstream along the creeks and rivers. The entire county was virtually cut off, with many roads and virtually all bridges, telephone and electric service interrupted. Total damage in the state amounted to $140.8 million (1969 USD, $747 million 2005 USD).)Rick Schwartz, Al Karr, Kevin Myatt, Hurricanes and the Middle Atlantic States: A Surprising History; Jamestown to the Present, Blue Diamond Books, 2007, Fish species The Tye River is home to dozens of species of fish and other aquatic life, including American eels, small and largemouth bass, and native mussels. A dam was removed in 2007 to help facilitate fish migration. According to an official of the Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries, \\"Removing the dam will increase the passage possibilities, and hopefully the populations of all these species. It will also allow for increased access for anglers, paddlers and boaters.\\" Recreation Fishing and camping are popular activities along the Tye River. Sections of the Tye River are also popular for whitewater boating with canoes and kayaks. The rapids are rated Class I to Class II+. Depending upon water conditions some rapids on the Tye River can approach class III. Sections of the former Virginia Blue Ridge Railway along the Tye River are now part of the Blue Ridge Railway Trail which was under development in the early 21st century. The trail will eventually connect the James River with the Blue Ridge Parkway and the Appalachian Trail.http://www.cstone.net/users/nelsonco/RailTrail/VABRTrail.htm See also *List of Virginia rivers *Hurricane Camille Further reading * Hurricanes and the Middle Atlantic States: A Surprising History; Jamestown to the Present, By Rick Schwartz, Al Karr, Kevin Myatt, Blue Diamond Books, 2007, * Category 5: The Story of Camille, Lessons Unlearned from America's Most Violent Hurricane By Ernest Zebrowski, Judith A.

The episode was written by David Grubstick and directed by Rose Troche. Plot Betty returns home with her arms full of moving boxes, but slips and falls after coming through the door. She regains her composure and is introduced to Ignacio's nurse, Elena, who is warmly at home with the family. At the same time, Betty and Amanda are looking for a new roommate, but Betty is getting mixed signals about leaving when she and Amanda see Jesse outside his place playing his guitar. After getting together, Betty and Jesse share some wine and have a long conversation that ends in what seems like a serious kiss, only to be interrupted by Jesse's phone which features one of his songs on ringtone. Jesse ignores the call. Hours later, after being woken up by Halston licking her face, Betty is quizzed by Amanda and later at work by Marc about the hours that lead up to the kiss, which is oddly acted out by Amanda and Marc. They reach the conclusion that Jesse was either serious... or drunk. Later that evening Betty tries calling Jesse but the call is sent to voicemail even as she hears his phone ringing through his apartment door. She tells Amanda that Jesse has been avoiding her. This has Betty really confused over her decision about whether she should stay in the city or return home to her family. The following day, Betty goes to the coffeehouse where Jesse is performing to confront him; Jesse confesses that he felt horrible about avoiding Betty and tries to convince her to go out with him. During their dinner date, Jesse's conversation focused on one thing: himself. As Betty saw the real Jesse and how truly self-absorbed he was, she had second thoughts and told Jesse he was not the one for her. Betty decided to leave her apartment, but not before telling Amanda she found a new roommate for her: Marc! Amanda and Marc are delighted. Back at the Suarez home, Ignacio's working relationship with Elena seems to be getting off on the wrong foot, as he is upset about how Elena is changing his habits, like cutting fatty foods and trying to get him to take a walk with her. Later that evening the two discuss trying to adjust, with her pointing out what a wonderful family has to live for and reminding him that if he doesn't change his ways he might not be as lucky next time. When Elena returns the next morning, she and Hilda discover Ignacio in a good mood during breakfast. Ignacio also asks Elena to join him for a walk. Meanwhile, Daniel and Molly try their best to keep their relationship a secret, but Connor is still puzzled by the tabloid photo of Molly, resulting in Wilhelmina becoming suspicious of Connor's recent avoidance of her. Connor invites a somewhat nervous Daniel to work out with him at the gym; during a round of boxing, Daniel can sense Connor's tension as Connor declares he will find out who Molly's \\"mystery man\\" really is. Later that evening Connor drives Daniel to Molly's neighborhood so he can spy on her, hoping to spot the \\"new guy.\\" But they're not the only ones there: Wilhelmina and Marc are spying on the two... and on Betty, who Daniel had previously asked to deliver some flowers to Molly from him. Betty is unaware of Connor's \\"stakeout\\" until Daniel spots her and grabs the flowers from her. When Connor sees this, he looks at the flowers and sees a card signed by \\"RJ\\"; Daniel convinces Connor to focus on Wilhelmina, and they drive away. Wilhelmina and Marc also leave, but not before they spot Molly walking home. An upset Wilhelmina realizes that Connor still has feelings for Molly. At work, Wilhelmina confronts Connor about Molly and delivers an ultimatum: he must choose between them. However, Connor asks Daniel to join him for another round of boxing at the gym. After trading some punches, Connor knocks Daniel down and calls him \\"RJ\\" - he put two and two together after seeing a T-shirt with \\"Rich Jerk\\" (Molly's nickname for Daniel, shortened to \\"RJ\\") on Daniel's desk, then the note with Molly's flowers. The next day, Connor asks Daniel, who is sporting a very obvious black eye, to join him for a business meeting. It seems things have been smoothed over. Connor then goes to Wilhelmina's office, admits he had a hard time letting go of Molly, but says he's now all hers... even if he has to beg. Casting This episode introduces Lauren Velez to the cast as Elena. Also, Ashley Jensen and Judith Light were absent from this episode. Reception The episode had a mixed reaction in this zap2it review: \\"It felt like Ugly Betty had completely derailed at the beginning of the episode -- and believe me, I still have some issues -- but by the end, there were a couple of resolutions that finally felt right.\\" Ratings While the episode managed to beat sitcoms on NBC (first-run) and CBS (repeats), this outing placed a distant second behind Fox's Bones with a 5.0/8 overall and a 2.4 among 18-49s, but only 7.27 million tuned in, dropping 270,000 from the last episode.\\"Ratings: Crossover Is Just What the Doctors Ordered!\\" from TV Guide (February 6, 2009)\\"TV Ratings: ABC Crosses Over to Thursday Win\\" from zap2it (February 6, 2009)\\"'Office' can't match Sunday's ratings\\" from Variety (February 6, 2009) This is the lowest ever number of viewers since the beginning of the series (this record would be taken by the Season 4 episode \\"Level (7) with Me\\").

Also popular were griffins, bears, solar, lunar and stellar images, and horses. Unlike much of European heraldry, multiple colors are common in mantling, most commonly blue and gold on the dexter side and red and silver on the sinister.

He studied English and Drama at Manchester University and later in California before moving to New Zealand where he established the first Drama Studies position at a New Zealand university in 1970; at the Victoria University of Wellington in Wellington. He retired from the position of Professor of Drama at Victoria in 1998 to concentrate on other projects. Biography He has worked extensively in theatre, as a professional director and drama tutor, both in New Zealand, the United States and Europe. Between 1968 and 1970, he worked as a 'polisher of English' (i.e. sub-editor) with the New China News Agency in Beijing. This being the period shortly after the conclusion of the Cultural Revolution, he was able to witness the re-emergence of Classical Chinese theatre as well as the emergence of new forms of drama. It was during this period that he wrote his first science fiction novel, The Eye of the Queen. For further details concerning this book and the circumstances surrounding its composition, visit Phillip Mann's website; see external links below. The Eye of the Queen details the life of Marius Thorndyke, Earth's leading contact linguist and founder of the CLI (Contact Linguistics Institute) after he departs to the world called Pe-Ellia at the invitation of the species for whom that is their home world. This species, long suspected but hitherto unknown, have been responsible for restricting Earth's space exploration to just a few inhabited planets none of which have attained space travel. In the course of his visit, Thorndyke comes to identify emotionally with one of the Pe-Ellian inhabitants and seeks to 'meld' with that being. This has extraordinary consequences for both Earth and Pe-Ellia. The Eye of the Queen established Phillip Mann's reputation as a creator of 'credible aliens' ‚Äì a feature which has remained prominent in his later works. He comments, \\"Thinking about alien consciousness helps clarify my thinking about Earth and the way we conduct ourselves. Thus I think of my books as being about us, no matter how outlandish the scenario.\\" The novel met with such critical success that some felt he would not be able to equal it. However, Master of Paxwax and its sequel, Fall of the Families, have become classics of New Zealand literature. Both books have been recorded in 15-minute episodes read by Dick Weir. They are regularly broadcast on Radio New Zealand. CDs of these recordings are available from Radio New Zealand. The story of Master of Paxwax, Mann's second book, centers around the life of Pawl Paxwax. Pawl ‚Äì and his name is significant ‚Äì is the second son of the Fifth Family in a galaxy-wide empire ruled by Eleven Great Families. These Families have for centuries enslaved non-human life forms by a policy of alien genocide. Now things are changing. Beneath the surface of the seemingly dead world of Sanctum, surviving intelligent aliens are gathering, united in their desire to strike back at the barbarous society that had laid waste their civilisations. When Pawl's father and brother die in quick succession, Pawl finds himself thrust into a position of supreme power, unaware that the alien races have decided to revolt and intend to use him and his lover, Laurel Beltane, as pawns to defeat the other ruling families. Pawl is a poet, and non-political in nature, but his enmity, once roused, is to be feared. \\"Wonderfully imaginative\\" said Locus. \\"High-class space opera with a welter of convincing aliens,\\" sang White Dwarf. The sequel, fittingly titled The Fall of the Families, brings this saga to its conclusion. The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction describes Phillip Mann's fiction as possessing \\"a strong visual and structural sense\\". After a decade concentrating on theatre direction, travelling, living in France and writing some plays and children's literature, in 2013 he published his first novel since 1996, The Disestablishment of Paradise. This is about the corruption by mankind of a pristine Earth-like planet called Paradise and subsequent banishment. Mann divides his time between his home in Brooklyn, Wellington and a converted barn in the small town of Choussy in France's Loire Valley.Mann Alive by Malcolm Burgess in the New Zealand Listener, 16 March 2013 pp33-35 He is now working on a new novel The Headman (a \\"darkly comic novel\\"), an anthology of short stories, and a work on theatre production.

He is a professor at Loughborough University in the UK, after professorships at the University of Michigan-Dearborn, and Wayne State University. During 1974‚Äì1976, he was a visiting Professor at the Universidad del Valle de Guatemala. Human evolution Barry Bogin is notable for arguing that human evolution introduced two new pre-reproductive stages, childhood and adolescence, into development. He argues that these stages are absent in the pattern of growth in nonhuman mammals, in particular, in other Homininae such as chimpanzees. This makes them biologically specific to humans. He further argues that the physical, behavioral, and emotional characteristics of children and adolescents that derive from these two stages play a key role in creating modern human adults. According to him, appreciating this aspect of human evolution has important implications for child development theory and practice in psychology, education, and child welfare. Guatemalan children Starting in 1974 Bogin began research on the physical development of Guatemalan Maya children, and their families. Since 1992 he has researched Maya child growth and development after migration to the United States. The purpose of this research has been to document and model the social, economic, and political influences on differences in physical growth and health between Maya children living in Guatemala compared to those in the USA.

He was born to a maritime engineer from Renfrewshire, and, after an apprenticeship in Liverpool, Houston also became an engineer. In 1877 he bought a share in a packet steamer with his inheritance, using the profits to start up his own management company in 1880, R.P. Houston & Company. In 1892 he was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Liverpool West Toxteth, resigning on 26 April 1924 through appointment as Steward of the Chiltern Hundreds. He was created a Baronet, of West Toxteth in the City of Liverpool, in 1922. In 1924 he married Lucy, Lady Byron, widow of the 9th baron, who then became Lady Houston. Research published in 2020 outlined her seven-year pursuit of him. In his will, he left his wife the bulk of his fortune. When he died on his steam yacht Liberty on 14 April 1926, she became the second richest woman in England. Using Houston's money his widow funded the first flight over Mount Everest and the development of the later-to-be-famous Supermarine Spitfire aircraft. She then purchased a weekly journal, the Saturday Review, in which she pursued a right-wing agenda to promote the strength of Britain and the Empire.

The town of Kilinochchi was the administrative center and de facto capital of the LTTE's proposed state of Tamil Eelam. The Sri Lankan Army (SLA) conducted an offensive through the months of November and December 2008 during which three attempts were made to capture the town during the month of December. These were thwarted by the LTTE, and both sides claimed that they suffered minimal casualties while inflicting maximum damage on the other during these assaults. The Sri Lanka Air Force launched air strikes against LTTE positions in Kilinochchi throughout this period. On 2 January 2009, divisions of the Sri Lanka Army advanced into Kilinochchi from the northern, southern and western directions of the town, and the LTTE fighters withdrew into positions in nearby jungles. Mahinda Rajapaksa, the president of Sri Lanka, later announced that the military had taken control of the town and urged the LTTE to lay down arms and surrender. However, the LTTE stated that the SLA captured a \\"ghost town\\" after they withdrew, and described it as an insignificant loss. After Kilinochchi was captured, several foreign governments urged both parties to seek a political solution. The Colombo Stock Exchange recorded a rise and the rupee stabilised, while celebrators lit firecrackers on the streets soon after the capture was declared. Amidst the celebrations, a suicide bomb attack occurred in the evening in front of the air force headquarters in Colombo, killing 3 and wounding about 30 people. The SLA continued to advance into LTTE held territory, capturing some more strategically important locations, including Elephant Pass and the entire A9 Highway soon after the fall of Kilinochchi. History and background The Sri Lanka Army withdrew from Kilinochchi in 1990, enabling the LTTE to take control of the town for the first time. The SLA recaptured it during operations Sathjaya I, II, and III in September 1996. However, the LTTE launched Operation Unceasing Waves II in September 1998 and captured the town again, forcing the SLA to vacate it. This battle caused heavy casualties to both sides, and the loss was described by the then military spokesman, Brigadier Sunil Tennakoon, as \\"the largest blow after Mullaitivu\\". Although Kilinochchi is not a strategically important location in terms of military operations, it bears a symbolic importance because of the LTTE using it as the de facto capital of Tamil Eelam, the separate state that the LTTE is fighting for. Vinayagamoorthy Muralitharan alias Colonel Karuna, a former commander of the LTTE, claimed that the town of Kilinochchi was important for the LTTE because it was the showcase of the organisation According to government claims, all civil administrative affairs were handled by government authorities despite the LTTE being in control of the town. = Administrative Capital = LTTE patrol in Killinochchi, 2004 After 2002, the LTTE used Kilinochchi as the administrative hub of the area under its control. The LTTE established a Police force, named Tamil Eelam Police Force, Peace Secretariat and Bank in areas under its control and Kilinochchi housed the headquarters for these entities. The Tamil Tigers also established and implemented a Judicial system which consisted of district courts, high courts and supreme court as well as a court of appeal. The supreme court was also located in Kilinochchi. Preparations 57 Division and Task Force 1 on Kilinochchi After the Sri Lankan military captured the Eastern Province from the LTTE, it advanced rapidly into LTTE-held territory in the Northern Province. The town of Kilinochchi was a major target for the troops during this offensive. With the SLA advancing on several fronts, the 57 Division and Task Force 1 (now 58 Division) operated on the Kilinochchi front with the objective of capturing the town. The overall operation was led by Major General Jagath Jayasuriya, the Wanni Security Forces Commander. Both divisions advanced from the west of the country, with 57 Division approaching Kilinochchi from the south and west, while the Task Force 1 advanced further northwards, capturing other key strongholds of the LTTE in order to converge on Kilinochchi from the north. By early October, Kilinochchi had been vacated by its residents and units of the Kilinochchi hospital, banks and several government institutions were relocated at Tharmapuram, a village away. 57 Division, led by Major General Jagath Dias, captured Akkarayankulam on 18 October 2008, a large village located to the southwest of Kilinochchi. The capture of this village enabled the SLA to attack Kilinochchi from the southwest. The Iranamadu junction, located to the south of Kilinochchi was also captured later, enabling the SLA to advance towards Kilinochchi from the south. Troops from the 57 Division earlier captured several LTTE strongholds such as Adampan and Kokavil The Task Force 1, led by Brigadier Shavendra Silva, advanced along the western coast, capturing several strategically important locations including the Mannar \\"Rice Bowl\\" area, Viddathalthivu, and Nachchikuda. The Task Force 1 launched an attack on Pooneryn on 15 November 2008, spearheaded by troops from the 2nd and 3rd Commando Regiments and a squadron of Special Forces, and captured the area. From there, the Task Force 1 moved west and captured Paranthan on 31 December 2008, enabling the SLA to attack Kilinochchi from the north. The LTTE constructed earth bunds and trenches around the town to halt the advance of the Sri Lankan military. One such earth bund was constructed to the south. Another stretched across the B69 Pooneryn ‚Äì Paranthan road, along the western side of the town. The LTTE had deployed their elite units, the Charles Anthony and Imran Pandiyan brigades along with other regular units under the command of Theepan, Bhanu and Lawrence for the defence of Kilinochchi. Meanwhile, the SLA began launching artillery attacks, while the Air Force launched air raids against LTTE positions in and around Kilinochchi. One such attack targeted the LTTE office complex in Kilinochchi. The government declared in October 2008 that it was ready to capture Kilinochchi. However, LTTE leader Velupillai Prabhakaran declared in an email interview that capturing Kilinochchi was \\"just a daydream of President Mahinda Rajapaksa\\". Timeline The Sri Lankan military began attacking Kilinochchi from three directions on 23 November 2008. Throughout the month of December, the SLA conducted three offensives in an attempt to take Kilinochchi. Heavy monsoon rains affected both sides during the months of November and December, with floods covering a large area in and around Kilinochchi. Troop movements were limited by this, and mines had been scattered around the area by the flood waters. Throughout the offensive, the Sri Lanka Air Force carried out numerous air strikes against Kilinochchi in support of the SLA. On 10 December 2008, the LTTE claimed to have blunted the first SLA offensive and killed 89 soldiers. However, the SLA claimed to have lost only 20 soldiers and killed 27 rebels. On 16 December 2008, the SLA launched a multi-front offensive against Kilinochchi. This assault was defeated by the LTTE, who claimed that SLA casualties in this battle were 130 soldiers dead and more than 300 wounded. They also claimed to have captured 28 bodies of army soldiers. However, the SLA denied this and claimed to have had only 25 soldiers killed, 18 missing and 160 wounded while they killed 120 Tigers. Heavy artillery and mortar fire was exchanged between both sides during the battle. Fighting continued for 10 days after this battle, during which period the SLA managed to capture some parts of the earth bund to the west of Kilinochchi. On 20 December 2008, the LTTE mounted a counter-offensive as SLA forces were preparing an assault to capture the village of Iranamadu, located to the south of Kilinochchi. The LTTE claimed that at least 60 soldiers were killed in the battle, but these claims were again disputed by the military spokesman Brigadier Udaya Nanayakkara, who claimed that SLA losses were 12 killed and 12 missing. =Capture= LTTE started to withdraw its personnel from Kilinochchi with the fall of Paranthan on 31 December 2008, as divisions of the Sri Lanka Army began surrounding the town. On 2 January 2009, the Sri Lanka Army entered the town of Kilinochchi. The SLA claimed they encountered only minimal resistance once it entered the town, as the rebels had withdrawn to positions in nearby jungles. According to the military spokesman Brigadier Udaya Nanayakkara, the SLA entered the town from three directions, overcoming pockets of LTTE resistance. The troop movements started on the dawn of 2 January 2009, when units of the 57 Division advanced across the built up area to the west of Kilinochchi, and entered the town center. More units of the 57 Division moved into the town from the south, while the Task Force 1 also advanced into the town from the north along the west and east of the A9 highway. After the capture of the town, the National Flag of Sri Lanka was raised at the town center by the commanding officer of the 57 Division, Major General Jagath Dias, along with the flags of Sri Lanka Army, Air Force, and the 57 Division. The infrastructure of the town was heavily damaged when the SLA took control of it. Most of the houses were badly damaged and a large water tank had been destroyed, which the SLA accused had been done by the LTTE using explosives. According to a senior commander of the SLA, the LTTE had damaged the town's infrastructure to obstruct the advance of the Sri Lankan military. Power supply lines in Kilinochchi had also been damaged. However, the LTTE claimed that the town's infrastructure had been destroyed by artillery attacks and air raids carried out by the Sri Lankan military. Reactions The President of Sri Lanka, Mahinda Rajapaksa, announced the capture of Kilinochchi at the Presidential Secretariat on the evening of 2 January, and called for the LTTE to lay down arms and surrender, stating that this would be the \\"final message\\" to the LTTE. In his speech, he stated that: The Island editorial described the capture of Kilinochchi as a blow to global terror and that it has sent a strong message that the civilised world is capable of eliminating the scourge of terrorism. Pro-rebel website Tamilnet reported that LTTE fighters and civilians had moved further northeast, and the Sri Lankan military had entered a \\"virtual ghost town\\". Balasingham Nadesan, the LTTE's political head, observed that the loss of Kilinochchi was an insignificant setback in the context of their liberation struggle, claiming that: Several foreign governments expressed their views on the capture of Kilinochchi soon after the event. On 2 January 2009, the United States Department of State urged the Sri Lankan Government and Tamil Tigers to start negotiating over the \\"legitimate issues\\" of the Tamils. India's Foreign Secretary Shivshankar Menon stated that there would be no military solution for the problems that are faced by Sri Lanka, regardless of how the military situation fluctuates. He mentioned that there should be a \\"political understanding within the framework of a united Sri Lanka\\" within which all communities can be comfortable. A statement was issued by the United Kingdom government as well, urging Sri Lanka to find a political solution. Their statement said that the need for a political solution was \\"even more urgent\\" now with the Sri Lankan military capturing Kilinochchi. In addition, Minister of State for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office of the British Government, Lord Malloch Brown and Secretary of State for International Development, Douglas Alexander, urged both parties of the conflict to respect International Humanitarian Law. The news of the fall of Kilinochchi to the Sri Lankan Military resulted in celebration, including gathering on the streets and lighting firecrackers, in places like Nuwara Eliya, Anuradhapura, Colombo, Ampara and Kalutara. The Government of Sri Lanka claimed that the population in Jaffna celebrated the capture by raising the national flag with anti-LTTE slogans and demonstrations. However Tamilnet, the pro-rebel website, denied these claims and claimed that the public were forced to take part in the celebrations. It claimed that the Sri Lankan Army confiscated the National identity cards of many residents in order to force them to take part. The country officially marked the capture of Kilinochchi on 5 January by hoisting the national flag and observing two minutes of silence to honour the troops, while television and radio stations either blacked out their regular bulletins during this time or played patriotic songs. Aftermath Following the capture of Kilinochchi by the SLA, the Colombo Stock Exchange recorded a rise of around 5 percent on the news and the Sri Lankan rupee became steady. A few hours after the President of Sri Lanka declared the victory, a suicide bombing was carried out outside the Air Force headquarters in Colombo, in which two air force police officers and a member of the bomb-disposal unit were killed and 30 people wounded. On 3 January 2009, at least 3 people were injured in another explosion that occurred in Pettah Market, triggered under a parked vehicle. On 6 January, an armed group attacked and damaged the Maharaja Television/Broadcasting Network studios of Capital Maharaja in Pannipitiya, after state owned media accused the media organisation of not giving sufficient airtime to report the capture of Kilinochchi. Reporters Without Borders condemned this attack, observing that the attack seemed to have occurred because the media organisation's \\"coverage was not patriotic enough\\". Soon after the capture of Kilinochchi, the government decided to ban the LTTE. The ban was put into effect from midnight, 7 January, for \\"using civilians as human shields in uncleared areas and endangering their lives, despite requests by the government to release them\\". The military continued its advance into LTTE held territory and captured the key LTTE position at Pallai within a few days. Soon afterward on 9 January, the SLA captured the strategically important Elephant Pass area, which links the Jaffna Peninsula with the mainland. The SLA is continued its offensive with the objective of capturing Mullaitivu, the only remaining major stronghold of the LTTE. Mullaitivu was also captured on 25 January.

His depictions range from subtle criticism of society to quasi-blasphemous sarcasm. His generation is probably the last one to use Yiddish as a literary language.

The columns are probably 4th century, the canopy 9th, 10th or 12th century. In ecclesiastical architecture, a ciborium (\\"ciborion\\": Œ∫ŒπŒ≤œéœÅŒπŒøŒΩ in Greek) is a canopy or covering supported by columns, freestanding in the sanctuary, that stands over and covers the altar in a basilica or other church. It may also be known by the more general term of baldachin, though ciborium is often considered more correct for examples in churches. By art historians at any rate. Really a baldachin (originally an exotic type of silk from Bagdad) should have a textile covering, or at least, as at Saint Peter's in Rome, imitate one. See Stanwick, 272; Krouse, 110; Grove There are exceptions; Bernini's structure in Saint Peter's, Rome is always called the \\"baldachin\\". Early ciboria had curtains hanging from rods between the columns, so that the altar could be concealed from the congregation at points in the liturgy. Smaller examples may cover other objects in a church. In a very large church, a ciborium is an effective way of visually highlighting the altar, and emphasizing its importance. The altar and ciborium are often set upon a dais to raise it above the floor of the sanctuary. A ciborium is also a covered, chalice-shaped container for Eucharistic hosts. In Italian the word is often used for the tabernacle on the altar, which is not the case in English. History The ciborium arose in the context of a wide range of canopies, both honorific and practical, used in the ancient world to cover both important persons and religious images or objects.Grove, Introduction Some of these were temporary and portable, including those using poles and textiles, and others permanent structures. Roman emperors are often shown underneath such a structure, often called an aedicula (\\"little house\\"), which term is reserved in modern architectural usage to a niche-like structure attached to a wall, but was originally used more widely. Examples can be seen on many coins, the Missorium of Theodosius I, the Chronography of 354, and other Late Antique works. The Holy of holies of the Jewish Temple of Jerusalem, a room whose entrance was covered by the parochet, a curtain or \\"veil\\", was certainly regarded as a precedent by the church;Barker, 95-97 the naos containing the cult image in an Egyptian temple is perhaps a comparable structure. The free-standing domed ciborium-like structure that stood over what was thought to be the site of Jesus's tomb within the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem was called the aedicula (or \\"edicule\\"), and was a key sight for pilgrims, often shown in art, for example in the Monza Ampullae.Barker, 96 This structure, erected under Constantine the Great, may itself have been important in spreading the idea of ciboria over altars.Cracraft and Rowland, 30 The later structure now in its place is far larger, with solid stone walls; the silver plaques covering the old structure were apparently used to make coins to pay the army defending Jerusalem against Saladin in the desperate days of 1187.Folda, 22 Ciboria were placed over the shrines of martyrs, which then had churches built over them, with the altar over the spot believed to be the site of the burial.Stancliffe, 24, 37; Grove appears to disagree (though agreeing that Constantine's in St John Lateran is the earliest known), and the immediate origins of the ciborium over altars appears to be undocumented. They also served to shelter the altar from dust and the like from high ceilings that could only rarely be reached.Grove The Euphrasian Basilica, Istria, now in Croatia. Columns 6th century and canopy 1277. Possibly the earliest important example over an altar was in the Basilica of Saint John Lateran in Rome, also donated by Constantine, looted by the Visigoths in the 5th century and now replaced by a large Gothic structure (see below). This is described as a fastigium in the earliest sources, but was probably a ciborium. Like most major early examples it was \\"of silver\\", whose weight is given, presumably meaning that decorated silver plaques were fixed to a wood or stone framework. No early examples in precious metal have survived, but many are recorded in important churches.Smith & Cheetham, 65; Grove, 1 Possibly the earliest ciborium to survive largely complete is one in Sant'Apollinare in Classe in Ravenna (not over the main altar), which is dated to 806-810,Krouse, 110; Smith & Cheetham, 65 though the columns of the example at Sant'Ambrogio appear to date from the original 4th-century church. The ciborium commissioned by Justinian the Great for Hagia Sophia in Constantinople and described by Paulus Silentarius is now lost. It was also of silver, nielloed, surmounted by \\"a globe of pure gold weighing 118 pounds, and golden lilies weighing 4 pounds [each], and above these a golden cross with precious and rare stones, which cross weighed 80 pounds of gold\\". The roof had eight panels rising to the globe and cross.Paulus Silentarius, , \\"pounds\\" substituted for \\"lbs.\\"; Smith & Cheetham, 65 The Early Medieval Eastern Orthodox church \\"directed that the eucharist be celebrated at an altar with a ciborium, from which hung the vessel in which the consecrated host was kept\\",Schiller, 29 the vessel sometimes being in the form of a dove. Early depictions of the Last Supper in Christian art, showing the Communion of the Apostles, show them queueing to receive the bread and wine from Christ, who stands under or beside a ciborium, presumably reflecting contemporary liturgical practice. An example of this type is in mosaic in the apse of the Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev, under a very large standing Virgin.Schiller, 28-31 According to the 8th-century saint and Patriarch Germanus I of Constantinople: \\"The ciborium represents here the place where Christ was crucified; for the place where He was buried was nearby and raised on a base.

The traditional attribution of this very widely- read work to Germanus is disputed by modern scholars. Examples in Orthodox manuscripts mostly show rounded dome roofs, but surviving early examples in the West often placed a circular canopy over four columns, with tiers of little columns supporting two or more stages rising to a central finial, giving a very open appearance, and allowing candles to be placed along the beams between the columns.Bock, 298 The example by the Cosmati in the gallery is similar to another 12th-century Italian ciborium now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York,Metropolitan Museum and that in the Basilica di San Nicola in Bari. By the Romanesque, gabled forms, as at Sant'Ambrogio, or ones with a flat top, as at the Euphrasian Basilica (illustrated) or St Mark's, Venice, are more typical. In Gothic architecture the gabled form already used at Sant'Ambrogio returns, now with an elaborate spire-like pinnacle. Probably the most elaborate is the one in the Basilica of Saint John Lateran in Rome, designed by Arnolfo di Cambio and later painted by Barna da Siena. The columns here and at San Paolo Fuori le Mura are still re-used classical ones, in porphyry at San Paolo and Sant'Ambrogio (Sant'Apollinare Nuovo in Ravenna has its porphyry columns, with no canopy surviving). Most of the surviving early examples are in stone in basilica churches, especially in Rome and other parts of Italy; it is unclear how common examples, perhaps in wood, once were in smaller churches.Stancliffe, 37; Grove, who mentions various lost examples mainly in wood. Altar curtains 13th-century Yaroslavl Gospels, with curtained ciborium in the centre; a common motif in Evangelist portraits Images and documentary mentions of early examples often have curtains called tetravela hung between the columns; these altar-curtains were used to cover and then reveal the view of the altar by the congregation at points during services ‚Äî exactly which points varied, and is often unclear.Bock, 297-300 on the Western and Greek churches. Altar-curtains survived the decline of the ciborium in both East and West, and in English are often called \\"riddels\\" (from French rideau, a word once also used for ordinary domestic curtains). A few churches have \\"riddle posts\\" or \\"riddel posts\\" around the altar, which supported the curtain-rails, and perhaps a cloth stretched above.However this term is so rare, that (spelt as \\"riddel\\"), a use in a poem by John Betjeman puzzled his biographer Bevis Hillier; see here and here Such an arrangement, open above, can be seen in folio 199v of the Tr√®s Riches Heures du duc de Berry.Commons image folio 199v of the Tr√®s Riches Heures du duc de Berry. Late medieval examples in Northern Europe were often topped by angels, and the posts, but not the curtains, were revived in some new or refitted Anglo- Catholic churches by Ninian Comper and others around 1900. In earlier periods the curtains were closed at the most solemn part of the Mass, a practice that continues to the present day in the Coptic and Armenian churches.The Orthodox Armenian Apostolic Church and Catholic Armenian Catholic Church; A comparison to the biblical Veil of the Temple was intended. The small domed structures, usually with red curtains, that are often shown near the writing saint in early Evangelist portraits, especially in the East, represent a ciborium,Bock covers the use and decline of ciborium curtains in considerable detail, though he is an old source. as do the structures surrounding many manuscript portraits of medieval rulers.Grove, 2.1 A single curtain hung, usually on a wall, behind an altar, is called a dossal. Green riddel curtains, with a metalwork dossal, in the Mass of St Gilles by the Master of Saint Giles Other uses Ciboria, often much smaller, were sometimes also erected to cover particular objects, especially icons and reliquaries,Cormack, 63, with a manuscript miniature showing an icon displayed under a ciborium and smaller ciboria that stood on, rather than over, the altar are also found. The word may also be used of some large sculptural structures that stand behind an altar, often offering no canopy or covering as such, for example at Siena Cathedral. These may be free-standing, or built against a wall, and usage here overlaps with the terms tabernacle and retable. The typical Gothic form of canopied niche to enclose a statue may be regarded as a \\"reduced form of ciborium\\".Grove, 2, (i) A very famous ciborium that apparently did not stand over an altar was one that apparently functioned as a quasi-reliquary shrine or symbolic tomb for the missing remains of St Demetrius of Thessaloniki in Hagios Demetrios, the large and important church erected in Thessaloniki over the mass grave in which he was traditionally buried. This appears, from various accounts of miracles associated with it, and depictions in mosaic, to have been a free-standing roofed structure inside the church, at one side of the nave, with doors or walls in precious metal all around it. It was hexagonal and made of or covered with silver; inside there was a couch or bed. The roof had flat triangular panels rising shallowly to a central point. It was rebuilt at least once.Cormack, Chapter 2, especially p. 63 and figs. 23, 27, 29. A medium-sized 13th-century ciborium in a corner of San Marco, Venice, known as the capitello (\\"little chapel\\"), was used for the display of important icons and relics in the Middle Ages., p. 416. Photo here Decline and revival Bernini's St. Peter's baldachin (1620s), actually a ciborium, was hugely influential on later ciboria Ciboria are now much rarer in churches in both East and West, as the introduction of other structures that screened the altar, such as the iconostasis in the East and rood screen and pulpitum in the West, meant that they would be little seen, and smaller examples often conflicted with the large altarpieces that came into fashion in the later Middle Ages.Grove, 2 (i) They enjoyed something of a revival after the Renaissance once again opened up the view of the sanctuary, but never again became usual even in large churches. Bernini's enormous ciborium in Saint Peter's, Rome is a famous exception; it is the largest in existence, and always called a baldachin.Krouse, 110 Many other elaborate aedicular Baroque altar surrounds that project from, but remain attached to, the wall behind, and have pairs of columns on each side, may be thought of as hinting at the ciborium without exactly using its form. The Gothic Revival saw the true free- standing ciborium return to some popularity: the Votive Church, Vienna has a large Gothic example designed in 1856, and Ninian Comper built a number, including one for Pusey House. Peterborough Cathedral has a neo-Gothic example, and Derby Cathedral one with the Romanesque small columns below a neo-classical architrave and pediment. Westminster Cathedral, a neo-Byzantine building, has a splayed version of 1894, with extra flanking columns, which within that context is \\"resolutely modernistic\\".Grove, 2 (ii) The Gothic style of ciborium was also borrowed for some public monuments like the Albert Memorial in London,Risebero, Bill, Modern Architecture and Design: An Alternative History, p. 91, MIT Press, 1985, , as it had been in the Middle Ages for the outdoor Scaliger Tombs in Verona. For other post-Renaissance versions, many variations of the basic square four-column plan, see the next section. Terms: ciborium or baldachin? The word \\"ciborium\\", in both senses, is said to derive from the cup-shaped seed vessel of the Egyptian water-lily nelumbium speciosum, which is supposed to have been used as a cup itself, and to resemble both the metal cup shape and, when inverted, the dome of the architectural feature, though the Grove Dictionary of Art, the Catholic Encyclopedia and other sources are somewhat dubious about this etymology, which goes back to at least the Late Antique period. An alternative is to derive the word from cibes (\\"food\\").Articles on \\"Ciborium\\" in works mentioned and OED; the shape of the seed cops of modern varieties of the plant seems very variable. Both senses of the word were in use in classical times. The word \\"baldachin\\" derives from a luxurious type of cloth from Baghdad, from which name the word is derived, in English as \\"baudekin\\" and other spellings. Matthew Paris records that Henry III of England wore a robe \\"de preciosissimo baldekino\\" at a ceremony at Westminster Abbey in 1247.Richard Ettinghausen et al., The Art and Architecture of Islam: 650-1250, 1987, Yale University Press (Yale/Penguin History of Art) The word for the cloth became the word for the ceremonial canopies made from the cloth. Bernini's St. Peter's baldachin imitates in bronze a cloth canopy above, and thus has some claim to be called a \\"baldachin\\", as it always is. A number of other Baroque ciboria, and secular architectural canopies, copied this conceit, for example Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome. The voluted top of the Bernini baldachin was also copied by a number of French architects, often producing structures around an altar with no actual canopy or roof, just columns arrayed in an approximate curve (a \\"rotunda altar\\"), with only an architrave and volutes above. Examples are at the churches at Val-de-Gr√¢ce (Fran√ßois Mansart and Jacques Lemercier, 1660s) and Saint-Louis-des-Invalides Cathedral (Jules Hardouin Mansart, 1706) in Paris, Angers Cathedral, Verdun Cathedral, Notre-Dame de Mouzon in Mouzon, Saint-Sauveur in Rennes, and the Saint-Sauveur Basilica in Dinan.Grove, with further examples These are usually called baldachins (not at Angers), and many have certainly departed from the traditional form of the ciborium. There is a Rococo German example at Worms Cathedral; many German Rococo churches used similar styles that were engaged with the apse wall, or partly so. In addition, according to the 1913 Catholic Encyclopedia articles on \\"Baldachin\\" and \\"Ciborium\\", the Catholic Church opted, apparently in the 20th century, to use officially \\"ciborium\\" only for the vessel and \\"baldachin\\" for all architectural forms.1913 Catholic Encyclopedia: \\"Ciborium\\" and Altar Canopy Architectural historians generally prefer to use \\"ciborium\\" at the least for all square four-column roofed forms.

German-American psychologist Kurt Zadek Lewin worked there and Robert Richardson Sears directed the station for much of the 1940s. Many other eminent psychologists, physiologists, and researchers were associated with the station and its work. In 1963 the station was renamed the Institute of Child Behavior and Development due to negative association amongst the public with the phrase \\"Child Welfare\\". In 1974 the Institute was closed as a research establishment. History The station was founded in 1917. A leader of the Iowa Congress of Mothers (a chapter of the National Congress of Mothers, which later became the Parent-Teacher Association) named Cora Bussey Hillis arranged for the station to be sited at the University of Iowa and procured funding from the state legislature and the Women's Christian Temperance Union. Hillis worked with Carl Emil Seashore, then the head of the psychology department at the University of Iowa, to establish the station. Seashore helped author the following law, which was eventually signed into law in 1917: With the exception of a stint of military service during World War I Dr. Bird T. Baldwin served as the first director of the station until his death on May 13, 1928. In 1922 the station listed these employees: LCCN 22026916 * Director Baldwin * Paid, full time‚Äî4 nurses, 1 social worker, 3 clerical or other helpers. * Paid, part time‚Äî1 physician, 1 nurse, 1 social worker, 3 clerical or other helpers. * Volunteer, part time‚Äî4 physicians. Research The Station was the first institution in the world devoted to the study of the \\"normal child.\\" Among its contributions to this field of knowledge, the Station conducted studies in the normal physical growth rates of children, studies in intellectual development in children and its relation to environment, studies in classroom management techniques that support positive outcomes, and developed collections of data regarding speech development and therapy for children with cerebral palsy. The Station also helped establish research standards for conducting research into child development. 1931 article in Popular Science describing some research conducted at the Station.

He is currently artist in residence at The Middlewood Trust, Roeburndale. Shilling is known for his ephemeral and changing art works made from natural materials in natural settings outdoors. He is self-taught and works intuitively, hoping to become more familiar with and absorbed in the landscape. Early life Shilling was born in Kent, UK. He spent his early life there, studying and working in Kent, before moving to Lancashire in 2005. It was on moving to the area that he first encountered the work of Andy Goldsworthy and became inspired to develop his artistic career. He has had no formal artistic training and began by copying Goldsworthy's sculptures closely to deconstruct his methods. Art works Shilling's inspiration came from Andy Goldsworthy whose work he initially studied and copied, before developing his own style. He works in the field to create land art sculptures using only natural items from the surrounding area with which to make them. Frequent themes are balancing sculptures, seemingly precariously stacked, and geometric designs using seasonal colours and changing hues. The art can last for as little as a few minutes to several months and Shilling often revisits the art to document how it alters over time. Shilling frequently photographs his works but uses only natural light, and often accompanies the work with short stories. Shilling uses small, commonplace natural materials to draw attention to the beauty in nature that is often overlooked, for example creating circular or mandala type designs from leaves and sticks. By these methods he aims to \\"respect natural cycles, seasons, life and death.\\" He has explained that the impermanence of his art means that for him his art is the process by which it is created, its insignificance in the wider landscape and its connectedness to nature, as well as a carpe diem reminder to appreciate beauty in the moment. Shilling has created many commissioned art works including public work for Lakes Alive festival in Cumbria and Down By the Riverside festival in the Forest of Bowland. He has said that this can be a particular challenge as he doesn't wish to deviate from his method of only using foraged natural items from the surrounding area, and the materials he uses have an inherent ephemerality which can conflict with creating a public artwork which would last for several days. He also teaches land art and holds workshops in Lancashire and Muncaster Castle, Cumbria and teaches both adult and children in the UK and abroad the techniques he uses. When working as a commissioned artist to a festival he often holds workshops on location. Shilling points out that as well as learning art techniques he likes to inspire people to improve their general health and wellbeing by reconnecting with the creative process and meeting other people in the outdoors. =Books= Shilling has self published 6 books, available in print and digital editions * Land Art (2009) * Wheel of Life (2009) * Transience, ephemeral art in nature (2010) * Flux (2011) * Land Art for Kids, On the Beach (2009) with Julia Brooklyn * Land Art for Kids, In the Woods (2010) with Julia Brooklyn See also * Environmental art * Environmental sculpture * Nils-Udo * Process art * Rock balancing ReferencesExternal links *Richard Shilling on YouTube *Land Art for Health *Richard Shilling art works on Flickr Category:1973 births Category:British contemporary artists Category:Land artists Category:Postmodern artists Category:Living people Category:Photographers from Lancashire Category:Artists from Kent ","title":"Richard Shilling"},{"id":"20924192","text":"Thoranam decoration in a Hindu Temple Thoranam ( IAST ) are hanging decorations in Tamil Nadu.http://www.oocities.org/rmayooranathan/decoration_concept.html Rooted in Tamil culturehttp://flickrhivemind.net/Tags/chennai,thoranam/Interesting it got a history way back to the Sangam period.

He led the development of Judo in France, with Shozo Awazu, and much of Europe and is credited with introducing the colored belt system for differentiating early grades. However, written accounts from the archives of London's Budokwai judo club, founded in 1918, record the use of colored judo belts at the 1926 9th annual Budokwai Display, and a list of ranked colored judokas appears in the Budokwai Committee Minutes of June 1927. Kawaishi visited London and the Budokwai in 1928, and was probably inspired to bring the colored belt system to France. The F√©d√©ration Fran√ßaise posthumously awarded him 10th Dan in judo and jujutsu. Name Mikinosuke is often erroneously transcribed, particularly in France, as Mikonosuke.  Biography  Kawaishi was born in Himeji in 1899 and having studied judo in Kyoto at the Dai Nippon Butokukai (Greater Japan Association of Martial Virtue). He left Japan in the mid-1920s to travel and see the world and began by touring the United States of America, teaching jujitsu particularly in New York City and San Diego. By 1928 he had arrived in the United Kingdom and soon established a school in Liverpool and with his close friend Gunji Koizumi. Koizumi was nearly 10 years his senior and was well established in the UK having formed the London Budokwai Club and a school at Oxford University. In 1931, he moved to London where he founded the Anglo-Japanese Judo Club and also began teaching judo at Oxford University with Koizumi. With the Asian martial arts still relatively new to England, he was forced to supplement his meager earnings as a teacher by becoming a professional wrestler with the stage name of \\"Matsuda\\". In that latter part of 1931 he returned to Japan for a short time, and it was during this trip that he renewed his association with Jigoro Kano, who awarded him with a third Dan in Kodokan Judo. In 1935, then a Kano fourth Dan, Kawaishi moved to Paris where he was commissioned to teach jujutsu to the French Police. It was at this time, that he opened the first public school of jujutsu in the Latin Quarters of Paris. Attempting to return to Japan as World War II loomed, Kawaishi was imprisoned in Manchuria. Following the end of the war and his subsequent release, he returned to Paris to continue with his teaching. In 1947 Kawaishi joined forces with Koizumi to promote the first ever-recorded Judo International tournament between two countries (UK and France). This became known as the Kawaishi Cup, with the medal bearing his name being awarded to the division winners only. With Mosh√© Feldenkrais he founded the French Judo Federation in the 1946, becoming the technical director for many years. Death Kawaishi died on the January 30, 1969, and his body was laid to rest in Plessis-Robinson, Paris.  Bibliography  * Michel Brousse, Les racines du judo fran√ßais.

Career Early years= Yussuff is of Nigerian descent but was born in Poplar, London on 23 September 1989. He is often nicknamed Toks as an abbreviation of his middle name Olatokunbo. Yussuff began his career as a trainee at Charlton Athletic Academy in July 2006 at the age of 17. He scored 8 league goals for the under-18 squad in the 2007-08 Premier Academy League, as well as scoring 2 goals for the under-18s in the FA Youth Cup. In spite of this, however, he failed to break into the first team and on 1 November 2008 the 19-year-old midfielder was loaned out to Conference side Northwich Victoria on an initial one-month deal. Yussuff made his debut for Northwich Victoria on 8 November 2008 in a 1‚Äì0 defeat to Burton Albion. He went on to make six more appearances for \\"The Vics\\" with his last match being a 1‚Äì0 defeat to Altrincham on 26 December 2008, after which he returned to his parent club. The midfielder would make his only appearance for \\"The Addicks\\" as a 79th minute substitute for Lloyd Sam in the Third Round of the 2008-09 FA Cup in which Charlton Athletic beat Norwich City 1‚Äì0 at Carrow Road on 13 January 2009, in front of a crowd of 13,997. On 26 March 2009, Yussuff was loaned out to Conference side Ebbsfleet United for the remainder of the 2008‚Äì09 season.

Yussuff was subsequently released by Charlton Athletic at the end of the 2008‚Äì09 season. =Gillingham= Yussuff joined League One side Gillingham on trial in July 2009, impressing manager Mark Stimson enough to be awarded a one-year contract for the 2009‚Äì10 season. Yussuff made his Football League debut on 8 August 2009 as an 87th-minute substitute for Jack Payne in a 5‚Äì0 win over Swindon Town.

Yussuff would go on to make 7 more league appearances for Gillingham in the 2009‚Äì10 season, the last being a 1‚Äì1 draw against Hartlepool United on 26 January 2010. Gillingham were relegated to League Two at the end of the 2009‚Äì10 season following a 3‚Äì0 defeat by Wycombe Wanderers on 8 May 2010. This resulted in Mark Stimson being sacked on 10 May 2010.

Yussuff was a key member of \\"The Dons\\" squad during their push for promotion, scoring 6 league goals in 40 appearances in the 2010‚Äì11 season. The midfielder's biggest honour to date for \\"The Dons\\" came when manager Terry Brown selected him to start in the 2011 Conference play-off final against Luton Town on 21 May 2011 at the City of Manchester Stadium in front of a crowd of 18,195. The match went down to a penalty shoot- out after the game ended 0‚Äì0 in extra time with AFC Wimbledon eventually winning 4‚Äì3, resulting in promotion to the football league.

In May/June 1944, the area's Jewish population was forced out of their homes into the brutal Cehei ghetto and from there packed into cattle cars and transported to Auschwitz-Birkenau. Over 160,000 Jews from the region perished.The Holocaust in Northern Transylvania Of those few remaining Jews who survived the Holocaust and remained in Romania, the last Jewish family emigrated from the region during the mid-1960s, while the country was still under Communist rule. The loss of its congregation left the Synagogue to fate, decaying silently over time. JAHF launched a vigorous campaign driving the restoration project forward. Its efforts contributed to raising funds to complete construction, establishing educational criterion, and supported pedagogical training for the regional school systems. The Museum now functions as an educational hub and essential resource for Holocaust Education in the region.

The Jews of SƒÉlaj County were concentrated in the Klein Brickyard of Cehei, in a marshy and muddy area about three miles from ≈ûimleu Silvaniei. At its peak in May 1944, the ghetto held about 8,500 Jews. Among these were the Jews from the communities in the districts of Crasna, Cehu Silvaniei, Jibou, ≈ûimleu Silvaniei, Supuru de Jos, TƒÉ≈ünad, and ZalƒÉu. Since the brick-drying sheds were rather limited, many of the ghetto inhabitants were compelled to live under the open sky. The ghetto was guarded by a special unit of gendarmes from Budapest and operated under the command of Krasznai, one of the most cruel ghetto commanders in Hungary.Final Report of the International Commission on the Holocaust in Romania Presented to Romanian President Ion Iliescu As a result of torture, malnutrition, and a totally inadequate water supply in the ghetto, the Jews of SƒÉlaj County arrived at Auschwitz in such poor condition, so that an unusually large percentage were selected for gassing immediately upon arrival. The deportations from Cehei were carried out in three transports between May 31 and June 8.Final Report of the International Commission on the Holocaust in Romania Presented to Romanian President Ion IliescuBiography of Elly Gross Although built structures no longer exist on the site of the former brickyard, the Jewish Architectural Heritage Foundation has set up signposts commemorating the events that took place at what is now known as the Cehei Ghetto.

The barren site aptly reflects the absence of the towns once vibrant Jewish population. Serving as a silent memorial to the Holocaust, the message is emboldened through sculptural suggestion and duplicitous abstractions. Embracing dichotomous design; the steel tracks represent the grotesqueness of the holocaust, as well as the temporal journey of the Jewish people.

Located around six miles south of Diss, in 2011 its population was 314. The village shares a parish council with neighbouring Thwaite. It is located on the A140 road from Norwich to Ipswich The name 'Stoke', comes from 'stoc', which means a place or a secondary settlement in old English. The word 'Ash', comes from the Anglian word '√¶sc', which means ash-tree. The name Ash was added to the name Stoke in the sixteenth century. In 1086 Stoke Ash was known as Stoches Stotas. Early history There is evidence of Roman settlement in Stoke Ash. A collection of Roman coins and pottery pieces have been found in the area. There is a small Roman site located \\"on the Colchester to Caistor Roman road\\". There are Roman tiles in the wall of the tower over the doorway in the All Saints Church. Some military items and pieces of overseas household articles have also been found. History In 1801, the population was divided into \\"those 'chiefly employed in agriculture', those 'chiefly employed in trade, manufacturers or handicraft', and others.\\" In 1831, 56 percent of the population were labourers and servants. Twenty percent were the middle class and 15 percent were employers and professionals. Only 2 percent was classed as 'other'. Kelly's Directory of Suffolk (1900), described the soil as being mixed, consisting of subsoil and clay. The chief crops were wheat, barley and beans. The area was said to be 1,200 acres. The Parish School, which included both girls and boys, consisted of 50 children, with an average attendance of 47. The pie chart shows the social status of men above the age of 20 in the year 1831. The \\"middle sorts\\" are a combination of farmers who do not pay for labourers and masters and skilled workers in urban manufacturing and handicrafts. Present Day 2011 employment statistics The village consists of a church called All Saints, a village hall and green, a post office, a public house and a boarding kennels and cattery called Quiet Acres . The A140 splits the village into two. To the east of the A140 are most of the houses, the church, village halls and post office, making this area the main part of the village. The Baptist church and six more homes are situated to the north of the village. The primary school and the White Horse Inn are located on the west side of the A140. The average population is older than the national average of the UK and also that of Suffolk. According to the UK 2011 Census, Stoke Ash does not have a large immigrant population as it has a low rate of inhabitants born in other EU countries or outside the EU. It has a higher level of residents born in the UK than the national average. The residents stating their health as 'very good' in the 2011 UK census was higher than the national average. The residents stating their health as 'very bad' was lower than the national average which suggests that people in Stoke Ash are generally more satisfied with their health than the average person in the UK. Stoke Ash has a higher rate of home ownership, either completely or on contract compared to the national average, which suggests that Stoke Ash is a relatively wealthy place. The pie chart shows the occupational statistics of 2011. Almost all the main jobs in 2011 have an equal number of people working in those sectors. This shows social structure has improved drastically because in 1831 most people were servants. All Saints Church All Saints is a medieval church located on Church Lane in Stoke Ash. It was founded in 1538 and includes a cemetery. It was intensely renewed in 1868. It is a Norman building made of flint and stone, consisting of S porch, chancel, nave and a square embattled western tower. The late fourteenth century square tower has a defensive wall and the roof is made of concrete brick tiles. The western tower accommodates four bells. The church has a Tudor red-brick porch. The west doorway and the tower stair doorway are both the original doors. The Arms of William IV (1836) are located above the south doorway. There are around 150 seats in the Church. The benches are from the year 1868. The register dates back from the year 1550. The White Horse Inn The White Horse Inn The White Horse Inn is a bed and breakfast which is situated on the A140 close to the town of Eye in Suffolk, midway between Ipswich and Norwich. It dates back to 17th century when it was a Coaching Inn. It was built during the reign of Charles the 1st ruled.

Located around east of Stowmarket, the 2011 Census showed that the population of the parish of Winston is 159. The parish also contains the settlements of Winston Green and Fenn Street. There is a church and an old school room, and every year there is a Winston Village Fete. A lot of the village of Winston is based around 14th Century Church, with multiple 16th Century cottages and farmhouses along church lane, showing the villages agricultural past, the area of Winston is still agricultural based with farms and fields all over the parish. Winston and the surrounding area is approximately 45m-50m above sea level making the area unlikely to flood, unless in exceptional circumstances. In the 1870s Winston was described as: > Winston, a parish, with a village, in Bosmere district, Suffolk; 1 mile SSE > of Debenham, and 7 NE of Needham r. station.  History  The parish of Winston first appears in the Domesday Book, written in 1066, stating that the population was \\"43.5 households (very large)\\". However the Domesday Book representation of the population is misleading, as the figure is based on heads of families so it may be up to 5 times more than the figure stated. The records show that from the first Census conducted in 1801 the population of Winston was 261. The population declined after the 1851 census, with almost everyone in the village at the time working on the land, it may be possible that due to the Industrial Revolution, Winston saw many of the residents move to local large towns like Ipswich. The population in Ipswich boomed during this period as many workers came from the rural area to the industrial area in search of more money and a better life. The parish of Winston contains 5 listed buildings, all of which are listed as grade II by English Heritage, mainly dating from the 16th and 17th Century. A population time graph for Winston, Suffolk from 1801 to 2011 According to the genealogy of the Suffolk family of Bacon, one Grimald, or Grimaldus, a relative of William de Warenne, who came to England in 1066. The Bacon family resided in the area around Winston, many birth and death records show that in the period of c.1475 to c.1640 the Bacon family lived in or around the area of Winston, which once had an estate which was handed down through the family. There is a War Memorial in Winston dating from 1923, it bears the names of 5 men lost in the First World War and 2 men lost in the Second World War. Employment A bar chart comparing the number of people in a type of work in Winston and the whole of England The 1831 Census showed that around 87% of people living within the parish of Winston worked in agriculture and by 1881 this was down to 53% working in agriculture. This shows a decline in employment in agriculture at the same time as a decline in population in the Parish. Around 13% of women living with Winston were enrolled in Domestic Services and Offices, the rest of female occupation being unknown or they did not have an occupation. The present day employment figures differ a lot from those in the 19th Century, for example only 5.1% of the population of Winston work in agriculture. Winston also has a low number of unemployed, the figure stands at 1.9%, which is well below 4.4% unemployed on average throughout England. Winston also has a very high percentage of residents that are self- employed at 28.3% as of 2011, much higher than the 9.8% average for the whole of England Church The local parish church called St Andrews was founded in around the 15th century. With extensions built during the 14th and 16th centuries, while being heavily restored during the 19th century, however it retains a lot of the original architecture, the church is listed as a grade II listed building. Records show that St Andrews church was used for many burials starting at around 1550. The last mention of the use of the school building in Winston is in 1897, where a letter was written concerning Winston school.  Travel  The nearest station to the village of Winston is in Stowmarket, which is 11 miles away or roughly a 25-minute drive from the centre of Winston. The station at Stowmarket is on the main line between Norwich and London. Winston lies just off the A1120 which is a direct road to Stowmarket, the nearest market town. The Village of Debenham nearby provides the local primary and secondary schools, while also providing local police and fire station, the centre of Debenham is approximately 1.5 miles from the centre of Winston, making it an easy place to get to. The nearest major town is Ipswich which is 30-minute drive and just under 13 miles to the centre of Ipswich from the village of Winston. This gives the residents of Winston options for a range of different services with two large towns in close proximity, making it an ideal place to live if you want to be in the countryside yet not in complete isolation. Winston is a 1-hour 30-minute drive from the nearest major airport which is Stansted and a 2 hours 20-minute drive from the airport of Heathrow. The centre of London is a 2:30-hour drive from the centre of the village of Winston, this makes the village of Winston easily within driving range of the biggest metropolitan area in the UK.

It is located in western Pennsylvania within the Pittsburgh Metropolitan Statistical Area, approximately northeast of Downtown Pittsburgh. Natrona is situated along the Allegheny River at Lock and Dam Four, Pools Three and Four between Brackenridge, Natrona Heights, Karns, Allegheny Township, and Lower Burrell. History The original village of Natrona ‚Äì then known as East Tarentum ‚Äì was built as a company town by the Pennsylvania Salt Manufacturing Company in the 1850s. The company began with two salt wells in 1850, and continued operations until 1959. By 1876, the company, which owned the cryolite deposits of Greenland, brought the crude mineral to its works in Natrona, where the mineral was pulverized, sifted, heated, reacted with calcium carbonate and leached to produce pure carbonate of soda (sodium carbonate) and aluminate of soda (sodium aluminate). =Canal= The Pennsylvania Canal once passed through Natrona and nearby communities in the early- to mid-19th century. =Railroads= The Pennsylvania Railroad had a train station in Natrona at Vine and Federal streets; its rail line began running through the town in the mid-19th century. Later, the Pennsylvania Railroad merged with rival New York Central Railroad in 1968 to form the Penn Central Transportation Company. The Interstate Commerce Commission required that the ailing New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad be added in 1969. The Consolidated Rail Corporation replaced the Penn Central Transportation Company and operated freight service through Natrona from 1976 until 1999 when it was divided between two companies. The Norfolk Southern Railway then operated trains through the town. Amtrak has detoured passenger service through Natrona on occasion; its nearest station is Penn Station in Downtown Pittsburgh. The West Penn Railways provided electric street car service to Natrona from 1906 until 1937. Local factories, beginning with the Pennsylvania Salt Manufacturing Company's Natrona Works, also operated trains through Natrona. As of 2011, Allegheny Technologies used a track to transport materials between departments at its Allegheny Ludlum Brackenridge Works. =Mining= The Pennsylvania Salt Manufacturing Company operated its Natrona No. 1 and Natrona No. 2 bituminous coal mines at Natrona. Geography Natrona is situated on an alluvial floodplain along the Allegheny River. Education The community is located within the Highlands School District. Highlands High School and Highlands Middle School are located in Natrona Heights. Air pollution levels (particularly chromium) measured in Natrona area schools are among the worst in the United States. Usage in popular cultureKnightriders= The film Knightriders (1981) by George A. Romero starring Ed Harris used scenes shot on Garfield Street in Natrona (1980) for the movie. Most of the film was shot in nearby Fawn Township. =Striking Distance= Lock and Dam Number Four spans the Allegheny River between Natrona in Harrison Township (below) and Lower Burrell (above). Also, the film Striking Distance (1993) starring Bruce Willis and Sarah Jessica Parker uses a sequence where boats jump over the dam at Natrona; the Tarentum Bridge can be seen just above the dam over Jacks Island, although the structure was added there later through editing. The bridge is officially named the George D. Stuart Bridge (part of Pennsylvania Route 366) and actually located about downstream spanning the river between Tarentum and New Kensington.

He was the wealthiest offer on Ile Royale and led the Raid on Canso and Siege of Annapolis Royal (1744) during King George's War.Bernard, p. 62 He received the Order of Saint Louis for his military work in Acadia.Bernard, p. 70  Early life  Fran√ßois Dupont Duvivier was born in Port Royal, Acadia, the eldest of the three sons of Fran√ßois du Pont Duvivier and Marie Mius d'Entremont de Pobomkou on April 25, 1705. With the cession in 1713 of Acadia to the British the Duviviers were sent to the new colony of √éle Royale (present-day Cape Breton Island) where, through various business endeavours they became one of the wealthiest and most prestigious families. Fran√ßois upheld his family's strong military traditions, enlisting as a cadet in the French troupes de la marine in 1716, and being commissioned an ensign three years later. By 1730 he had earned promotion to lieutenant and in 1737 he was made Captain in the Compagnies Franches garrison of Louisbourg. Business ventures Duvivier proved himself an astute businessman in Louisbourg, rapidly accruing a vast fortune and becoming one of the wealthiest officers in the colony. Through a series of trading ventures with New England, the West Indies, and France, canny manipulation of the law, and the usage of his military rank as leverage he earned a reputation as a businessman of great acumen who was not afraid to use unscrupulous business practices to further his own ambitions. By 1745 his fortune was roughly estimated by a contemporary at the vast sum of 200,000 livres.  King George's War  At the outbreak of the hostilities between France and Great Britain whose North American theatre became known among Americans as King George's War (but is known more generally as the War of the Austrian Succession), Duvivier was chosen to command a raiding party of 350 men in an attack on the British settlement at Canso. After the success of this raid the captain was charged with the task of raising an Acadian and Mi'kmaq army to capture Annapolis Royal (as Port Royal had been renamed), the only significant British stronghold in Nova Scotia. Having achieved less than expected success in gathering these forces, Duvivier arrived at Annapolis Royal with an army that was inadequate to the task of forcing a surrender. After laying siege to the settlement for nearly a month he received word that reinforcements and naval support from Louisbourg would not arrive, forcing him to break siege and return to √éle Royale.  Later life  After the expedition to Annapolis Royal Duvivier returned to France where he carried the colony's dispatches to Versailles and prepared to join a relief expedition to Louisbourg. However, the fall of Louisbourg to British colonists under the command of William Pepperrell halted all plans for a relief expedition, compelling Duvivier to stay in France. In 1747 he resigned his captain's commission only to rejoin at half pay in 1749 in order to make a bid for the governorship of √éle Royale, newly restored to the French in the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle. Failing in this he remained in France, retiring from the military in 1753 with a pension of 1,200 livres. Records of Duvivier disappear for the next twenty years, but it can be presumed that he spent most of this time living on his estate at Le Vivier, near Chalais in the commune of S√©rignac before dying on the 28th of May, 1776. The vast fortune he had accumulated in North America had dwindled to 25,000 livres, which was inherited by his sister-in-law.  References  Endnotes Texts * Bernard Pothier.

She worked as a nurse and poisoned her victims after encouraging them to leave her money in their wills. She was described privately by the sentencing judge as \\"the greatest criminal that ever lived.\\" Crimes Wilson worked as a nurse, first in Spalding, Lincolnshire, and then moving to Kirkby Lonsdale, Cumbria. She married a man called Dixon but her husband soon died, probably poisoned with colchicum, a bottle of which was found in his room. The doctor recommended an autopsy but Wilson begged him not to perform it, and he backed down. In 1862 Wilson worked as a live-in nurse, nursing a Mrs Sarah Carnell, who rewrote her will in favour of Wilson; soon afterwards, Wilson brought her a \\"soothing draught\\", saying \\"Drink it down, love, it will warm you.\\" Carnell took a mouthful and spat it out, complaining that it had burned her mouth. Later it was noticed that a hole had been burned in the bed clothes by the liquid. Wilson then fled to London, but was arrested a couple of days later. First trial The drink she had given to Carnell turned out to contain sulphuric acid ‚Äì enough to kill 50 people. Wilson claimed that the acid had been mistakenly given to her by the pharmacist who prepared the medicine. She was tried for attempted murder but acquitted. The judge, Lord Bramwell, in the words of Wilson's lawyer Montagu Williams, Q.C., \\"pointed out that the theory of the defence was an untenable one, as, had the bottle contained the poison when the prisoner received it, it would have become red- hot or would have burst, before she arrived at the invalid's bedside. However, there is no accounting for juries and, at the end of the Judge's summing-up, to the astonishment probably of almost everybody in Court\\" she was found not guilty. When Wilson left the dock, she was immediately rearrested, as the police had continued their investigations into Wilson and had exhumed the bodies of some former patients. She was charged with the murder of seven former patients, but tried on just one, Mrs. Maria Soames, who died in 1856. Wilson denied all the charges. Second trial Wilson was tried on 25 September 1862 before Mr Justice Byles, again defended by Montague Williams. During the trial it was alleged that seven people whom Wilson had lived with as nurse had died after rewriting their wills to leave her some money, but this evidence was not admitted. Almost all had suffered from gout. Evidence of colchicine poisoning was given by toxicologist Alfred Swaine Taylor, the defence being that the poison could not be reliably detected after so long. In summing up the judge said to the jury: \\"Gentlemen, if such a state of things as this were allowed to exist no living person could sit down to a meal in safety\\". Wilson was found guilty and sentenced to hang. A crowd of 20,000 turned out to see her execution at Newgate Gaol on 20 October 1862. She was the last woman to be publicly hanged in London. After the trial, Byles asked Williams to come to his chambers, where he told him: \\"I sent for you to tell you that you did that case remarkably well. But it was no good; the facts were too strong. I prosecuted Rush for the murder of Mr Jermy, I defended Daniel Good, and I defended several other notable criminals when I was on the Norfolk Circuit; but, if it will be of any satisfaction to you, I may tell you that in my opinion you have to-day defended the greatest criminal that ever lived.\\" Public reaction to crimes Wilson's punishment, the first death sentence handed down to a woman by the Central Criminal Court in 14 years, drew little condemnation.\\"Execution at the Old Bailey.\\" Times [London, England] 21 October 1862: 5. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 20 November 2012:‚Äú...not a single effort was made in her behalf in any quarter whatever...to arrest or divert the course of justice...not a finger was raised to deprecate a just retribution.\\" In the view of Harper's Weekly, \\"From the age of fourteen to that of forty-three her career was one of undeviating yet complex vice [...] She was as foul in life as bloody in hand, and she seems not to have spared the poison draught even to the partners of her adultery and sensuality. Hers was an undeviating career of the foulest personal vices and the most cold- blooded and systematic murders, as well as deliberate and treacherous robberies.\\" It was generally thought that Wilson was guilty of more crimes than the one she was convicted of.

LAPDm is similar to the ISDN Layer 2, LAPD, but with these simplifications: * LAPDm frames are always 184 bits, with segmentation for larger messages. * LAPDm allows no more than one outstanding unacknowledged I-frame (GSM 04.06 Sections 5.8.4 and 6). * LAPDm does not support extended header formats (GSM 04.06 Section 3). * LAPDm supports only the SABM, DISC, DM, UI and UA U-Frames (GSM 04.06 Sections 3.4, 3.8.1). * LAPDm supports the RR and REJ S-Frames (GSM 04.06 3.4, 3.8.1), but not RNR (GSM 04.06 Sections 3.8.7 and 6). * LAPDm has just one internal timer, T200 (GSM 04.06 5.8). * LAPDm supports only one terminal endpoint, whose TEI is implied. * The BTS is always able to enter asynchronous balanced mode when requested. * LAPDm can never be in a receiver-not-ready condition (GSM 04.06 Section 3.8.7). * LAPDm supports only two SAPs: SAP3 for SMS and SAP0 for everything else (GSM 04.06 Sections 3.3.3 and 6). * In SAP0, asynchronous balanced mode is always initiated by the MS (GSM 04.06 Sections 5.4.1.1 and 6). Another important difference between LAPDm and LAPD is the establishment contention resolution procedure of GSM 04.06 Section 5.4.1.4, wherein the MS sends an L3 message in the information field of the SABM frame which is then echoed back by the BTS in the corresponding UA frame. This procedure is required in LAPDm because of the possibility of a handset accidentally attempting to use the wrong channel. LAPD does not require contention resolution, since hard-wired ISDN devices cannot accidentally use a wrong channel. The Associated Control Procedure used in Layer 2 of the iDEN RF interface is very similar to LAPDm.

His father left the family home when Murphy was a child, forcing his mother to go on welfare. At 15, he was a high school dropout. One summer, however, young Cisero began playing pool at the Police Athletic League (PAL), and except for short-term jobs, he continued playing pool for the duration of his life.The Saga of Cicero Murphy Scorecard SportsIllustrated.cnn.com Retrieved 2009-01-03 He became city champion in 1953 and state champion in 1958. From 1959 to 1964, he was eastern state champion in the PAL. Later in life, Murphy participated in city programs in an effort to help young adults and children, such as Billiards in the Streets, which was sponsored by the Department of Parks and Recreation. He also would visit veterans hospitals, senior citizen homes, and mental hospitals giving trick shot exhibitions and teaching people how to play pool.Karen Kramer Filmes City Pockets Pool Tournament Retrieved 2009-01-03 He won the New York City championship at age sixteen, and when he was in his twenties, he won the Eastern States 14.1 Championship six straight times. Because he was African American in an era when there were racial tensions in the United States, Murphy was not invited to compete in world title events until 1965 despite his skills as a player. Many other African Americans who were not accepted in the world title events avoided confrontation due to intimidation. Murphy won the Burbank World Invitational 14.1 tournament in 1965, defeating white players such as Joe Balsis, Jimmy Moore, and Luther Lassiter. Pool players picketed outside the front of the now-defunct Commodore Hotel in Midtown Manhattan, which was the site of the 1964 Billiard Room Propriety Association of America tournament, to protest Murphy's exclusion.Murphy's Law, Mike Gefner, Village Voice, Dec. 13, 1994 The next year he competed in the Burbank World Invitational 14.1 tournament against top-flight competition, and defeated Luther Lassiter in the finals. Some people have compared Cisero Murphy to Major League Baseball's Jackie Robinson, breaking the racial barriers (including the baseball color line) in sports. Murphy was inducted into the Billiard Congress of America Hall of Fame 1995. Cisero Murphy is the only player in the history of pocket billiards competition to win a world title on his first attempt. He continued to place near the top in straight pool events during the 1960s and, two decades later, had a winning record in the 1983 BCA US Open 14.1 Championship. During his career, he has had high runs over 250 balls. After taking the title, Murphy was officially in the upper echelon of players.

According to oral tradition, he had extraordinary characteristics and was widely feared, but he was persuaded to support the confederacy of the Five Nations. His name has since been used as the term, Tadodaho, to refer to the chief chosen to preside over the Grand Council of the Iroquois League. By tradition, as the Onondaga are the \\"keepers of the council fire\\", the chief is chosen from that nation. The position is the most influential Iroquois chief in New York State, where the Six Nations confederacy historically had the most influence. This meaning of the term has been used for centuries. Legend of Tadodaho Tadodaho was said to be a warrior and primary chief of the Onondaga people. Depending on the speaker's dialect and the writer's orthography, other versions of the name include Adodarhoh, Atartaho, Atotarho, Tatotarho, Thatotarho, and Watatohtahro. In the 1883 work The Iroquois Book of Rites, edited by Horatio Hale, the term Atartaho is said to signify \\"entangled\\". In 1889, J. N. B. Hewitt recounted an Iroquois tale which refers to Tadodaho as a \\"misshapen monster\\". Jean Houston and Margaret Rubin write in Manual for the Peacemaker that Tadodaho had \\"matted and spiky hair\\", and that this visage lent itself to legends that he had snakes in his hair. He is said to have had a \\"twisted body\\" and could kill his enemies from a distance without seeing them. Tadodaho ruled with fear, and his people believed him to be a sorcerer. He scared his own people and threatened other peoples, including the Seneca and Cayuga nations. Tadodaho successfully led his Onondaga in raids against the nearby Cayuga people and traveled west, and attacked the Seneca people. Peace among the nations of the Haudenosaunee was delayed due to fear of Tadodaho. Deganawidah, of the Huron people, and Hiawatha, of the Onondaga, desired peace among the Haudenosaunee peoples. According to legend, all the chiefs were persuaded except for Tadodaho, who was seen as a hindrance to the Great Law of Peace; he quashed three attempts by Hiawatha to initiate peace discussions among the nations. Hiawatha's daughter died after Tadodaho broke Hiawatha's first attempt to bring together a council, and Hiawatha's second daughter died after Tadodaho foiled the second council. Hiawatha's daughters' deaths were ascribed to Tadodaho's powers. Hiawatha's third daughter died at the council fire of the third meeting, while Tadodaho was present. Hewitt writes in his 1888 recounting that Hiawatha cried: \\"All my children are now gone from me; they have been destroyed by Tha-do-da-ho, and he has spoiled our plans. It now behooves me to go among other people. I will start now.\\" Onondaga Lake According to Haudenosaunee legend, Hiawatha and Deganawidah used political and spiritual tactics to garner Tadodaho's support. Hiawatha and Deganawidah walked with the chiefs of the Cayuga, Mohawk, Oneida, and Onondaga peoples to Canandaigua Lake while singing a song called the \\"Peace Hymn\\". When they arrived at Canandaigua Lake, they convinced the Seneca people to join their cause of peace. Houston and Rubin recount a statement by Deganawidah, who asserted that he was ready to go meet with Tadodaho at Onondaga Lake and win him over to his mission of peace, saying: > \\"We must seek the fire and look for the smoke of Tadodaho. He alone stands > in our path. His mind is twisted, and there are seven crooks in his body. > These must be straightened if the league is to endure.\\" Hiawatha and Deganawidah consulted with Jigonhsasee, also called Mother of Nations, who advised them how to win Tadodaho to their cause. They used a holy medicine ceremony to soothe Tadodaho and heal his mind and body. In one recounting of the story, Jigonhsasee herself spoke privately with Tadodaho. Hiawatha combed the matted portions out of Tadodaho's hair, and Deganawidah massaged Tadodaho's body with herbs and wampum, and smoothed out the seven crooks in Tadodaho's body. After Tadodaho was healed, he permitted the Onondaga people to join the council of peace. Tadodaho joined the League of the Great Peace and was given the title of \\"firekeeper\\" of the confederacy; he was chairman of the council of nations. The final steps toward peace were conducted at Onondaga Lake. The Tadodaho legend continues to be told in Haudenosaunee society. It has come to refer to the chief who chairs the council of the Onondaga, called Tadodaho. Charles L. Henning writes in the work \\"Hiawatha and the Onondaga Indians\\", published in 1902 in the periodical The Open Court: > \\"...the name Tadodaho remained in the tribe, and when a man was obliged to > hold the office of head-chief of the Onondagas, he was always called > Tadodaho. The Tadodaho is the only proper man to invite the people to the > general council of the five nations, and for this reason he is considered > the 'fire keeper,' because the Onondagas were the keepers of the great > council fire.\\" Term for spiritual leader The term Tadodaho later was used by the Iroquois to refer to their most influential spiritual leader in New York State; it has been used in this way for centuries. The Tadodaho in New York State is the spiritual leader of the Haudenosaunee, Six Nations that includes the Cayuga, Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Seneca, and Tuscarora people. The post is also called the \\"Head Chief of All the Six Nations\\". He presides over the Grand Council of the Haudenosaunee (also called Iroquois). The Great Council Fire of the Iroquois League is still located within the Onondaga reservation in present-day New York. Many of the Iroquois live in Canada, where their ancestors moved after the American Revolutionary War, as they were allies of the defeated British. The Crown gave them some land in compensation for what they lost. Along with other Native American leaders, the Tadodaho is responsible for maintaining the history of the Haudenosaunee people. The position of Tadodaho is a lifetime appointment. According to tradition, when the previous Tadodaho dies, a council of chiefs from the Haudenosaunee chooses a leader from the Onondaga people. Contemporary leaders and issues As Tadodaho in 1968, George A. Thomas demanded the return to the Iroquois of 25 wampum belts that were held by the New York State Museum. Thomas said: > \\"it was wrong for our grandfathers to give away the wampum. The wampum tells > of old, old agreements and passes on the thoughts of our grandfathers. We > would like to see them. Our people would like to touch them.\\" An anthropologist described the conflict as \\"the great wampum war\\", and the issue affected the relationship between the Iroquois people, the New York State Museum, and academia. Thomas had emphasized spiritual leadership and said the wampum belts represented important traditions for the people. This was in the period of Native American activism that led to passage of NAGPRA, federal legislation to protect Native American cultural resources and encourage museums to return remains and grave goods to the nations. On December 7, 1968, Leon Shenandoah was selected as the next Tadodaho. He worked in daily life as a custodian at Syracuse University. Shenandoah asserted both the political responsibilities and spiritual nature of his role. He opposed any of the Haudenosaunee's entering into gambling enterprises, warning of the moral problems associated with such decisions.[Doug George-Kanentiio, \\"Oneida Nation violates Iroquois laws\\"], Indianz.com, 20 May 2013, accessed 11 September 2013 He was highly respected for his spiritual leadership and, when he died in 1996, his death was mourned by Native Americans across the United States. He had served as Tadodaho for over 25 years during a period of major changes among the Iroquois and other Native American nations, who have been reasserting sovereignty. In 2002, Sidney Hill was selected as the Tadodaho. He has been active in land claim cases in New York, by which the Iroquois nations have sought return or compensation for lands they were forced to cede to New York in the aftermath of the American Revolutionary War. The federal courts have upheld some land claim cases. In 2005, Hill led a group of Onondaga to file papers in United States federal court claiming land ownership over in Upstate New York. The ownership assertion by the Onondaga included land along Lake Ontario from the Thousand Islands through Syracuse, to the border of Pennsylvania, and including Onondaga Lake. Hill wanted to highlight the desire of his people to see Onondaga Lake restored to environmental health. In May 2013, Tadodaho Hill sent a letter to several Iroquois communities in an effort to guide their relation to the Confederacy and its traditional principles. He (and others) have opposed the Oneida Nation of New York's May 16, 2013 agreement with New York State that would involve the tribe's putting their land in trust, accepting New York taxes, and additional New York jurisdiction over their affairs, as part of a deal to gain gambling. (According to Doug George-Kanentiio, a Mohawk journalist, this tribe is not officially part of the Haudenosaunee, as it did not exist when the Confederacy was formed.) In popular culture *Rick, the protagonist of Simon Spurrier's novel, The Culled (2006, book 1 of The Afterblight Chronicles), belongs to the Haudenosaunee people and is guided through crises by the sachem. Another character, named Hiawatha, saves Rick's life and advises him the Tadodaho have said Rick and Hiawatha's courses are \\"aligned\\".

Heron was held prisoner of war in Louisbourg until 22 September of that year at which time he and the other British prisoners were released and transported to Boston. There they provided the Massachusetts leadership with valuable intelligence concerning the defences of the fortress at Louisbourg, making possible its capture the following year.

He is often portrayed as the son of the love goddess Venus and the god of war Mars. He is also known in Latin as ' (\\"Love\\"). His Greek counterpart is Eros.Larousse Desk Reference Encyclopedia, The Book People, Haydock, 1995, p. 215. Although Eros is generally portrayed as a slender winged youth in Classical Greek art, during the Hellenistic period, he was increasingly portrayed as a chubby boy. During this time, his iconography acquired the bow and arrow that represent his source of power: a person, or even a deity, who is shot by Cupid's arrow is filled with uncontrollable desire. In myths, Cupid is a minor character who serves mostly to set the plot in motion. He is a main character only in the tale of Cupid and Psyche, when wounded by his own weapons, he experiences the ordeal of love. Although other extended stories are not told about him, his tradition is rich in poetic themes and visual scenarios, such as \\"Love conquers all\\" and the retaliatory punishment or torture of Cupid. His powers are similar, though not identical, to Kamadeva the Hindu god of human love. In art, Cupid often appears in multiples as the Amores, or ' in the later terminology of art history, the equivalent of the Greek erotes. Cupids are a frequent motif of both Roman art and later Western art of the classical tradition. In the 15th century, the iconography of Cupid starts to become indistinguishable from the putto. Cupid continued to be a popular figure in the Middle Ages, when under Christian influence he often had a dual nature as Heavenly and Earthly love. In the Renaissance, a renewed interest in classical philosophy endowed him with complex allegorical meanings. In contemporary popular culture, Cupid is shown drawing his bow to inspire romantic love, often as an icon of Valentine's Day.This introduction is based on the entry on \\"Cupid\\" in The Classical Tradition, edited by Anthony Grafton, Glenn W. Most, and Salvatore Settis (Harvard University Press, 2010), pp. 244‚Äì246.  Etymology  The name Cupƒ´d≈ç ('passionate desire') is a derivative of Latin cupi≈ç, cupiere ('to desire'), stemming from Proto-Italic *kupi, *kupei ('to desire'), ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *kup(e)i ('to tremble, desire'). Origins and birth Cupid Carving His Bow (1620s) by Fran√ßois Duquesnoy, Bode Museum, Berlin The Romans reinterpreted myths and concepts pertaining to the Greek Eros for Cupid in their own literature and art, and medieval and Renaissance mythographers conflate the two freely. In the Greek tradition, Eros had a dual, contradictory genealogy. He was among the primordial gods who came into existence asexually; after his generation, deities were begotten through male-female unions.Leonard Muellner, The Anger of Achilles: M·ªÖnis in Greek Epic (Cornell University Press, 1996), pp. 57‚Äì58; Jean-Pierre Vernant, \\"One ... Two ... Three: Er≈çs,\\" in Before Sexuality: The Construction of Erotic Experience in the Ancient Greek World (Princeton University Press, 1990), p. 467. In Hesiod's Theogony, only Chaos and Gaia (Earth) are older. Before the existence of gender dichotomy, Eros functioned by causing entities to separate from themselves that which they already contained.Vernant, \\"One ... Two ... Three: Er≈çs,\\" p. 465ff. At the same time, the Eros who was pictured as a boy or slim youth was regarded as the child of a divine couple, the identity of whom varied by source. The influential Renaissance mythographer Natale Conti began his chapter on Cupid/Eros by declaring that the Greeks themselves were unsure about his parentage: Heaven and Earth,Sappho, fragment 31. Ares and Aphrodite,Simonides, fragment 54. Night and Ether,Acusilaus, FGrH 1A 3 frg. 6C. or Strife and Zephyr.Alcaeus, fragment 13. Citations of ancient sources from Conti given by John Mulryan and Steven Brown, Natale Conti's Mythologiae Books I‚ÄìV (Arizona Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies, 2006), vol. 1, p. 332. The Greek travel writer Pausanias, he notes, contradicts himself by saying at one point that Eros welcomed Aphrodite into the world, and at another that Eros was the son of Aphrodite and the youngest of the gods.Natale Conti, Mythologiae 4.14. In Latin literature, Cupid is usually treated as the son of Venus without reference to a father. Seneca says that Vulcan, as the husband of Venus, is the father of Cupid.Seneca, Octavia 560. Cicero, however, says that there were three Cupids, as well as three Venuses: the first Cupid was the son of Mercury and Diana, the second of Mercury and the second Venus, and the third of Mars and the third Venus. This last Cupid was the equivalent of Anteros, \\"Counter-Love,\\" one of the Erotes, the gods who embody aspects of love.Cicero, De Natura Deorum 3.59‚Äì60. The multiple Cupids frolicking in art are the decorative manifestation of these proliferating loves and desires. During the English Renaissance, Christopher Marlowe wrote of \\"ten thousand Cupids\\"; in Ben Jonson's wedding masque Hymenaei, \\"a thousand several-coloured loves ... hop about the nuptial room\\".M.T. Jones-Davies and Ton Hoenselaars, introduction to Masque of Cupids, edited and annotated by John Jowett, in Thomas Middleton: The Collected Works (Oxford University Press, 2007), p. 1031. In the later classical tradition, Cupid is most often regarded as the son of Venus and Mars, whose love affair represented an allegory of Love and War.\\"Cupid,\\" The Classical Tradition, p. 244. The duality between the primordial and the sexually conceived Eros accommodated philosophical concepts of Heavenly and Earthly Love even in the Christian era.Entry on \\"Cupid,\\" The Classical Tradition, p. 244. Attributes and themes A blindfolded, armed Cupid (1452/66) by Piero della Francesca Edme Bouchardon, Cupid, 1744, National Gallery of Art Cupid is winged, allegedly because lovers are flighty and likely to change their minds, and boyish because love is irrational. His symbols are the arrow and torch, \\"because love wounds and inflames the heart.\\" These attributes and their interpretation were established by late antiquity, as summarized by Isidore of Seville (d. 636 AD) in his Etymologiae.Isidore, Etymologies 8.11.80. Cupid is also sometimes depicted blindfolded and described as blind, not so much in the sense of sightless‚Äîsince the sight of the beloved can be a spur to love‚Äîas blinkered and arbitrary. As described by Shakespeare in A Midsummer Night's Dream (1590s):Geoffrey Miles, Classical Mythology in English Literature: A Critical Anthology (Routledge, 1999), p. 24. Cupid sculpture by Bertel Thorvaldsen In Botticelli's Allegory of Spring (1482), also known by its Italian title La Primavera, Cupid is shown blindfolded while shooting his arrow, positioned above the central figure of Venus.Jennifer Speake and Thomas G. Bergin, entry on \\"Cupid,\\" Encyclopedia of the Renaissance and the Reformation (Market House Books, rev. ed. 2004), p. 129. Particularly in ancient Roman art, cupids may also carry or be surrounded by fruits, animals, or attributes of the Seasons or the wine-god Dionysus, symbolizing the earth's generative capacity.Jean Sorabella, \\"A Roman Sarcophagus and Its Patron,\\" Metropolitan Museum Journal 36 (2001), p. 75. Having all these associations, Cupid is considered to share parallels with the Hindu god Kama. Entry: \\"Kama\\" =Cupid's arrows= The god of love (Cupid) shoots an arrow at the lover. From a 14th-century text of Roman de la Rose. Cupid carries two kinds of arrows, or darts, one with a sharp golden point, and the other with a blunt tip of lead. A person wounded by the golden arrow is filled with uncontrollable desire, but the one struck by the lead feels aversion and desires only to flee. The use of these arrows is described by the Latin poet Ovid in the first book of his Metamorphoses. When Apollo taunts Cupid as the lesser archer, Cupid shoots him with the golden arrow, but strikes the object of his desire, the nymph Daphne, with the lead. Trapped by Apollo's unwanted advances, Daphne prays to her father, the river god Peneus, who turns her into a laurel, the tree sacred to Apollo. It is the first of several unsuccessful or tragic love affairs for Apollo.Ovid, Metamorphoses 1.463‚Äì473. A variation is found in The Kingis Quair, a 15th-century poem attributed to James I of Scotland, in which Cupid has three arrows: gold, for a gentle \\"smiting\\" that is easily cured; the more compelling silver; and steel, for a love-wound that never heals.The Kingis Quair, lines 92‚Äì99; Walter W. Skeat, Chaucerian and Other Pieces (Oxford University Press, 1897, 1935), sup. vol., note 1315, p. 551. =Cupid and the bees= Cupid the Honey Thief, by Lucas Cranach the Elder In the tale of Cupid the honey thief, the child-god is stung by bees when he steals honey from their hive. He cries and runs to his mother Venus,Susan Youens, Hugo Wolf and His M√∂rike Songs (Cambridge University Press, 2004), p. 118: \\"When he runs crying to his mother Venus\\". complaining that so small a creature shouldn't cause such painful wounds. Venus laughs, and points out the poetic justice: he too is small, and yet delivers the sting of love. The story was first told about Eros in the Idylls of Theocritus (3rd century BC).Theocritus, Idyll 19. It also appears in Anacreontic poetry. It was retold numerous times in both art and poetry during the Renaissance. The theme brought the Amoretti poetry cycle (1595) of Edmund Spenser to a conclusion,Jane Kingsley-Smith, Cupid in Early Modern Literature and Culture (Cambridge University Press, 2010), p. 12. and furnished subject matter for at least twenty works by Lucas Cranach the Elder and his workshop.Charles Sterling et al., Fifteenth- to Eighteenth-Century European Paintings in the Robert Lehman Collection: France, Central Europe, The Netherlands, Spain, and Great Britain (Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1998), pp. 43‚Äì44. The German poet and classicist Karl Philipp Conz (1762‚Äì1827) framed the tale as Schadenfreude (\\"taking pleasure in someone else's pain\\") in a poem by the same title.Youens, Hugo Wolf and His M√∂rike Songs, p. 119. In a version by Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, a writer of the German Enlightenment, the incident prompts Cupid to turn himself into a bee: > Through this sting was Amor made wiser. > The untiring deceiver > concocted another battle-plan: > he lurked beneath the carnations and roses > and when a maiden came to pick them, > he flew out as a bee and stung her.Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, Die Biene; > Youens, Hugo Wolf and His M√∂rike Songs, p. 119. The image of Cupid as a bee is part of a complex tradition of poetic imagery involving the flower of youth, the sting of love as a deflowering, and honey as a secretion of love.Youens, Hugo Wolf and His M√∂rike Songs, pp. 117‚Äì120. Cupids playing with a lyre, Roman fresco from Herculaneum =Cupid and dolphins= In both ancient and later art, Cupid is often shown riding a dolphin. On ancient Roman sarcophagi, the image may represent the soul's journey, originally associated with Dionysian religion.Janet Huskinson, Roman Children's Sarcophagi: Their Decoration and Its Social Significance (Oxford University Press, 1996), passim; Joan P. Alcock, \\"Pisces in Britannia: The Eating and Portrayal of Fish in Roman Britain,\\" in Fish: Food from the Waters. Proceedings of the Oxford Symposium on Food and Cookery 1997 (Prospect Books, 1998), p. 25. A mosaic from late Roman Britain shows a procession emerging from the mouth of the sea god Neptune, first dolphins and then sea birds, ascending to Cupid. One interpretation of this allegory is that Neptune represents the soul's origin in the matter from which life was fashioned, with Cupid triumphing as the soul's desired destiny.Dominic Perring, \\"'Gnosticism' in Fourth-Century Britain: The Frampton Mosaics Reconsidered,\\" Britannia 34 (2003), p. 108. In other contexts, Cupid with a dolphin recurs as a playful motif, as in garden statuary at Pompeii that shows a dolphin rescuing Cupid from an octopus, or Cupid holding a dolphin. The dolphin, often elaborated fantastically, might be constructed as a spout for a fountain.Anthony King, \\"Mammals: Evidence from Wall Paintings, Sculpture, Mosaics, Faunal Remains, and Ancient Literary Sources,\\" in The Natural History of Pompeii (Cambridge University Press, 2002), pp. 419‚Äì420. On a modern-era fountain in the Palazzo Vecchio, Florence, Italy, Cupid seems to be strangling a dolphin.\\"Archaeological News,\\" American Journal of Archaeology 11.2 (1896), p. 304. Dolphins were often portrayed in antiquity as friendly to humans, and the dolphin itself could represent affection. Pliny records a tale of a dolphin at Puteoli carrying a boy on its back across a lake to go to school each day; when the boy died, the dolphin grieved itself to death.Pliny, Natural History 9.8.24; Alcock, \\"Pisces in Britannia,\\" p. 25. In erotic scenes from mythology, Cupid riding the dolphin may convey how swiftly love moves,Marietta Cambareri and Peter Fusco, catalogue description for a Venus and Cupid, Italian and Spanish Sculpture: Catalogue of the J. Paul Getty Museum Collection (Getty Publications, 2002), p. 62. or the Cupid astride a sea beast may be a reassuring presence for the wild ride of love.Thomas Puttfarken, Titian and Tragic Painting: Aristotle's Poetics And the Rise of the Modern Artist (Yale University Press, 2005), p. 174. A dolphin-riding Cupid may attend scenes depicting the wedding of Neptune and Amphitrite or the Triumph of Neptune, also known as a marine thiasos. =Demon of fornication= To adapt myths for Christian use, medieval mythographers interpreted them morally. In this view, Cupid might be seen as a \\"demon of fornication\\".Daemon fornicationis in Isidore of Seville, moechiae daemon in Theodulf of Orleans; Jane Chance, Medieval Mythography: From Roman North Africa to the School of Chartres, A.D. 433‚Äì1177 (University Press of Florida, 1994), p. 129ff., especially p. 138. The innovative Theodulf of Orleans, who wrote during the reign of Charlemagne, reinterpreted Cupid as a seductive but malicious figure who exploits desire to draw people into an allegorical underworld of vice.Theodulf of Orleans, De libris, carmen 45; Chance, Medieval Mythography, p. 133. To Theodulf, Cupid's quiver symbolized his depraved mind, his bow trickery, his arrows poison, and his torch burning passion. It was appropriate to portray him naked, so as not to conceal his deception and evil.Theodulf, De libris 37‚Äì38; Chance, Medieval Mythography, pp. 137, 156, 585. Similar views are expressed by the Second Vatican Mythographer (II 46/35) and Remigius of Auxerre, Commentary on Martianus Capella 8.22. =Sleeping Cupid= Bronze Cupid Sleeping on a lion skin (1635‚Äì40), signed F, based on the marble attributed to Praxiteles Cupid sleeping became a symbol of absent or languishing love in Renaissance poetry and art, including a Sleeping Cupid (1496) by Michelangelo that is now lost.\\"Cupid,\\" The Classical Tradition, p. 245; Stefania Macioe, \\"Caravaggio and the Role of Classical Models,\\" in The Rediscovery of Antiquity: The Role of the Artist (Collegium Hyperboreum, 2003), pp. 437‚Äì438. The ancient type was known at the time through descriptions in classical literature, and at least one extant example had been displayed in the sculpture garden of Lorenzo de' Medici since 1488.Rona Goffen, Renaissance Rivals: Michelangelo, Leonardo, Raphael, Titian (Yale University Press, 2002, 2004), p. 95. In the 1st century AD, Pliny had described two marble versions of a Cupid (Eros), one at Thespiae and a nude at Parium, where it was the stained object of erotic fascination.Pliny, Natural History 36.22, describes it as on a par with the Cnidian Venus both in its nobility and in the wrong it had endured, as a certain main from Rhodes had fallen in love with it and left a visible trace of his love (vestigium amoris); Goffen, Renaissance Rivals, p. 96. Michelangelo's work was important in establishing the reputation of the young artist, who was only twenty at the time. At the request of his patron, he increased its value by deliberately making it look \\"antique\\",Deborah Parker, Michelangelo and the Art of Letter Writing (Cambridge University Press, 2010), p. 11. thus creating \\"his most notorious fake\\".Goffen, Renaissance Rivals, p. 95. After the deception was acknowledged, the Cupid Sleeping was displayed as evidence of his virtuosity alongside an ancient marble, attributed to Praxiteles, of Cupid asleep on a lion skin.Estelle Lingo, Fran√ßois Duquesnoy and the Greek Ideal (Yale University Press, 2007), p. 61. In the poetry of Giambattista Marino (d. 1625), the image of Cupid or Amore sleeping represents the indolence of Love in the lap of Idleness. A madrigal by his literary rival Gaspare Murtola exhorted artists to paint the theme. A catalogue of works from antiquity collected by the Mattei family, patrons of Caravaggio, included sketches of sleeping cupids based on sculpture from the Temple of Venus Erycina in Rome. Caravaggio, whose works Murtola is known for describing, took up the challenge with his 1608 Sleeping Cupid, a disturbing depiction of an unhealthy, immobilized child with \\"jaundiced skin, flushed cheeks, bluish lips and ears, the emaciated chest and swollen belly, the wasted muscles and inflamed joints.\\" The model is thought to have suffered from juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.John L. Varriano, Caravaggio (Penn State Press, 2006), pp. 57, 130. Caravaggio's sleeping Cupid was reconceived in fresco by Giovanni da San Giovanni, and the subject recurred throughout Roman and Italian work of the period.Macioe, \\"Caravaggio and the Role of Classical Models,\\" p. 436‚Äì438. Caravaggio's Amor Vincit Omnia =Love Conquers All= Earlier in his career, Caravaggio had challenged contemporary sensibilities with his \\"sexually provocative and anti-intellectual\\" Victorious Love, also known as Love Conquers All (Amor Vincit Omnia), in which a brazenly naked Cupid tramples on emblems of culture and erudition representing music, architecture, warfare, and scholarship.Varriano, Caravaggio, pp. 22, 123. The motto comes from the Augustan poet Vergil, writing in the late 1st century BC. His collection of Eclogues concludes with what might be his most famous line:David R. Slavitt, Eclogues and Georgics of Virgil (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1971, 1990), p. xvii. > Omnia vincit Amor: et nos cedamus Amori. > Love conquers all, and so let us surrender ourselves to Love.Vergil, > Eclogues 10.69. The theme was also expressed as the triumph of Cupid, as in the Triumphs of Petrarch.Aldo S. Bernardo, Petrarch, Laura, and the Triumphs (State University of New York, 1974), p. 102ff.; Varriano, Caravaggio, p. 123. Roman Cupid chariot of the war god, from the reign of Trajan (98‚Äì117 AD) The ancient Roman Cupid was a god who embodied desire, but he had no temples or religious practices independent of other Roman deities such as Venus, whom he often accompanies as a side figure in cult statues. A Cupid might appear among the several statuettes for private devotion in a household shrine,Annemarie Kaufmann-Heinimann, \\"Religion in the House,\\" in A Companion to Roman Religion (Blackwell, 2007), p. 199. but there is no clear distinction between figures for veneration and those displayed as art or decoration.John R. Clarke, Art in the Lives of Ordinary Romans: Visual Representation and Non-Elite Viewers in Italy, 100 B.C.-A.D. 315 (University of California Press, 2003), p. 89. Roman temples often served a secondary purpose as art museums, and Cicero mentions a statue of \\"Cupid\\" (Eros) by Praxiteles that was consecrated at a sacrarium and received religious veneration jointly with Hercules.Cicero, Against Verres 4.2‚Äì4; David L. Balch, \\"From Endymion in Roman Domus to Jonah in Christian Catacombs: From Houses of the Living to Houses for the Dead. Iconography and Religion in Transition,\\" in Commemorating the Dead: Texts and Artifacts in Context. Studies of Roman (De Gruyter, 2008), p. 281; Anna Clark, Divine Qualities: Cult and Community in Republican Rome (Oxford University Press, 2007), p. 177. An inscription from C√°rtama in Roman Spain records statues of Mars and Cupid among the public works of a wealthy female priest (sacerdos perpetua), and another list of benefactions by a procurator of Baetica includes statues of Venus and Cupid.Leonard A. Curchin, \\"Personal Wealth in Roman Spain,\\" Historia 32.2 (1983), p. 230. Cupid became more common in Roman art from the time of Augustus, the first Roman emperor. After the Battle of Actium, when Antony and Cleopatra were defeated, Cupid transferring the weapons of Mars to his mother Venus became a motif of Augustan imagery.Charles Brian Rose, \\"The Parthians in Augustan Rome,\\" American Journal of Archaeology 109.1 (2005), pp. 27‚Äì28 In the Aeneid, the national epic of Rome by the poet Vergil, Cupid disguises himself as Iulus, the son of Aeneas who was in turn the son of Venus herself, and in this form he beguiles Queen Dido of Carthage to fall in love with the hero. She gives safe harbor to Aeneas and his band of refugees from Troy, only to be abandoned by him as he fulfills his destiny to found Rome. Iulus (also known as Ascanius) becomes the mythical founder of the Julian family from which Julius Caesar came. Augustus, Caesar's heir, commemorated a beloved great-grandson who died as a child by having him portrayed as Cupid, dedicating one such statue at the Temple of Venus on the Capitoline Hill, and keeping one in his bedroom where he kissed it at night.Suetonius, Caligula 7; Robert Turcan, The Gods of Ancient Rome (Routledge, 2001; originally published in French 1998), p. 18. A brother of this child became the emperor Claudius, whose mother Antonia appears in a surviving portrait-sculpture as Venus, with Cupid on her shoulder.Susann S. Lusnia, \\"Urban Planning and Sculptural Display in Severan Rome: Reconstructing the Septizodium and Its Role in Dynastic Politics,\\" American Journal of Archaeology 108.4 (2004), p. 530. The Augustus of Prima Porta is accompanied by a Cupid riding a dolphin.J. C. McKeow, A Cabinet of Roman Curiosities (Oxford University Press, 2010), p. 210. Cupids in multiples appeared on the friezes of the Temple of Venus Genetrix (Venus as \\"Begetting Mother\\"), and influenced scenes of relief sculpture on other works such as sarcophagi, particularly those of children.Janet Huskinson, Roman Children's Sarcophagi: Their Decoration and Its Social Significance (Oxford University Press, 1996), p. 41ff. Tiepolo As a winged figure, Cupido shared some characteristics with the goddess Victoria.Clark, Divine Qualities, p. 199; Huskinson, Roman Children's Sarcophagi, passim. On coinage issued by Sulla the dictator, Cupid bears the palm branch, the most common attribute of Victory.J. Rufus Fears, \\"The Theology of Victory at Rome: Approaches and Problem,\\" Aufstieg und Niedergang der r√∂mischen Welt II.17.2 (1981), p. 791, and in the same volume, \\"The Cult of Virtues and Roman Imperial Ideology,\\" p. 881. \\"Desire\\" in Roman cultureIn antiquity, proper nouns and common nouns were not distinguished by capitalization, and there was no sharp line between an abstraction such as cupido and its divine personification Cupido; J. Rufus Fears, \\"The Cult of Virtues and Roman Imperial Ideology,\\" Aufstieg und Niedergang der r√∂mischen Welt II.17.2 (1981), p. 849, note 69. was often attached to power as well as to erotic attraction. Roman historians criticize cupido gloriae, \\"desire for glory,\\" and cupido imperii, \\"desire for ruling power\\".William V. Harris, War and Imperialism in Republican Rome: 327-70 B.C. (Oxford University Press, 1979, 1985), pp. 17‚Äì18; Sviatoslav Dmitrie, The Greek Slogan of Freedom and Early Roman Politics in Greece (Oxford University Press, 2011), p. 372; Philip Hardie, Rumour and Renown: Representations of Fama in Western Literature (Cambridge University Press, 2012), pp. 33, 172, 234, 275, 333ff. In Latin philosophical discourse, cupido is the equivalent of Greek pothos, a focus of reflections on the meaning and burden of desire. In depicting the \\"pious love\\" (amor pius) of Nisus and Euryalus in the Aeneid, Vergil has Nisus wonder: > Is it the gods who put passion in men's mind, Euryalus, or does each > person's fierce desire (cupido) become his own God?As quoted by David > Armstrong, Vergil, Philodemus, and the Augustans (University of Texas Press, > 2004), p. 181; Aeneid 9.184‚Äì184: dine hunc ardorem mentibus addunt, / > Euryale, an sua cuique deus fit dira cupido? In Lucretius' physics of sex, cupido can represent human lust and an animal instinct to mate, but also the impulse of atoms to bond and form matter.Diskin Clay, \\"De Rerum Natura: Greek Physis and Epicurean Physiologia (Lucretius 1.1‚Äì148),\\" Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association 100 (1969), p. 37. An association of sex and violence is found in the erotic fascination for gladiators, who often had sexualized names such as Cupido.H.S. Versnel, \\"A Parody on Hymns in Martial V.24 and Some Trinitarian Problems,\\" Mnemosyne 27.4 (1974), p. 368. Cupid was the enemy of chastity, and the poet Ovid opposes him to Diana, the virgin goddess of the hunt who likewise carries a bow but who hates Cupid's passion-provoking arrows.Tela Cupidinis odit: Ovid, Ars Amatoria 1.261; C.M.C. Green, \\"Terms of Venery: Ars Amatoria I,\\" Transactions of the American Philological Association 126 (1996), pp. 242, 245. Cupid is also at odds with Apollo, the archer-brother of Diana and patron of poetic inspiration whose love affairs almost always end disastrously. Ovid blames Cupid for causing him to write love poetry instead of the more respectable epic.Rebecca Armstrong, \\"Retiring Apollo: Ovid on the Politics and Poetics of Self-Sufficiency,\\" Classical Quarterly 54.2 (2004) 528‚Äì550. Cupid and Psyche Psych√© et l'amour (1626‚Äì29) by Simon Vouet: Psyche lifts a lamp to view the sleeping Cupid. The story of Cupid and Psyche appears in Greek art as early as the 4th century BC, but the most extended literary source of the tale is the Latin novel Metamorphoses, also known as The Golden Ass, by Apuleius (2nd century AD). It concerns the overcoming of obstacles to the love between Psyche (\\"Soul\\" or \\"Breath of Life\\") and Cupid, and their ultimate union in marriage. The fame of Psyche's beauty threatens to eclipse that of Venus herself, and the love goddess sends Cupid to work her revenge. Cupid, however, becomes enamored of Psyche, and arranges for her to be taken to his palace. He visits her by night, warning her not to try to look upon him. Psyche's envious sisters convince her that her lover must be a hideous monster, and she finally introduces a lamp into their chamber to see him. Startled by his beauty, she drips hot oil from the lamp and wakes him. He abandons her. She wanders the earth looking for him, and finally submits to the service of Venus, who tortures her. The goddess then sends Psyche on a series of quests. Each time she despairs, and each time she is given divine aid. On her final task, she is to retrieve a dose of Proserpina's beauty from the underworld. She succeeds, but on the way back can't resist opening the box in the hope of benefitting from it herself, whereupon she falls into a torpid sleep. Cupid finds her in this state, and revives her by returning the sleep to the box. Cupid grants her immortality so the couple can be wed as equals. The story's Neoplatonic elements and allusions to mystery religions accommodate multiple interpretations,Stephen Harrison, entry on \\"Cupid,\\" The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome (Oxford University Press, 2010), p. 338. and it has been analyzed as an allegory and in light of folktale, M√§rchen or fairy tale, and myth.Hendrik Wagenvoort, \\"Cupid and Psyche,\\" reprinted in Pietas: Selected Studies in Roman Religion (Brill, 1980), pp. 84‚Äì92. Often presented as an allegory of love overcoming death, the story was a frequent source of imagery for Roman sarcophagi and other extant art of antiquity. Since the rediscovery of Apuleius's novel in the Renaissance, the reception of Cupid and Psyche in the classical tradition has been extensive. The story has been retold in poetry, drama, and opera, and depicted widely in painting, sculpture, and various media.Harrison, \\"Cupid and Psyche,\\" in Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome, p. 339. Modern inspirationsLa Belle et la B√™te= Better known as \\"The Beauty and the Beast\\", it was originally written by Gabrielle-Suzanne Barbot de Villeneuve and abridged and later published by French author Jeanne Marie Leprince de Beaumont in 1740. The story over the years has gained international acclaim and in 1991 inspired the Disney movie Beauty and the Beast. It has been said that Gabrielle was inspired by the tale Cupid and Psyche. The tale is about a beautiful yet lonely woman with a heart of gold that is held captive by a hideous beast who has invisible servants to aid her in anything she desires within the confines of the castle walls. She eventually falls in love with him despite his appearance and breaks the cursed placed on him to reveal a handsome prince. Depictions On gems and other surviving pieces, Cupid is usually shown amusing himself with adult play, sometimes driving a hoop, throwing darts, catching a butterfly, or flirting with a nymph. He is often depicted with his mother (in graphic arts, this is nearly always Venus), playing a horn. In other images, his mother is depicted scolding or even spanking him due to his mischievous nature. He is also shown wearing a helmet and carrying a buckler, perhaps in reference to Virgil's Omnia vincit amor or as political satire on wars for love, or love as war.

Murtaza was succeeded by his younger brother Zulfikar Ali Khan Bahadur. Early life Sayyid Murtaza Ali Khan Bahadur was born on 22 November 1923 at the Rafat Mahal, Khasbagh Palace in Rampur, the eldest son of Shia Nawabzada (Crown Prince) Raza Ali Khan Bahadur. At the time, Murtaza's grandfather Hamid Ali Khan Bahadur was the Nawab. Upon his grandfather's death in 1930, Murtaza's father became Nawab of Rampur and Murtaza became the heir apparent. He was educated at the Doon School in Dehradun, then at Wellington College in Britain and at St.Stephen's College in New Delhi. In 1943, Murtaza was commissioned into the British Indian Army and served as an aide-de-camp to the Commander-in-Chief, India, General (later Field-Marshal) Sir Claude Auchinleck. He was promoted to Captain in 1946 and in that year was made the Brigadier of the Rampur State Forces. Also that year, Murtaza was appointed an MBE. From 1946 until Independence, Murtaza served as the Minister of the Army for Rampur State and as the Minister for the Household, Education and Public Works until 1949 when Rampur State formally merged with the Dominion of India. Titular Nawab of Rampur Following the death of his father in 1966, Murtaza succeeded as titular Nawab of Rampur. From 1969 until 1971, he served as a member in the Uttar Pradesh legislative assembly, as well as an MP in the Lok Sabha. It is an interesting historical fact that Murtaza Ali contested an election from Rampur opposite his own mother Rafat Jamani Begum in 1972 and won. In 1971, the Indira Gandhi regime stripped Nawab Murtaza and his fellow former rulers of what little rights they had left, formally ending Nawab Murtaza's standing as a monarch. Personal life In 1943, Murtaza married Her Highness Nawab Aftab Dulhan Sakina uz-Zamani Begum Sahiba of Pirpur (11 September 1928 ‚Äì 3 August 1993) the daughter of a minor chieftain.

Of the 150 people who perished, eleven were members of the Hong Kong cricket team. Hong Kong's cricket team had played an Interport cricket match against Shanghai at the Shanghai Cricket Club on 3 October 1892 and were returning home on the SS Bokhara. Ship history Built by Caird & Company of Greenock, Scotland, and launched on 18 December 1872, the SS Bokhara had a two-cylinder compound inverted steam engine and was registered in London. The passenger liner travelled mainly to India and the Far East and in 1875 had its registry transferred to Greenock. On the ship's maiden voyage, in 1873, it was stranded on an uncharted rock off Hong Kong and after eventually refloating, it had to be docked at Kowloon for repairs. In 1884 the ship was used as a transport vessel for soldiers in the Mahdist War. Sinking The ship set off from Shanghai on 8 October, due to arrive at Hong Kong on the 11th and was then bound for Colombo and Bombay. On board were 173 people, as well as silk, tea and general cargo to the weight of 1500 tons. A unforecast typhoon struck on 9 October and after various early manoeuvres the ship lay a-hull in the hope of drifting down the centre of the Taiwan Strait until the storm - which the captain thought would cross the strait and land near Xiamen - had passed. Unluckily the storm was recurving and passing up the west coast of Taiwan. The expected drift in a generally south west direction was actually between south and south south west straight towards the Penghu Islands. The winds worsened on the 10th and as the ship rolled violently the ships boats were smashed and the deckhouse damaged. At ten o'clock on the night of the 10 October three huge waves boarded the ship, smashed the engine and boiler room skylights and, folding below, doused the boilers, filling the machinery spaces with steam. The engineers tried in vain get the boiler going again to raise steam, but at around eleven forty the watch on the bridge saw land only a few hundred yards away directly to leeward. The captain went below to warn the passengers and get them on deck, but it was too late. At about eleven forty-five the ship struck the reef twice, with the second strike causing the starboard side to be ripped wide open and within two minutes the Bokhara had sunk. Rescue The survivors, who lay injured on the beach, were found by local Chinese fishermen who brandished axes and knives. After salvaging bits and pieces from the wreckage, the fishermen then took the survivors to Peihou Island followed by Makung, where they were looked after by the locals. They were then picked up by the Douglas Steamer Thales, who transferred the survivors to which was heading to Hong Kong. Victims and survivors There is residual uncertainty about exactly how many people were aboard the ship. The best estimate is 173, but it could have been more since at least one child, whose body was identified is not amongst those normally listed as being aboard. Confusion was also caused by the total loss of the two year old Norwegian cargo steamer Normand, Car. Michelsen Co. (Captain Jonsson), which had been lost some time the previous day, the 9th, on Tortoise Rock, which is about 3.1 nautical miles south west of where the Bokhara went down. Of the 26 crew of the Normand all survived the immediate wreck, but all but two were swept away when the mizzen mast, to which everyone was clinging, collapsed. The two who survived, 2nd Engineer John NIstad and Ordinary Seaman Thomas Herness, were washed ashore on Fisher Island (Xiyu) about a mile apart after some seventeen hours in the water. Initially they were taken to be Bokhara survivors, adding to the uncertainties. Only two Hong Kong cricketers survived, Dr James Lowson and Lieutenant Markham. Lowson had to have a lung removed but continued to play cricket for Hong Kong until 1898. First-class cricketer Ernest Coxon and former Hampshire player Horatio Dumbleton both played in Hong Kong's interport match against Shanghai earlier that year but were, fortunately for them, unable to play in the October fixture. A further 21 people were saved from the water, including the Chief Officer, Third and Fourth Officers and two European Quartermasters. The other 16 survivors were the lascar crew, though one of them died of his injuries in Anping on Taiwan shortly after the Thales' arrival. Hong Kong and Shanghai's cricket teams pose for a photograph. The eleven Hong Kong cricketers to die were - * Lieutenant C.G. Boyle * Lieutenant Burnett * Captain Dawson * Sergeant Donegan * Captain John Dunn * Quartermaster-Sergeant Jeffkins * Sergeant Mumford * G.S. Purvis, Esq. * G.E. Taverner, Esq. * Major Turner * C. Wallace, Esq. Famous Colorado artist Helen Henderson Chain and her husband also died on this voyage. Aftermath A Marine Board of Inquiry was launched but after only two days of testimony found that accident was not caused by the wrongful act or default of any Certified Officer and commended the crew on their efforts to avoid the tragedy. With the Hong Kong cricket community in mourning, the Interport series did not resume until 1897. Sand Island in the Pescadores, where the ship sank, was until recently within a Taiwanese military firing range. However it is now open to tourists and accessible at high tide, and the monument to the Bokhara has been restored..

The film was conceived as an educational film about AIDS, but raised controversy and was withdrawn. The film claims that HIV was developed in American military laboratories, and that its well-established African origin is a cover-up conspiracy by the Americans. Today the film is regarded as a significant step in the development of the style seen in the director's later and more acclaimed films. Production In 1986, the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare contracted Roy Andersson to write and direct an information film about AIDS to be shown in Swedish schools and to military conscripts. At the time, Andersson had not made a film since the financially unsuccessful Giliap from 1975, and had since then mainly worked with television commercials. Before the film was finished, however, the Board asked Andersson to abandon the project. The board had seen the finished parts and questioned Andersson's sources, and were also sceptical about the overall approach and tone of the film. Andersson continued to work on the project on his own and eventually finished it. The film introduces what would become the director's signature style, with static camera and long takes featuring hand-picked amateur actors in grim make-up. The style had been hinted at in Giliap and was developed further in Andersson's commercials, later to be even more refined in the feature films Songs from the Second Floor and You, the Living. HIV origin theory In the film, Andersson strongly criticises the widespread theory of HIV's origin in Africa. Included are scenes featuring scientists promoting this theory in ways which make them appear as incompetent and racist, and the theory highly unlikely. Andersson instead suggests that the virus had its origin in American military laboratories, and that the African origin is a part of a conspiracy by the Americans. The theory the film supports was later revealed to be an invention by the East German security service Stasi, with the intention to discredit the western world. Release Following the positive reception of Andersson's 1991 short film World of Glory, Something Happened was in 1993 screened at a number of international film festivals, where it received several awards.

After the Mark Chapman single on their own Moral Burro label, they returned to Probe Plus with their debut album, Skullfuck (the title influenced by a Grateful Dead album cover), released in late 1987. Skullfuck was later cited by Nirvana's Kurt Cobain as an influence. The band worked with Kramer on the second album, Upwind of Disaster, Downwind of Atonement, released on Glass Records in 1989. Sutton departed to join The La's and was replaced by Andy Rowan for the Shaved Beatnik EP.

The Sensory Deprivation Chamber Quartet Dwarf mini-album followed in 1989, and was their last release for Glass. After a split single with Bevis Frond, they moved on to Paperhouse Records for their next album, Bad Orb, Whirling Ball (1990).

In 1984, the Department of Health transferred management control to the newly created charity, The Children's Trust. Tadworth Court was the manor house of the manor of Tadworth which lay within the parish of Banstead, by Banstead Downs, a horse-racing racecourse in the 17th century. Banstead was well known as an airing place at this period, where Londoners sought fresh air, being 600 feet above sea level. The attractions of Epsom Spa to the west prompted the first settlements other than isolated farmhouses on this part of the widest section of the North Downs stretching from Banstead village to Walton-on-the- Hill to the south. Tadworth Court on the south of the site is a listed building for architecture in the highest category as a country house of circa 1700, with \\"rustic quoins, stone dressings (renderings)..steep (and richly decorated) pediment....high panelling and rococo plasterwork...Boxed room with early C10 panelling,\\". Nikolaus Pevsner described it as a ‚Äôsplendid house‚Äô and ‚Äôone of the most elegant in the whole country‚Äô. He was amazed that such a house so close to London was virtually unknown -- no pictures of the house are known before the 20th century. The owners of the house: The first owner, Leonard Wessel, a merchant purchased the estate in 1694. He was Sheriff of the County in 1700 and a Member of Parliament in 1701. Whilst of a Dutch family, his great grandfather was born in England in 1557. Recent work to the house revealed that it does not incorporate an earlier building, but in common with all buildings of this period contains some reused beams due to the growing shortage of timber. 1694 is the likely construction date of the house and by 1698 the Banstead Court Rolls record that Wessel applied for leave ‚Äôto plant rows of trees on the Heath, fronting his dwelling house and leading towards the Warren.‚Äô One of these, a large Poplar survived until the 19th century. Wessel died in 1708. The house appears on contemporary maps and Celia Fiennes in 1712 describes it as one of ‚Äôseveral good houses in or about Epsham‚Äô, though by then in the possession of Sir Thomas Scawen, Alderman of London, his brother-in-law.

The King of Thailand is the head of state and head of the ruling Royal House of Chakri. Although the current Chakri Dynasty was created in 1782, the existence of the institution of monarchy in Thailand is traditionally considered to have its roots from the founding of the Sukhothai Kingdom in 1238, with a brief interregnum from the death of Ekkathat to the accession of Taksin in the 18th century. The institution was transformed into a constitutional monarchy in 1932 after the bloodless Siamese Revolution of 1932. The monarchy's official ceremonial residence is the Grand Palace in Bangkok, while the private residence has been at the Dusit Palace. The king currently resides in quarantine at the Grand Hotel Sonnenbichl in Germany. The King of Thailand's titles include Head of State, Head of the Royal Thai Armed Forces, Adherent of Buddhism and Upholder of religions. HistoryOrigin= The current concept of Thai kingship evolved through 800 years of absolute rule. The first king of a unified Thailand was the founder of the Kingdom of Sukhothai, King Sri Indraditya, in 1238. The idea of this early kingship is said to be based on two concepts derived from Hinduism and Theravada Buddhist beliefs. The first concept is based on the Vedic-Hindu caste of \\"Kshatriya\\" (, or warrior-ruler, in which the king derives his powers from military might. The second is based on the Theravada Buddhist concept of \\"Dhammaraja\\" (, Buddhism having been introduced to Thailand around the 6th century CE. The idea of the Dhammaraja (or kingship under Dharma), is that the king should rule his people in accordance with Dharma and the teachings of the Buddha. These ideas were briefly replaced in 1279, when King Ramkhamhaeng came to the throne. Ramkhamhaeng departed from tradition and created instead a concept of \\"paternal rule\\" (, in which the king governs his people as a father would govern his children. This idea is reinforced in the title and name of the king, as he is still known today, Pho Khun Ramkhamhaeng ( meaning 'Father Ruler Ramkhamhaeng'. This lasted briefly. By the end of the kingdom, the two old concepts returned as symbolized by the change in the style of the kings: \\"Pho\\" was changed to \\"Phaya\\" or Lord. =Kings of Ayutthaya= King Naresuan of Ayutthaya fought several wars against the Burmese to preserve Siamese independence. The Kingdom of Sukhothai was supplanted by the Kingdom of Ayutthaya, which was founded in 1351 by King Ramathibodhi I. During the Ayutthayan period, the idea of kingship changed. Due to ancient Khmer tradition in the region, the Hindu concept of kingship was applied to the status of the leader. Brahmins took charge in the royal coronation. The king was treated as a reincarnation of Hindu gods. Ayutthaya historical documents show the official titles of the kings in great variation: Indra, Shiva and Vishnu, or Rama. Seemingly, Rama was the most popular, as in \\"Ramathibodhi\\". However, Buddhist influence was also evident, as many times the king's title and \\"unofficial\\" name \\"Dhammaraja\\", an abbreviation of the Buddhist Dharmaraja. The two former concepts were re-established, with a third, older concept taking hold. This concept was called \\"Devaraja\\" ( (or \\"divine king\\"), which was an idea borrowed by the Khmer Empire from the Hindu- Buddhist kingdoms of Java, especially the idea of a scholar class based on Hindu Brahmins. The concept centered on the idea that the king was an incarnation (avatar) of the god Vishnu and that he was a Bodhisattva (enlightened one), therefore basing his power on his religious power, his moral power, and his purity of blood. The king, portrayed by state interests as a semi-divine figure, then became‚Äîthrough a rigid cultural implementation‚Äîan object of worship and veneration to his people. From then on the monarchy was largely removed from the people and continued under a system of absolute rule. Living in palaces designed after Mount Meru (\\"home of the gods\\" in Hinduism), the kings turned themselves into a \\"Chakravartin\\", where the king became an absolute and universal lord of his realm. Kings demanded that the universe be envisioned as revolving around them, and expressed their powers through elaborate rituals and ceremonies. For four centuries these kings ruled Ayutthaya, presiding over some of the greatest period of cultural, economic, and military growth in Thai History.  Sakdina and Rachasap  Wat Phra Si Sanphet next to the king's palace was the most sacred temple in the kingdom of Ayutthaya. The Kings of Ayutthaya created many institutions to support their rule. Whereas feudalism developed in the European Middle Ages, Ayutthayan King Trailokanat instituted sakdina, a system of social hierarchy which ranked the king's subjects according to the amount of land they were entitled to, according to their rank and position. Rachasap is required by court etiquette as an honorific register consisting of a special vocabulary used exclusively for addressing the king, or for talking about royalty.  Royal authority  The king was chief administrator, chief legislator, and chief judge, with all laws, orders, verdict and punishments theoretically originating from his person. The king's sovereignty was reflected in the titles \\"Lord of the Land\\" ( Phra Chao Phaen Din) and \\"Lord of Life\\" ( Chao Chiwit). The king's powers and titles were seen by foreign observers as proof that the king was an absolute monarch in the European sense. However, in Siamese tradition the duty and responsibility of the king was seen as developed from the ancient Indian theories of royal authority, which resemble Enlightened Absolutism, although the emphasis is not on rationality but on Dhamma. This was disrupted in 1767, when Thai digests of the dhammasƒÅt () were lost when a Burmese army under the Alaungpaya Dynasty invaded, sacked and burned the city of Ayutthaya. =Kingdom restored= An interlude filled by civil war was ended when King Taksin restored the dominion under what has been called the Thonburi Kingdom. =Chakri kings= Thongduang, later King Rama I of Siam, founded the Chakri dynasty in 1782. In 1782, King Buddha Yodfa Chulaloke ascended the throne and moved the capital from the Thonburi side to the Bangkok side of the Chao Phraya River. There he established the House of Chakri, the current ruling dynasty of Thailand. (This first reign was later designated as that of Rama I in the list of Rama Kings of Thailand.) He also established the office of Supreme Patriarch as the head of the Sangha, the order of Buddhist monks. During the Rattanakosin Period the Chakri kings tried to continue the concepts of Ayutthayan kingship once again emphasizing the connection between the sovereign and his subjects. On the other hand, they continued to not relinquish any authority of the throne. Kings Buddha Loetla Nabhalai (Rama II) and Nangklao (Rama III) created a semblance of a modern administration by creating a supreme council and appointing chief officers to help with the running of the government. Mongkut (Rama IV) marked a significant break in tradition when he spent the first 27 years of his adult life as a Buddhist monk during which time he became proficient in the English language, before ascending the throne. As king, he continued the appointment of officers to his supreme council, the most notable being Somdet Chao Phraya Prayurawongse and Si Suriyawongse, both of whom acted as Chief Ministers for King Mongkut (and the latter as regent, from the king's death in 1868 until 1873.) Chulalongkorn (Rama V) ascended the throne as a minor at age 15 in 1868, and as King of Siam on 16 November 1873. As a prince, he had been tutored in Western traditions by the governess, Anna Leonowens. Intent on reforming the monarchy along Western lines, during his minority he traveled extensively to observe western administrative methods. He transformed the monarchy along Western lines of an \\"enlightened ruler\\". He abolished the practice of prostration in front of the monarch, and repealed many laws concerning the relationship between the monarch and his people, while continuing many of the ancient aspects and rituals of the old kingship. In 1874, he created a privy council copied from the European tradition, to help him rule his Kingdom. During his reign Siam was pressured to relinquish control of its old tributaries of Laos and northern Malaya to Western powers, Siam itself narrowly avoided being colonized. In 1905, 37 years after his coronation, Chulalongkorn ended slavery with the Slave Abolition Act. In 1867 slaves accounted for one-third of the Siamese population. His son, Vajiravudh (Rama VI), ascended to the throne in 1910 and continued his father's zeal for reform to bring the monarchy into the 20th century. The perceived slow pace of reform resulted in the Palace Revolt of 1912. In 1914, Vajiravudh determined that the act providing for invoking martial law, first promulgated by his father in 1907, was not consistent with modern laws of war, nor convenient for the preservation of the security of the state, so it was amended to a more modern form that, with minor amendments, continued in force through subsequent changes in government. Prajadhipok (Rama VII) succeeded his brother in 1925. The Eton and Sandhurst educated monarch created a council similar to a cabinet, where the most important government officials could meet to decide state affairs. This advisory and legislative council, styled the Supreme Council of State of Siam (Thai: ‡∏≠‡∏†‡∏¥‡∏£‡∏±‡∏ê‡∏°‡∏ô‡∏ï‡∏£‡∏µ‡∏™‡∏†‡∏≤) was founded on 28 November 1925 and existed until 1932. =Constitutional monarchy= King Prajadhipok signing the Constitution of Siam, 10 December 1932. In June 1932, a group of foreign-educated students and military men called \\"the promoters\\" carried out a bloodless revolution, seized power and demanded that King Prajadhipok grant the people of Siam a constitution. The king agreed and in December 1932 the people were granted a constitution, ending 150 years of absolute Chakri rule. From then on the role of the monarch was relegated to that of a symbolic head of state. His powers from then on were exercised by a prime minister and the national assembly. In 1935 King Pradhipok (Rama VII) abdicated the throne, following disagreements with the government. He lived in exile in the United Kingdom until his death in 1941. The king was replaced by his young nephew Ananda Mahidol (Rama VIII). The new king was 10 years old and was living abroad in Switzerland. A council of regents was appointed in his place. During this period the roles and powers of the king were entirely usurped by the fascist government of Plaek Phibunsongkhram, who changed the name of the kingdom from Siam to Thailand, and aligned it on the side of the Axis powers in the Pacific theatre of World War II. By the end of the war Phibunsongkhram was removed and the young king returned. The Free Thai movement provided resistance to foreign occupation during the war and helped rehabilitate Thailand after the war. After Rama VIII's sudden death from a bullet wound in 1946, Prince Bhumibol Adulyadej (Rama IX), aged 19 years old, became the new monarch. In establishing his rule, the king was aided by the efforts of the US government, who used the monarchy as a bulwark against communist gains in Southeast Asia. King Bhumibol was the world's longest reigning monarch at the time of his death in October 2016. He died on 13 October 2016 at the age of 88. = The monarchy in the 21st century = The king's image appears in every town and in many prominent locations Since c. 2000, the role of the Thai monarchy has been increasingly challenged by scholars, media, observers and traditionalists, and as more educated pro-democracy interests began to express their speech. Many deemed that a series of laws and measures relating to l√®se majest√© in Thailand are hindrances to freedom of expression. Dozens of arrests, hundreds of criminal investigations and multiple imprisonments have been made based on these laws. King Bhumibol Adulyadej's speech in his 2005 national birthday broadcast could be interpreted that he welcomed criticism. The l√®se-majest√© law is part of Thailand's Criminal Code and has been described as \\"world's harshest l√®se majest√© law\\" and \\"possibly the strictest criminal-defamation law anywhere\\". Political scientist Giles Ungpakorn noted that \\"the l√®se-majest√© laws are not really designed to protect the institution of the monarchy. In the past, the laws have been used to protect governments and to shield military coups from lawful criticism. This whole [royal] image is created to bolster a conservative elite well beyond the walls of the palace.\\" Thai activist and magazine editor Somyot Prueksakasemsuk, who was sentenced to eleven years' imprisonment for l√®se-majest√© in 2013, is a designated prisoner of conscience by Amnesty International. The king is assisted in his work and duties by the Private Secretary to the King of Thailand and the Privy Council of Thailand, in consultation with the head of the cabinet, the Prime Minister. In accordance with the constitution the king is no longer the originator of all laws in the kingdom; that prerogative is entrusted to the National Assembly of Thailand. All bills passed by the legislature, however, require his royal assent to become law. The monarchy's household and finances are managed by the Bureau of the Royal Household and the Crown Property Bureau respectively, these agencies are not considered part of the Thai government and all personnel are appointed by the king. The junta which took power in 2014 has been aggressive in jailing critics of the monarchy.2014 coup marks the highest number of l√®se-majest√© prisoners in Thai history. Prachatai.\\"Thailand jails man for 35 years for insulting the monarchy on Facebook\\". The Independent. 10 June 2017.

This genus is a binucleate flagellate, which is able to live in the anaerobic conditions of animal intestinal tracts. A characteristic of Spironucleus that is common to all metamonads is that it does not have aerobic mitochondria, but instead rely on hydrogenosomes to produce energy. Spironucleus has six anterior and two posterior flagella. The life cycle of Spironucleus involves one active trophozoite stage and one inactive cyst stage. Spironucleus undergoes asexual reproduction via longitudinal binary fission. Spironucleus vortens can cause lateral line erosion in freshwater anglefish . Spironucleus columbae is found to cause hexamitiasis in pigeons . Finally, Spironucleus muris is found to cause illnesses of the digestive system in mice, rats, and hamsters . The genome of Spironucleus has been studied to exhibit the role of lateral gene transfer from prokaryotes in allowing for anaerobic metabolic processes in diplomonads .  Practical Importance  The different species of Spironucleus can be found in a variety of animal hosts, including fish, birds, and mice. One parasite in fish was previously known as Spironucleus barkhanus, but was then redescribed as Spironucleus salmonicida. This new classification was given to this organism so that Spironucleus salmonicida could be discernible from the fish commensals Spironucleus barkhanus as they were morphologically identical, but genetically different . Spironucleus vortens species is often found in freshwater angelfish, where it affects the gastrointestinal tract and may cause head and lateral line erosion . Pathogenesis of Spironucleus can be promoted by stressful environmental conditions, including poor water quality, malnutrition, overcrowding, and fluctuating temperatures. These pathogens can be found in wild fish, as well as farmed fish. However, farmed fish are more susceptible to the Spironucleus pathogen due to the poor conditions that sometimes accompany aquaculture. A species found in birds is Spironucleus columbae. A study in the Handbook of Avian Medicine states that this species of Spironucleus causes hexamitiasis in pigeons. Young pigeons can become infected with Spironucleus columbae by consuming droppings, food, or water that contain the protozoan. The colonization and division of this species in the intestinal tract can cause small ulcerative lesions and other accompanying physical digestive illnesses. Some accompanying illnesses due to the lesions may include vomiting, dehydration, diarrhoea, and weight loss. These symptoms may also be worsened by bacterial infections within the lesions. In serious conditions, Spironucleus columbae may ultimately cause death . A species found in mice is Spironucleus muris. It can be found in normal adult mice, where it would not cause severe symptoms. This species is more pathogenic in young, stressed, or immunocompromised mice . In addition to mice, Spironucleus muris can also cause digestive illnesses to rats and hamsters as well. One illness that this species can cause on mice, rats, and hamsters includes the inflammation of the small bowel . Greaves (2012) states that this species can be seen in crypts and intervillous spaces of the gut and lists ‚Äúblunting of intestinal villi, epithelial degeneration and mucin depletion, reactive epithelial hyperplasia, edema, and leukocyte infiltration‚Äù as associated symptoms. Additionally, Whary et al. (2015) lists some physical symptoms of an infected mouse include poor hair coat, sluggish behaviour, and weight loss. Like other Spironucleus species, transmission occurs through the faecal or oral route to infect the intestinal tract and potentially cause lethal illnesses.  Genetics  The genome of Spironucleus has been studied to demonstrate the exchange of genetic material between lineages of various protists . A study by Andersson et al. (2007) discovered 84 genes in S. salmonicida that were involved in lateral gene transfer based on their unexpected positions in the phylogenetic tree. The sequences found were similar to other eukaryotes related to diplomonads, as well as prokaryotes. Many of the genes found from lateral gene transfer from prokaryotes were responsible for the anaerobic metabolic processes that allowed diplomonads to become anaerobes. A comparative study of the genomes of S. salmonicida with its close relative, Giardia lamblia, lends insight into the role that lateral gene transfer has on the large diversity of protist genomes . Additionally, another study by Xu et al. (2014) compared the genomes of S. salmonicida and Giardia intestinalis to find that S. salmonicida possesses more extensive metabolic stores and more elaborate gene regulation that allows for the parasite to better manage unstable environmental conditions. The comparison between the genomes of both protists contribute in the understanding of the biology of parasitic protists and the evolution of eukaryotic genomes .

He is best remembered for the humanitarian manner in which he, as Commandant, ran the Zonderwater Italian POW camp. Early life Hendrik Frederik Prinsloo was the son of Commandant Hendrik Frederik Prinsloo (1861‚Äì1900), who commanded the Carolina Boer Commando at the Battle of Spion Kop and was killed in action at Witkloof, and his wife, Cecilia Maria Steyn. In 1926, Boer and Briton erected a monument to commemorate his gallantry at Witkloof. He was also a direct descendant of Hendrik Frederik Prinsloo (1784‚Äì1816), who was involved in the Slagter's Nek rebellion in 1815. As a boy of twelve he was taken prisoner-of- war by the British while carrying arms in his father's Commando (the Carolinaers) during the Second Boer War. Because of his tender age, he was lodged in the Barberton concentration camp with his mother. After the war he became a magistrate's court interpreter in Natal Province and eventually farmed in the Carolina district. Military career During the Boer Revolt of 1914 Prinsloo sided with the South African government forces. On 12 January 1915 he was appointed \\"honorary lieutenant, supernumerary list (Active Citizen Force)\\". During his subsequent service in German South-West Africa he became aide-de-camp to Colonel Commandant WR Collins from January to August 1915. On 26 November 1915 he joined the 1st Regiment, Military Constabulary. Although no specific reference to his service in France can be found, it would appear that he served with the South African Brigade which formed part of the 9th (Scottish) Division.The Long, Long Trail ‚Äì The British Army of 1914‚Äì1918‚Äìfor family historians In his address to a 1947 reunion of Middlesex Regiment officers, he mentioned that members of the regiment had served under his command. The 3/10th Battalion (The Middlesex Regiment) landed at Le Havre on 1 June 1917 and was attached to South African Brigade.The Long, Long Trail ‚Äì The British Army of 1914‚Äì1918‚Äìfor family historians He was awarded the French Croix de Guerre. On 31 December 1919 he resigned from the army and assumed an appointment with the Permanent Police Force as headquarters sub-inspector. Later he settled in Windhoek where he became commander of the Windhoek Town and District Police. In 1922, as a lieutenant in the Military Constabulary in South West Africa he took a leading part in ending the Bondelswart Rebellion. He was the leader of the force which tracked down and killed the rebel leader Abraham Morris. This brought about the subsequent surrender of the Bondel insurgents. At the outbreak of World War II, he was Commanding Officer of the Regiment Botha. As he was about to depart for North Africa with his regiment, he was recalled at the instance of Field Marshal JC Smuts who was the Prime Minister and Minister of Defence and placed in command of the vast Italian prisoner of war camp at Zonderwater (also spelt Sonderwater) near Cullinan. In 1947 he represented South Africa at the Diplomatic Conference held in Geneva for the purpose of revising the International Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners-of-War, that is, the Geneva Convention of 1929. On 28 August 1947 he was transferred to the reserve of officers. Zonderwater POW camp Theatre, library, shop and welfare offices complex at Zonderwater POW camp On 12 November 1941 Prinsloo was posted to No 8 Prisoner of War Battalion, First Reserve Brigade. In December 1942 he assumed duty as assistant camp commandant of the prisoner-of-war camp, Zonderwater, and in the following year he was promoted acting colonel, an appointment he held until 1 April 1947, when he was released and taken on as supernumerary to the establishment. Zonderwater camp, which can more accurately be described as a city, was the largest of the eighteen known World War II Italian POW camps and held nearly a hundred thousand prisoners of war before it closed down on 1 January 1947.South African Air Force official website The appointment of Colonel Hendrik Prinsloo OBE as commanding officer was inspired. As a result of his efforts Zonderwater became one of the best functioning military camps in South Africa. There was an improvement in living conditions, which included the establishment of an orchestra and a 10 000 book library, craft exhibitions and art classes. Illiteracy dropped from 30% to 2%. In short, life at Zonderwater was as close to civilian life for the prisoners, all due to Colonel Prinsloo who cared for his charges. Recognition He was awarded the French Croix de Guerre and was Mentioned in Despatches for services in the First World War. He received the Efficiency Decoration on 11 April 1944 and was made an Officer of the Military Division of the Order of the British Empire on 14 June 1945. His efforts were recognised by the post-war Italian Government on 25 November 1949 when he, as the Camp Commandant, and three of his officers were invested with the Order of the Star of Italy. The award was made to those who had specially contributed to the re-building of post-war Italy. Prinsloo was further recognised by the award of the Order of Good Merit by the Pope.George Duncan‚Äôs Lesser Known Facts of World War II Civilian life Between World War I and World War II he was a farmer in the Ermelo in the Eastern Transvaal district.

History The annual Hogmanay celebration was originally an informal street party focused on the Tron Kirk in the High Street of the Old Town. Since 1993, it has been officially organised with the focus moved to Princes Street. In 1996, over 300,000 people attended, leading to ticketing of the main street party in later years up to a limit of 100,000 tickets. In 2003‚Äì2004, most of the organised events were cancelled at short notice due to very high winds. Similarly, the 2006‚Äì2007 celebrations in Edinburgh were cancelled on the day, again due to high winds and heavy rain. Hogmanay celebrations in Edinburgh The Annual Stoats Loony Dook held on 1 January Hogmanay is the Scots word for New Year's Eve. In Scotland, New Year's (Hogmanay) is celebrated with several different customs, such as First-Footing, which involves friends or family members going to each other's houses with a gift of whisky and sometimes a lump of coal. In Edinburgh, it now covers four days of processions, concerts and fireworks, with the street party beginning on Hogmanay. Alternative tickets are available for entrance into the Princes Street Gardens concert and C√©ilidh, where well-known artists perform and ticket holders can participate in traditional Scottish c√©ilidh dancing. On New Year's Day the celebrations continue with the Stoats Loony Dook parade. The Edinburgh Hogmanay celebrations are among the largest in the world. Celebrations in Edinburgh in 1996‚Äì97 were recognised by the Guinness Book of Records at the world's largest New Year party, with approximately 400,000 people in attendance. Numbers have since been restricted due to safety concerns. Fireworks displays New Year's fireworks in front of the One O'Clock Gun Edinburgh, the Scottish capital, hosts one of the world's most famous New Year celebrations. The celebration is focused on a major street party along Princes Street. The cannon is fired at Edinburgh Castle at the stroke of midnight, followed by a large fireworks display. Edinburgh hosts a festival of four or five days, beginning on 28 December, and lasting until New Year's Day or 2 January, which is also a bank holiday in Scotland. Other cities across Scotland, such as Aberdeen, Glasgow and Stirling have large organised celebrations too, including fireworks at midnight.

Ltd was a British motorcycle manufacturer that operated between 1902 and 1926. Significant innovations developed by the company included one of the first motorcycle suspension systems, with a leading link front fork and a subframe suspended on springs from the main frame. History Founded in 1902, the Bat Motor Manufacturing Co. Ltd was named after founder Samuel Robert Batson. Based in Penge, the first Bat motorcycle used a small de Dion engine but poor sales led to Batson selling the company to Theodore Tessier in 1904. Nicknamed 'Best After Tests,' two Bat motorcycles were entered in the 1907 Isle of Man TT races. The company produced the first sprung frame in 1906 and in 1908 developed one of the first sidecar outfits, with two powered wheels on a removable sidecar. Tessier was also an innovator and keen to develop motorcycling technology. Significant innovations included one of the first practical clutch mechanisms and he also patented one of the first motorcycle full suspension systems, with a leading link front fork and a subframe suspended on springs from the main frame. To raise awareness of the motorcycles, Tessier began serious competitive racing and achieved over 200 wins, setting numerous speed records. Bat also developed twin-cylinder motorcycles in 1912 and managed seventh place in the 1913 Senior TT. Production ended with the outbreak of the First World War but restarted in 1919. They took over Martinsyde Motorcycles in 1923 but financial difficulties led to the closure of the Bat-Martinsyde company in 1926. Car production Bat also produced a number of tricars, with a wicker passenger seat over the front axle. The single-cylinder engines were usually or . By 1904 a number of cars were produced using a 6 hp 2-cylinder Fafnir engine and a seat for the driver instead of the usual saddle, with a semi-enclosed wooden body for a passenger. In 1909 Bat introduced the Carcycle, which was similar to a motorcycle and sidecar but had four wheels and handlebar steering.

Career Born in Manchester, Clegg began his football career with Manchester United. Having already made 11 appearances and scored four goals for the club's Junior B team, he signed a trainee contract as a 16-year-old in June 1997. He became a regular in the Junior and Youth sides in 1997‚Äì98, and by 1998‚Äì99, he had progressed to the reserve team. In May 1999, he played in the first leg and was named as a substitute in the second leg of United's 3‚Äì1 aggregate win over Oldham Athletic in the final of the Manchester Senior Cup. In October 1999, Clegg was sent out on loan to United's feeder club, Royal Antwerp, in order to gain some first team experience. However, during the six months that he was out there, he made just two appearances, and he returned in April 2000. The following season, Clegg progressed to the fringes of the reserve team, making six appearances and scoring three goals before being loaned out again in March 2001, this time to Wycombe Wanderers. In two months at Wycombe, Clegg made 11 appearances (ten in the league), but was unable to get on the scoresheet. He returned to Manchester United in May 2001, but he was deemed surplus to requirements for the 2001‚Äì02 season and was allowed to join Bury on a free transfer. In his first season with Bury, Clegg scored four goals in 33 matches, as the club was relegated to the Third Division. He got a slightly better return in 2002‚Äì03, scoring six goals in 36 appearances, helping the Shakers to a play-off spot by finishing in seventh place in the league. However, they were beaten 3‚Äì1 on aggregate by Bournemouth in the semi-finals. Clegg's appearances became more sporadic in 2003‚Äì04, and he failed to get on the scoresheet in any of the eight matches in which he played. At the end of the 2003‚Äì04 season, Clegg was released from his contract with Bury, and went on trial with Linfield in Northern Ireland over the summer of 2004. However, he did not impress manager David Jeffrey, and was not offered a contract with the club. Fortunately for Clegg, he was picked up by Northwich Victoria in September 2004. In 2005, Clegg signed for Worcester City, founder members of the newly formed Conference North, and helped them to a seventh-place finish in his first season. Over the next three seasons, Worcester gradually slipped down the table, finishing in eighth, ninth and 12th in 2005‚Äì06, 2006‚Äì07 and 2007‚Äì08 respectively. For the 2008‚Äì09 season, the Conference North and Conference South were reorganised, and Worcester City were placed in the south section. Being based in Manchester, that made commuting to matches difficult for Clegg, and he was transferred to Hinckley United in July 2008.

Her work incorporates traditional books alongside images, texts for performance, films, and site specific work. Olsen describes her work as involving avant-garde modernist and contemporary poetics, feminist theory and writing practice, Language Writing, ecology and environmental literatures, and performance.https://pure.royalholloway.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/redell- olsen(c56f9b42-8ea2-4317-8f0e-23ec48cb577a).html Life and work ACADEMIC CAREER Olsen studied English literature at Cambridge University before subsequently completing an MA in Fine Art. She completed her PhD on 'Contemporary Poetics and Innovative Women's Writing' at Royal Holloway, University of London, in 2002, and went on to teach on the Performance Writing programme at Dartington University alongside Caroline Bergvall. She subsequently moved to a Lectureship at Royal Holloway, University of London,http://www.rhul.ac.uk/english/about-us/Staff/Olsen/About-us-Olsen.htm RHUL profile page where she is now Professor in Poetry and Poetics, teaching undergraduate English Students and postgraduate Creative Writing students. With Robert Gavin Hampson, she founded and ran the MA in Poetic Practice at Royal Holloway from 2003-13. Starting in 2014 this was absorbed into the MA Creative Writing programme as the Poetic Practice Pathway (alongside the existing Poetry and Fiction pathways).http://www.royalholloway.ac.uk/english/informationforprospective students/postgraduatetaught/macreativewriting/macreativewriting.aspx The courses on this pathway were taught for many years by Olsen, Hampson, and Will Montgomery; it is now taught mainly by Olsen. She is also currently the Director of the Poetics Research Centre at Royal Holloway. AWARDS Olsen was the Judith E. Wilson Fellow at the University of Cambridge from 2013-14. During this period she produced 'Whiteout Film for Snowgoggles' as part of the Polar Muse project at the Scott Polar Research institute in Cambridge. In 2018, her poetic film essay 'Now Circa (1918)' was shortlisted for the AHRC Research in Film Award. More recently, she was the winner of the 2020-21 DARE Art Prize. This was awarded by the University of Leeds and Opera North in association with the National Science and Media Museum and The Tetley, Leeds for the creation of a film and a song cycle, using and responding to scientific data measuring different species of insects in the UK skies. This practice-based research will contribute to the inter-disciplinary research into climate change and species extinction of the University of Leeds BIODAR unit.operanorth.co.uk/news/redell-olsen-wins-dare-art-prize-2020/21/ WORK Olsen's early work includes 'Book of the Insect' (allsingingalldancing, 1999) and 'Book of the Fur' (rempress, 2000). In 2004, she and the book-artist Susan Johanknecht published here are my instructions (Gefn Press), the outcome of their collaborative project 'writing instructions / reading walls', which had involved inviting 9 artists/writers to present them with instructions for a work to be sited on the cafe wall at the Poetry Society, London.Foreword to here are my instructions These works were exhibited serially over the period January to May 2003. Olsen and Johanknecht then sent their own instructions to the 9 participants in response to the work produced. Here are my instructions includes this second response together with visual material relating to the work produced in response to the first set on instructions.Foreword to here are my instructions It also included a foreword by the two editors and a poem by Olsen, 'we await your instructions nervously'. In 2004, Olsen also published secure portable space (Reality Street). This included four sequences: 'Corrupted by Showgirls'; Spill-Kit; Era of Heroes; and The Minimaus Poems - her response to Charles Olson's Maximus. David Kennedy and Christine Kennedy, in their book, women's experimental poetry in britain 1970 to 2010 (2013), described 'Corrupted by Showgirls' as 'a gender-politics savvy critique of the representation of women in musicals and film noir' (143). They noted, in particular, how the sequence picks up on 'film's reliance on close- ups of small, but telling, physical gestures for its most powerful emotional effects' (143). Their suggestion that 'Era of heroes / Heroes of Error' shows Olsen's interest in 'public language and public space' (143) is developed more fully by Zoe Skoulding in her monograph Contemporary Women's Poetry & Urban Space (2013). Skoulding discusses how Olsen's 'The Minimaus Poems' read 'the spatial environment of the city' against 'the textual background of Charles Olson's The Maximus Poems' (179). Rather than being a simple play on the similar surnames, carried over into an ironic juxtaposition of Gloucester, England, and Gloucester, Massachusetts, Olsen's text sets up 'a complex interplay in which location and gender shift within multiple ironies' (180): Olsen's text works to disrupt 'any certainty' by creating 'a double map in which competing views multiply subject positions, disturbing the relationship with the background text by foregrounding particular elements of it' (181). Olsen complicates this further by reworking the American Gloucester through the writings of the composer and First World War poet, Ivor Gurney (Olsen, 2004). In addition, Olsen's subject is enmeshed in the environment created by contemporary technological communication systems (181). Skoulding also discusses Olsen's neon-light version of 'Era of Heroes / Heroes of Error', displayed in the bookart bookshop in Old Street, London, where the flickering of the light repeatedly collapsed the words 'Era of Heroes' into 'Heroes of Error'as 'a challenge to the notion of the hero in a time of war'. The long alphabetical list of superheroes, 'perhaps reminiscent of the reading out of the names of the dead', which Olsen read to accompany the exhibition, Skoulding suggests,'quotes popular culture while drawing attention to the arbitrary construction of notions of heroism' (183). Olsen's two most recent volumes have been published in the USA. In 2012, she published Punk Faun: A Bar Rock Pastel (Oakland, CA: Subpress), and, in 2014, she published film poems (Los Angeles: Les Figues). Film poems brought together 5 sequences: London Land Marks; A Newe Book of Copyes; Bucolic Picnic; The Lost Pool; and SPRIGS & spots. All five were originally written in conjunction with films made or re-made by Olsen, as Drew Milne points out in his Foreword. An account of the making and performance of 'The Lost Pool' is contained in Robert Hampson's essay, 'Lost and Found: Women's Poetry and the Academy' (Journal of British and Irish Innovative Poetry, 3:2, September 2011, 81-90). Sophie Mayer discusses Olsen's film poems in 'Cinema Mon Amour: How British Poetry Fell in Love with Film', her chapter in The Oxford Handbook of Contemporary British and Irish Poetry (OUP, 2013).Peter Robinson (ed), The Oxford Handbook of Contemporary British and Irish Poetry (Oxford University Press, 2013). Olsen provided her own engagement with the aesthetics of the film poems in 'To Quill at Film' published in Trenchart: Logistics (Los Angeles: Les Figues, 2013). As noted above, Olsen's poetic film essay 'Now Circa (1918), produced to mark the centenary of suffrage for some women in Great Britain in the contemporary context of Trump and #MeToo, was shortlisted for the AHRC research in Film Award (2018). More recently, she produced a text for film and live performance 'Judgement Action' (or 'Foil, Jumping, Daisies), which draws on research into Black Mountain College. Olsen discusses her engagement with film in an interview for the midnight mollusc.themidnightmollusc.blogspot.co.uk/2017/03/interview-with-redell-olsen Her critical work also includes: 'Strategies of Critical Practice: Recent Writing on Experimental and Innovative Poetry by Women' (Signs, 33:2, Winter 2008, 373-87); 'Degrees of Liveness, Live and Electronic Subjects: Leslie Scalapino, Fiona Templeton and Carla Harryman', How2, I.6; 'Kites and Poses: Attitudinal Interfaces in Frank O'Hara and Grace Hartigan' in Robert Hampson and Will Montgomery (eds), Frank O'Hara Now (Liverpool University Press, 2010), 178-94; 'Field Recording as Writing: John Berger, Peter Gizzi and Julian Spahr in Will Montgomery and Stephen Benson (eds), Writing the Field Recording (Edinburgh, 2018) 167-86.

Clark and Prince created Blackwater in 1997 as a business for assuming some of the roles once played by the public sector military, most notably providing security for American and British officials in the Iraq War. As a Navy SEAL firearms instructor, Clark grew dissatisfied with the fact that the Navy did not own firing ranges, and instead had to borrow time on Marine or Army ranges or rent facilities that were highly inadequate for serving the Navy's needs. With the idea of creating a ‚Äúone-stop shopping‚Äù private training facility, Clark's concept simply lacked the financial backing, until he realized that one of his SEAL trainees (Erik Prince) was a man with similar ideas but far greater financial resources. He found a similar opportunity at Strategic Tactical Services where a wealthy investor backed Clark's idea which was lost with his departure from Blackwater. He was co-founder at STS. In 2006 Clark started his own company, Clark Consulting based out of Virginia Beach. Clark Consulting LLC. is an SDVO small business. Clark Consulting LLC. specializes in training and support services for personnel operating in high- risk environments. Clark was solicited by the U.S. Navy Center for Security Forces and the Naval Expeditionary Combat Command to consult on training programs. The consultation turned into a 7-year project led by Al Clark and Clark Consulting LLC. The project titled \\"Combat Shooting Training Program Analysis\\" chartered by NECC gave Clark a clean slate and asked that he build them a combat shooting program that could eventually sustain itself to increase the NECC forces combat shooting proficiency and readiness. The shooting program would eventually be titled \\"ESAMI\\" Expeditionary Small Arms Marksmanship Instructor. Clark Consulting LLC. trained close to 1,000 NECC forces over this time.

Examples of uses include analysis of: bone beneath skin, tablets inside plastic bottles, explosives inside containers and counterfeit tablets inside blister packs. There have also been advancements in the development of deep non-invasive medical diagnosis using SORS with the hopes of being able to detect breast tumors. Intensity distribution of the diffused light when one select only the part coming out in reflection at a distance from the source. Raman spectroscopy relies on inelastic scattering events of monochromatic light to produce a spectrum characteristic of a sample. The technique usually uses the red- shifted photons produced by monochromatic light losing energy to a vibrational motion within a molecule. The shift in colour and the probability of inelastic scatter is characteristic of the molecule that scatters the photon. A molecule may produce over 10 to 20 major lines, though this is restricted only by the number of bonds and symmetry constraints. Importantly, the spectrum produced by a mixture forms a linear combination of the component spectra, enabling relative chemical content to be determined in a simple spectroscopic measurement using chemometric analysis. Methods Conventional Raman spectroscopy is limited to the near-surface of diffusely scattering objects. For example, with tissue it is limited to the first few hundred micrometres depth of surface material. Raman spectroscopy is used for this purpose in many applications where its high chemical specificity enables chemical mapping of surfaces, e.g., tablet mapping. Measurement beyond the surface of diffusely scattering samples is limited because the signal intensity is high in the region of laser excitation and that dominates the collected signal. The basic SORS technique was invented and developed by Pavel Matousek, Anthony Parker and collaborators at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in the UK. The method relies upon the fact that most materials are neither completely transparent to light nor completely block it, but that they tend to scatter the light. An example is when a red laser pointer illuminates the end of a finger - the light scatters throughout all of the tissue in the finger. Wherever the light goes there will be some inelastic scattering due to the Raman effect, so, at some point, most parts of an object will generate a detectable Raman signal, even if it is not at the surface. The trick with SORS is to make a measurement that avoids the dominating excitation region. A SORS measurement will make at least two Raman measurements; one at the source and one at an offset position of typically a few millimetres away. The two spectra can be subtracted using a scaled subtraction to produce two spectra representing the subsurface and surface spectra. For a simple two-layer system, such as powder in a plastic bottle, the powder spectrum can be measured without knowing the bottle material or its relative signal contribution. To do this without using an offset measurement would be severely restricted by photon shot noise generated by Raman and fluorescence signals originating from the surface layer. Scaled subtraction works well for two-layer systems but more complicated examples, such as where the overlying material contains components included in the sub- layer (living tissue, for example), may require multi-variate analysis. When multi-variate techniques, such as principal component analysis are used, it is necessary to take several spectra at varied offset distances. As the spatial offset increases the ratio of the spectral contribution sub-surface/surface increases. However, the total signal also decreases with increasing offset, so the ratio cannot increase forever in a practical measurement. Inverse SORS is a useful sub-variant of SORS that improves certain measurements such as analysis of tissue in vivo. Rather than use a spot collection geometry and a circular spot for illumination the constant offset can be maintained by illuminating the sample with a ring of light centred on the collection region. This has several advantages, including lowering the total power density and allowing simple manipulation of offset distance. Micro-spatially offset Raman spectroscopy (micro-SORS) combines SORS with microscopy. The main difference between SORS and micro-SORS is the spatial resolution: while SORS is suited to the analysis of millimetric layers, micro-SORS is able to resolve thin, micrometric-scale layers.

Directed by Joel Bender, it stars Kirsten Baker as June. Following their high school graduation, her friends and she take over the operation of June's uncle's gasoline station, which faces stiff competition from the newer, bigger, more modern station that has recently opened across the street. Plot summary The film's plot follows the adventures of June (Kirsten Baker) and her friends, who after their senior year of high school, agree to help out at the failing gas and service station run by June's uncle, played by (Huntz Hall) . However, right across the street is another station, run by Mr. Friendly (Dave Shelley), a devious businessman. His goal is to put his rival out of business. It seems like fate might be working in the villain's favor. Uncle Joe has been struck by a heart attack, and can no longer run the business. When Uncle Joe's doctor tells him he must sell the gasoline station that he has operated for more than 20 years, June decides to take it over and get her friends to work for her as gas-pump attendants. The girls wear uniforms consisting of halter tops and short shorts, labelled either \\"Regular\\" or \\"Super Duper\\" (for high-octane fuel). Michael and his male friends work as mechanics in the body shop. June also installs a public address (PA) system, over which she announces the station's services, using sexually suggestive phrases and double entendres. Business is soon booming, much to Mr. Friendly's chagrin. The Vultures, a local motorcycle gang, vandalize the station, but June soon puts her feminine charms to work to recruit them to her cause, putting them to work as her tow truck-driving team. (Ken Lerner plays Peewee, one of the bikers.) Mr. Friendly hires two mobsters to murder June. The mobsters are played by screen veterans Mike Mazurki and Joe E. Ross, best known for playing bumbling police officer Toody on Car 54, Where Are You? However, when they threaten her, she flips the switch on the PA system, alerting the others. Having returned from towing a vehicle, the Vultures hatch a plan: while the girls pace back and forth, topless, to distract the mobsters, the Vultures, waiting just outside the doorway to the station's office, club the men over the head, knocking them unconscious. Next, Mr. Friendly convinces the gasoline supplier not to deliver supplies to June's station. Without a product to sell, the station is out of business, until June finds a way to get more fuel to sell; they visit their competitor, asking to have the gas tank of Michael's car filled. As the vehicle is refueled, one of the boys, hidden beneath the car, siphons the gasoline into a storage tank, so that the car seems to hold much more fuel than it needs. By making two visits, using the same vehicle, the friends are able to obtain more regular and high- octane gasoline to sell at their own station. This scheme is successful, but only for the near term, and they are soon out of product again. They are all about to admit defeat until Mr. Friendly pays them an unfriendly visit to mock their attempt to compete against him, and June rallies them.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077597/ She intercepts the fuel deliveryman, who tells her to follow him if she wants to see where the president of the fuel company works, but warns her that he refuses to see anyone but oil sheiks. June and her friends follow the deliveryman, but the security guard at the gate refuses to allow them to enter the company's property. June hits on a plan. The Vultures will don helmets, posing as a security force, and she and the other teens will dress as oil sheiks. This time, the guard permits them to enter, and they are ushered into the president's office. June removes her disguise, and, attracted to her in her brief uniform, the president listens to her story concerning how her friends and she have attempted to save her ailing uncle's family business, despite the unfair competition that Mr. Friendly has posed, which includes his having hired hit men to murder her. Outraged at Mr. Friendly's conduct, the president discontinues his franchise, and June takes over the Pyramid gas station and garage. Her uncle recovers and returns to manage the business, and June and her friends enjoy their postgraduation freedom.

Hawksley was born in Nottingham, England in 1839 and was the son of civil engineer Thomas Hawksley. He studied at University College London and after graduating entered into apprenticeship with his father's firm, which had been established in 1852 and specialised in water related projects.. From 1857 Hawksley was, with his father, an adviser to the Great Yarmouth Waterworks Company and in 1866 became a partner in his father's firm. Hawksley worked extensively in the water industry and clients included the Newcastle and Gateshead Water Company, Sunderland and South Shields Water Company, Consett Waterworks, Weardale and Shildon District Waterworks and Durham County Water Board. Hawksley, with his father, built the Catcleugh Reservoir in Northumberland for the Newcastle and Gateshead Water Company between 1899 and 1905. In addition to his work on reservoirs, pipes and other infrastructure for the water companies he also undertook work for the Bishop Auckland District Gas Company. Hawksley became a member of the Smeatonian Society of Civil Engineers in 1897 and would serve as their president in 1911. He also served as the 38th president of the Institution of Civil Engineers from November 1901 to November 1902.. In holding that office he followed in the footsteps of his father who had been the 16th president from December 1871 to December 1873.. On 12 July 1907 Charles Hawksley established the Thomas Hawksley Fund on the centenary of his father's birth to provide a lasting memory for Thomas who had died in 1893. The fund was given to the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, of which whose council he was a member, which used it to provide an annual lecture and medal the first of which was presented on 5 December 1913. Hawksley gave ¬£4000 to Imperial College London's department of civil engineering which was used to construct a hydraulics laboratory shortly after the First World War.. Charles Hawksley died in 1917. The Institution of Civil Engineers awards the Charles Hawksley Prize in his honour.

The Puritan community found no scriptural justification for celebrating Christmas, and associated such celebrations with paganism and idolatry. Indeed, Christmas celebrations in 17th-century England involved Carnival-like behavior including role inversion, heavy drinking, and sexual liberties.Stephen W. Nissenbaum, \\"Christmas in Early New England, 1620-1820: Puritanism, Popular Culture, and the Printed Word\\", Proceedings of the American Antiquarian Society 106:1:79 (January 1, 1996) The earliest years of the Plymouth Colony were troubled with non-Puritans attempting to make merry, and Governor William Bradford was forced to reprimand offenders. English laws suppressing the holiday were enacted in the English Interregnum, but repealed late in the 17th century. However, the Puritan view of Christmas and its celebration had gained cultural ascendancy in New England, and Christmas celebrations continued to be discouraged despite being legal. But by the mid-18th century, Christmas had become a mainstream celebration in New England, and by the beginning of the 19th century, ministers of Congregational churches, the church of the Puritans, actually called for formal observance of Christmas in the churches. When Christmas became a federal holiday in 1870, late 19th century Americans widely fashioned the day into the Christmas of commercialism, spirituality, and nostalgia that most Americans recognize today.  The Puritan view of Christmas  In Puritans at Play (1995), Bruce Colin Daniels writes \\"Christmas occupied a special place in the ideological religious warfare of Reformation Europe.\\" Most Anabaptists, Quakers, and Congregational and Presbyterian Puritans, he observes, regarded the day as an abomination while Anglicans, Lutherans, the Dutch Reformed, and other denominations celebrated the day as did Roman Catholics. When the Church of England promoted the Feast of the Nativity as a major religious holiday, the Puritans attacked it as \\"residual Papist idolatry\\". Cotton Mather, c. 1700 Puritans heaped contempt on Christmas, Daniels writes, calling it 'Foolstide' and suppressing any attempts to celebrate it for several reasons. First, no holy days except the Sabbath were sanctioned in Scripture, second, the most egregious behaviors were exercised in its celebration (Cotton Mather railed against these behaviors), and third, December 25 was ahistorical. The Puritan argued that the selection of the date was an early Christian hijacking of a Roman festival, and to celebrate a December Christmas was to defile oneself by paying homage to a pagan custom. James Howard Barnett notes in The American Christmas (1984) that the Puritan view prevailed in New England for almost two centuries. The Puritan calendar was one of the most leisure-less ever adopted by mankind, with approximately 300 working days compared to the 240 typical of cultures from Ancient Rome to modern America. Days of rest in the New England calendar were few, Innes writes, and restricted to Sabbath, election day, Harvard Commencement day, and periodic days of humiliation and thanksgiving. Non-Puritans in New England deplored the loss of the holidays enjoyed by the laboring classes in England. The Examination and Tryal of Father Christmas (1686) The Plymouth Pilgrims put their loathing for the day into practice in 1620 when they spent their first Christmas Day in the New World building their first structure in the New World - thus demonstrating their complete contempt for the day. A year later on December 25, 1621, Governor William Bradford led a work detail into the forest and discovered some recent arrivals among the crew had scruples about working on the day. Bradford noted in his history of the colony, Of Plymouth Plantation: > On the day called Christmas Day, the Governor called [the settlers] out to > work as was usual. However, the most of this new company excused themselves > and said it went against their consciences to work on that day. So the > Governor told them that if they made it [a] matter of conscience, he would > spare them till they were better informed; so he led away the rest and left > them. When the Governor and his crew returned home at noon they discovered those left behind playing stool-ball, pitching the bar, and pursuing other sports. Bradford confiscated their implements, reprimanded them, forbade any further reveling in the streets, and told them their devotion for the day should be confined to their homes. Christmas in the 17th century was celebrated in rowdy and aggressive ways: > The holiday the suppressed was not what we probably mean when we think of a > 'traditional' Christmas... [I]t involved behavior that most of us would find > offensive and even shocking today -- rowdy public displays of excessive > eating and drinking, the mockery of established authority, aggressive > begging (often combined with the threat of doing harm), even the boisterous > invasion of wealthy homes. Massachusetts and Connecticut followed the Plymouth Colony in refusing to condone any observance of the day. When the Puritans came to power in England following the execution of King Charles I of England, Parliament of England enacted a law in 1647 abolishing the observance of Christmas, Easter, and Whitsuntide. The Puritans of New England then passed a series of laws making any observance of Christmas illegal, thus banning Christmas celebrations for part of the 17th century. A Massachusetts law of 1659 punished offenders with a hefty five shilling fine.  Legacy  Sir Edmund Andros Laws suppressing the celebration of Christmas were repealed in 1681, but staunch Puritans continued to regard the day as an abomination. Eighteenth century New Englanders viewed Christmas as the representation of royal officialdom, external interference in local affairs, dissolute behavior, and an impediment to their holy mission. During Anglican Governor Sir Edmund Andros tenure (December 20, 1686 - April 18, 1689), for example, the royal government closed Boston shops on Christmas Day and drove the schoolmaster out of town for a forced holiday. Following Andros' overthrow, however, the Puritan view reasserted itself and shops remained open for business as usual on Christmas with goods such as hay and wood being brought into Boston as on any other work day. With such an onus placed upon Christmas, non-Puritans in colonial New England made no attempt to celebrate the day. Many spent the day quietly at home. In 1771, Anna Winslow, an American schoolgirl visiting Boston noted in her diary, \\"I kept Christmas at home this year, and did a good day's work.\\" Although Christmas celebrations were legal after 1680, New England officials continued to frown upon gift giving and reveling. Evergreen decoration, associated with pagan custom, was expressly forbidden in Puritan meeting houses and discouraged in the New England home. Merrymakers were prosecuted for disturbing the peace. Still, the Christmas traditions continued to \\"hover[] just beneath the surface of New England culture, emerging occasionally into plain sight.\\" Multiple incidents of Christmas disorder are recorded from the late 17th and early 18th century. Christmas began to become respectable in the 18th century. Even Cotton Mather's 1712 anti-Christmas sermon did argue against inappropriate behavior during Christmas, but he allowed for the possibility of celebrating it. By 1730s, there sermons positively urging that Christmas was a joyful occasion. A few almanacs started mentioning Christmas in 1713, but by the 1760s, it became common. Starting in the 1760s, the Boston Anticks, groups of roving performers, would perform \\"bawdy skits\\" at wealthy people's houses and then demand money from them. Christmas poems were printed in New England newspapers on multiple occasions, both for adults and for children. Christmas music was printed starting in the 1760s. The first public call by a Congregationalist for a church celebration of Christmas came in 1797. The Universalists started holding Christmas services in 1789, and the Unitarians started advocating for closing businesses on Christmas in 1817. From 1818 to the late 1820s, there was a short-lived movement to hold Christmas services in churches, and to close businesses. Yet the commercial side of Christmas was already beginning to take hold: by 1808, there were already advertisements for Christmas gifts, and the modern version of Christmas was being created: > In New England, as elsewhere, the next incarnation of Christmas was taking > shape. That incarnation engaged powerful new forces that were coming to > dominate much of American society in the years after 1820--a heady brew that > mixed a rapidly commercializing economy with a culture of domesticity > centered on the well-being of children. Both elements were present in a new > Christmas poem that soon came to define the rituals of the season in middle- > class households throughout the United States. This new poem, written in > 1822, began to receive wide distribution in the newspaper press (including > that of New England) five years later. The poem was written by the son of an > Episcopal bishop--and ignored religion altogether. Although it was set on > the night before Christmas, its subject was not the nativity but 'A Visit > from St. Nicholas.' So it would be Santa Claus, not Jesus of Nazareth, whose > influence finally succeeded in transforming Christmas from a season of > misrule into a day of quieter family pleasures. In 1856, Christmas became a public holiday in Massachusetts. As late as 1870, classes were scheduled in Boston public schools on Christmas Day and punishments were doled out to children who chose to stay home beneath the Christmas tree. One commentator hinted that the Puritans viewed Santa Claus as the Anti-Christ. In the aftermath of the American Civil War, Christmas became the festival highpoint of the American calendar. The day became a Federal holiday in 1870 under President Ulysses S. Grant in an attempt to unite north and south. During the 19th century, the Puritan hostility to Christmas gradually relaxed. In the late 19th century, authors praised the holiday for its liberality, family togetherness, and joyful observance. In 1887, for example, St. Nicholas Magazine published a story about a sickly Puritan boy of 1635 being restored to health when his mother brings him a bough of Christmas greenery. One commentator suggested the Puritans had actually done the day a service in reviling the gaming, dissipation, and sporting in its observation. When the day's less pleasant associations were stripped away, Americans recreated the day according to their tastes and times. The doctrines that caused the Puritans to regard the day with disapprobation were modified and the day was rescued from its traditional excesses of behavior. Christmas was reshaped in late 19th century America with liberal Protestantism and spirituality, commercialism, artisanship, nostalgia, and hope becoming the day's distinguishing characteristics.

It is a cause of primary hyperaldosteronism. Symptoms and signs Patients with GRA may be asymptomatic, but the following symptoms can be present: * Fatigue * Headache * High blood pressure * Hypokalemia * Intermittent or temporary paralysis * Muscle spasms * Muscle weakness * Numbness * Polyuria * Polydipsia * Tingling * Hypernatraemia * Metabolic alkalosis Normal Physiology Steroidogenesis, showing aldosterone synthase at right. Aldosterone synthase is a steroid hydroxylase cytochrome P450 oxidase enzyme involved in the generation of aldosterone. It is localized to the mitochondrial inner membrane. The enzyme has steroid 18-hydroxylase activity to synthesize aldosterone and other steroids. Aldosterone synthase is found within the zona glomerulosa at the outer edge of the adrenal cortex. Aldosterone synthase normally is not ACTH sensitive, and only activated by angiotensin II. Aldosterone causes the tubules of the kidneys to retain sodium and water. This increases the volume of fluid in the body, and drives up blood pressure. Steroid hormones are synthesized from cholesterol within the adrenal cortex. Aldosterone and corticosterone share the first part of their biosynthetic pathway. The last part is either mediated by the aldosterone synthase (for aldosterone) or by the 11Œ≤-hydroxylase (for corticosterone). :Aldosterone synthesis is stimulated by several factors: ::by increase in the plasma concentration of angiotensin III. ::by increased plasma angiotensin II, ACTH, or potassium levels. ::The ACTH stimulation test is sometimes used to stimulate the production of aldosterone along with cortisol to determine if primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency is present. ::by plasma acidosis. ::by the stretch receptors located in the atria of the heart. ::by adrenoglomerulotropin, a lipid factor, obtained from pineal extracts. It selectively stimulates secretion of aldosterone. ::The secretion of aldosterone has a diurnal rhythm. :Control of aldosterone release from the adrenal cortex: ::*The role of the renin‚Äìangiotensin system: :::Angiotensin is involved in regulating aldosterone and is the core regulator. Angiotensin II acts synergistically with potassium. ::*The role of sympathetic nerves: :::Aldosterone production is also affected to one extent or another by nervous control which integrates the inverse of carotid artery pressure, pain, posture, and probably emotion (anxiety, fear, and hostility)(including surgical stress). ::*The role of baroreceptors: :::Pressure in the carotid artery decreases aldosterone ::*The role of the juxtaglomerular apparatus ::*The plasma concentration of potassium: :::The amount of aldosterone secreted is a direct function of the serum potassium as probably determined by sensors in the carotid artery. ::*The plasma concentration of sodium: :::Aldosterone is a function of the inverse of the sodium intake as sensed via osmotic pressure. ::*Miscellaneous regulation: :::ACTH, a pituitary peptide, also has some stimulating effect on aldosterone probably by stimulating deoxycorticosterone formation which is a precursor of aldosterone. :::Aldosterone is increased by blood loss, pregnancy, and possibly by other circumstances such as physical exertion, endotoxin shock, and burns. :Aldosterone feedback: ::Feedback by aldosterone concentration itself is of a non-morphological character (that is, other than changes in cell number or structure) and is relatively poor, so that electrolyte feedback predominates in the short term. Pathophysiology The genes encoding aldosterone synthase and 11Œ≤-hydroxylase are 95% identical and are close together on chromosome 8. In individuals with GRA, there is unequal crossing over so that the 5' regulatory region of the 11-hydroxylase gene is fused to the coding region of the aldosterone synthase. The product of this hybrid gene is aldosterone synthase that is ACTH-sensitiveGanong Physiology in the zona fasciculata of the adrenal gland. Although in normal subjects, ACTH accelerates the first step of aldosterone synthesis, ACTH normally has no effect on the activity of aldosterone synthase. However, in subjects with glucocorticoid-remediable aldosteronism, ACTH increases the activity of existing aldosterone synthase, resulting in an abnormally high rate of aldosterone synthesis and hyperaldosteronism. Diagnosis Genetic testing Treatment In GRA, the hypersecretion of aldosterone and the accompanying hypertension are remedied when ACTH secretion is suppressed by administering glucocorticoids. Dexamethasone, spironolactone and eplerenone have been used in treatment.

After he took part in the conspiracy to kill Pavle Radenoviƒá in 1415, Hraniƒá came in conflict with Pavloviƒá family. In fighting against them, he allied with Ottoman Empire. In 1420 Ishak Bey organized unsuccessful campaign in Bosnia to support Sandalj's struggle against his enemies. At the beginning of February 1426 a special ceremony was dedicated to Duke Sandalj and Duchess Jelena in Dubrovnik, when they attended the feast of Saint Blaise, the city's patron saint.: \\"–î—É–±—Ä–æ–≤—á–∞–Ω–∏ —Å—É, –ø–æ –ø–æ—Å–µ–±–Ω–æ–º —Ü–µ—Ä–µ–º–æ–Ω–∏—ò–∞–ª—É, –ø—Ä–∏—Ä–µ–¥–∏–ª–∏ –≤–æ—ò–≤–æ–¥–∏ –°–∞–Ω–¥–∞—ô—É –∏ –à–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏ —Å–≤–µ—á–∞–Ω–∏ –¥–æ—á–µ–∫ –ø—Ä–≤–∏—Ö –¥–∞–Ω–∞ —Ñ–µ–±—Ä—É–∞—Ä–∞ 1426. –≥–æ–¥–∏–Ω–µ. –¢–æ–º –ø—Ä–∏–ª–∏–∫–æ–º, –à–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∞ —ò–µ –ø—Ä–∏—Å—É—Å—Ç–≤–æ–≤–∞–ª–∞ –Ω–∞—ò–≤–µ—õ–æ—ò —Å–≤–µ—á–∞–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ —É –î—É–±—Ä–æ–≤–Ω–∏–∫—É, –ø—Ä–æ—Å–ª–∞–≤–∏ –°–≤–µ—Ç–æ–≥ –í–ª–∞—Ö–∞\\" Sandalj often had conflicts with King Stephen Tvrtko II, even refusing to attend his wedding to the Hungarian-born Dorothy Garai in 1428. Death and legacy Sandalj died childless in 1435. He was succeeded by his nephew Stjepan Vukƒçiƒá Kosaƒça, son of his brother Vukac. Fine believes that Sandalj was most likely the person who killed Musa √áelebi, who was inspiration for epic hero Musa Kesed≈æija, or contributed significantly to his murder, and should have been the epic hero attributed with fighting and killing Musa, rather than Marko Kraljeviƒá. Religion Sandalj was a staunch supporter of the Bosnian Church, which he openly followed, and used every opportunity to instill its influence in all spheres of life in the kingdom. This is confirmed by Giunio Resti (Junije Restiƒá), known as Restius, who in his chronicle points out that Sandalj was born and died in the bosom of the Bosnian Church. Accordingly, in letters from April and May 1405, Ragusans tied him to the top brass of the Bosnian Church. The presence of djed, highest ranking priest of the Bosnian Church, always close to Sandalj during the Konavle War also confirms duke's conviction in role of the Bosnian Church and its place in public life in medieval Bosnia. Like his contemporaries, Hrvoje Vukƒçiƒá, Pavle Radinoviƒá and his son Radislav Pavloviƒá, Sandalj was closely linked to the philosophy and \\"moral politology\\" of his time, represented by the shadowy patarens, or Kristjani as the members of the Bosnian Church called themselves, and whose organized structure was deeply interwoven with all aspects of human everyday life, protecting the rights, morals and elements of the state- building in its time.

The show is about the four brothers Uwe (born 27 September 1951), Horst-G√ºnter (born 22 February 1954), Peter (born 5 August 1955) and Manfred \\"Manni\\" (born 29 July 1962) Ludolf. G√ºnter Ludolf died on January 31, 2011.  History  In 2002, German public TV station SWR Fernsehen intended to make a documentary on Dernbach (Landkreis Neuwied in the Westerwald). During filming, the mayor sent the journalists to the Ludolfs and a short portrait of the family (including the mother, who was still alive) was produced. After that, the SWR decided to produce a two-part-documentary (30 minutes each) under the title Schrott- Br√ºder ‚Äì Die Autoverwerter aus dem Westerwald (Junk Brothers - The car recyclers from the Westerwald). Several private TV stations (e. g. Kabel 1 and RTL 2) broadcast reports about the unusual family. DMAX later decided to produce an entire TV series about the Ludolfs. The show was so successful that on New Year's Day 2008, a 24-hour Ludolfs marathon was aired on DMAX. This marathon was repeated on New Year's Day 2009. On 12 March 2008, the fourth season of the Ludolfs was launched. The series has also been aired on Dutch television (with subtitles), and since early 2008 on DiscoveryRussia in Russian synchronization. = After Horst-G√ºnter Ludolf's death = Following Horst-G√ºnter Ludolf's death in January 2011, 12 episodes starring the three brothers aired online on .de. In 2012, Sport1 renewed and renamed the series SEK Ludolf - Das Schrott Einsatz Kommando which included 12 episodes and one Best-of. In January 2016, the series aired as Die Ludolfs - Das Schrottimperium ist zur√ºck after four years of absence on kabel eins in which only Uwe, his son Tommy and Manfred Ludolf establish a new scrapyard. Peter Ludolf manages the old scrapyard and does not star in the series.  The documentary  The DMAX television series displays the life and work of the Ludolf brothers, who own a car recycling yard. With their unusual business and lifestyle, the Ludolfs had a certain cult status in their hometown long before the series was filmed. They have a reputation for having any used car part that you might need. They organised an open door day in April 2007, an estimated amount of 15,000 to 20,000 people went to view the garage and junk yard resulting in traffic congestion on the nearby A3 highway. The stars of the series are Peter, Manfred, Uwe and (Horst-)G√ºnter Ludolf. For over 30 years the brothers, including their father and company founder Horst, have been collecting between two and five million car parts. The parts, stored in a warehouse, are sorted by a homegrown \\"cluster principle\\" with only Peter Ludolf knowing which part is in which pile. Each of the four brothers has a specific task. It's up to Peter to locate the desired part whether the customer is at the door or on the phone. G√ºnter answers the telephone and passes on the questions to Peter. Uwe and Manni, \\"Power and Hand\\" - a nickname they gave themselves due to the division of labor while disassembling junk cars. They are also responsible for fetching the cars. The series sources its charms from the different personalities of the brothers and their often comical devotion to their work at the scrap yard. Peter Ludolf lives with his playful and childlike brother, Manni, in the former home of their parents located on the premises. G√ºnter also lives with Peter and Manni since going through an existential crisis after his wife cheated on him. G√ºnter rarely speaks or leaves the compound, instead he smokes a lot and survives on coffee and vitamin tablets. Only lothario Uwe Ludolf leads a bourgeois life with his wife Karin and three adult children, who might possibly take over the company once the brothers retire.  Cameo Appearances  In the Daddy Cool issue, rappers Bushido und Kay One are to be seen asking for a spare part for a Ford Fiesta.

Construction was completed in 1893. It started in Jersey City, New Jersey at a connection with the National Docks Railway in Communipaw east of the Central Railroad of New Jersey line, and extended westward on the bridge across Newark Bay to connect with the LVRR's Newark and Passaic Railway. The connection with the National Docks Railway was used to reach the LVRR terminal in Jersey City. In 1895, the LVRR incorporated the Greenville and Hudson Railway and built a line parallel to the Nationals Docks Railway in 1900. Shortly thereafter, the LVRR obtained control of the National Docks Railway, and the Greenville and Hudson became redundant. In 1891 the LVRR consolidated the railroads along the Jersey City route into the Lehigh Valley Terminal Railway. Along with the Jersey City, Newark and Western Railway, the other consolidated companies were the Roselle and South Plainfield Railway, the Newark and Roselle Railway, the Newark and Passaic Railway, the Newark Railway, the Jersey City Terminal Railway, and the Edgewater Railway.

In 2008, the company celebrated its 25th year in business and was named to Forbes 400 Best Big Companies list for the second time. In 2013, the company was purchased by the McKesson Corporation and dissolved. The organization also ranked number 965 on the 2008 Fortune 1000 list of largest businesses, up from 980 the prior year. History PSS division logo The company, based in Jacksonville, Florida, began in 1983 with the physician business, now called the Physician Sales & Service (PSS) division, as a distributor of medical supplies, diagnostic equipment, and pharmaceutical related products to primary care office-based physicians in the United States. According to The Florida Times-Union, \\"PSS entered the radiology and imaging equipment distribution business by acquiring Jacksonville-based Diagnostic Imaging, Inc\\" in 1996. PSS division logo The acquisition of Gulf South Medical Supply Inc. was completed in early 1998 for $661 million and expanded PSSWM's target customer group to include long-term care and assisted living facilities, home health care and hospice providers. On February 22, 2013, McKesson Corporation (NYSE: MCK) announced that it completed the acquisition of PSS World Medical, Inc. for a total purchase price of approximately $2.1 billion, acquiring all outstanding shares of PSS World Medical for $29.00 per share in cash. According to The Florida Times- Union, Physician Sales and Service Inc. \\"officially changed its corporate name\\" in March, 1998 to PSS World Medical Inc. (PSSWM) \\"to reflect...[the company's] expansion into multiple medical distribution sectors.\\" In 1998 a book, Faster Company: Building the World's Nuttiest, Turn-on-a-Dime, Home- Grown, Billion-Dollar Business, was published after being written by Founder and then CEO, Patrick Kelly. Fisher Scientific announced its intention to buy PSSWM for $746.9 million in June, 2000 to increase its sales of medical products to doctors and nursing homes. Investors did not like the plan, and stock prices for both companies declined. On September 5, 2000, Fisher backed out of the deal and both companies announced that the \\"transaction is not in the best interest of their respective shareholders.\\" Diagnostic Imaging acquired California-based Intra-Trade Medical Corp. and QA Processor Service; New York-based Vanguard Imaging; and Florida-based Palm Beach X-Ray Company in 1999 with the expressed hope of raising annual revenue by $45 million. However, PSSWM restructured the company's debt in 2000 and DI lost money for two years. In late 2002, PSSWM announced a $115 million deal to sell its Diagnostic Imaging subsidiary to a venture capital firm that will continue operating the imaging business based in Jacksonville. Current operations The company has over 800 sales consultants who work through 39 full-service distribution centers providing coverage throughout the United States. As a single source for medical inventory needs, PSS carries over 55,000 different medical products, (70% supplies, 20% equipment, and 10% pharmaceuticals), representing over 1,000 major manufacturers.

The garden was established by public subscription in 1843 at the initiative of pharmacist Jean-Anthyme Margueron (1771‚Äì1848), and is the oldest public garden in the city. In response to the 1841 creation of the city's Hospice G√©n√©ral et de l‚ÄôEcole Pr√©paratoire de Pharmacie, it began as a collection of about 2,000 medical and exotic plants arranged in greenhouses (containing about 500 plants), orchard, and garden proper. It was flooded by the Loire in 1848 and again in 1856, to a depth of 2 metres, which required rebuilding the garden and replacing most of its trees. In 1863 an orangery and animal park were added, and then in 1890 new greenhouses (cold, temperate, and hot) under the direction of Louis Madelin, with the garden's first seed catalog published in 1901. The greenhouses were damaged by bombardments in World War II. The garden currently contains about 2,000 taxa, organized as follows: * North - regular parterres along an avenue of magnolias, with a pool containing water lilies and lotus; renovated in 1980 to contain theme gardens and a phylogenetic garden. * East - bulbs, rhizomes, and perennials, as well as a garden of plant evolution. * South - an excellent arboretum in the English style, a pond, and a \\"garden of simples\\" as in medieval gardens. * West - heath, bog, Mediterranean garden, and alpine garden.

She is known for coaching Loyola College to national prominence, and later for her achievements after being diagnosed with terminal cancer. Athletic career Beginning at a young age, Geppi was driven athletically. As a youth, she was one of 2 young girls playing football and baseball on the local boys' teams.... She attended Parkville High School, where she would earn Baltimore \\"All--Metro\\" honors in volleyball, basketball, and lacrosse. These athletic accolades led her to be recruited by several colleges, and was offered a number of scholarships to play collegiate basketball. For college, Geppi decided to attend nearby Loyola College where she could remain close to her family. Although recruited to play three sports, Geppi decided to play only volleyball and lacrosse. In lacrosse, Geppi was usually an offensive player. However, in her sophomore year, she suffered a nerve injury which required her to change positions. Geppi converted to goalkeeper. The conversion was a success, Geppi would go on to earn All-American honors as a goalkeeper. After college, Geppi continued playing lacrosse, where she helped Team USA win two gold medals in international competition. Geppi was named captain of both the volleyball and lacrosse teams during her playing career. In 1984, Geppi was inducted into the Loyola College Athletic Hall of Fame. She was the youngest person ever to be honored with this induction. Coaching career Geppi- Aikens became the head coach of the Loyola Greyhounds women's lacrosse team in 1989. During her career she amassed a 197-71 record and led the team to the NCAA Women's Lacrosse Championship tournament ten times. She earned NCAA Division I \\"Coach of the Year\\" honors three times, in 1996, 1997, and 2003. Geppi-Aikens also served as Loyola's volleyball coach from 1984 to 1990, and was assistant athletic director for a time. In 2001, during a period a remission from her cancer, Geppi-Aikens was inducted into the U.S. Lacrosse Greater Baltimore Chapter Hall of Fame. After battling cancer since 1995, Geppi-Aikens learned prior to the 2003 season that the brain tumor had returned and this time it was inoperable. Despite being paralyzed by the cancer and using a wheelchair Geppi-Aikens continued to coach her team to the nation's # 1 ranking. The Greyhounds advanced to the Final Four of the NCAA Women's Lacrosse Championship tournament before their season ended with a 5-3 loss. Image of Diane Geppi-Aikens in 2003 coaching her team despite physical limitations. Image by Jed Kirschbaum of the Baltimore Sun. In 2003, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) awarded Geppi-Aikens with the Inspiration Award. This award is presented to an individual who gives hope and inspiration to others. Cancer Geppi-Aikens first learned that she had brain cancer in 1995. She had surgery to remove the tumor. Treatment did not prevent the tumor from coming back, and she again had surgery in 1997, 1998, and 2001. In December 2002, she learned that the cancer had again come back, and this time the tumor was inoperable. After the final diagnosis and being told she had only months to live, she stated that she had two goals. She wrote in a Sports Illustrated article entitled No Time To Die that she wanted to see her son graduate high school, and to coach her team to play for the national championship. She died on June 29, 2003, just one month after her son's graduation and coaching the Loyola women's lacrosse team to the NCAA Championship Final Four. Legacy The Intercollegiate Women's Lacrosse Coaches Association (IWLCA) presents annually the Diane Geppi-Aikens Memorial Award recognizing lifetime achievement in contribution to women‚Äôs lacrosse. Also, annually at the Tewaaraton Trophy presentation, an award given to the nation's top male and female collegiate lacrosse players, the Diane Geppi- Aikens Scholarship is presented. This scholarship was created to honor the women‚Äôs college lacrosse player who displays the same leadership, character and perseverance as exhibited by Geppi-Aikens. In 2004, Chip Silverman wrote a book called, Lucky Every Day: 20 Unforgettable Lessons from a Coach Who Made a Difference recalling stories and events of Geppi-Aikens' life and its effect on her players and those that surrounded her. In her honor, main athletic fields at Loyola College have been renamed the Diane Geppi-Aikens Field. In addition, the college holds the annual Diane Geppi-Aikens Memorial 5k Race.

Located on the east bank of the River Waveney around a mile east of Harleston, in 2005 its population was 440. The parish includes the hamlets of Withersdale Street. The Mendham Marshes are also within the parish boundaries. All Saints Church is a medieval church, Grade I listed, that was restored in the 1860s. It is now one of six churches in the Sancroft Benefice. The village of Mendham came under Mendham Priory until the dissolution of the monasteries. Mendham Priory then became a private house. The present house is an early 19th century neo-classical mansion, with a Doric style porch, built for Alexander Adair. The Priory was later the home of the Dimmock family. Until the 19th century, around 25% of the parish fell in Norfolk and 75% in Suffolk. Mendham's most famous son, born to a local miller, went on to become Sir Alfred James Munnings KCVO, PRA (8 October 1878 ‚Äì 17 July 1959), known as one of England's finest painters of horses, and as an outspoken enemy of Modernism. An extract of one of his paintings, featuring gypsy Charlotte Gray leading a pony, has been incorporated into the Mendham village sign. Her husband Frederick or 'Nobby' Gray was one of Alfred's closest friends and a model in some of his paintings. Both Nobby and Charlotte are buried in All Saints churchyard in Mendham.

Simon Meredith Simon Meredith, portrayed by Dale Meeks, made his first screen appearance on 20 November 2003. When Simon first laid eyes on Nicola Blackstock (Nicola Wheeler), he knew she was the woman for him. Unfortunately for the friendly fishmonger, it took the object of his affections longer to work out he was the one for her too. The problem was that Nicola had taken a shine to Simon's fellow fishmonger, Kenny, and asked her pal Emily Kirk to arrange a date for them. Misunderstanding her friend, the post mistress sorted out a drink for Nicola with Simon, and she was horrified to find a round, plain man waiting for her. But whatever Simon might look like, inside he is an absolute diamond - as proved by the fact everyone in Emmerdale loves him. Although he started dating Nicola, who he nicknamed \\"Frosty\\", Simon's feelings were trampled on when she took local stud Syd Woolfe to her school reunion because she was ashamed of her real life lover. In a horrible twist, Simon had been planning to propose to her on her return from the night out but, when he heard her thanking Syd for accompanying her, Simon found it hard to forgive. However, when Nicola realised she was losing the one man who truly loved her, she set a plan in motion to prove her devotion once and for all. In front of family, friends and her old school chums, Nicola declared her love for Simon and introduced him to everyone. Won over, Simon proposes and the couple look forward to the future together. But their happiness does not last for long. The reappearance of Simon's ex-fianc√©e Tash Abbott sets off the green eyed-monster in Nicola and the two women come to blows. Furious at Nicola's jealous behaviour, Simon flees to his mother in Scarborough - followed by Nicola. Desperate not to lose him, Nicola launches an impassioned speech and Simon finally accepts she properly loves him. The couple got re-engaged and bought Mulberry Cottage in Emmerdale and it looked like they were set up for a happy beginning to their marriage. However, unbeknown to Simon, his mother Lesley Meredith (Sherrie Hewson) had run their business into the ground and in a matter of weeks, they lost everything. Broke and ruined, Simon was at his lowest ebb and Nicola did nothing to ease his agony. Instead, she tried to convince him to let her millionaire father, Rodney, bail them out. Simon was horrified and it was the beginning of the end of their relationship. Nicola could not live without money and Simon ‚Äì who had by now got a job on the bins ‚Äì was bringing in next to nothing. Sick of each other, the couple started rowing to a terrible extent. Caught in the crossfire was Ivan Jones (Daniel Brocklebank), their lodger ‚Äì who was dating Nicola's half-brother Paul Lambert (Mathew Bose). Unbeknownst to Simon, Nicola had developed a huge crush on Ivan and was trying her level best to seduce him. When Simon's mum, Lesley, saw Nicola dressed in skimpy underwear and pawing Ivan, she assumed they were having an affair ‚Äì and soon everyone knew. Simon was horrified at the thought of the two people closest to him had betrayed him and disowned them both. He was mortified to discover later that Ivan had been completely innocent and wronged, he begged him to move back in and after a while, they got their friendship back on track. Life seemed to be back on an even keel at Mulberry Cottage but there was another drama about to unfold. Lesley bumped into Bobby-John, a man she had fallen for in her youth and they rekindled their romance. Simon was deeply skeptical of Bobby-John and worried Lesley was heading for a fall. She was, but it was not of Bobby-John's making. She had been stealing money from Kelly Windsor's credit card and used it pay for a posh break away with Bobby-John. When the truth came out, everyone was horrified and Lesley was left thinking she had lost everyone. Fortunately, Bobby-John found it in his heart to forgive her and they rode off into the sunset together. Simon and best mate Ivan have become dissatisfied with their lives and jobs in Emmerdale, so on 2 August, they bid farewell to 'the village of the damned' and headed for the warm beaches of Costa Rica.

The site is noted as the location of a munitions factory founded during the First World War. It was officially known as National Filling Factory No. 1. In 1916 a massive explosion killed 35 of the women who worked there. Etymology The name Barnbow is first attested in the period 1185-93 in the unique form Barnesburc and in the form Barnebu, which is more representative of later attestations. The name comes from the Old Norse personal name Bjarni and the word b√∫ ('homestead, estate'). Thus, when coined, the name meant 'Bjarni's homestead'. However, the name was by the thirteenth century sometime reinterpreted as including the word bow (from Old Norse bogi and/or Old English boga), which influenced its present form.Harry Parkin, Your City's Place-Names: Leeds, English Place-Name Society City-Names Series, 3 (Nottingham: English Place-Names Society, 2017), p. 21. Barnbow munitions factory After the declaration of war with Germany in August 1914, there was suddenly an urgent need for large volumes of arms and munitions. Shells were already being filled and armed at Leeds Forge Company, based at Armley, which by August 1915 was filling 10,000 shells per week. However new factories were required to dramatically increase production. A committee, chaired by Joseph Watson the Leeds soap manufacturer, was established for the purpose and decided to build a munitions factory from scratch. A governing board was organized to oversee construction on the new site, which was earmarked for Barnbow, situated between Cross Gates and Garforth. Barnbow became the most productive British shell factory of the First World War. Railway tracks were laid directly into the factory complex to transport materials in and transport goods out. Platforms of over were added to the nearby railway station to transport workers to and from work at the site. Massive factory buildings were quickly built, power lines were erected to bring power, and shell filling operations began in December 1915. A water main was laid and deliver 200,000 gallons of water per day, and changing rooms and a canteen were also rapidly built. The whole site covered , but due to security concerns there was a huge press blackout about the area. Memorial to the Barnbow Lasses, Manston Park, Cross Gates, Leeds =The work force= An extremely large work force was required so an employment agency was set up at Wellesley Barracks in Leeds. A third of the staff was recruited from Leeds itself, and other workers came from York, Castleford, Wakefield, Harrogate, Pontefract and many of the small villages nearby. For six days a week, a 24-hour three-shift system was set up, and by October 1916 there were 16,000 people working at Barnbow (over 130,000 people had applied). As the war progressed, the number of men on the site dwindled (due to the death rate on the war front), and the workforce ended up with around 93 per cent women and girls (affectionately known as \\"The Barnbow Lasses\\"). Workers earnings averaged ¬£3 per week, though through a bonus scheme women handling the explosives could take home between ¬£10-¬£12 per week. Thirty-eight trains per day were run, transporting the workers to and from work.http://www.historic- uk.com/HistoryUK/England-History/BarnbowLasses.htm One of the managers at the factory was Leeds City manager Herbert Chapman, who went on to manage Huddersfield Town and Arsenal. =Conditions= Working conditions were barely tolerable at Barnbow. The workers who handled the explosives had to strip to their underwear, and wear smocks and caps. Rubber soled shoes were also provided, and cigarettes and matches were completely banned. The hours on site were long, and the staff did not receive holidays at all. The food rationing was also rather severe, but the workers were allowed to drink as much barley water and milk as they liked, due to the nature of their jobs. Barnbow had its own farm, housing 120 cows which produced 300 gallons of milk per day. The workers often worked with Cordite which was a propellant for the shells, but had the unfortunate side effect on people who came into contact with it of turning their skin yellow. A cure for this ailment was to drink plenty of milk. Due to the \\"yellow\\" appearance of many of the women's skin, it earned them the nickname The Barnbow Canaries, which later inspired a play called Barnbow Canaries which premiered at the West Yorkshire Playhouse in the summer of 2016. =The explosion= Just after 10 pm on Tuesday 5 December 1916, several hundred women and girls had just started their shift at the factory. Four and a half inch shells were being filled, fused, finished off and packed. Room 42 was mainly used for the filling, and around 170 girls worked there. Shells were brought to the room fully loaded, and all that was left to do was for the fuse to be added and the shell cap screwed down. The fuse was inserted by hand, then a machine screwed the fuse down tightly. At 10:27 pm a violent explosion suddenly rocked room 42 killing 35 women outright, and maiming and injuring many more. Many of the dead were only identifiable by the identity disks they wore around their necks. The machine where the explosion occurred was completely destroyed. Despite the danger still remaining in room 42, many other workers hurried in to help the injured and get them to safety. Production was stopped only for a short while, and once the bodies were removed other girls were volunteering to work in room 42. Many of the injured girls and women went for convalescence. Because of the censorship at the time, no account of the accident was made public, though Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig paid tribute to the devotion and sacrifice of the workers killed. Many death notices appeared in the Yorkshire Evening Post, stating cause of death as killed by accident: the only clue to the tragedy that had befallen them. Six years after the end of the war, the public were finally told the facts of the explosion at Barnbow. There were a further two explosions at the factory; the first in March 1917 killing two girl workers, and one in May 1918 killing three men. Barnbow was Britain's top shell factory between 1914 and 1918, and by the end of the war on 11 November 1918, a total of 566,000 tons of ammunition had been shipped overseas. = ROF Leeds = In World War II, the factory became ROF Leeds, and postwar manufactured the Centurion. Monuments In October 2016, the site of Barnbow Munitions Factory was listed as a scheduled monument. There are two memorials to those killed, each listing all the names. In Manston Park is a stone with a plaque. On Cross Gates Road, by the roundabout at the Ring Road are 3 small stones with a simple inscription. Around them on the ground are metal tiles, each bearing the name of one of the women.

He only competed in the Bundesliga during his 15-year senior career, amassing totals of 243 games and 15 goals and representing mainly Bochum (five years) and Stuttgart (four). Football career Born in Bochum, Legat started professionally at hometown's VfL Bochum, making his Bundesliga debut on 6 September 1987 (not yet 19) in a 1‚Äì1 home draw against Borussia M√∂nchengladbach, and became an essential first-team member in the following seasons. After a spectacular 1990‚Äì91 ‚Äì 31 matches, seven goals, being crucial in helping Bochum retain its top division status ‚Äì Legat signed with SV Werder Bremen: facing stiffer competition, he still managed to play nearly 100 official games in three seasons, and also helped the club win the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in his debut campaign, although he did not play in the final against AS Monaco FC. Legat then spent one season at Eintracht Frankfurt, playing as a defensive complement to Augustine Okocha, then moved south for VfB Stuttgart. With the latter, he began suffering from injuries, undergoing two Achilles tendon surgeries. Additionally, Legat was involved in a racist incident with Guinean Pablo Thiam, a teammate, in early 1999. He was immediately released, only appearing 40 times in four years combined, and spent two more injury-ravaged years at FC Schalke 04, subsequently retiring. In 2005‚Äì06, Legat spent one year coaching Werder's under-19 side. The following year, he would be involved in another incident, in which he brandished a samurai sword to a group of youngsters after being threatened alongside his wife, slightly hitting one in the head. Off the fieldViolence= In his time as an active player, Legate's career was overshadowed several times by derailments off the court. So he put a man into the hospital, for example, in New Year's Eve 1996/97 in Bochum after he had threatened him. 9 Seiten/Bilder In June 2007, Legat made headlines when he fell in the parking lot of a Remscheid fast food chain branch in dispute with a group of young people who allegedly molested him. As a result, Legat pulled a Samurai sword, which earned him a legal proceeding for attempted dangerous bodily injury. The proceeding was stopped in December 2008 against a payment of an amount of 1000 euro to a charitable institution. =TV appearances= In April 2014, Legat participated in the celebrity cooking show Hell's Kitchen and reached the final. In autumn of the same year he joined the celebrity boxing event Promiboxen, where he won his fight against the rapper Trooper Da Don. He has participated in several ProSieben events, including TV Total Stock Car Crash Challenge in November 2014 and October 2015 and Die gro√üe ProSieben V√∂lkerball Meisterschaft in April 2016. In January 2016, Legate was candidate in the tenth season of the RTL Television reality game show Ich bin ein Star ‚Äì Holt mich hier raus! and finished third. In June 2016, he worked together with his wife Alexandra at Das Sommerhaus der Stars ‚Äì Kampf der Promipaare. In July 2016, he was participant in the summer specials of Grill the Henssler and Ninja Warrior Germany, and in August 2016 he took part in the show Bauer sucht Frau ‚Äì Die gro√üe Bauernolympiade in the team of celebrities. In December 2016, he lost his challenge to his competitor Detlef Soost at Schlag den Raab, where he also presented a tattoo translating to \\"Blood, Honour, Pride & Family\\", which strongly resembles the Nazi slogan Blood & Honour . In January 2017 he strengthened the \\"Team Football\\" at Duell der Stars ‚Äì Die Sat.1 Promiarena. =Private= Legat grew up with his three brothers in the parents in Werne, a district of Bochum. In the 1990s he married Alexandra, with whom he has two sons today. He and his children have been living in Wermelskirchen in Bergisches Land for years. According to his autobiography, published in 2014, Wenn das Leben foul spielt, Legat attributes his own outbursts of violence to years of sexual abuse as well as brutal and humiliating attacks by his often- drunk father to both him and the rest of the family during his childhood.

The abbey was located at Glenstrup near Randers, Denmark. HistoryBenedictine monks= Glenstrup Abbey, dedicated to the Virgin Mary, was founded about 1125 on Glenstrup Lake, near the town of Hobro, as a Benedictine monastery. The nobleman Svend Bo and his wife Inger Thott gave property and several farms to support it in the mid-12th century. In some records it was nicknamed \\"N√∏rre Abbey\\". It was built on the site of a holy spring called Maria's Spring in medieval times. The location was a religious one in Viking times and the abbey was most likely constructed on the site of a stave chapel built to Christianize the place in the late 11th century. The monastery was built in the traditional three ranges attached to a church as a four-sided enclosure. The massive Romanesque tower was an unusual feature on the west front of the abbey church. Few records about the abbey survive. It is mentioned in a papal bull of the mid-13th century, probably issued by Pope Alexander III. At its height the abbey owned many farms, two mills, and several churches from which it collected tithes. It also owned the permanent rights to fish eels from the lake, where it built a permanent eel trap. It also had the rights to income from the fair or market held on Lady Day, which was held in nearby fields as late as 1552. The abbey however eventually entered a long slow decline which culminated in its closure in 1431. Although records are sparse, this was apparently caused by a combination of lack of revenue and declining religious standards which meant that there were no novices. Ulrik, Bishop of Aarhus, decided that the house had become unruly and that to maintain it would cost the diocese more than it brought in; the last Benedictine monks were therefore removed, and an effort made to interest another order in the premises. =Glenstrup Charterhouse= At the suggestion of King Eric of Pomerania, Bishop Ulrik gave the abbey and the income properties from the recently closed priory of Our Lady in Randers to the Carthusian Order for the establishment of a new charterhouse in the Diocese of Aarhus in 1429. The Carthusians settled briefly at the vacant Glenstrup Abbey, creating Glenstrup Charterhouse, but abandoned the site by 1441. =Benedictine monks= Bishop Ulrik then tried to re-establish a Benedictine community, but the attempt was short-lived, and the Benedictines left Glenstrup for the last time before 1445. =Bridgettine nuns= Bishop Ulrik then gave the abbey and its attendant properties to the newly established Bridgettine Mariager Abbey. The Bridgettines were seen in the mid-15th century as a reforming order capable of restoring the religious zeal that many religious houses had lost and re-establishing the strict standards which by this time many had abandoned. They were however only interested in the estates of Glenstrup, and demolished the abbey premises shortly after 1445, leaving only the church.

Located around six miles south-east of Diss, in 2011 its population (including Athelington) was 144, according to the 2011 census. Redlingfield Priory was found here from 1120 until it was disbanded during the Dissolution of the Monasteries, in which \\"the priory was surrendered on 10 February 1536-7\\". Population From 1851 when it reached its peak population of 251, the parish maintained a relatively constant decline until 1961. Since then, the population has been slowly growing. St Andrew's Church The church \\"serves a small and scattered parish of farms and cottage in the heart of the north Suffolk countryside.\\" The church is Anglo Saxon in origin and is mentioned in the Domesday Book. As is the case with most ancient churches the building has been altered and restored several times. The 'earliest visible craftmanship' dates from the 14th century, the church also served the Redlingfield Priory from 1120 onward, before being returned to the village following the Reformation. One noteworthy feature is that the \\"church is built almost entirely of red brick, an uncommon and striking site for a church of the age, in this area.\\" Employment In 1831, two thirds of the population were described as 'labourers or servants' (with 'Middling Sorts' and Employers & Professionals' combined making up 15 people and 'other' describing 3), 33of the labourers were 'Agricultural Labourers' with the remaining 3 in the category noted as servants. All of the employers were noted as being farmers. The Post Office Directory of 1865 stated 'The land is a rich loam, and is principally the property of Sir Robert Shnfto Adair, who is lord of the manor, but there are a few other landed proprietors, namely, George Barber, Charles Clarke, Thomas Kerry...' Landscape The area lies on a Boulder Clay Plateau, rising up to 56m above sea level. The area is relatively flat and is dominated by arable farming although it features one of suffolk's few collections of ancient woodland. The farmlands are divided by hedgerows heading for \\"stardom\\" due to their diverse array of species and 3 veteran Oaks believed to be boundary markers, indicating the great age of the hedgerow network. Second World War The arrival of the 3,000 U.S. serviceman of 95th Bomb Group's B-17s at station 119 in neighbouring RAF Horham on 15 June 1943 swamped the corner of Suffolk. The airbase sprawled across four parishes including Redlingfield, and is unfortunately most notable for a B-17 Flying Fortress crashing upon take-off into Redlingfield, destroying a farmhouse and killing all ten crew.

Composed in three books, it was written at Ely Abbey on the island of Ely in the fenlands of eastern Cambridgeshire. Ely Abbey became the cathedral of a newly formed bishopric in 1109. Traditionally the author of the anonymous work has been given as Richard or Thomas, two monks at Ely, one of whom, Richard, has been identified with an official of the monastery, but some historians hold that neither Richard nor Thomas was the author. The Liber covers the period from the founding of the abbey in 673 until the middle of the 12th century, building on earlier historical works. It incorporates documents and stories of saints' lives. The work typifies a type of local history produced during the latter part of the 12th century. Similar books were written at other English monasteries. The longest of the contemporary local histories, the Liber chronicles the devastation that the Anarchy caused during the reign of King Stephen. It also documents the career of Nigel, the Bishop of Ely from 1133 to 1169, and his disputes with King Stephen. Other themes include the miracles worked by the monastery's patron saint, √Üthelthryth, and gifts of land to Ely. Two complete manuscripts survive, complemented by partial manuscripts. The Latin text was published in 1962, and an English translation followed in 2005. Extracts had appeared in print earlier. The Liber Eliensis provides an important history of the region and period it covers, and particularly for the abbey and bishopric of Ely. Background and authorship Early 19th-century print of Ely Cathedral, where the Liber Eliensis was produced The Liber Eliensis was written at Ely Abbey, which became Ely Cathedral upon conversion into a bishopric in 1109.Stafford Unification and Conquest p. 20Stafford Unification and Conquest pp. 180‚Äì181 The historian Elisabeth van Houts believes that it was written in two stages: first under Bishop Hervey le Breton, in office from 1109 to 1133; and continued under Bishop Geoffrey Ridel, who served from 1173 to 1189. For van Houts, the first stage was the translation of an Old English work into Latin, commissioned by Bishop Hervey. The rest of the work, van Houts argues, was composed in the 1170s.van Houts \\"Historical Writing\\" Companion to the Anglo- Norman World p. 110 However, E. O. Blake, who edited the first Latin printing of the work, concludes that the Liber was probably composed in three parts, based on its contents; the first book of the Liber was begun after 1131, when one of the sources used in the Liber was completed. The second has a preface apologising for the delay in its completion, and could not have been started before 1154, as it records events from that year. The third and final book was completed between 1169, when Bishop Nigel died and whose death is mentioned in the book, and 1174, when a new bishop was appointed. As there is no mention of Nigel's replacement, Blake states that this suggests that book three was finished before the new bishop took office.Blake \\"Introduction\\" Liber Eliensis pp. xlvi‚Äìxlix Traditionally the work was ascribed to either Thomas or Richard, two monks of Ely mentioned in the text.Fairweather \\"Introduction\\" Liber Eliensis p. xvii The historian Antonia Gransden is inclined to believe that the work is by Richard, who is usually identified with the Richard who was recorded as sub-prior and prior of Ely, holding the latter office from 1177 until some time between 1189 and 1194.Gransden Historical Writing p. 271 Blake thinks that Richard was the author, but he considers the evidence to be inconclusive. Janet Fairweather, a classicist and a recent translator of the Liber, suggests that it may have been written by someone other than the traditional candidates. Whoever the author, the Liber specifically states that it was written at the bidding of some members of the monastic community at Ely.Gransden Historical Writing p. 272 The Liber is one of a number of monastic histories written during the middle and later 12th century, when a number of monasteries in northern and southern England produced works devoted to recording the histories of their religious houses and local areas. In the south, these included the Historia Ecclesie Abbendonensis of Abingdon Abbey, the Chronicon Abbatiae Rameseiensis of Ramsey Abbey, the Chronicon Angliae Petriburgense of Peterborough Abbey, a history of the see of Bath and Wells, and the Chronicon Monasterii de Bello of Battle Abbey. The northern histories record the foundation stories of the various Cistercian houses in the north, along with other information relating to those houses. Those from the south, including the Liber Eliensis, mainly concern themselves with the various controversies involving their respective religious houses. The northern histories are less concerned with controversy, and overall are more prone to hagiography.Gransden Historical Writing pp. 269‚Äì270 Sources To a large extent the work is composite; that is, it is a compilation borrowing from or at least using earlier sources. These include the early medieval writer Bede's Ecclesiastical History of the English People, a chronicle that was associated with Bede's De temporum ratione, the Chronicon ex chronicis, and William of Poitiers' Gesta Guillelmi II ducis Normannorum. Lesser-used sources include the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Orderic Vitalis' Historia Ecclesiastica, Stephen of Ripon's Vita Sancti Wilfrithi, William of Malmesbury's Gesta pontificum Anglorum, a list of the kings of Wessex, the Old English poem The Battle of Maldon, and a number of saints' lives, including some written by Eadmer, Felix, Abbo of Fleury, Goscelin, and Osbern of Canterbury.Blake \\"Introduction\\" Liber Eliensis pp. xxviii‚Äìxxix The work on Maldon was included because the hero of the work was Byrhtnoth, a patron of the monastery.Gransden Historical Writing p. 274 Works more directly related to Ely were also used. The primary one of these works was Bishop √Üthelwold of Winchester's Libellus, large parts of which were copied into the Liber Eliensis.Stafford Unification and Conquest p. 16 Also incorporated into the Liber was an earlier Vita, or saints' life, on √Üthelthryth, the founder and first abbess of Ely.Blake \\"Introduction\\" Liber Eliensis pp. xxx‚Äìxxxi A work on the benefactors of the abbey was also used,Blake \\"Introduction\\" Liber Eliensis p. xxxviii and the material from three surviving cartularies.Blake \\"Introduction\\" Liber Eliensis p. xxxix These documents were translated from their original Old English into Latin by the compiler. Another source, as related in the Liber itself, was a work about Hereward the Wake written by a brother monk known as Richard. Modern historians have identified it with the Gesta Herwardi known from a 13th- century manuscript. It is, however, unclear whether the compiler of the Liber used the exact text of the Gesta as it has come down to us, or a different, earlier manuscript.van Houts \\"Hereward and Flanders\\" Anglo-Saxon England 28 pp. 202‚Äì204 Some of these sources may originally have been oral works. A number of the stories in the narrative parts of the Liber resemble Scandinavian sagas, including the story about King Cnut visiting the monastery and singing an Anglo-Saxon song to the assembled monks. It is possible that the information on Hereward and Byrhtnoth originally came from orally transmitted tales that were written down.Gransden Historical Writing p. 275 Contents A 13th-century representation of left The work is traditionally divided into three books. Along with the history in Book I the first section also contains a prologue and a preface. It discusses the founding of the Abbey of Ely and the background of the foundress, √Üthelthryth. The first book also deals with the history of the abbey and its abbesses until the Danish invasions of the 9th century. A description of the destruction of the abbey by the Danes and of King Edgar's (reigned 959‚Äì975) rule concludes the book.Fairweather (ed.) Liber Eliensis pp. 9‚Äì11 The second book, Book II, begins with the restoration of the abbey during Edgar's reign, under Bishop √Üthelwold. Accounts of the subsequent abbots until the last, Richard, are included in Book II, as well as numerous charters and other documents.Fairweather (ed.) Liber Eliensis pp. 85‚Äì95 The final book, Book III, contains information on the conversion of the abbey to a bishopric, and on the first few bishops; it concludes with a description of the martyrdom of Thomas Becket. Interspersed with the historical narrative are a number of documents and charters relating to the bishops.Fairweather (ed.) Liber Eliensis pp. 286‚Äì296 The work also depicts the devastation that the Anarchy caused during King Stephen's reign. The chronicler states that failure of the harvest and pillaging caused a famine. The work describes the area around the abbey for as being filled with unburied corpses, and that the price of a bushel of grain rose to 200 pence. The long descriptions of Nigel of Ely's disputes with King Stephen lead to a discussion of the Battle of Lincoln and other matters not directly related to Ely. The Liber gives a detailed account of Nigel's career, although in general the chronicle's author favours Stephen over his own bishop. The ascension of King Henry II to the English throne is considered to be an excellent event, and the Liber praises the new king.Gransden Historical Writing pp. 280‚Äì281 An important part of the work was devoted to the miracles and glorification of Ely's patroness, Saint √Üthelthryth. The very beginning of the work incorporates an earlier Vita, or Life, of √Üthelthryth, which resembles the Vitae of other saints written by Goscelin in the 11th century; Goscelin is known to have visited Ely.Gransden Historical Writing p. 282 The work may have helped to increase the number of pilgrims visiting Ely, as well as enabling the monks to better explain the history of earlier donations to the abbey. Many of the gifts to the abbey church are described, such as the altar cloth donated by Queen Emma (died 1052), wife of both King √Üthelred II (died 1016) and King Cnut (died 1035), with a short history of the circumstances of the gift.Gransden Historical Writing pp. 284‚Äì285 The miracle stories frequently say that those who wished cures or miracles similar to those in the Liber would need to come to the monastery, where they could make a donation.Paxton \\"Textual Communities\\" Anglo-Norman Studies XXVI p. 124 The historian Jennifer Paxton argues that increasing pilgrimage to the monastery was one of the main goals of the compilers of the Liber.Paxton \\"Textual Communities\\" Anglo-Norman Studies XXVI p. 128 Another concern of the chronicle was the acquisition of land by the abbey. The work incorporates three pre- existing inventories of the abbey's possessions, and records each gift to the abbey, giving the grantor and occasionally details of the grantor's life. This detailed record of the various rights and possessions of the abbey was useful if those possessions needed to be defended against outside or inside conflicts. The Liber was used by the monks to defend their claims to be the real heirs of the abbey's rights and property rather than the bishops, after the conversion of the abbey into a bishopric. The chronicle also records the division of property between the monks and the newly appointed bishop. According to the chronicler, the division took place during the episcopate of the first bishop, Hervey le Breton, and was characterised as barely adequate for the needs of the monks. Later the chronicle records documents from the bishops that defined the separation between the monks and the episcopate.Gransden Historical Writing pp. 283‚Äì284 The chronicle also records the conflict between the abbey and various Bishops of Lincoln, which had continued until the abbey became a bishopric in 1109.Gransden Historical Writing p. 286 A third theme of the work is the stress on the importance and number of distinguished burials that took place at Ely. They would have increased the desire of others to be buried there, which would have benefited the community by the donations that would have flowed from those wishing to secure their burial. The Liber stresses the burials of √Üthelstan, a Bishop of Elmham, that of √Ülfwine, another Bishop of Elmham, and Wulfstan II, an Archbishop of York.Paxton \\"Textual Communities\\" Anglo-Norman Studies XXVI pp. 132‚Äì134 Influence The medieval chronicler, Matthew Paris, shown here in a 13th-century manuscript depiction of his deathbed, used the Liber as a source for his works. The Liber was familiar to the 13th-century chronicler Matthew Paris, who used it along with the Chronicon Abbatiae Rameseiensis of Ramsey Abbey in his own historical works. Another 13th-century English writer, Roger of Wendover, was also aware of the Liber.Gransden Historical Writing p. 374 and footnote 147 Some of the information contained in the Liber is important to historians. It is in the Liber that the first statement that √Üthelwold translated the Benedictine Rule into Old English is made.Gneuss \\"Origin of Standard Old English\\" Anglo-Saxon England 1 pp. 73‚Äì74 and footnote 3 The Liber is the longest of the local histories produced in England during the 12th century, and it contains a description of the royal chancery, which might be the earliest evidence for the existence of that office in the Anglo-Saxon kingdom. The Liber describes how King Edgar (died 975) granted the abbey the office of chancellor (head of the chancery), but the authenticity of the passage is unclear.Gransden Historical Writing p. 276 The existence of a formal chancery office in Anglo-Saxon England before the Norman Conquest is a matter of some debate amongst historians.Rankin \\"Chancery, Royal\\" Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Anglo-Saxon England The historian Dorothy Whitelock says of the work that it is \\"unique among post-Conquest monastic histories\\".Quoted in Royal Historical Society Texts and Calendars II p. 90 It was written to help buttress the claims of Ely to a judicial liberty, or the exercise of all the royal rights within a hundred.Warren Governance pp. 46‚Äì47 To do this, the Liber collected together earlier sources used to help the abbey evade episcopal control, prior to the abbey becoming a bishopric. These documents may have been forged or had their contents doctored to help the abbey's cause. Because of the tendentious nature of the collection, the work is used by historians with great caution.Blake \\"Introduction\\" Liber Eliensis pp. xlix‚Äìl Despite the untrustworthy nature of the Liber and the documents preserved therein, it remains a valuable source for the history of the time period it covers, as well as the internal history of the abbey and bishopric.Blake \\"Introduction\\" Liber Eliensis pp. liii‚Äìliv The historian Antonia Gransden characterises the Liber as \\"valuable for general history\\", but qualifies by saying that \\"the whole lacks unity and has errors and confusing repetitions\\".Gransden Historical Writing p. 270 Manuscripts The work survives in two complete manuscripts (MS), that of Trinity College, Cambridge MS O.2.1, usually known as the E manuscript; and one in the possession of Ely Cathedral Chapter, usually known as the F manuscript. The E manuscript dates from the late 12th century, and shows three different scribal hands. The F manuscript dates to the early 13th century, with four scribal hands.Blake \\"Introduction\\" Liber Eliensis pp. xxiii‚Äìxxiv The E manuscript was given to Trinity College as part of the Gale Collection by Roger Gale in 1738.Staff \\"Liber Eliensis\\" Trinity Library Catalogue The F manuscript has remained at Ely since its creation, and is the only manuscript at Ely still remaining from the medieval monastic library.Owen Library and Muniments of Ely Cathedral p. 4 As well as the two complete manuscripts, a number of other manuscripts contain parts of the whole work. British Library MS Cotton Titus A.i, usually known as the G manuscript, has part of Book II, and dates from the late 12th or early 13th century. British Library MS Cotton Domitian A.xv, known as the B manuscript, dates from the late 13th or early 14th century and includes some other material along with Book I and the same parts of Book II as in manuscript G. Another Cottonian manuscript, British Library MS Cotton Vespasian A.xix, has parts of Book III, and dates to between 1257 and 1286.Blake \\"Introduction\\" Liber Eliensis p. xxv This manuscript is usually known as the A manuscript.Fairweather \\"Introduction\\" Liber Eliensis p. xxv The relationship between the various extant manuscripts is complex, and a definitive scheme of how the various manuscripts relate to each other cannot be made.Blake \\"Introduction\\" Liber Eliensis p. xlii Blake, in his edition of the Liber, suggests that Book I once existed as a stand-alone work, which influenced the B manuscript. A separate Book II, with parts of Book III, was then written and combined with the stand-alone Book I, into either manuscript E or an earlier version of that manuscript. Book II was then revised, combined with parts of G, Book I, and parts of E to make manuscript F.Blake \\"Introduction\\" Liber Eliensis p. xlvi Related manuscripts include Bodleian Library Oxford MS Laud 647, known as the O manuscript. This is based on the Liber, but reorganised into a listing of the acts of the various abbots and bishops and dates from the 14th century. Blake, in his edition of the Liber, calls that and related works the Chronicon Abbatum et Episcoporum Eliensium.Blake \\"Introduction\\" Liber Eliensis pp. xxv‚Äìxxvi Another related work is contained in Trinity College, Cambridge MS O.2.41, which contains the Libellus of √Üthelwold and an Ely cartulary.

During the period 1940 to 1945, Clark served two tours of active duty in the Army with preceding and intervening private consulting work related to military supply and logistics. Clark was involved in supply and ordnance matters during the North African campaign and served as Dwight D. Eisenhower's Deputy G-4 (assistant chief of staff for logistics) at SHAEF (Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force). After the war, Clark returned to private consulting work but continued to serve Eisenhower. In the late 1940s, in conjunction with a small group of liberal Republicans, including Russell Davenport and Senator James Duff, Clark worked for Eisenhower's presidential candidacy. As part of this planning group, Clark shuttled back and forth between the U.S. and Europe to ensure the secrecy of discussions with Eisenhower. The material documents Eisenhower's early interest in the presidency and a 1951 meeting between Taft and Eisenhower. Documentation includes correspondence and Clark's memoir. In 1949, Clark undertook a second project for Eisenhower when asked to consider a means of assisting the financially distressed American Military Institute. Discussions resulted in a plan to reorganize the Institute under the auspices of Columbia University and broaden its scope to include the study of war and peace. Eventually Columbia established a separate Institute of War and Peace Studies, leaving the American Military Institute to secure other funding arrangements. There is extensive documentation of Clark's efforts to establish the Institute of War and Peace Studies. He remained in contact with the Institute until the mid-1950s. In 1951, Clark became involved in a third Eisenhower project, Jo Davidson's bust of Eisenhower. Through Clark's efforts, a bust was placed at the U.S. Military Academy in 1953. A year later a second bust was placed at the Royal Military College at Sandhurst. Then in 1980, Clark became involved in a controversy over the illegal reproduction of the bust. Last, Clark served Eisenhower in the latter stages of the 1952 campaign by submitting a memorandum on U.S. Pacific policy, which he later elaborated to include mutual security matters. The documentation consists of the memorandum and a small quantity of related material. In 1949, Clark became involved in the Institute for Creative Research, a public policy group organized by Russell Davenport. In 1953, Clark's consulting firm undertook an economic survey of the Dominican Republic. This study was completed in 1954 and submitted to Eisenhower in February 1955. Last, in 1958 Clark joined a group of businessmen and scientists promoting the establishment of the International Institute for Scientific Research and the European Research Institute. This led to a memorandum, ‚ÄúPlan for Scientific Cooperation in the Free World‚Äù, which Clark sent to Eisenhower in April 1959. Eisenhower's science adviser, however, reviewed the proposal unfavorably. During the 1960s, Clark developed serious medical problems that necessitated giving up his consulting work and in part explains the dearth of documentation from this decade. In the early 1970s, after regaining his health, Clark embarked upon a project to bring together documentation of the various important events of his career. He referred to the project as his curriculum vitae. The main facet of the project was the writing of his memoirs, but in preparing for the task he submerged himself in histories of the period, collected and organized primary documentation, and contacted people he had worked with in the course of his career. Some of the contacts led to meetings between Clark and his former associates for the purpose of compiling commentaries on their shared experiences. ReferencesExternal links *Papers of Edwin N.

Medici Fountain in the Jardin du Luxembourg, Paris. The Gardens of the French Renaissance is a garden style, initially inspired by the Italian Renaissance garden, which evolved later into the grander and more formal jardin √† la fran√ßaise during the reign of Louis XIV, by the middle of the 17th century. In 1495, King Charles VIII and his nobles brought the Renaissance style back to France after their war campaign in Italy.Claude Wenzler, Architecture du jardin, pg. 12 They reached their peak in the gardens of the royal Ch√¢teau de Fontainebleau, Ch√¢teau d'Amboise, Ch√¢teau de Blois, and Ch√¢teau de Chenonceau. French Renaissance gardens were characterized by symmetrical and geometric planting beds or parterres, plants in pots, paths of gravel and sand, terraces, stairways and ramps, moving water in the form of canals, cascades and monumental fountains, and extensive use of artificial grottoes, labyrinths, and statues of mythological figures. They became an extension of the ch√¢teaux that they surrounded, and were designed to illustrate the Renaissance ideals of measure and proportion, and to remind viewers of the virtues of Ancient Rome.Claude Wenzer, pg. 13  History Italian influence= Ch√¢teau de Vallery, about 1570. In the 13th century, the Italian landscape architect Pietro de' Crescenzi wrote a treatise called Opus Ruralium Commodium, which laid out a formal plan for gardens, ornamented with topiary sculptures, trees and bushes trimmed into architectural shapes, following a tradition begun by the Romans. King Charles V of France ordered a French translation in 1373, and the new Italian style began to appear in France.Claude Wenzler, pg. 12 Another influential writer was Leon Battista Alberti (1404‚Äì1472), who in 1450 wrote a tract, De re aedificatoria for Lorenzo de' Medici. Alberti used the geometric principles of Vitruvius to design building fa√ßades and gardens. He suggested that the house should look over the garden, and that the garden should have \\"porticos for giving shade, cradles where vines grow on columns of marble, and there should be vases and even amusing statues, provided that they are not obscene.\\" quoted in Philippe Prevot, Histoire des Jardins, pg. 69 In his design of the gardens of the Cortile del Belvedere in Rome, the architect Bramante (1444‚Äì1544) introduced the idea of perspective, using a long axis perpendicular to the palace, along which he placed parterres and fountains.Prevot, Histoire des jardins, pg. 70 This became a central feature of Renaissance gardens. A popular novel by the monk Francesco Colonna, published in Venice in 1499, called The Dream of Poliphile, an allegorical journey by a traveller, Poliphile, to fantastic lands in search of his love, Polia, had an enormous influence upon gardens of the time. The ideas of a \\"garden-island\\" in a lake, such as the one in the Boboli Gardens in Florence, of statues of giants coming out of earth in the park of the Villa di Pratolino, and the theme of labyrinth were all taken from the imaginary voyages of Poliphile.Prevot, Histoire des jardins, pg. 70. All these elements were to appear in French Renaissance gardens. =The birthplace of Renaissance gardens in France: Ch√¢teau-Gaillard (Amboise)= In 1495, Charles VIII invaded the kingdom of Naples, and he saw the luxury of the palaces and gardens in Italy. When he returned to France in 1496, he convinced and brought back with him 22 Italian artists, including a monk and master gardener from Naples named Pacello da Mercogliano. They decided to reproduce in Amboise the marvels of Tuscany and elected a 15 hectares amphitheater- shaped land in the heart of the city to realize the King's dream of Poggioreale.Jean VASSORT, 'L'Art des Jardins de France, pg. 70 Charles VIII ordered the construction of Ch√¢teau-Gaillard and Pacello chose this royal domain to introduce and acclimatize the first orange trees in France. He created lawns, floral beds and settings for his \\"Arte del Verde\\" and successfully introduced Italian style gardens for the very first time in France. He used Ch√¢teau-Gaillard as an experimental laboratory for his innovations: he created a new variety of plum called \\"Queen Claude\\", and used very specific techniques such as half barrels as tree planter boxes. The gardens of Ch√¢teau-Gaillard stand as the \\"missing link\\" between medieval monastic gardens and future French formal gardens.

At the beginning of the 16th century, King Francis I, who had also visited Italy and had met Leonardo da Vinci, built gardens in the new style on three terraces of different levels bordered by the old walls of his Ch√¢teau de Blois. Besides the parterres of flowers, the gardens produced a wide variety of vegetables and fruits, including orange and lemon trees in boxes, which were taken indoors in winter. The building that sheltered them, still standing, was the first orangerie in France. The gardens were on the site of the present-day Place Victor-Hugo and the site of the railways station. The last vestiges of the garden were destroyed in 1890 by the construction of the Avenue Victor- Hugo. Map of Amboise in 1600 At about the same time, Pacello da Mercogliano designed gardens for the Ch√¢teau de Gaillon owned by Cardinal Georges d'Amboise, a Minister of King Henry IV, who had also spent time in Italy. The gardens, built on different levels below the old medieval ch√¢teau, were planted in parterres of flowers and fruit trees. The parterre at the entrance of the garden featured the coat of arms of France in flowers. Bushes were trimmed into the shapes of men on horseback, ships, and birds. It was also decorated with imposing fountains of marble.Wenzler, Architecture du jardin pg. 14 Ch√¢teau of Bury The gardens of the Ch√¢teau de Bury were built between 1511 and 1524 by Florimont Robertet, a Secretary of State for both Louis XII and Francis I. Robertet had visited the Villa Medici in Fiesole and wanted to reproduce the terraced gardens he saw there. The ch√¢teau, departing from the traditional design, was integrated closely with its gardens. Visitors passed through a square garden inside the castle and out into two geometric gardens behind the ch√¢teau, decorated with fountains and surrounded by a wooden gallery. The axis went from the entrance to the chapel, at the far end of the garden. Like Italian Renaissance gardens, the gardens of Bury were located on the edge of a hill, with a fine view of the forest of Blois.Wenzler, Architecture du jardin, pg. 14 In the centre of the court of the ch√¢teau, Robertet placed a bronze copy of Michelangelo's David, which had been given to him by the Republic of Florence.Prevot, Histoire des jardins, pg. 106 =Gardens of Fontainebleau= Fountain of Diana, in the gardens of the Ch√¢teau de Fontainebleau. The Gardens of the Ch√¢teau de Fontainebleau, located in a forest which had been the hunting preserve of the Capetian Kings of France, were created by Francis I beginning in 1528. The garden featured fountains, parterres, a forest of pine trees brought from Provence and the first artificial grotto in France in 1541. Catherine de' Medici ordered copies in bronze of the statues which decorated the Cortile del Belvedere in Rome. A statue of Hercules in repose by Michelangelo decorated the garden of the lake. In 1594 Henry IV added a small island in the lake connected to the court of fountains by a bridge.Philippe Prevot, Histoire des jardins, pg. 107-08 =The Gardens of Chenonceau= View of the Catherine de' Medici's garden at Ch√¢teau de Chenonceau The Ch√¢teau de Chenonceau had two separate gardens: the first created in 1551 for Diane de Poitiers, the favorite of King Henry II, with a large parterre and a jet d'eau (jet of water), and a second, smaller garden created for Catherine de' Medici in 1560, on a terrace raised above the river Cher, divided into compartments, with a basin in the centre. =Gardens of Saint-Germaine-en-Laye= The gardens of the Ch√¢teau de Saint-Germain-en-Laye marked the beginning of the transition to a new style, which would be called the Garden √† la fran√ßaise. The garden was laid out in 1595 by royal gardener Charles Mollet for Henry IV.

Trained as a lathe-operator M√ºller later became an industrial unionist and organizer of mass-strikes against World War I. In 1918 he was a leading figure of the council movement in the German Revolution. In the 1920s he wrote a three-volume history of the German Revolution. Passport Nr. 1 for Emil Barth, member of the Berlin Executive Council (highest-ranking worker¬¥s council in the German Revolution); with signatures from Richard M√ºller and Brutus Molkenbuhr Early life Born in a small village called Weira in the Grand Duchy of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, in what today is the German state of Thuringia, M√ºller left home and started working in the metal-industry after his father died in 1896. He became a lathe operator and around 1906 a member of the Deutscher Metallarbeiter-Verband (DMV), the German metalworkers union. Around the same time he became a member of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands - SPD) which by then was the biggest socialist party in Europe.Ralf Hoffrogge, Richard M√ºller - Der Mann hinter der Novemberrevolution, Berlin 2008, pp. 15-25. World War I and the Anti-War Movement In 1914 M√ºller was chairman of the agitational commission of the Berlin branch of the Metalworkers Union. M√ºller represented around 9,000 lathe-operators in the city of Berlin. When the First World War started, the social-democrats and the union leaders decided to collaborate with the imperial government and to support the war-movement. The lathe-operators, however maintained a left wing viewpoint and criticized this nationalist turn of the socialist and trade union movement and started wildcat strikes. From 1916 to 1918, these strikes became a mass-movement which substantially challenged the political support for the world-war. M√ºller, as the head of an organization called the \\"Revolutionary Stewards\\", was the leading figure behind these mass-strikes.See: Ralf Hoffrogge, From Unionism to Workers‚Äô Councils - The Revolutionary Shop Stewards in Germany 1914‚Äì1918, in: Dario Azzellini, Immanuel Ness (Hg): Ours to Master and to Own: Worker¬¥s Control from the Commune to the Present, Chicago 2011 M√ºller was arrested and drafted into the military three times, but he always managed to find a way out and return his political work. After the January-Strike in 1918 a big wave of repression hit the anti-war-movement. M√ºller and his circle decided to plan an armed uprising within the next months. Preparations began quite slowly, but gained speed in the fall of 1918, when the military catastrophe for Germany became more and more obvious to the public. M√ºller and the shop-stewards started secret conferences that involved Karl Liebknecht and his spartacist league but also some representatives of the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany (USPD) who had split from SPD because they opposed the war. Liebknecht in these meetings pushed for action, but M√ºller and his comrades had a more pragmatic way of organizing things. In order to secure the success of the revolution, they wanted to avoid premature actions at all costs.Richard M√ºller, Vom Kaiserreich zur Republik, volume I, Vienna 1924; see also: Chaja Boebel/Lothar Wentzel (Hg.): Streiken gegen den Krieg - Die Bedeutung der Massenstreiks in der Metallindustrie vom Januar 1918, Hamburg 2008 German Revolution Although the Berlin Coalition of M√ºller's revolutionary stewards, the spartacists and the USPD was the best-prepared group, the Revolution itself started spontaneously as a mutiny within the German war-fleet. When news about these events came to Berlin, the revolutionaries sped up their preparations and called for action on 9 November. The shop-stewards, who were the only leftist group with a widespread network in the factories, called for a general strike and armed demonstrations formed to enter the city center. First Congress of the Worker¬¥s and Soldier¬¥s Councils of Germany, December 1918 - opening speech by Richard M√ºller The revolutionaries took Berlin by surprise, almost no resistance was put against their actions. One day after the revolution, M√ºller became chairman of the \\"Executive Council of Workers' and Soldiers' Councils\\" (Vollzugsrat). By then this was the highest organ of the newly declared \\"Socialist republic of Germany\\", so that in theory M√ºller was head of state. But in fact power concentrated within the \\"Council of People's Representatives\\" (Rat der Volksbeauftragten), a revolutionary government dominated by Friedrich Ebert, leader of the Social Democrats. M√ºller and the more radical forces in the executive council lost power very quickly. They had to hand over executive powers to the Council of People's Representatives only two weeks after the revolution, and in the summer of 1919 Vollzugsrat was shut down by force after several strikes calling for socialization of core-industries were turned down as well. These strikes in the spring of 1919 were the biggest mass-mobilisation of the German council movement in which M√ºller was a leading figure. Together with his friend Ernst D√§umig he wrote a very influential conception how council-communism could work in practise. By then, the periodical \\"The Workers-Council\\" (Der Arbeiter-Rat), was the theoretical organ of the council movement and M√ºller was one of its main authors. During the strike Movement in March 1919 Richard M√ºller was strike-leader for the larger Berlin area and tried to build a united front of all working class parties, but failed.Ralf Hoffrogge, Richard M√ºller - Der Mann hinter der Novemberrevolution, Berlin 2008, pp. 90-144. Communist Party When the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) was founded by Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg on New Year's Eve of 1918, they tried to integrate M√ºller and the revolutionary stewards because of their credibility among workers and their widespread network within the factories. Although M√ºller was part of the socialist left and sympathizing with Liebknecht, he and his group decided not to join the party. The reason was its intention to boycott the upcoming elections for the national assembly and to leave the major unions in order to form their own communist union movement. After the KPD turned away from this ultra-left and more or less sectarian political course, M√ºller and many of his former comrades joined the party in October 1920. By then, the USPD had split and the left majority altogether had found its way to Communism. By then the council movement was already dead and political parties once again were the main organisation of the socialist movement. Within the KPD, M√ºller became Leader of the \\"Reichsgewerkschaftszentrale\\", the KPD's central on union affairs. M√ºller was responsible for the communist agitation and politics within the German unions. He lost this job in March 1921 when he criticised a failed communist uprising in Thuringia. In his views the action was premature and caused by police provocation. But the KPD central committee did not like independent critics within the party and tried to get rid of M√ºller. Due to an Intervention of Lenin and Trotsky on the Third World-Congress of the Communist International they had to accept the re-integration of M√ºller and other critics into the KPD. But when fights within the party started over again later, M√ºller and his faction lost support from Moscow and left the party.Ralf Hoffrogge, Richard M√ºller - Der Mann hinter der Novemberrevolution, Berlin 2008, pp. 144-170. Historian After he was forced out of the communist movement, M√ºller wrote an extensive history of the German Revolution. The first volume \\"Vom Kaiserreich zur Republik\\" (From Empire to republic) was published in 1924. A year later two other volumes followed: \\"Die Novemberrevolution\\" (The November- Revolution) and \\"B√ºrgerkrieg in Deutschland\\" (Civil War in Germany). M√ºller's writings were the only contemporary Marxist history of the German Revolution. In addition, they presented a unique collection of sources that M√ºller had collected during his political career. But in the academia, M√ºller's conclusions were mostly ignored because of his Marxist point of view. This is a paradox because M√ºller's works were widely used as a source in almost every standard account of the historical events, since M√ºller gave the most detailed inside-view on the revolutionary movement. Prominent examples are the works of Arthur Rosenberg and Sebastian Haffner, two German historians who not only used M√ºller as a source but also discussed his conclusions. M√ºller's writings were re-discovered in the 1960s by the German student movement and had a strong influence on its view on the German Revolution.For further information see the preface written by Frank Dingel for the 1974 reprint of M√ºllers first book \\"Vom Kaiserreich zur Republik\\". Retreat to private life By the end of the 1920s M√ºller was an active member of the \\"Deutscher Industrieverband\\" (DIV), a small communist but anti-Stalinist union without party affiliation. Little is known about his activity there and M√ºller left the Organisation around 1929. Afterwards he became an entrepreneur in real estate. Originally, he wanted to become a publisher and founded a company called \\"Phoebus\\" in order to promote his third book. But after some time, the firm changed its field of operation and went into construction works. Phoebus built state- subsidized homes for working-class families and Richard M√ºller acted very successfully as director of the enterprise. By 1930 he had become a millionaire; some time later he left the business and retired. Little is known about his late years; he did not seem to be active in any kind of anti-fascist action, at least nothing like this is documented. M√ºller died on 11 May 1943 in Berlin.Ralf Hoffrogge, Richard M√ºller - Der Mann hinter der Novemberrevolution, Berlin 2008, pp. 1198-215.

She was the wife of the German composer Johann Samuel Schroeter, and later, during her years of widowhood, a love interest of Joseph Haydn. Early life and marriage She was born in 1751 (baptized 13 May) to Robert Scott, a wealthy Scottish businessman living in London, and his wife Elizabeth. Her father died in 1771, leaving Rebecca an annuity and the future sum of 15,000 pounds, contingent on her marrying with the approval of the executors of the will.Source for this paragraph: Scull (1997) Some time in or before 1775, the family engaged the composer and pianist Johann Schroeter, an immigrant from Germany, as Rebecca's music teacher. By 1775, Johann and Rebecca had fallen in love, and sought to be married‚Äîmuch against the family's wishes. (Their objection hinged on matters of social class: they felt that Schroeter, a mere musical trademan, was not high enough on the social scale for the daughter of a wealthy family.) The marriage eventually did proceed (17 July 1775), but only with great difficulties. The family tried to get Schroeter to abandon the marriage by offering him the sum of ¬£500, and they also attempted to deprive Rebecca of her ¬£15,000 inheritance (it is not known whether the attempt succeeded.) The marriage produced no children of which any record has survived. Schroeter continued his musical career but fell into poor health (perhaps, some said at the time, from excessive alcohol consumption). He died either on 1 or 2 November 1788. Mrs. Schroeter continued to live in comfort at No. 6 James Street, Buckingham Gate, where she and her husband had moved in 1786.Source for this paragraph: Scull 1997 Relationship with Haydn Joseph Haydn, probably the most celebrated composer in Europe in his lifetime, traveled to England during 1791-1792 and 1794-1795, where he led highly successful concerts and composed a number of his best known works, including his last twelve symphonies. He resided in London for most of his stay. On 29 June 1791, Rebecca Schroeter wrote Haydn a letter, inviting him to give her a music lesson: :Mrs. Schroeter presents her compliments to Mr. Haydn, and informs him, she is just returned to town, and will be very happy to see him whenever it is convenient for him to give her a lesson. James str. Buckingham Gate. Wednesday, June 29th 1791.Source: Robbins Landon (1976) Haydn accepted the invitation. This is the first of 22 letters from Mrs. Schroeter to Haydn, which are preserved not in the originals, but in copies made by Haydn in his so-called \\"second London notebook\\". The letters indicate that, just like 16 years earlier, Mrs. Schroeter fell in love with her music teacher. These feelings were evidently reciprocated. Biographer Albert Christoph Dies, who interviewed Haydn in his old age, wrote the following in his 1810 book about Haydn: :I opened up [one of the London notebooks] and found a couple of dozen letters in the English language. Haydn smiled and said: \\"Letters from an English widow in London, who loved me; but she was, though already 60 years old, still a beautiful and charming woman and I would have married her very easily if I had been free at the time.\\" :This woman is the widow, still living, of the famous pianist Schr√∂ter, whose melodious song Haydn emphatically praised... if he was not invited elsewhere, he usually dined with her.Translation from Robbins Landon 1976, 87 Dies probably garbled the story; in fact it was Haydn who was about 60 at the time; Mrs. Schroeter was only 40.Thus Hughes (1903) wrote, \\"to me it occurs as a possibility that Haydn said to Dies, not \\"though she was sixty years old\\" but \\"though I was sixty years old.\\" In saying that he was not \\"free at the time\\", Haydn meant that he was married. His marriage to Maria Anna Keller in 1760 was apparently a disaster for both parties, and as divorce does not exist in the Catholic Church, Haydn, as a Catholic, had to continue the marriage. Haydn was also in the breakup phase of a long-term relationship with the singer Luigia Polzelli, whom he had not brought to London with him. =Schroeter's letters to Haydn= The Schroeter letters express an ardent affection and are often very solicitous of Haydn's welfare. 7 March 1792: :My D[ear]: I was extremely sorry to part with you so suddenly last Night, our conversation was particularly interesting and I had [a] thousand things to say to you, my heart WAS and is full of TENDERNESS for you, but no language can express HALF the LOVE and AFFECTION I feel for you, you are DEARER to me EVERY DAY of my life. ... Oh how earnes[t]ly [I] wish to see you, I hope you will come to me tomorrow. I shall be happy to see you both in the Morning and the Evening. God Bless you my love, my thoughts and best wishes ever accompany you, and I always am with the most sincere and invariable Regard my D: : :My Dearest I cannot be happy :till I see you if you know, :do, tell me, when you will come.Robbins Landon 1976, 143 19 April 1792: :M[y]: D[ear]: I was extremely sorry to hear this morning that you were indisposed, I am told you was five hours at your Study's yesterday,Robbins Landon (1976) notes that Haydn was working \\"frantically\\" to complete the Symphony #97 in time for a concert. indeed MY D[ear]: L[ove]: I am afraid it will hurt you why should you who have already produced so many WONDERFUL and CHARMING compositions, still fatigue yourself with such close application.Robbins Landon 1976, 157 Mrs. Schroeter was also very supportive of Haydn's career, telling him often how much she appreciated his music. In the letter of 1 June 1792, biographers have attempted to restore a wording which in the notebook copy was first double-underlined, then heavily crossed out, presumably by Haydn himself. The passage begins: :I hope to see you my D _r_ L ~~e~~ on Tuesday as usual to Dinner xxxx The \\"xxxx\\" indicates the obliterated passage, which is a few words long. A few tails and extenders are visible below and above the obliteration. Inspecting these, H. C. Robbins Landon (1959, 283) and Bartha (1965, 522) read this as \\"and all (?night ?p.m.) with me,\\"; Scull (1997), citing additional evidence concerning Haydn's handwriting, prefers the reading \\"and sleep with me\\". The passage is (with minor exceptions) the only one which Haydn either double-underlined or obliterated. Konrad Wolf (1958), examining the letters, notes that they were written with circumspection: \\"She had been careful ... when writing them, for although she is very free with glowing affirmations of love, she never leaves any clues to her activities, circumstances, acquaintance circles, etc. that could identify her to anyone but the recipient.\\" Robbins Landon adds: \\"It is surprising that a love affair of these proportions, between the famous Haydn and a lady of London society, managed to escape the gossip hounds of the day; it must have been conducted very discreetly indeed.\\"Robbins Landon (1959, XXV) Both Wolf and Robbins Landon suggest that the reason Haydn made copies of the letters was that Mrs. Schroeter had at some point asked him to return them to her. =After 1792= There are no letters following Haydn's departure from England in 1792. On his return in 1794, he rented lodgings at 1 Bury Street, about 10 minutes' walk from Mrs. Schroeter's residence,Hughes (1950, 88) and biographersFor example, Hughes (1950), Robbins Landon (1959, 1976), Geiringer (1982, 143) conjecture that he continued his relationship with her.Under the assumption that Mrs. Schroeter continued her habit of writing to Haydn, there are various possibilities for why no letters survive. Haydn may not have copied the letters, or he may have copied them into one of the London notebooks that later was lost; see Robbins Landon (1959, XXV) The two never saw each other again after 1795, when Haydn departed permanently for his home in Austria. It seems clear, however, that they parted as friends. Shortly before leaving England for the last time in 1795, Haydn wrote a set of three piano trios (Hob.XV:24, XV:25 and XV:26), considered today by critics as outstanding,Scull calls them \\"three great piano trios\\"; Rosen (1997) also writes very admiringly of them. Rosen characterizes #25, the \\"Gypsy Rondo\\" trio, as a thoughtful gift to an amateur pianist--as he judges, it sounds harder to play than it really is. and dedicated them to Mrs. Schroeter. In 1796, she helped Haydn with a business matter, signing (as a witness) a large- scale contract between Haydn and Frederick Augustus Hyde, a music publisher.Larsen (1976) In 1800, when the self-published edition of Haydn's famous oratorio The Creation appeared, Mrs. Schroeter's name was on the list of subscribers.Geiringer (1983, 143-144) This is the last recorded contact, but the fact that Dies knew that Mrs. Schroeter was \\"still living\\" when he wrote his 1810 biography (see above) suggests that communication between Mrs. Schroeter and Haydn may have continued after 1800. Later life Mrs. Schroeter moved from the James Street house in either 1800 or 1801, was recorded as living in 11 Gloucester Place, Camden Town (part of London) in 1821, and died there at the age of 74 in 1826 (date unknown; burial 7 April).

The firm is known for its 1982 investment in Gibson Greetings as well as for its involvement in seeding other notable private equity firms in the 1990s including Vestar Capital Partners and Catterton Partners. The firm was based in New York City. History Wesray was formed in September 1981 by William E. Simon, Ray Chambers, and Frank E. Walsh, Jr. The new partners, who had met earlier that year, named their new business for themselves; with the exception of Walsh. The \\"WES\\" in the firm's name represented Simon's initials and \\"RAY\\" was for Chambers' first name.Worthy, Ford S. \\"WES THREATENS TO PULL OUT OF WESRAY\\", Fortune (magazine), July 21, 1986.

Before forming Wesray, they had collaborated in the acquisition of a few small companies, including Tactec Systems, the mobile communications division of RCA; Long Island Oyster Farms; and Mobile Music Man, a business that specialized in the rental of school musical instruments. In January 1982, Simon, Chambers, and a group of other investors acquired Gibson Greetings, a producer of greeting cards. The purchase price for Gibson was $80 million, of which only $1 million was rumored to have been contributed by the investors ($330,000 each). By mid-1983, just sixteen months after the original deal, Gibson completed a $290 million IPO and both Simon and Chambers made approximately $70 million each.Taylor, Alexander L. \\"Buyout Binge\\".

About a year after the Gibson Greetings purchase, Wesray acquired Heekin Can from Sir James Goldsmith through a complex leveraged buyout transaction in which almost all of the purchase price of the company was obtained through Heekin's own cash reserves, loans and credit lines against Heekin's assets, and a sale-and- leaseback arrangement for Heekin's facilities.Heekin Can Inc., International Directory of Company Histories, Vol. 13.

Pages 225-231. while the International Directory of Company Histories reports Wesray's contribution as only $250,000 and the total purchase price as $108.8 million. When Heekin went public through a stock offering in 1985, Wesray realized a profit of $28 million from the sale of its Heekin holdings. Simon and Wesray would later complete the $71.6 million acquisition of Atlas Van Lines.

History Lord Millett, in the opinion he gave in , summarized the history of disqualification orders in British company law, noting that they were originally created under s. 75 of the Companies Act 1928 (subsequently consolidated as s. 275 of the Companies Act 1929), which was enacted on the recommendation of the Report of the Company Law Amendment Committee (1925-1926) under the chairmanship of Mr Wilfred Greene KC (Cmd 2657). It gave the official receiver, the liquidator or any creditor or contributary the ability to apply to the court having jurisdiction to wind up the company, for an order to disqualify a director from being concerned in the management of a company for a period up to five years. Such order was up to the discretion of the court. The scope of that provision was subsequently expanded as follows: :* S. 33 of the Companies Act 1947 (subsequently consolidated as section 188 of the Companies Act 1948), following the Report of the Committee on Company Law Amendment (1945) under the chairmanship of Cohen J (Cmd 6659), extended the grounds upon which a disqualification order could be made. :* S. 28 of the Companies Act 1976 provided for the case where a person had been persistently in default in relation to statutory requirements for returns, accounts or other documents. Such an order could only be sought by the Secretary of State, as it was not a requirement that the company should be insolvent or in the course of winding up. :* S. 9 of the Insolvency Act 1976 covered the case where a person had been a director of more than one company which had gone into liquidation while insolvent and his conduct as a director of any of those companies made him unfit to be concerned in the management of a company. :* S. 93 of the Companies Act 1981 extended the maximum period of disqualification to 15 years. The CDDA consolidated the law relating to disqualification orders and introduced the concept of mandatory disqualification, following up on Sir Kenneth Cork's recommendations in the Insolvency Law and Practice, Report of the Review Committee (1982) (Cmnd 8558). That report recommended that application for a mandatory order should be made by the liquidator or, with the leave of the court, by a creditor. This was not acceptable to Parliament, which understandably considered that greater safeguards are necessary in the case of a mandatory order than are required where the court retains a discretion to decline to make an order. Disqualification orders and undertakings A court may, and under section 6 shall, make against a person a disqualification order, for a period specified in the order, providing that: :* he shall not be a director of a company, act as receiver of a company‚Äôs property or in any way, whether directly or indirectly, be concerned or take part in the promotion, formation or management of a company unless (in each case) he has the leave of the court, and :* he shall not act as an insolvency practitioner.(s.1) The Secretary of State may also accept disqualification undertakings from such persons in specified circumstances, which will have similar effect.(s.1A) Disqualification at the discretion of the court The court may make a disqualification order where: :* the person is convicted of an indictable offence (whether on indictment or summarily) in connection with the promotion, formation, management, liquidation or striking off of a company with the receivership of a company‚Äôs property or with his being an administrative receiver of a company.(s. 2) :* it appears to the court that he has been persistently in default in relation to provisions of the companies legislation requiring any return, account or other document to be filed with, delivered or sent, or notice of any matter to be given, to the registrar of companies.(s. 3) :* in the course of the winding up of a company, it appears that he‚Äî ::(a) has been guilty of an offence for which he is liable (whether he has been convicted or not) under s. 458 of the Companies Act 1985 (fraudulent trading), or ::(b) has otherwise been guilty, while an officer or liquidator of the company receiver of the company‚Äôs property or administrative receiver of the company, of any fraud in relation to the company or of any breach of his duty as such officer, liquidator, receiver or administrative receiver.(s. 4) :* a person is convicted (either on indictment or summarily) in consequence of a contravention of, or failure to comply with, any provision of the companies legislation requiring a return, account or other document to be filed with, delivered or sent, or notice of any matter to be given, to the registrar of companies (whether the contravention or failure is on the person‚Äôs own part or on the part of any company).(s. 5) The maximum period of the order is 15 years under ss, 2 and 4, and 5 years under ss. 3 and 5.

Assessment is considered to be an objective standard in determining what is ordinarily expected of people fit to be directors of companies. Directors must inform themselves of company affairs and join in with other directors to supervise those affairs.Jonathan Parker J's ruling in Re Barings plc (No 5) [1999] 1 BCLC 433 The courts have identified relevant factors for determining the length of the disqualification period: :* a company director should realise that his statutory and fiduciary obligations are personal responsibilities :* the primary purpose of disqualification is to protect the public against the future conduct of companies by persons whose past records as directors of insolvent companies showed them to be a danger to creditors and others :* the period of disqualification must reflect the gravity of the offence :* the period of disqualification may be fixed by starting with an assessment of the correct period to fit the gravity of the conduct, and a discount is then given for mitigating factors :* a wide variety of factors, including the former director‚Äôs age and state of health, the length of time he has been in jeopardy, whether he has admitted the offence, his general conduct before and after the offence, and the periods of disqualification of his co-directors that may have been ordered by other courts, may be relevant and admissible in determining the appropriate period of disqualification The courts have also provided guidance as to what constitutes an appropriate length for a disqualification period: :* periods over ten years should be reserved for particularly serious cases, which may include cases where a director who has already had one period of disqualification imposed on him falls to be disqualified yet again. :* six to 10 years should apply for serious cases which do not merit the top category. :* two to five years‚Äô disqualification should be applied where, though disqualification is mandatory, the case is, relatively, not very serious.Re Sevenoaks Stationers (Retail) Ltd [1991] Ch 164, which referenced Sir Nicholas Browne-Wilkinson VC's opinion in Re Lo-Line ElectricMotors Ltd [1988] Ch 477 =Automatic disqualification= The following persons are automatically disqualified: :* undischarged bankrupts, persons subject to a moratorium period under a debt relief order, and persons subject to a bankruptcy restrictions order or a debt relief restrictions order(s. 11) :* those who have failed to make a payment under a county court administration order(s. 12) :* those subject to a disqualification order under corresponding Northern Ireland legislation(s. 12A) =Subsequent amendments=Enterprise Act 2002 Effective 20 June 2003, the Enterprise Act 2002 added ss. 9A - 9E to the Act, which expand the mandatory disqualification r√©gime to cover the following breaches of competition law under the Competition Act 1998 or the Treaty establishing the European Community: :* agreements preventing, restricting or distorting competition :* abuse of a dominant position The factors for determining unfitness in this case relate solely to behaviour concerning the breach of competition law, and the other factors listed in Schedule 1 do not apply. Disqualification may be made through an order of the court or through an undertaking. Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Act 2015 In March 2015, the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Act 2015 received Royal Assent. On 1 October 2015, Part 9 of the 2015 Act came into force, which amended the 1986 Act to introduce: :* inclusion of relevant foreign offences as grounds for disqualification (s. 104) :* extension of the r√©gime to persons instructing unfit directors of insolvent companies (s. 105) :* revision of the procedure for determining the unfitness of directors and shadow directors (s. 106) :* requirements for official receivers, liquidators, administrators and administrative receivers to report to the Secretary of State on the conduct of each person who was a director of a company on the insolvency date or within the three years before (s. 107) :* provision for compensation orders and undertakings on persons who are subject to disqualification orders or undertakings, where the person's conduct as a director caused loss to one or more creditors during the time he was a director of an insolvent company (s. 110) ConsequencesUnder the Act= :* where a person acts contrary to a disqualification order, undertaking or automatic disqualification without the leave of the court, he is guilty of an offence, and is subject on indictment to a sentence of up to 2 years in prison and/or a fine, or on summary conviction to a sentence of 6 months and/or a fine at the statutory maximum.(s. 13) :* where a body corporate is convicted of acting contrary to a disqualification order, and it is shown that a person has contributed to the offence through consent, connivance or neglect, both parties are equally liable.(s. 14) :* a person is liable for the debts of a company where he acts contrary to a disqualification order or undertaking, or where he acts or is willing to act on the instructions of another person who is similarly subject to the same.(s. 15) =Other effects= A person subject to a disqualification order or undertaking will also be disqualified from acting as: :* a charity trustee without permission of the court or the Charity Commission for England and Wales (as the case may be) :* a school governor :* a trustee of an occupational pension scheme without leave from the Pensions Regulator :* a member of a police authority :* a director, trustee or committee member of a registered social landlord :* a member of the Council for Healthcare Regulatory Excellence and various other health commissions and social care bodies Membership in certain professional bodies may also be affected, and members may be required to notify the fact of such disqualification to the body in question.Effect of a Disqualification Further reading * See also * Insolvency Act 1986 * UK insolvency law ReferencesExternal links *Disqualified Director Database from the Insolvency Service Category:United Kingdom company law Category:United Kingdom Acts of Parliament 1986 Category:Corporate directors ","title":"Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986"},{"id":"20926576","text":"Palo Pinto may refer to various locations: *Palo Pinto, Missouri *Palo Pinto County, Texas - a county in northern Texas state. *Palo Pinto, Texas - county seat of and city in Palo Pinto County, Texas. *Palo Pinto Independent School District - public school district for the Palo Pinto area.

The Schildbach Xylotheque of the Ottoneum (Natural History Museum) in Kassel (Hessen, Germany). A collection created by Carl Schildbach from 1771 to 1799. Every \\"book\\" is made by the wood of the tree that is documented inside it with wax three-dimensional replicas of tree significant elements. Since 2012 the Xylotheque is showed inside the display designed by Mark Dion for dOCUMENTA (13). Mark Dion (born August 28, 1961) is an American conceptual artist best known for his use of scientific presentations in his installations. His work examines the manner in which prevalent ideologies and institutions influence our understanding of history, knowledge and the natural world. The job of the artist, according to him, is to \\"go against the grain of dominant culture, to challenge perception and convention. By locating the roots of environmental politics and public policy in the construction of knowledge about nature, Dion questions the objectivity and authoritative role of the scientific voice in contemporary society, tracking how pseudo-science, social agendas and ideology creep into public discourse and knowledge production. Some of his well known works include Neukom Vivarium(2006), a permanent outdoor installation and learning lab for the Olympic Sculpture Park in Seattle, WA.  Early life and beginnings  Dion was born in August 28th, 1961, New Bedford, Massachusetts, to a working-class family. He spent his early childhood in New Bedford before relocating to Fairhaven, Massachusetts, where he was mostly raised. Dion credits the museums and historical architecture in both towns, such as the New Bedford whaling museum, in helping spark his interests. Dion began attending the University of Hartford Art School in 1981. He concurrently took classes at the School of Visual arts in New York from 1983 till 1984 and later participated at the one-year Independent Study Program of the Whitney Museum of American Art, where he studied with conceptual artists Joseph Kosuth and Hans Hacke, and media artist Barbara Kruger.There, he was encouraged by faculty to utilize interdisciplinary approaches that would afford a unity of his wide-ranging interests, and he began creating installations inspired by his passion for research and collecting. Dion took classes in biology at City College and attended several reading seminars to develop a concrete science foundation. He worked with fellow students Gregg Bourdowitz, Jason Simon, Craig Owens. Dion experienced financial issues while attending school, leading him to work thirty hours a week as an art conservator in SoHo, Manhattan that specialized in nine-teeth century American art. Although, Dion credits his time there as helping him see representations as objects, saying \\"Working in the studio, one would see an object in the middle of its life. I found that incredibly interesting.\\" Dion received his Bachelors of Fine Arts from the degree in 1986. Dion has received several Honorary degrees, including an honorary doctorate in Philosophy from the University of Hartford in 2003, an Honorary Fellowship of the Falmouth University (2014) and an Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters(Ph.D.) from the Wagner Free Institute of Science in Philadelphia (2015).  Career  Dion worked on several small projects like The Department of Marine Animal identification of the City of New York (Chinatown division), which gave way to his big collaborations with the Wexner Center for the Arts at Ohio State University and the Weisman Art Museum at the University of Minnesota. = Tate Thames Digs at the Tate Gallery (1999) = One of Dion's first big projects was with the Tate Britain in London. As part of Tate Modern's re-opening programme, Dion and a team of volunteers combed the shore of the river at Bankside in front of Tate Modern, and at Millbank, opposite Tate Britain, in search of artifacts and ephemeral buried beneath the mud and gravel of its beaches. A wide variety of objects and fragments were uncovered, ranging from clay pipes, oyster shells and cattle teeth to plastic toys and shoes. The more unusual finds included a bottle containing a letter in Arabic script, pieces of Bartmann jugs and a fragment of human shinbone. \\"Archaeologists tents\\" were then set up on the lawn outside Tate Britain, where each item was meticulously cleaned and identified by professionals including Museum of London staff, Thames River Police and ecologists. Once collected and processed Mark Dion created an artwork from the objects and artefacts. The finds are presented as an installation, arranged in a mahogany cabinet alongside photographs of the beachcombers and tidal flow charts. First shown at the Tate Gallery as an Art Now installation between October 1999 and January 2000, the finds for Tate Thames Dig are presented according to location in a double-sided old-fashioned mahogany cabinet, alongside photographs of the beachcombers and tidal flow charts. There are also five 'treasure chests' which contain larger items, but which are not part of this work. Organised loosely according to type (such as bones, glassware, pottery, metal objects), the viewer finds them in seemingly unhistorical and largely uninterpreted arrangements. Antique items sit alongside contemporary items, ephemera and detritus are next to objects of value. Each is a material witness, performing the same function as a historical proof. This lack of distinction is an important aspect of Dion's approach and he resists the reading of history as a necessarily linear progression. The only differentiation is a geographical one, the two sites retaining their individual identities. The lack of historical categorisation suggests a subversion of standard museological practice. Viewers are free to create their own associations, to trace histories across time, not necessarily in a linear direction. = New England Digs (2001) = In 2001, assisted by students at Brown University and the Rhode Island School of Design, Dion conducted excavations in a garbage heap on the edge of Seekonk River, a burned down 19th century waterfront sight along the Narragansett Bay, in New Bedford, and a dump along side the edge of a cemetery in Brockton, Massachusetts. The group along with Dion unearthed and collected a plethora of items and contemporary artifacts, all of which were cleaned, categorized and complied into an exhibition named the New England Digs. The material culture unearthed in New England Digs yielded three unique yet related assemblages, pointing to regional legacies of economic vitality‚ÄîNew Bedford was once a major whaling hub, Providence was a booming trade center and producer of jewelry, and Brockton was the shoe capital of the world‚Äîas well as their decline. But in Dion‚Äôs quintessential style, historically significant finds are democratically mingled with refuse and it all looks stunning. ‚ÄúThere is a long history of using trash in modern art,‚Äù Dion has stated, ‚Äúbut here objects are allowed to exist as what they are or were, without metaphor, noninterpretive, not even archaeological. = Cabinets of Curiosity at the Weisman Art Museum (2001) = In 2001, Dion collaborated with some few students from the University of Minnesota and Colleen. J. Sheehy, director of Weisman Art Museum, to present an exhibition based on the Cabinets of Curiosities exhibit he had done for the Wexner Center for the Arts at the Ohio state university in 1997. The project spanned from February through May of 2001. = Rescue Archeology: A Project for The Museum of Modern Art (2004) = In the year 2000, The Museum of Modern Art's sculpture garden underwent an extensive rebuilding project. The garden was disassembled and the land was excavated to a depth of fifteen feet. Dion lead the series of archaeological digs in the garden, recovering a pillar and fragments of the limestone foundation from the nine-story townhouse. A month later he scavenged again in the garden, as well as in the hollowed-out brownstones adjoining the Museum to the west and in the newly demolished Dorset Hotel. His findings included historical artifacts such as cornices, moldings, shards of ceramic and glass, sections of fireplace mantels, wallpaper pieces, and bricks from distinct phases of the Museum‚Äôs expansion, as well as more recent ephemera, including the remains of Bruce Nauman‚Äôs Audio-Visual Underground Chamber (1972‚Äì74), which was installed in the garden as part of the artist‚Äôs 1995 retrospective. A series of six fireplace mantels salvaged from the brownstones adjacent to the Museum and fully restored by the Dion, are intended to refer to the living room of Abby and John D. Rockefeller, Jr., renowned for its warmth and intimacy. A custom-made cabinet presents objects cleaned and classified not by scientific criteria but by the artist‚Äôs logic; visitors are invited to peruse its contents and appreciate its odd organizational paradigms. Finally, a functional laboratory and a group of photographs recording Dion‚Äôs behind-the-scenes archaeological ‚Äúperformance,‚Äù as he calls it, reveal an interest in experimentation and process that balances his investment in the finished product. = Neukom Vivarium (2006) = The Neukom Vivarium is considered one of Dion‚Äôs most notable works. It is a permanent installation located in the Olympic Sculpture Park in Seattle, Washington. Dion utilized a 60-foot a fallen Western Hemlock tree as the nurse log inside an 80-foot greenhouse. The tree ‚Äúinhabits an art system,‚Äù according to the Seattle Art Museum. By ‚Äúinhabits,‚Äù they mean insects, fungi, lichen, and other plants. Visitors are provided with magnifying glasses and field guides if they find a creature particularly attention-grabbing. By virtue of being organic, Neukom Vivarium is an ever-evolving piece. Bacteria and mushrooms appearing one day may be replaced with moss and bugs the very next. = Miami Art Museum (2006) = In 2006, Mark Dion conducted a large installation at the South Florida Wildlife Rescue Unit that focused on the Everglades and human attempts to control the South Florida ecosystem. Interweaving the diverse disciplines of art, science, ecology, history, and archeology, Dion‚Äôs project consists of three parts, corresponding to the three major periods of Everglades history: exploration (late 1700s ‚Äì mid 1800s); exploitation (mid-1800s ‚Äì early 20th century); and preservation and restoration (mid-20th century ‚Äì the present). The largest component of the installation features a facsimile of a vehicle and equipment belonging to an imaginary agency that rushes into vulnerable ecosystems to save threatened plants and animals: the South Florida Wildlife Rescue Unit. The second portion of the installation is a series of reproductions of vintage photographs taken in the early decades of the 20th century by John Kunkel Small, a curator of the New York Botanical Garden who identified numerous plant species in the Everglades and authored a scathing book entitled From Eden to Sahara: Florida‚Äôs Tragedy, which documented the changes wrought by dredging and draining the area. The third portion consists of a vitrine containing artifacts, including a book of pressed specimens, the Herbarium Perrine (Marine Algae), purportedly belonging to 19th century botanist and early Florida settler Henry Perrine. Perrine was partly responsible for the overzealous introduction of foreign plant species to the area, which now poses one of the gravest threats to the ecosystem. Like the installation‚Äôs vehicle, the vitrine and its components are a fiction invented by the artist. = Solo exhibitions = His works include Follies at Storm King Sculpture Park (2019), Theatre of the Natural World at the Whitechapel Gallery, London (2018), Misadventures of a 21st Century Naturalist at the Institute of Contemporary Art Boston (2017), Mark Dion: The Academy of Things at The Academy of Fine Arts Design in Dresden, Germany (2014), The Macabre Treasuryat Museum Het Domein in Sittard, The Netherlands (2013), Oceanomania: Souvenirs of Mysterious Seas at Mus√©e Oc√©anographique de Monaco and Nouveau Mus√©e National de Monaco / Villa Paloma in Monaco (2011), The Marvelous Museum: A Mark Dion Project at Oakland Museum of California (2010-11), Systema Metropolis at Natural History Museum, London (2007), The South Florida Wildlife Rescue Unit at Miami Art Museum (2006), Rescue Archaeology, a project for the Museum of Modern Art (2004), and his renowned Tate Thames Dig at the Tate Gallery in London (1999). = Other works = In 2012, Dion's work was included in dOCUMENTA 13, curated by Carolyn Christov-Bakargiev in Kassel, Germany, and has also been exhibited at MoMA PS1 in New York, Guggenheim Bilbao, Minneapolis Institute of Art, Tate Gallery, and the Museum of Modern Art. The artist has also completed other public commissions which include Den, a site- specific installation for the National Tourist Routes in Norway (2012), An Archaeology of Knowledge for Johns Hopkins University (2012), and Ship in a Bottle for Port of Los Angeles Waterfront (2011).  In recent years  Dion resides with his wife, artist Dana Sherwood, in Copake, New York, and continues to conducts his works worldwide. He currently mentors at Columbia University and is co-director of Mildred's Lane, a visual art education and residency program in Beach Lake, Pennsylvania. He continues to make frequent collaborations with museums of natural history, aquariums, zoos and other institutions mandated to produce public knowledge on the topic of nature. Dion is the subject of a monograph published by Phaidon\\"Mark Dion (Phaidon)\\". Artbook.com. Retrieved November 3, 2019. and a documentary on the PBS series art:21. In 2015, Dion visited Colgate University to conduct works shops and lectures with students and faculty.  Awards and nominations  Dion received the ninth annual Larry Aldrich Foundation Award (2001), The Joan Mitchell Foundation Award (2007), the Smithsonian American Art Museum's Lucida Art Award (2008), and a Guggenheim Fellowship (2019).

In 1540, he surrendered Gisborough Priory to the king, and was given a pension. He was made provost of Jesus College, Rotherham in 1544. It was suppressed early in the reign of Edward VI, and he became then Archdeacon of Nottingham.Society and Religion in Elizabethan England, Greaves,R.L: Minneapolis, University of Minnesota Press, 1981 His tenure of the bishopric of Hull continued under Robert Holgate and Nicholas Heath; but he was deprived of the office, as well as of his archdeaconry, in 1559 for refusing to take the oath of supremacy. In 1559, the year of his deprivation, he obtained letters patent from Elizabeth I to found a grammar school at Tideswell. On 5 June 1563, he also obtained letters patent to found a similar school, bearing the same name, and also a hospital, or almshouse, at Guisborough. Pursglove resided in his last years partly at Tideswell and partly at Dunston in the same county. He died on 2 May 1579, and was buried in Tideswell church where a memorial brass in the floor shows him dressed as a bishop in alb, stole and chasuble (robes worn up to the reign of Mary I, but banned under the Elizabethan Church Settlement). Prior Pursglove College, a sixth form college in Guisborough, North Yorkshire, is named in his memory. At some point or other, he used the alias \\"Sylvester\\".

Wagner Generating Station is an electric generating station located on Fort Smallwood Road north of Orchard Beach in Anne Arundel County, Maryland, just east of Glen Burnie, and is operated by the Raven Power Holdings, LLC, a subsidiary of Riverstone Holdings LLC. The H. A. Wagner station consists of natural gas fueled Unit 1, nominally rated at 133 MWe, coal-fired Unit 2 rated at 136 MWe, coal-fired Unit 3 rated at 359 MWe, and oil-fired Unit 4 rated at 415 MWe. The station shares a site adjacent to the Patapsco River with the Brandon Shores Generating Station. The Brandon Shores plant dominates the site with its exhaust and flue-gas desulfurization system stacks. Fuel delivery The Wagner and Brandon Shores Generating Stations consume approximately 4.8 million tons of coal annually. Coal for both stations and number 6 fuel oil for Wagner Unit 4 is delivered by barge. Although there is a railroad spur into the site that could be used for coal shipments to the site, it is unused and would require improvements to restore it to an operational state. An estimate in a 2007 report indicated that the cost of returning this rail line to operation with the necessary material handling equipment would potentially exceed US $20 million. Natural gas for the Wagner Unit 1 is provided by a pipeline. Dispatch of electricity The electrical output of Brandon Shores Generating Station is dispatched by the PJM Interconnection regional transmission organization. Wagner Generating Station from Cox Creek, with the stacks of the Brandon Shores plant at left and the active Brandon Shores stack just visible History The Wagner Generating Station's oil-fired Unit 1 commenced operations in 1956. Unit 2, consisting of a Babcock & Wilcox 1800 psig steam boiler and General Electric single reheat steam turbine, began operations as a coal-fired plant in 1959. Coal-fired Unit 3, which has a Babcock & Wilcox 3500 psig supercritical boiler and a Westinghouse double-reheat cross compound turbine, commenced operations in 1966. The oil-fired unit 4 began operations in 1972. Unit 2 was converted to fuel oil to comply with state and federal air quality requirements in 1972, and then modified to allow a return to burning coal in 1987.Maryland Public Service Commission Order No. 67682, Case No. 7975, March 17, 1987. Units 2, 3, and 4 were also converted to use natural gas during startup operations in 1987. Additional air pollution controls were added to the plants in the 1980s. The plant is named for Herbert Appleton Wagner (1867‚Äì1947), who was president of the Consolidated Gas and Electric of Baltimore, the predecessor company of Constellation Energy, from 1915 through 1942. Wagner also held a patent on a self-starting, single-phase motor and founded in 1891 the Wagner Electric Manufacturing Company in St. Louis, Missouri. 2012 sale The plant was originally constructed by a predecessor company of Constellation Energy, which was later purchased by Exelon in 2012. On August 9, 2012, Exelon announced that it had reached an agreement, subject to regulatory approvals, for the sale of the Charles P. Crane, Brandon Shores, and Herbert A. Wagner Generating Stations to Raven Power Holdings LLC, a newly formed portfolio company of Riverstone Holdings LLC, for approximately $400 million. Exelon had committed to divest the plants as condition for regulatory approval of its merger with Constellation Energy to alleviate concerns regarding potential market power in the regional wholesale electricity market. The sale was completed on November 30, 2012. Cooling All four Wagner units are cooled using water from intake structures from a basin on the Patapsco River using two circulating water pumps per unit. Water from units 1, 2, and 3 is returned to the river by a discharge canal upstream of the intake basin while water from unit 4 uses a discharge canal downstream of the intake basin.

The mountain sports two other subsidiary peaks with commemorative names: Ha Ling Peak on the northwestern end, and Miners Peak southeastern of Ha Ling Peak. Another peak on the mountain is named Ship's Prow, which is on the Southeastern end of the mountain. The mountain is separated from Mount Rundle by Whiteman's Gap, and is separated to the South from The Three Sisters by Three Sisters Pass. The peak is named for Lawrence Grassi (1890‚Äì1980), an Italian miner who emigrated to Canada in 1912. After working with the Canadian Pacific Railway for several years he worked in the Canmore coal mines. Grassi also became a well-respected climbing guide as well as building many trails in the area including one to the Grassi Lakes which also bear his name. Name Change Ehagay Nakoda was formerly named Mount Lawrence Grassi, but the name was changed along with renaming Ha Ling Peak. In 1998, the name of the massif was changed to Ehagay Nakoda, meaning \\"The last Nakoda\\" (\\"The last human being\\"), which is derived from a Stoney Nakoda origin story about the mountain‚Äôs creation. This traditional story told of a Nakoda who was transformed into a mountain by Iktomni (the Trickster, or the Old Man) so that they would remain on this Earth long after human beings cease to inhabit it. The story was submitted by a local Stoney Nakoda Edler, Peter Lazarus Wesley, for the renaming of Chinaman's Peak, but the decision was made to rename the entire massif while also changing the name of Chinaman's Peak to Ha Ling Peak. To respect the history of Lawrence Grassi and the former name of the mountain, the tallest peak was named Mount Lawrence Grassi. Climate Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Mount Lawrence Grassi is located in a subarctic climate with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers.

The design produces a precisely patterned light source by reflection or illumination, or a stop pattern by transmission, with precise uniformity, spatial frequency, sharp edge definition, and high contrast ratio.  Manufacturing  Ronchi rulings are typically manufactured through photolithographic deposition of metallic chromium on a substrate, which yields a precise, near-100 percent contrast pattern. For a reflective or illuminated type, dark stripes are printed on a diffusely reflecting or translucent substrate, such as a square of white ceramic material or opal glass. For a transmissive type, opaque stripes are printed on a transparent glass substrate. A transmissive type may be readily modified to act as an illuminated type by stacking a reflective object behind it.  Applications  A test target in the Ronchi pattern provides a precise signal for testing resolution, contrast, distortion, aberrations, and diffraction in optical imaging systems. In constructing telescope mirrors, the Ronchi test procedure evaluates the quality of the surface figure, and provides guidance on refining the figure. The ruled divisions in a linear encoder are in the form of Ronchi ruling, which provides the basic precision of the measurements. A single Ronchi device provides a pattern that is periodic in one dimension. Stacking a pair of Ronchi transmission elements produces a two-dimensional array of periodic rectangular or rhomboidal apertures. By varying the translation, rotation, and chosen frequency of one element against the other, a wide assortment of laboratory test patterns can be generated with the paired arrangement. Telescopic focusing aids such as the Bahtinov mask consist of multiple adjacent Ronchi transmission stop patterns. Inserting a Ronchi mask in the entrance aperture produces diffraction effects in the image, which visibly change with the focusing condition.

A senior British Army officer, Major-General Sir Frederick Maurice, alleged that the War Cabinet had misled Parliament about troop strengths on the Western Front. The leader of the Liberal Party, H. H. Asquith, took up the allegations and attacked Prime Minister David Lloyd George, also a Liberal. It ripped apart the Liberal Party. While Asquith's attack was ineffective, Lloyd George vigorously defended his position, treating the debate like a vote of confidence. He won over the House with a powerful, if misleading, speech, refuting all of Maurice's allegations. The debate did not cause the profound split in the Liberal Party, but did make it more visible and harder to heal. The main results were to strengthen Lloyd George, weaken Asquith, end public criticism of overall strategy, and strengthen civilian control of the military.John Gooch, \\"The Maurice Debate 1918,\\" Journal of Contemporary History (1968) 3#4 pp. 211‚Äì228 in JSTOR Background to the affair Prime Minister David Lloyd George and those close to him had long grown exasperated by the unreliable statistics produced by the Army about both British and German strength. Cabinet Secretary Maurice Hankey had written in his diary (20 December 1917) \\"The War office figures and statements are utterly unreliable, and their facts are twisted to support their arguments. If they want men they make out that they can hardly hold the line ‚Ä¶ If they want to do an offensive they make out that the enemy is exhausted and demoralised, and that they have lots of men\\".Grigg 2002, pp. 506‚Äì7 General Sir William Robertson was removed as Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS ‚Äì professional head of the Army) in February 1918 after months of argument with the government about manpower and deployment of resources between fronts, and was suspected of engaging in political intrigues to return to power.John Grigg, Lloyd George: War leader, 1916‚Äì1918 (2002) p. 503. Shortly after Robertson's removal, the German Spring Offensive of 21 March 1918 came close to inflicting catastrophic defeat on Hubert Gough's Fifth Army. With the British forces still hard-pressed in April, the causes of the near debacle became a matter of political controversy. Lloyd George felt that Field Marshal Haig had squandered British manpower to little useful effect in his offensives of 1916‚Äì17, whilst the British military and their political and press allies felt, not without reason, that the Government had left the BEF starved of men (John Grigg argues than he had been justified in doing so, as Haig had been intending to resume the offensive at the start of 1918). Lloyd George quoted official War Office figures in a speech in the House of Commons on 9 April 1918, stating that the BEF had been stronger on 1 January 1918 than a year previously (the eve of the German offensive in March might have been a better comparison than January, in John Grigg's view). Lloyd George also said that there had been only one \\"white\\" division in Mesopotamia and three in Egypt and Palestine, the rest of the divisions in those theatres being Indian divisions containing only a small proportion of British troops.Grigg 2002, pp. 491, 506‚Äì7 Maj-Gen Maurice, a long-standing prot√©g√© of Robertson's, was now in his final weeks as Director of Military Operations (DMO). He paid a visit to Haig's GHQ in France (where he was offered, but apparently declined, a staff position) and recorded (15 April) that officers at Haig's staff were dissatisfied with Lloyd George's speech of 9 April.Grigg 2002, p. 491 On 18 April a Liberal backbencher asked whether Lloyd George's figures included non-combatants (e.g. labourers, many of them Indian, Chinese or black South Africans, who built roads and railways and helped to move heavy equipment). Ian Macpherson, Under-Secretary at the War Office, replied using figures from the Adjutant-General's Department, sent by Colonel Walter Kirke, Deputy DMO (Maurice was still technically DMO until 20 April).Grigg 2002, pp. 491‚Äì2 On 22 April a weekly summary from the same department informed the War Office that the Germans had had a rifle superiority of 330,000 at the start of the year. Lloyd George was furious at this contradiction of his own 9 April figures and the 18 April figures used by Macpherson. He wrote an angry letter to Milner (Secretary of State for War), calling the figures \\"extraordinarily slipshod\\". The German superiority was then pared back to 262,000 by including troops in Italy in the British total.Grigg 2002, pp. 491‚Äì2, 502‚Äì3, 506‚Äì7 Then on 23 April came questions in the House to the Conservative Leader Bonar Law (the Conservatives were supporting Lloyd George's coalition government) about how Gough's Army had been thinly stretched after taking over a section of French line earlier in 1918. Law replied somewhat disingenuously (see below) that Haig and Philippe P√©tain (French Commander-in-Chief) had agreed the extension of the British sector to Barisis between themselves, rather than being leant on by the Supreme War Council at Versailles. The Morning Post was calling openly for the fall of the government at this stage. Maurice's letter Maurice had a meeting with Robertson on 29 April. From the context (letters from Robertson 29 and 30 April) it is clear that Robertson suggested writing to Henry Wilson, Robertson's successor as CIGS, and then, if necessary to the press. Robertson initially suggested he speak to Liberal leader and former prime minister Asquith, but Maurice did not do so (in Grigg's view Asquith probably would have advised against going to the press), and Robertson changed his mind later the same day.Grigg 2002, p492 Robertson encouraged Maurice to write the letter, but did not back him openly, causing Lloyd George's biographer John Grigg to conclude, \\"Robertson is the person who comes worst out of the affair.\\" There is, however, little evidence to confirm Lloyd George's suspicions of a wider plot involving senior military and political figures, to bring down the government.Roy Jenkins, Asquith; Papermac 1994 edition, p. 469 Maurice wrote to Wilson on 30 April.French 1995, pp. 234‚Äì5 Wilson did not reply to Maurice's letter. There is no evidence of Wilson's views, or whether he launched any inquiry of his own about the different figures being produced.Grigg 2002, pp. 492, 502‚Äì3 However, Hankey later told Liddell Hart in 1932 that he had a friendly conversation with Maurice on the eve of his press letter, telling him that Lloyd George thought highly of him and suggesting a number of suitable jobs for him; Grigg speculates that the conversation might have been at Wilson's behest after Maurice's letter to Wilson, and that the staff post in France (which he had declined on 15 April) might have been one of the mooted jobs.Grigg 2002, pp. 503‚Äì5 Maurice composed his letter to the press on 2 May but did not yet send it. Robertson wrote to him on 4 May, writing that not too much credence should be given to imminent predictions of Lloyd George's downfall, that Maurice should take especial care to get his facts exactly right, and adding: \\"You are contemplating a great thing ‚Äì to your undying credit\\".Grigg 2002, p493 Maurice wrote to Asquith (6 May) saying he had decided against seeing him as it would be forcing Asquith to take responsibility for the letter, and Maurice wanted to take all responsibility himself.Grigg 2002, p. 494 Maurice's allegations Maurice's letter appeared in The Times on 7 May.The Times, 7 May 1918 p7David Dutton, A History of the Liberal Party in the Twentieth Century; Palgrave Macmillan, 2004 p. 72 The letter also appeared in The Morning Post, the Daily Chronicle and The Daily News.Robin Prior and Trevor Wilson, Sir Frederick Barton Maurice in Dictionary of National Biography, OUP 2004‚Äì08 The Daily Telegraph refused to print it.Grigg 2002, p. 489 In his letter, Maurice wrote that ministers in the coalition government of Prime Minister David Lloyd George and Unionist Party leader Bonar Law, had given false information to Parliament about the strength of British troops on the Western Front to cover up the fact that the number of British troops there had been reduced following Lloyd George's decision (against military advice) to send additional forces to Palestine.Liberal Democrat History Group website, 2009: http://www.liberalhistory.org.uk/item_single.php?item_id=55&item;=history In his letter he accused both Bonar Law and Lloyd George of misleading the House.The Times, 7 May 1918 p. 7 As Thomas Jones put it, Maurice challenged: > statements ... made by Lloyd George in the House of Commons on 9 April: > first, that notwithstanding the heavy casualties in 1917, the army in France > was considerably stronger on 1 January 1918 than on 1 January 1917, and > second, that in Egypt and Palestine there was a very small proportion of > British as compared with Indian troops; and by Bonar Law on 23 April that > the extension of the British Front which took place before the battle of 21 > March was an arrangement made solely by the military authorities. The government's statements indicated that the British forces on the Western Front were adequate, and therefore implied that the near-defeat inflicted by Germany in March was the responsibility of General Headquarters.Roy Jenkins, Asquith; Papermac 1994 edition, p. 473 Maurice wrote that his letter was \\"not the result of a military conspiracy\\" and had been \\"seen by no soldier\\" (a dubious claim, as he had in fact conspired with Robertson). He said that he was as \\"sincere a democrat as the Prime Minister\\" but that \\"My duty as a citizen must override my duty as a soldier\\". Reaction to the letter Wilson mentioned to the War Cabinet on the morning of Maurice's letter that he had ‚Äúheard from Maurice‚Äù but did not mention the contents of Maurice's letter, nor that he had apparently not replied to it. To add further to the statistical confusion, the War Office now supplied yet another set of figures (7-8 May). These now showed that the BEF had been inferior to the German forces opposite by \\"only\\" 100,000 combatants. To Lloyd George's irritation, these figures treated artillerymen, machine gunners and tank crews as non-combatants.Grigg 2002, p502-3, 506-7 Asquith tabled a private notice question and Bonar Law, on behalf of the government, offered to establish a Court of Honour consisting of two judges to look into the matter. Asquith would have been free to choose the judges, but he thought the proposal insulting to the independence of Parliament and declined the offer on the evening of 7 May. Instead Asquith demanded a Select committee to inquire into the allegations and pressed for a Parliamentary debate. On 8 May 1918 Howell Arthur Gwynne, editor of The Morning Post, wrote to Asquith admitting that he was a long-standing political enemy of his, but that it was in the national interest that he be restored as Prime Minister in Lloyd George's place.Grigg 2002, p494 The letter provoked serious concern in the press both on the substantive issue of the right levels of manpower on the Western Front and their adequate support and because of the allegation that MPs had been misled.The Times, 8 May 1918 p10 However, on 8 May the Times editorial likened the letter's innuendos, such as that it ‚Äúhad been seen by no soldier‚Äù whereas Maurice had in fact conspired with Robertson, to the very sort of ‚Äúdisingenuous Parliamentary answer‚Äù which Maurice professed to deplore. Grigg argues that Maurice claimed to be acting for the sake of Army morale, yet his actions were likely to worsen it by sowing discord, and that it is more plausible that he was hoping to bring down the government.Grigg 2002, p503-5 As with the Fall of Robertson earlier in the year, Asquith's vanity and resentment at having been deposed as Prime Minister (by Lloyd George, in December 1916) made it impossible for him to stay entirely aloof, especially with his wife and his political associates egging him on. However, he was conscious of his own lack of stomach for the fight and others‚Äô lack of appetite for his return. On the eve of the debate The Westminster Gazette, edited by his friend and future biographer J. A. Spender, had climbed down from its previous position of calling for the fullest possible investigation of Maurice's allegations, and instead called for national unity.Grigg 2002, p502 Maurice did not stay in London to coach those ready to attack ministers.Farrar-Hockley 1975, p317 The debate On the morning of 9 May The Times carried a report of a speech by G. H. Roberts, Minister of Labour, complaining of constant \\"sniping\\" at the government, a phrase which Lloyd George would use in his peroration.Grigg 2002, p. 495 Asquith rose to speak at about 3.45 pm. His performance in the debate was thought to be dry, formal and pedantic. According to his biographer, \\"... there was no sense of a great Parliamentary occasion about his speech. He had chosen a minor key and he had played it without his usual sureness of touch.\\"Roy Jenkins, Asquith; Papermac 1994 edition, p. 471 He concentrated on explaining why he was calling for a select committee and insisted that he was not seeking to displace the government. He had no answer when a heckler suggested that setting up a select committee had not worked over the Marconi scandal. At one point he asked rhetorically \\"What is the alternative?\\" and as he paused for effect Charles Stanton, MP for Merthyr Tydfil, shouted \\"Get on with the war!\\" to cheers and laughter.Roy Jenkins, Asquith; Papermac 1994 edition, p. 470 Even Asquith's friends saw that he had lost his fighting spirit and would not be acceptable as a wartime Prime Minister.Ged Martin, \\"Asquith, the Maurice Debate and the Historians\\", Australian Journal of Politics and History (1985) 31#3 pp. 435‚Äì444. Lloyd George guessed, largely correctly, that the whole affair had been stirred up by General Robertson. He also sensed that Asquith had lost the will to rule. He had had Hankey prepare a brief, using the War Office figures of 18 April, not the DMO figures of 22 April, which had since been heavily amended, or the final set of DMO figures from 7 to 8 May.Grigg 2002, pp. 494, 506‚Äì7 Whether or nor his statement on 9 April had been honest, a claim accepted by some historians, there is no doubt that he spoke dishonestly in the debate a month later. Lloyd George spoke for one and a quarter hours, twice as long as Asquith. He was direct and combative. He treated the issue as if it were a vote of confidence in the government and refuted Maurice's charges in a powerful, if misleading speech, based on doubtful material.Prior & Wilson, DNB He pointed out that Asquith had not set up a select committee of the House of Commons over the disastrous Kut Campaign.Grigg 2002, p. 496 Lloyd George attacked Maurice, pointing out that his letter constituted a breach of King's Regulations.Roy Douglas, Liberals: The History of the Liberal and Liberal Democrat Parties; Hambledon & London, 2005 p. 179 Lloyd George pointed out that the figures which the Government had presented to the House on 18 April, showing an increase in the number of BEF \\"combatants\\" between 1 January 1918 and 1 January 1917, had technically come from Maurice's department. He admitted, in response to an interruption, that Maurice had not actually seen the 18 April figures (he had been away at the time) but they had been initialled by a deputy (Colonel Walter Kirke).Grigg 2002, pp. 497, 509 The figure of three \\"white\\" divisions in Egypt/Palestine had been given at a Cabinet meeting at which Maurice had been in attendance. Furthermore, he argued that Maurice's statement that he had been at Versailles where the extension of the British line had been agreed was misleading ‚Äì Maurice had been in Versailles but not at the Supreme War Council, and the issue had not been discussed there but had already been agreed between Haig and P√©tain.Grigg 2002, p. 497 Lloyd George also reminded MPs that the debate might bring down the Government and restore Asquith as Prime Minister, urging them to \\"Make no mistake!\\"Grigg 2002, p. 498 Lloyd George was judged to have demolished the charges Maurice had laid against him. One commentator, Dingle Foot, noted that, \\"at the time it appeared that Lloyd George had completely routed his critics.\\"Dingle Foot, British Political Crises: 1916; William Kimber, London 1976 p. 73 Hankey listened to Lloyd George's \\"superb parliamentary effort\\" from the gallery, although he thought it \\"not the speech of a man who tells 'the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth'\\". He recorded that Lloyd George was \\"discreetly silent\\" about the Adjutant- General's figures of 22 April which did not show an increase in the combat strength of the BEF. Hankey was asked by MPs of all \\"complexions\\" to tell them the real truth of the matter, but supported the Prime Minister in public.Grigg 2002, pp. 507‚Äì8 Amongst other speeches of note was that of Edward Carson, who had recently resigned from the government over Irish conscription. The previous day (8 May) Carson had tried to persuade the Unionist Business Committee (Conservative backbenchers) to support neither Lloyd George nor Asquith, but they decided to back the government rather than see Asquith return as Prime Minister or fight an election on an electoral register five years out of date. In his speech Carson pointed out that the House must either support or bring down the government, and that the former was preferable. He supported the government.Grigg 2002, p. 499 By this time further speakers were being interrupted by shouts of \\"Divide! Divide!\\", as MPs were keen to move to a vote. Because of the high number of absentees (many MPs were away serving with the forces) less than half the House actually supported the government. However, Parliament had no desire to displace the government and in the vote on the debate the House of Commons divided in support of the Government by 295 votes to 108.Chris Cook, A Short History of the Liberal Party: 1900‚Äì1992; Macmillan, 1993 p. 73Grigg 2002, p. 499. Grigg gives the numbers as 293‚Äì106 (as does French 1995), possibly excluding tellers on either side One historian of the Liberal Party has commented that this was a larger majority than had appeared likely. 98 Liberal MPs supported the Asquith motion, 70 Liberal MPs supported Lloyd George's government, while 93 Liberal MPs either abstained or were absent. Labour MPs were also split by the debate with 15 MPs supporting the government, eight supporting Asquith's motion and 12 being either absent or abstaining.Hansard The validity of Maurice's charges After the debate Lloyd George told George Younger that he had been ‚Äúcaught out telling the truth‚Äù. Lloyd George chose to disregard any figures provided after 18 April, and as Hankey put it was ‚Äúdiscreetly silent‚Äù about the Adjutant-General's figures of 22 April (or, for that matter the figures of 7‚Äì8 May).Grigg 2002, p507-8 Lord Milner later, after the debate, suggested that Lloyd George should issue a correction to the 18 April figures but did not press the point ‚Äì this suggestion, which John Grigg describes as \\"politically foolish\\", contributed to Lloyd George's loss of confidence in Milner as War Secretary.Grigg 2002, p510 Lloyd George's figure of 3 \\"white\\" divisions in Egypt/Palestine had been given in good faith at the time, but Henry Wilson had since informed him that the correct number was in fact seven (some were redeployed to the Western Front after the German Offensive began on 21 March, replaced by Indian divisions from Mesopotamia). Bonar Law said on 23 April that the extension of the British line had already been agreed between Haig and P√©tain and, in response to a supplementary question from Mr Pringle MP, declared somewhat ambiguously that ‚Äúthis particular matter‚Äù had not been discussed at Versailles. Maurice said in his letter that he had been present at Versailles when the matter had been discussed. In fact the actual extension of the line had been agreed in principle at the political level between Lloyd George and Paul Painlev√© (French Prime Minister at the time) in September 1917, and Haig had (somewhat grudgingly) agreed the details with P√©tain in October. However, there had then been further pressure from the French that the British take over yet more line, to the displeasure of Lloyd George as well as Haig. The matter was referred to the Supreme War Council at Versailles, who recommended that the BEF take over about half of what the French were demanding. In the event, P√©tain did not press the matter and Barisis remained the rightward point of the BEF positions at the time of the German attack on 21 March 1918. It is unclear whether Law was being deliberately evasive.Grigg 2002, p501, 504 Later allegations muddy the waters Whilst Lloyd George was writing his memoirs in the 1930s, his secretary (and mistress) Frances Stevenson made a diary entry which later came to light when Lord Beaverbrook published Men and Power in 1956. Beaverbrook wrote that after Lloyd George's 9 April statement J. T. Davies had revealed a War Office correction to her, but had burned the incriminating document in front of her.Grigg 2002, p. 509Roy Jenkins, Asquith; Papermac 1994 edition, pp. 473‚Äì4 Frances (the widowed Countess Lloyd-George as she was by then) wrote to The Spectator (23 November 1956) stating that the incident had in fact occurred some time after the Maurice Debate. She wrote in her autobiography (1967) that on writing her diary entry she had telephoned J. T. Davies who claimed to have ‚Äúno recollection‚Äù on the incident. Nancy Maurice (in her book The Maurice Case p. 174) suggested that Davies had staged the discovery and destruction of the document and made Frances Stevenson his unwilling tool. Grigg points out that even if such an incident did take place, it had no effect on the Maurice Debate itself.Grigg 2002, p. 510 The impact of the debate Maj-Gen Maurice was put on half-pay on 11 May, and soon ‚Äúretired‚Äù from the Army. However, he was far from disgraced and shortly became military correspondent of the Daily Chronicle. He later enjoyed a distinguished career as an author and lecturer in military history and as a university administrator. However, he was never officially exonerated. In his memoirs in the mid 1930s Lloyd George was harsh about Maurice and did not come clean about his own disingenuous use of statistics in the debate.Grigg 2002, p499-500, 509 The military writer Repington was also a casualty of the affair, as he had annoyed Milner's disciples by attacking him. On 12 May a two-page editorial in The Observer (written by the editor JL Garvin at the behest of the owner Waldorf Astor) attacked him and his reputation never fully recovered.Grigg 2002, p500 The Times newspaper reported that as a result of the debate it now sensed the existence of an organised opposition.Dutton, p72 This was not the first time that Liberals had voted against the government but it was the first time that Asquith had led the opposition from the front.Cook, p72 Thoughts about formalising the Coalition Liberals into a distinct party group now began to take shape. The beginnings of separate Lloyd Georgeite Liberal constituency organisations began to appear.K. O. Morgan, The Age of Lloyd George: The Liberal Party and British Politics, 1890‚Äì1919; Allen & Unwin 1971, p72 In the Summer of 1918 there were talks between Lloyd George's Chief Whip, Freddie Guest and the Conservatives prepared to guarantee Coalition backing for 150 Liberal MPs in the next general election.K O Morgan, Lloyd George's Stage Army: The Coalition Liberals, 1918‚Äì1922; in A J P Taylor (ed.) Lloyd George, Twelve Essays; Hamish Hamilton, 1971 p227 This was the birth of the coalition coupon and the formal divide in Liberal ranks which took place at the 1918 general election. At Newcastle on 29 October 1918, with the general election imminent, Lloyd George claimed that the Maurice Debate had determined which of the 159 Liberals received coalition \\"coupons\\", but research has shown that this was not strictly true.Stephen Koss, Asquith; Hamish Hamilton 1985 edition, p 236-9 Lloyd George also talked about the Maurice Debate at length in a speech at Wolverhampton on 23 November 1918.Roy Jenkins, Asquith; Papermac 1994 edition, p 477 The Maurice debate may not have been the sole identifying factor for those Liberals granted or denied the coupon but the personal rift between Lloyd George and Asquith was deepened by it. The disunity in the Liberal Party was transparent for all to see, to the clear electoral detriment of the party. By 1924 the Liberal Party had been reduced in Parliament to 40 seats and was never again able to form a government in its own right.

While in the legislature, Olson was a member of the House Agriculture, Education, Rules and Legislative Administration, Transportation and Transit, Economic Development and Housing, and Energy committees, and of various sub-committees relevant to each area. She was chair of the Legislative Commission on the Economic Status of Women from 1991-1993. The commission has since evolved into the Office on the Economic Status of Women. She also served as an assistant majority leader during the 1993-1994 session under House Speaker Dee Long. Background and community service From the rural Trimont and Sherburn areas, Olson earned a reputation as a strong advocate for farmers, agricultural issues and education during her time in office.

Designed by the architect James Pennethorne, it was complete enough to be occupied by 1834, and was finished by 1852. The house replaced an earlier one on the estate. T.R. Potter recorded in his History and Antiquities of Charnwood Forest (1842): > The residence of the owners of Swithland was, till the present generation, > situated near the Church. It was a considerable pile, but so surrounded on > all sides, even in front, by stables, dovecotes and high walls, and so close > to the public road, that the present proprietor has judiciously pulled it > down, and erected on a higher ground a mansion more suited to the taste of > the age. It is built of stuccoed and painted granite and slate rubble and brick, with Swithland slate roofs concealed by a parapet. It consists of a central block and two wings in a restrained neo-classical style with banded rustication to the ground floor. It has two storeys, with a sunken basement. The entrance front has one-storey porch with four paired fluted Doric columns up four stone steps. The house was Grade II listed in 1979.

He was also a construction engineer who was active in building industry in the Soviet Union.  Biography Early years= S. J. Rutgers was born in Leiden, Netherlands on January 25, 1879. He studied from 1896 to the Polytechnical School of Delft, where he came into contact with socialism. In 1900 he graduated as a civil engineer and took a job for the municipality of Rotterdam, where he worked on the expansion of the port. At the same time, he was active from 1899 in the SDAP. From 1911 to 1915 he was director of public works in Medan, and then buyer for Indonesian companies in the United States. =Political activities= A plaque on the 1922‚Äì1925 home of Rutgers in Kemerovo, noting him as an engineer and founder of the Kuzbass Autonomous Industrial Colony During World War I, Rutgers was a frequent contributor to the Left Wing socialist press in America. His influential articles in The International Socialist Review and other publications supported the antimilitarist Zimmerwald Left movement and helped publicize the ideas of revolutionary socialism to an American audience. Rutgers was the financial force behind the establishment of a group called the Socialist Propaganda League of America in 1915, a revolutionary socialist forerunner of the Communist Party of America.Maria Van Enckevort, st_martin_studies_2006.1-2.htm#_Toc155903776 \\"Otto Huiswoud: Political Praxis and Anti-Imperialism,\\" Philipsburg, St. Maarten: St. Martin Studies, no. 1-2, 2006. Unpaginated in html format, see footnote 1. Rutgers was subsequently regarded as one of the leading theoreticians of the Left Wing of the Socialist Party of America, a tendency which emerged as the Communist Party of America after 1919. After the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917, Rutgers made his way to Soviet Russia via Vladivostok and Japan. Having transversed the war zone of the Russian Civil War, he arrived in Moscow whereupon he was invited to meet with Lenin in the Kremlin. He attended the First Congress of the Communist International. When the Comintern established its Amsterdam Bureau, Rutgers was appointed secretary and given the major portion of twenty million roubles ‚Äì in the form of precious stones ‚Äì with which to found this bureau. From 1922‚Äì1926, he led the construction of an international workers cooperative, the Kuzbass Autonomous Industrial Colony in the Kuzbas area of Siberia. From 1926-1938 he lived alternately in the Netherlands, Vienna, and Moscow. In 1938, Rutgers left the Soviet Union. Back in the Netherlands, Rutgers lived out his life as a respected, but non-influential member of the Communist Party of the Netherlands. =Death and legacy= Sebald Rutgers died in Amersfoort, Netherlands on June 14, 1961.

It is produced using the traditional method from grapes grown within the boundaries of the territory of Franciacorta, on the hills located between the southern shore of Lake Iseo and the city of Brescia. It was awarded DOC status in 1967, the designation then also including red and white still wines. Since 1995 the DOCG classification has applied exclusively to the sparkling wines of the area.winepros.com.au. History The Franciacorta DOCG tax seal The still wines from this area have ancient traditions, referred to by Virgil and Pliny the Elder, and documented in Brescia City council books as \\"Franzacurta\\" as far back as in 1277. The name may derive from the tax-exempt (francae) status of the region's towns (curtes) in the Middle Ages.Karen MacNeil, The Wine Bible, 2nd ed. p. 404 The wines were not called Franciacorta until 1957, when Guido Berlucchi released a white wine named Pinot di Franciacorta. An ambitious young winemaker working for Berlucchi, Franco Ziliani, was permitted to pursue an ambition of producing a fine sparkling wine, and in 1961 was allowed to produce for release 3,000 bottles of a sparkling wine, also sold under the name Pinot di Franciacorta. Instant interest allowed the following vintage production to be set at 20,000 bottles, and eventually the annual production was 100,000 bottles. The national prominence that followed was soon exploited by several entrepreneurs from Milan and Brescia, and by the time the region was granted DOC status in 1967 there were 11 producers of sparkling Franciacorta, although Berlucchi represented more than 80% of the production. With its directives, Franciacorta became the first DOC to specify that its sparkling wines must be made by metodo classico. In 1990, the Consorzio per la tutela del Franciacorta was formed, instigating codes of self-regulation with a gradual reduction of yields and elimination of the use of Pinot grigio, becoming the body considered responsible for the efficient elevation of sparkling Franciacorta to DOCG status in 1995. Since August 1, 2003, Franciacorta has been the only Italian wine not obliged to declare its DOCG appellation on the label, in the same manner that a Champagne is permitted to exclude from labels its AOC. From 1996 to 2006, sales of Franciacorta grew from 2.9 million to 6.7 million bottles. According to Tom Stevenson, the Franciacorta region is \\"the only compact wine area producing world class sparkling wine in Italy\\". Conditions and regulations Vineyard in Franciacorta Chardonnay grapes in Franciacorta Grapes for Franciacorta are grown in strictly delimited vineyards in the communes, Adro, Capriolo, Cazzago San Martino, Cellatica, Coccaglio, Cologne, Corte Franca, Erbusco, Gussago, Iseo, Monticelli Brusati, Ome, Paderno Franciacorta, Paratico, Passirano, Provaglio d'Iseo, Rodengo Saiano, Rovato and Brescia, with soil conditions described as mineral-rich, granular-sized, calcareous gravel and sandy morainal soils that cover a limestone bedrock. The DOCG declared vineyards extend and the distribution of permitted grape varieties are 85% Chardonnay, 10% Pinot nero and 5% Pinot bianco. Nonvintage Franciacorta (NV) may not be released until at least 25 months after harvest, of which 18 months must be in contact with the yeast in the bottle (compared to 15 months minimum in Champagne, although many producers choose to age far longer). Franciacorta Vintage or Millesimato may not be sold until at least 37 months after harvest, of which 30 months must be in contact with the yeast (similar to Champagne). A Franciacorta ros√© must contain at least 15% Pinot nero, and may be made by blending red wine. Franciacorta Sat√®n must be a Blanc de blancs with only the use of Chardonnay and/or Pinot bianco permitted, with only 4.5 atmospheres of pressure instead of 6. The designations for dosage are exactly as those of Champagne: Pas dos√©, or Dosage z√©ro, Pas op√©r√©, or nature: maximum 2 g/l of residual sugar; Extra brut: 6 g/l; Brut: 15 g/l; Extra dry: 12‚Äì20 g/l; Sec: 17‚Äì35 g/l; Demi-sec: 33‚Äì50 g/l. Curtefranca With the creation of the DOCG Franciacorta, the former DOC was renamed Terre di Franciacorta for the still wines and then in 2008, Curtefranca.The renaming was a legal requirement to avoid confusion between the DOC still wines and the DOCG sparkling wines. These are made in two types: a Burgundy-style Bianco based either on Chardonnay or Pinot bianco or a blend of both, and a Bordeaux- style Rosso based on either Cabernet Franc or Cabernet Sauvignon or both, and Merlot, with smaller amounts of Nebbiolo and Barbera. Pinot noir is permitted only in the DOCG sparkling wines, with no option of a Burgundian-style still red wine under the DOC rules.

Symptoms are most common during infection by Entamoeba histolytica. Amoebiasis can be present with no, mild, or severe symptoms. Symptoms may include abdominal pain, diarrhea, or bloody diarrhea. Complications can include inflammation and ulceration of the colon with tissue death or perforation, which may result in peritonitis. People affected may develop anemia due to loss of blood. Cysts of Entamoeba can survive for up to a month in soil or for up to 45 minutes under fingernails. Invasion of the intestinal lining results in bloody diarrhea. If the parasite reaches the bloodstream it can spread through the body, most frequently ending up in the liver where it can cause amoebic liver abscesses. Liver abscesses can occur without previous diarrhea. Diagnosis is typical by stool examination using a microscope, but may not reliably exclude infection or separate between specific types. An increased white blood cell count may be present in severe cases. The most accurate test is finding specific antibodies in the blood, but it may remain positive following treatment. Bacterial colitis can result in similar symptoms. Prevention of amoebiasis is by improved sanitation, including separating food and water from faeces. There is no vaccine. There are two treatment options depending on the location of the infection. Amoebiasis in tissues is treated with either metronidazole, tinidazole, nitazoxanide, dehydroemetine or chloroquine, while luminal infection is treated with diloxanide furoate or iodoquinoline. Effective treatment against all stages of the disease may require a combination of medications. Infections without symptoms do not require treatment but infected individuals can spread the parasite to others and treatment can be considered. Treatment of other Entamoeba infections apart from E. histolytica is not needed. Amoebiasis is present all over the world, though most cases occur in the developing world. About 480 million people are currently infected with about 40 million new cases per year with significant symptoms. This results in the death of between 40,000‚Äì110,000 people a year. Most infections are now believed due to E. dispar. E. dispar is more common in certain areas and symptomatic cases may be less common than previously reported. The first case of amoebiasis was documented in 1875 and in 1891 the disease was described in detail, resulting in the terms amoebic dysentery and amoebic liver abscess. Further evidence from the Philippines in 1913 found that upon swallowing cysts of E. histolytica volunteers developed the disease.  Signs and symptoms  Most infected people, about 90%, are asymptomatic, but this disease has the potential to become serious. It is estimated that about 40,000 to 100,000 people worldwide die annually due to amoebiasis.Atlas of Human Infectious Diseases, First Edition. Heiman F.L. Wertheim, Peter Horby and John P. Woodall., 2012, Blackwell Publishing Ltd. Infections can sometimes last for years if there is no treatment. Symptoms take from a few days to a few weeks to develop and manifest themselves, but usually it is about two to four weeks. Symptoms can range from mild diarrhea to dysentery with blood, coupled with intense abdominal pains. Extra-intestinal complications might also arise as a result of invasive infection which includes colitis, liver, lung, or brain abscesses. The blood comes from bleeding lesions created by the amoebae invading the lining of the colon. In about 10% of invasive cases the amoebae enter the bloodstream and may travel to other organs in the body. Most commonly this means the liver, as this is where blood from the intestine reaches first, but they can end up almost anywhere in the body. Onset time is highly variable and the average asymptomatic infection persists for over a year. It is theorized that the absence of symptoms or their intensity may vary with such factors as strain of amoeba, immune response of the host, and perhaps associated bacteria and viruses. In asymptomatic infections, the amoeba lives by eating and digesting bacteria and food particles in the gut, a part of the gastrointestinal tract. It does not usually come in contact with the intestine itself due to the protective layer of mucus that lines the gut. Disease occurs when amoeba comes in contact with the cells lining the intestine. It then secretes the same substances it uses to digest bacteria, which include enzymes that destroy cell membranes and proteins. This process can lead to penetration and digestion of human tissues, resulting first in flask-shaped ulcerations in the intestine. Entamoeba histolytica ingests the destroyed cells by phagocytosis and is often seen with red blood cells (a process known as erythrophagocytosis) inside when viewed in stool samples. Especially in Latin America, a granulomatous mass (known as an amoeboma) may form in the wall of the ascending colon or rectum due to long-lasting immunological cellular response, and is sometimes confused with cancer. The ingestion of one viable cyst may cause an infection. Steroid therapy can lead to severe amoebic colitis in persons with asymptomatic or symptomatic E. histolytica infection. Severe amoebic colitis is associated with high mortality, and on average more than 50% with severe colitis die. Cause Amoebiasis is an infection caused by the amoeba Entamoeba histolytica. Likewise amoebiasis is sometimes incorrectly used to refer to infection with other amoebae, but strictly speaking it should be reserved for Entamoeba histolytica infection. Other amoebae infecting humans include:Berger SA, Marr JS. Human Parasitic Diseases Sourcebook. Jones and Bartlett Publishers: Sudbury, Massachusetts, 2006. * Parasites ** Dientamoeba fragilis, which causes Dientamoebiasis ** Entamoeba dispar ** Entamoeba hartmanni ** Entamoeba coli ** Entamoeba polecki ** Entamoeba bangladeshi ** Entamoeba moshkovskii ** Endolimax nana and ** Iodamoeba butschlii. Except for Dientamoeba, the parasites above are not thought to cause disease. * Free living amoebas. at Orphanet These species are often described as \\"opportunistic free-living amoebas\\" as human infection is not an obligate part of their life cycle. ** Naegleria fowleri, which causes primary amoebic meningoencephalitis ** Acanthamoeba, which causes cutaneous amoebiasis and Acanthamoeba keratitis and sometimes migrates to the brain. ** Balamuthia mandrillaris, which causes both skin and brain infections. ** Sappinia diploidea = Transmission = Life- cycle of the Entamoeba histolytica Amoebiasis is usually transmitted by the fecal-oral route, but it can also be transmitted indirectly through contact with dirty hands or objects as well as by anal-oral contact. Infection is spread through ingestion of the cyst form of the parasite, a semi-dormant and hardy structure found in feces. Any non-encysted amoebae, or trophozoites, die quickly after leaving the body but may also be present in stool: these are rarely the source of new infections. Since amoebiasis is transmitted through contaminated food and water, it is often endemic in regions of the world with limited modern sanitation systems, including M√©xico, Central America, western South America, South Asia, and western and southern Africa. Amoebic dysentery is one form of traveler's diarrhea, although most traveler's diarrhea is bacterial or viral in origin.  Pathogenesis  Tissue damage caused by E. histolytica is a result of three main events, host cell death, inflammation, and parasite invasion. Abbreviations: EhMIF, E. histolytica macrophage migration inhibitory factor; MMP, matrix metalloproteinases. Amoebiasis results from tissue destruction induced by the E. histolytica parasite. E. histolytica causes tissue damage by three main events: direct host cell killing, inflammation, and parasite invasion.  Diagnosis  With colonoscopy it is possible to detect small ulcers of between 3‚Äì5mm, but diagnosis may be difficult as the mucous membrane between these areas can look either healthy or inflamed. Trophozoites may be identified at the ulcer edge or within the tissue, using immunohistochemical staining with specific anti-E. histolytica antibodies. Asymptomatic human infections are usually diagnosed by finding cysts shed in the stool. Various flotation or sedimentation procedures have been developed to recover the cysts from fecal matter and stains help to visualize the isolated cysts for microscopic examination. Since cysts are not shed constantly, a minimum of three stools are examined. In symptomatic infections, the motile form (the trophozoite) is often seen in fresh feces. Serological tests exist, and most infected individuals (with symptoms or not) test positive for the presence of antibodies. The levels of antibody are much higher in individuals with liver abscesses. Serology only becomes positive about two weeks after infection. More recent developments include a kit that detects the presence of amoeba proteins in the feces, and another that detects ameba DNA in feces. These tests are not in widespread use due to their expense. Microscopy is still by far the most widespread method of diagnosis around the world. However it is not as sensitive or accurate in diagnosis as the other tests available. It is important to distinguish the E. histolytica cyst from the cysts of nonpathogenic intestinal protozoa such as Entamoeba coli by its appearance. E. histolytica cysts have a maximum of four nuclei, while the commensal Entamoeba coli cyst has up to 8 nuclei. Additionally, in E. histolytica, the endosome is centrally located in the nucleus, while it is usually off-center in Entamoeba coli. Finally, chromatoidal bodies in E. histolytica cysts are rounded, while they are jagged in Entamoeba coli. However, other species, Entamoeba dispar and E. moshkovskii, are also commensals and cannot be distinguished from E. histolytica under the microscope. As E. dispar is much more common than E. histolytica in most parts of the world this means that there is a lot of incorrect diagnosis of E. histolytica infection taking place. The WHO recommends that infections diagnosed by microscopy alone should not be treated if they are asymptomatic and there is no other reason to suspect that the infection is actually E. histolytica. Detection of cysts or trophozoites stools under microscope may require examination of several samples over several days to determine if they are present, because cysts are shed intermittently and may not show up in every sample. Typically, the organism can no longer be found in the feces once the disease goes extra-intestinal. Serological tests are useful in detecting infection by E. histolytica if the organism goes extra-intestinal and in excluding the organism from the diagnosis of other disorders. An Ova & Parasite (O&P;) test or an E. histolytica fecal antigen assay is the proper assay for intestinal infections. Since antibodies may persist for years after clinical cure, a positive serological result may not necessarily indicate an active infection. A negative serological result, however, can be equally important in excluding suspected tissue invasion by E. histolytica. Stool antigen detection tests have helped to overcome some of the limitations of stool microscopy. Antigen detection tests are easy to use, but they have variable sensitivity and specificity, especially in low-endemic areas. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is considered the gold standard for diagnosis but remains underutilized.

Prevention  Specimen of the human intestine that was damaged by amebic ulcer. To help prevent the spread of amoebiasis around the home : * Wash hands thoroughly with soap and hot running water for at least 10 seconds after using the toilet or changing a baby's diaper, and before handling food. * Clean bathrooms and toilets often; pay particular attention to toilet seats and taps. * Avoid sharing towels or face washers. To help prevent infection: * Avoid raw vegetables when in endemic areas, as they may have been fertilized using human feces. * Boil water or treat with iodine tablets. * Avoid eating street foods especially in public places where others are sharing sauces in one container Good sanitary practice, as well as responsible sewage disposal or treatment, are necessary for the prevention of E. histolytica infection on an endemic level. E.histolytica cysts are usually resistant to chlorination, therefore sedimentation and filtration of water supplies are necessary to reduce the incidence of infection. E. histolytica cysts may be recovered from contaminated food by methods similar to those used for recovering Giardia lamblia cysts from feces. Filtration is probably the most practical method for recovery from drinking water and liquid foods. E. histolytica cysts must be distinguished from cysts of other parasitic (but nonpathogenic) protozoa and from cysts of free-living protozoa as discussed above. Recovery procedures are not very accurate; cysts are easily lost or damaged beyond recognition, which leads to many falsely negative results in recovery tests.  Treatment  E. histolytica infections occur in both the intestine and (in people with symptoms) in tissue of the intestine and/or liver. Those with symptoms require treatment with two medications, an amoebicidal tissue-active agent and a luminal cysticidal agent. Individuals that are asymptomatic only need a luminal cysticidal agent.  Prognosis  Significance of Amebiasis In the majority of cases, amoebas remain in the gastrointestinal tract of the hosts. Severe ulceration of the gastrointestinal mucosal surfaces occurs in less than 16% of cases. In fewer cases, the parasite invades the soft tissues, most commonly the liver. Only rarely are masses formed (amoebomas) that lead to intestinal obstruction.(Mistaken for Ca caecum and appendicular mass) Other local complications include bloody diarrhea, pericolic and pericaecal abscess. Complications of hepatic amoebiasis includes subdiaphragmatic abscess, perforation of diaphragm to pericardium and pleural cavity, perforation to abdominal cavital (amoebic peritonitis) and perforation of skin (amoebiasis cutis). Pulmonary amoebiasis can occur from liver lesions by spread through the blood or by perforation of pleural cavity and lung. It can cause lung abscess, pulmono pleural fistula, empyema lung and broncho pleural fistula. It can also reach the brain through blood vessels and cause amoebic brain abscess and amoebic meningoencephalitis. Cutaneous amoebiasis can also occur in skin around sites of colostomy wound, perianal region, region overlying visceral lesion and at the site of drainage of liver abscess. Urogenital tract amoebiasis derived from intestinal lesion can cause amoebic vulvovaginitis (May's disease), rectovesicle fistula and rectovaginal fistula. Entamoeba histolytica infection is associated with malnutrition and stunting of growth.  Epidemiology  Amoebiasis caused about 55,000 deaths worldwide in 2010, down from 68,000 in 1990. In older textbooks it is often stated that 10% of the world's population is infected with Entamoeba histolytica. It is now known that at least 90% of these infections are due to E. dispar. Nevertheless, this means that there are up to 50 million true E. histolytica infections and approximately seventy thousand die each year, mostly from liver abscesses or other complications. Although usually considered a tropical parasite, the first case reported (in 1875) was actually in St Petersburg in Russia, near the Arctic Circle.L√∂sch, F. (1875) Massenhafte Entwickelung von Am√∂ben im Dickdarm. Virchow's Archiv 65: 196-211. Infection is more common in warmer areas, but this is because of both poorer hygiene and the parasitic cysts surviving longer in warm moist conditions. History Amoebiasis was first described by Fedor A. L√∂sch in 1875, in northern Russia. The most dramatic incident in the US was the Chicago World's Fair outbreak in 1933, caused by contaminated drinking water. There were more than a thousand cases, with 98 deaths. It has been known since 1897 that at least one non-disease-causing species of Entamoeba existed (Entamoeba coli), but it was first formally recognized by the WHO in 1997 that E. histolytica was two species, despite this having first been proposed in 1925. In addition to the now-recognized E. dispar, evidence shows there are at least two other species of Entamoeba that look the same in humans: E. moshkovskii and Entamoeba bangladeshi. The reason these species haven't been differentiated until recently is because of the reliance on appearance. Joel Connolly of the Chicago Bureau of Sanitary Engineering brought the outbreak to an end when he found that defective plumbing permitted sewage to contaminate drinking water. In 1998 there was an outbreak of amoebiasis in the Republic of Georgia. Between 26 May and 3 September 1998, 177 cases were reported, including 71 cases of intestinal amoebiasis and 106 probable cases of liver abscess. The Nicobarese people have attested to the medicinal properties found in Glochidion calocarpum, a plant common to India, saying that its bark and seed are most effective in curing abdominal disorders associated with amoebiasis.See p. 412 in:  References  External links  * Amoebiasis - Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Category:Intestinal infectious diseases Category:Waterborne diseases Category:Neglected tropical diseases Category:Tropical diseases Category:Wikipedia medicine articles ready to translate Category:RTTID  Srinivasa Ramanujan  Srinivasa Ramanujan FRS (/Ààsr…™n…™v…ëÀês r…ëÀêÀàm…ëÀên äd í…ôn/; born Srinivasa Ramanujan Aiyangar; 22 December 1887 ‚Äì 26 April 1920) was an Indian mathematician who lived during the British Rule in India.

His career includes playing competitively on tour, head golf professional at Milwaukee Country Club one of America's most esteemed golf clubs, and a career of teaching both tour professional and amateur golfers. Among the tour professionals he has taught are Masters champion Tommy Aaron, U.S. Women's Open champion Carol Mann, du Maurier Classic champion Martha Nause and Women's British Open champion Sherri Steinhauer.

De la Torre won numerous golf tournaments, including the Wisconsin State Open five timesWisconsin State Open winners and the Wisconsin PGA Professional Championship five times.Wisconsin PGA Professional Championship winners He was elected to the Wisconsin Golf Hall of Fame in 1975.Wisconsin State Golf Association - Hall of Fame In 1999 he was inducted into the Northwestern University Athletic Hall of Fame. Teaching origins De la Torre was born in his parents' apartment above the golf shop at the Real Club de la Puerta de Hierro in Madrid, Spain, where his father √Ångel de la Torre was the head golf professional. Angel was five-time Spanish National Golf Champion. Manuel's father's instruction and that of his father's friend and colleague Ernest Jones, served as the basis for de la Torre's instruction. His concepts for golf instruction have stood the test of time for over 60 years. He retired as head golf professional at Milwaukee Country Club at which he continued to teach amateurs and tour professionals. Alternative approach Golf instruction can be divided into two approaches. That which constitutes more than 90% of today's golf instruction is body-focused. The central premise of this type of golf instruction is built around the idea that if the golfer learns to correctly move various body parts (hips, legs, shoulders, etc.) the result will be a movement of the golf club that will produce effective golf shots. That which constitutes the other 10% of golf instruction is club- focused. Its central premise is that the golfer should instead focus on learning how the golf club should move during an effective swing. De la Torre has devoted his career to refining and teaching this approach to both golfers and instructors. The difference between these two approaches may seem minor at first consideration. However, any student (or instructor) who has experienced both will immediately appreciate the simplicity of de la Torre's golf instruction which is unique among the leading golf instructors. De la Torre brings to light the absurdity of thinking that the cause of a poor shot is related to what your body is doing (e.g. Hips are too fast, arms are too slow, shoulder turn is off plane, etc.) He correctly observes that if the club is moving correctly, there is nothing you can do with your body that produce a poor shot. Conversely, if the club is moving incorrectly, there is nothing you can do with your body that will correct the problem and avoid the poor shot. By way of analogy, regardless of what he does with his body, if the marksman does the right thing with the rifle, the bullet must hit the target. If the golfer does the right thing with the golf club, the ball must go to the target. Not only does this approach identify and deal with the single factor that determines the outcome of each shot (i.e. the movement of the golf club), it enables the golf instruction to be highly simplified. For beginners, this means golf is far more comprehendable and achievable. For experienced golfers, his instruction has been a relief from their efforts to manage the many parts of the body and therefore a lifting of the unnecessary burden carried by too many golfers. For tour professionals, this simplicity enables a more manageable swing that better withstands the pressures of competition. He therefore has made a life's career and many satisfied clients by diagnosing and then fixing the motion of the club. Body-focused instruction is problematic because: *no two golfers' bodies are exactly alike, *it asks golfers to consciously control body motions that are by their nature unconsciously controlled, *it asks the golfer to address too many things during the 2.5 seconds required for a golf swing, and *demands that all body motions be correct in order to achieve the desired result. By contrast, club- focused instruction teaches: *how the club moves for an effective swing, *the club's movement is universal for every player and every club, and *a lesson simple enough to accomplish during those same 2.5 seconds. The club-focused instruction long advocated by de la Torre and Jones prior to him has now been validated by new research performed by Dr. Gabrieale Wulf at the University of Las Vegas and by Dr. Bob Christina at the University of North Carolina. In their studies players of all skill levels improved faster when given club- focused instruction. Death De la Torre died on 24 April 2016 at his home in Milwaukee, Wisconsin from complications of a stroke, age 94.

He was a 19th-century industrialist, active in his family's iron business which was a branch of the Stirling Iron Works, the maker of the Hudson River Chain that prevented the British Royal Navy from sailing up the Hudson River during the American Revolutionary War. He was active in Albany politics, serving as an alderman and one term as mayor. He also served as Adjutant General of New York from 1869-1873. BiographyBirth and family= General Franklin Townsend was born on September 28, 1821 to Isaiah and Hannah Townsend Townsend in Albany New York. Franklin's brothers were Howard Townsend, a prominent doctor; Frederick Townsend, a Union officer in the American Civil War; and Robert Townsend, a ship's commander in the American Civil War who lost his life while on duty in China. Townsend's maternal grandfather was Solomon Townsend, a midshipman in the Colonial United States Navy, merchant ship captain, and active in the iron business in New York State through the Augusta Forge which he established in Tuxedo, New York. It could be said that iron ran in the family's blood since Townsend's great uncle, Peter Townsend, established and ran the Stirling Iron Works which forged the great Hudson River Chain which was strung across the Hudson River just south of the important American base at West Point, New York. On January 15, 1852 Franklin Townsend married Anna Josephine King, the daughter of Rufus H. King, a U.S. Representative from New York, and Amelia Laverty King, in Albany. They had two children: *Rufus King Townsend (born in Albany New York March 18, 1853; died there December 21, 1895), who was educated at The Albany Academy and at Williams College and eventually headed his father's iron business. *Franklin Townsend, Jr. (born in Albany on November 4, 1854; died there on October 31, 1895), who was educated at The Albany Academy and Williams College and studied at the College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York City. After graduation he received practical medical training in Germany and built his career practicing medicine in Albany where he was highly respected. =Iron business= Franklin Townsend's father, Isaiah established his own metals business in partnership with his brother John 1804 called \\"I & J Townsend\\" The firm was involved in the buying and selling of iron and produced in their foundry machine castings and railcar wheels. Franklin joined the business as a young man in 1849 upon the death of his uncle John Townsend along with John's son Theodore, (Franklin's first cousin). In 1856 he changed the business to a sole proprietor by the name of \\"Franklin Townsend & Co.\\" until 1871 when his older son Rufus King Townsend succeeded him. =Military career= Grave of General Franklin Townsend and wife Anna Josephine King located at the Albany Rural Cemetery When civil war broke out in the United States, Townsend became involved in raising the One Hundred and Thirteenth Regiment which in December 1862 was converted to the Seventh Heavy Artillery. Recruitment lasted from July 24, 1862 to August 18 and raised 1,100 men. The regiment left Albany the next day bound for Washington. Townsend was appointed Adjutant General of New York for five years January 1, 1869 to 1873. =Political career= Townsend was active in Albany city politics, serving as a supervisor and alderman. On April 9, 1850, he was elected as a Whig the 47th Mayor of Albany, following in the footsteps of his uncle John Townsend, the 37th Mayor of Albany. Franklin Townsend was a Democratic member of the New York State Assembly (Albany Co., 4th D.) in 1857. =Commercial interests= In addition to his involvement in the family's iron business, Townsend was president of the New York State National Bank 1867 to 1879 and vice president of the Albany Savings Bank. =Death= Franklin Townsend died at his home at 4 Elk Street, Albany NY on September 11, 1898.

He won ten caps for Wales and was selected to play in the 1930 British Lions tour of New Zealand and Australia. Club career Parker first played for Swansea in 1923, and in 1924 he was part of the Swansea team that played the 1924 touring New Zealand team. Swansea lost heavily, but when Parker scored with a penalty kick he was the first person to score against the tourists, even though the game was the fifth of the series.Billot (1972), p. 59. Parker was Swansea's lead scorer over five consecutive seasons between 1925/26 and 1929/30. He was also chosen to captain Swansea in the 1927/28 season. International career Parker was first chosen to represent Wales in a match against Ireland as part of the 1924 Five Nations Championship. The Welsh team saw ten changes from the prior game against Scotland, which Wales had lost 10‚Äì35 and Parker was one of six new caps, five of them in the pack. Played in front of the Prince of Wales at the Cardiff Arms Park, Wales lost narrowly. The selectors kept faith in Parker and he was chosen to play in the next game, away to France. Wales were victorious, halting a losing streak of four matches, thanks to a drop goal from Vincent Griffiths. Parker was next selected for Wales to face the same touring New Zealand team he had lost to playing for Swansea in 1924. Under the captaincy of Jack Wetter, Wales were outclassed by the All Black's speed and combination play. Parker worked tirelessly in the packBillot (1972), p. 68. along with Steve Morris and Charlie Pugh, but were let down by uninspiring back play. Teddy Morgan, writing in the Western Mail, commented that \\"The Welsh side hardly deserved a score, though the forwards surpassed themselves.\\" Parker played the entire 1925 Five Nations Championship, one of only three players in the pack to hold their position throughout the tournament, the others being Aberavon's Bryn Phillips and Llanelli's Idris Jones. Although Wales lost three of the four games, Parker scored in two of the games, a conversion in the win over France and a conversion and a penalty goal in a loss to Scotland. Parker missed the next three Championships, but was reselected for the 1929 tournament. Parker was back on the score sheet converting one of the two tries in a victory over the French. In the final match of the Championship, Parker converted a try by Frank Williams to steal a draw with Ireland. Parker's final international cap was in the opening game of the 1930 campaign, a draw with England at the Arms Park. In 1930, Parker was selected to join the British Lions in their tour of Australia and New Zealand. Parker played in all five tests of the tour, scoring a penalty goal in the fourth test against New Zealand in Wellington. On the tour he was often used as a hooker, playing in that position for all four New Zealand tests.Dai Parker.

Members of the family wielded considerable power, especially from the 14th to the 17th centuries in Castile. The family originated from the village of Mendoza in the province of √Ålava in the Basque countries, with the seigneury becoming part of the Kingdom of Castile during the reign of Alfonso XI (1312‚Äì1350). The Mendozas participated in Castilian politics afterward, with its scions becoming advisers, administrators, and clerics. Its different branches and name expanded out of its original nucleus in later centuries. The place-name and surname Mendoza stems from two Basque words: \\"mend(i)\\"+\\"oza\\", meaning 'cold mountain', with a dropped \\"i\\" in between. Prehistory The Tower of Mendoza in √Ålava √Ålava is a hilly region with a core flat area (the Plains of √Ålava) bounded at the time by the kingdoms of Castile, and the Navarre in the 13th and 14th century. It had been loosely controlled by Navarre earlier, and retained its own distinctive customs and traditions. The town of Mendoza and the province of √Ålava itself was also a battlefield, where the clashing noble families of the area settled their disputes for generations. In 1332, the Mendozas had already been there at least a century, struggling with the rival clans, such as the Ayala, Orozco, and Velasco. They traced themselves as a stem of the House of Haro, another powerful clan of the Basque countries. Once the Castilian Civil War came to an end with the triumph of Queen Isabella of Castile, the Basque interclan warfare generally ended as well, but even way before, since the 14th century, the Mendoza were jostling for position and privilege in Castile, an expanding military power. By virtue of the Mendozas' status as knights and free men, they became Castilian nobility with √Ålava's annexation (hidalgos). All members of the noble class were knights, administrators, or lawyers, and served in the administration of the realm. The largest family's responsibility was to form and maintain a local army that could make available if called by the king. The highest nobility became direct vassals of the king. The Mendozas in the 14th centuryGonz√°lo Y√°√±ez de Mendoza= The first Mendoza to occupy a high position in Castile was Gonz√°lo Y√°√±ez de Mendoza. During the Reconquista, he fought in the Battle of R√≠o Salado in 1340 and the Siege of AHouse of Mendoza Coat of arms of the Mendoza The Mendoza family was a powerful line of Spanish nobles.

He served as chief huntsman to King Alfonso XI and settled in Guadalajara, which he ruled after marrying the sister of √ç√±igo L√≥pez de Orozco. Orozco, another person originally from √Ålava, had received the post of mayor as a reward for his military services to the king. This pattern would later be replicated in the family several times: by serving the king in war, they would receive prestigious positions. Using these positions, they would then marry into power and wealth. =Pedro Gonz√°lez de Mendoza= The son of Gonz√°lo, Pedro Gonz√°lez de Mendoza (1340-1385) participated in the Castilian Civil War. He aided the fortunes of his family greatly by siding with his stepbrother Henry II over Pedro the Cruel, as Henry's line eventually won the war. Pedro was taken prisoner by Edward, the Black Prince in the Battle of Najera, a crushing defeat for Henry's forces, but was eventually released after Edward left Pedro's side to return to England. Pedro was remembered as a hero for his actions in the Battle of Aljubarrota, another crushing Castilian defeat. When King John I's horse died, Pedro gave him his horse so that he could flee. Pedro was then slain in the battle with no way to escape. Still, his services were remembered, and the Mendoza family continued to grow in power and wealth. Pedro was also a poet whose works include examples of the Galician tradition, a serrana, and coplas of a Jew's love. =Diego Hurtado de Mendoza= Diego Hurtado de Mendoza inherited the fortunes of his father Pedro. He married the illegitimate daughter of King Henry II, and later married Leonor Lasso de la Vega an exceptionally powerful and well-connected widow and head of house of the prestigious House of Lasso de la Vega. That marriage united both families and their titles under the House of Mendoza. King Henry III appointed him Admiral of Castile, and he fought against Portugal as commander of the fleet. Still, of the three engagements he commanded, his forces lost in all of them. When he died, he was considered among the richest men in Castile. The Mendozas in the 15th century√ç√±igo L√≥pez de Mendoza= √ç√±igo L√≥pez de Mendoza =Pedro Gonz√°lez de Mendoza=The Mendozas in the 16th century The family loyalty demonstrated by Santillana's children did not persist through the next generation. With the cardinal dead, the family's leadership fell back in power under the constable of Castilla living in Burgos, Bernardino Fern√°ndez de Velasco, Santillana's son, an anomaly according to historian, to the detriment of √ç√±igo L√≥pez de Mendoza y Luna, Duke of the Infantado, whose house was in Guadalajara. Bernardino would be the one to guide Mendoza throughout the critical years, in which the crown went from the Trast√°mara to the Habsburgo. But the constable found himself at the front of Mendozas less willing to follow orders from a sole leader. The same dimensions of power that the cardinal had assured the young generation of the family allowed its members to undertake more independent political careers. =Decline and fall= The Palace of Infantado in Guadalajara did not cease to make up the family's material centre. The Mendozas that stayed in Castilla accepted the constable's leadership, but even in this group disputes surfaced, especially between the Infantado and the Count of Coru√±a, who weakened the family's cohesion as a political and military unit. The family unit was even more threatened by the acts of two of Santillana's grandson: the cardinal's eldest son Rodrigo, marquis of the Cenete, and the second Count of Tendilla. =Rodrigo D√≠az de Vivar y Mendoza= The marquis of Cenete and the Count of Cid acted, in all aspects, totally independent from the Mendoza group, stimulated by their haughty and arrogant character. From his bases in Granada where, thanks to his father‚Äîthe cardinal‚Äîhe possessed vast domains, he occupied the post of prison governor of Guadix and came to form part of the Council of Granada. Cenete developed a career marked by audacity, opportunism, and scandal. In 1502 he secretly married and in 1506 he kidnapped the woman with home Isabel the Catholic had forbidden him from marrying. In 1514 he was accused by the Crown of entering the city of Valencia completely armed, without royal sanction, and in 1523 he joined forces with his younger brother, the Count of M√©lito, once again without permission, to quell the revolt of the thieves' slang. In 1535, his second daughter, heiress to the title and fortune, married the heir of the Count of Infantado, returning the titles to the central house of the Mendozas. =Diego Hurtado de Mendoza= The career of Diego Hurtado de Mendoza, Count of M√©lito and older brother to the Marquis of Cenete, presents totally different features. M√©lito carried out a moderately important role as viceroy of Valencia during the first years of Charles V's reign, during the Revolt of the Brotherhoods. =Ana de Mendoza y de la Cerda= Granddaughter of the Count of M√©lito, she married Ruy G√≥mez de Silva, the favourite of Felipe II, in 1553. The couple, who in 1559 received the title of Princes of √âboli, became the centre of a political party in the Court. Before the politics of the Duke of Alba of a \\"closed Spain\\", the Mendozas were promoters of a Spain \\"open\\" to new ideas. The period, marked by the ascending politics of the √âboli in Castilla, that goes from 1555 until the death of Ruy G√≥mez in 1573. This politics of an \\"open Spain\\" was not typical of the House of Mendoza as a whole, but rather of the branches of the family that came from the cardinal Mendoza, for which he had created proper bases of power in the kingdoms of Granada and Valencia. =√ç√±igo L√≥pez de Mendoza y Qui√±ones= The most famous and capable of Santillana's grandsons was the second Count of Tendilla. Thanks to his uncle's influence, the cardinal of Mendoza, Tendilla was named captain general of the kingdom of Granada and prison governor of Alhambra. He was capable of dazzling gestures like his cousin the Marquis of Cenete, but was intensely loyal to Ferdinand the Catholic: during the disputes about the succession that arose after 1504, he was one of the only noble Castilians that remained loyal to Fernando and was opposed to the efforts of Felipe I of Castile to be done with the kingdom. Each time more absorbed in the problems of the kingdom of Granada, Tendilla isolated himself from the rest of his family, becoming more conservative and convinced that his house was the only one that remained loyal to the family traditions of the Mendozas. =Lope Hurtado de Mendoza = Born in 1499, he was the youngest son of Juan Hurtado D√≠az de Mendoza y Salcedo, Lord of Legarda, Salcedo, and the Bujada, major of Vizcaya. Since he was not the heir to the title of major he was sent to Court, where he prospered and came to occupy important positions, being named as member of the Council of the Kingdom and Main Butler of Margarita de Austria. He served also as governor of Or√°n and ambassador before the courts of Portugal, Germany, and Rome. He inherited from his father the Lordship of the Bujada and in 1539 he was named commander of the charge of Villarubia de Oca√±a by the emperor Carlos V. He was first married to Teresa Ugarte, heiress to the Lordship of Astobiza. His second wife was margarita de Rojas, with whom he had Fernando de Mendoza, who was distinguished for his career and the military and came to be General of the coast of Granada and Knight Commander of Sancti Spiritus in Alc√°ntara. He died in October 1558. Family Policy During most of the reign of the Catholic Monarchs no serious conflicts arose between the nobles or crises occurred nationally able to test the cohesion of the family. Tendilla and cousins, separated from the main branch by the expansion of a prolific family and geographic dispersion of their political careers, were delivered, every one by his side, to ensure success without further consideration to the family as a whole. When probate litigation generated, again, serious conflicts in Castile, Mendoza could not or would not act as a group, particularly Tendilla adopted positions against the rest of the family. In the atmosphere of crisis and rebellion that gripped Castile death of Isabella in 1504, the Mendoza family was forced to choose between their traditional political support for the Trast√°mara dynasty, whose last representative was Ferdinand, who had cemented the family's success in the past and set the new policy, or to support the new dynasty of Burgundy. The third Duke of the Infantry, the nominal head of Mendozas, and the constable, who actually ran the affairs of the family, favored the Burgundy. Tendilla preferred to keep the tradition. While Castile was under Trast√°mara government, its policy was successful, when it became clear that the dynasty would die out in Castile, the position taken by Tendilla proved detrimental to its political and material prosperity, preventing the family act together and weakening Mendoza efficiency of the whole.

Life Peter Behrens was the illegitimate son of an American GI, and was put up for adoption by his biological mother. He was adopted by the Behrens family, where he grew up in northern Germany. After graduating from high school in Jaderberg, he studied at a college nearby, but quit a short while later. Subsequently, he toured as a drummer in several bands, playing throughout northern Germany, and for half a year throughout Africa. In 1971 he played in the Krautrock band Silberbart, who released an album of psychedelic hard rock, now very popular among collectors. Nearing the end of the 1970s, he attended the Milan circus school, and worked briefly as a clown and pantomime artist. Together with Stephan Remmler and Gert \\"Kralle\\" Krawinkel, Behrens was a member of the German band Trio in the early 1980s, where he played the drums. The band became known particularly through the minimalist title Da Da Da, as part of the New German Wave. The other two members met Behrens through a newspaper advertisement. Behrens was known for his somewhat formal attire: white T-shirt, white pants, red suspenders/braces and red shoes. His hairstyle incorporated an upward coil similar to that of Moritz of Max and Moritz. He adopted this appearance before clown school and Trio. He used to play the drums standing upright in a rigid manner with a stony expression, which contributed to the distinctive appearance of the band. After Trio disbanded in 1986, and after overcoming alcoholism and a severe drug problem, he dedicated himself to his work as a social worker on the streets of Bremerhaven and Wilhelmshaven. As a solo artist, he was not successful. He interpreted songs, including the official song for the European Football Championship 1988, Das Tor, Dep De D√∂ Dep, a cover version of \\"Tom's Diner\\" by Suzanne Vega. In the late 1980s, Peter Behrens appeared in a few films. In his first three of these (Andre Handles Them All, Drei gegen Drei and Tausend Augen), he played even bigger roles. In Manta ‚Äì Der Film, he played a minimal supporting role. In 2005 and 2006, he joined Frl. Menke performing in a musical in Hamburg. After this musical ended its run, he again played drums in a band. In 2008, under the name Peter Behrens (Ex-Trio) & Drei Mann im Doppelbett a song called \\"drei zwei\\", written by three Trio-fans, was published, for which a music video was produced. There is also a music video clip titled \\"Goldene Zeiten\\" (Golden Times) directed by Carsten Freckmann of the group Art & Weise from 2014 with Peter Behrens as a clown. Behrens had two children and lived in Wilhelmshaven, where he died on 11 May 2016 from multiple organ failure. He was 68.

He later served as a pilot in the Korean War and was shot down in 1952, making him the most recent major leaguer to be killed in battle. Baseball career Born in Talihina, Oklahoma in 1917, Bob Neighbors graduated from Hominy High School and spent one year at Oklahoma Baptist University, Shawnee, Oklahoma, then he signed with the Siloam Springs Travelers of the Arkansas‚ÄìMissouri League in 1936. He batted .279 in 118 games with 16 home runs and 86 RBIs. Neighbors produced similar numbers with the Travelers in 1937, and was called up by the Browns in September, but did not get into a major league game. In 1938, he joined the Palestine Pals of the East Texas League and hit .301 in 139 games. The shortstop moved up to the Springfield Browns of the Class B Three-I League in 1939, and his 14 home runs and 80 RBIs in 119 games earned him a second late-season call-up to the big club. The 21-year-old made his major league debut on September 16, 1939, and appeared in seven games, getting two hits ‚Äî including a home run in Fenway Park off future Browns star Denny Galehouse ‚Äî in eleven at-bats. Neighbors returned to the minors in 1940, batting .279 for the Toledo Mud Hens of the American Association, one step below the majors. In January 1941, Neighbors married Winifred Wilcox, and the newly married couple moved to San Antonio, where Bob played for the Texas League's San Antonio Missions in 1941. That summer, tragedy struck: while Bob was on the road with the team at the time, Winifred was hit by a car and killed. \\"It had a bad effect on Bob\\", his younger brother Morris said later. \\"Bob was on the road and Winnie back home in San Antonio when it happened. He felt that if he had been there -- if he had a job where he wasn't traveling -- it wouldn't have happened.\\" Neighbors struggled to a .216 average and when World War II broke out he quit organized baseball to join the Army Air Corps. Military career Neighbors entered military service with the United States Army Air Forces at Tulsa, Oklahoma on May 8, 1942. He served with the 22nd Air Transport Training Detachment at Sheppard Field in Wichita Falls, Texas, where he played baseball for the Sheppard Field Mechanics, a team that featured Dave Short of the Chicago White Sox, Ray Poole of the Philadelphia Athletics, Bill Gray of the Pacific Coast League's Hollywood Stars and future big-leaguer Ray Murray. Neighbors later served at Maxwell Field in Montgomery, Alabama, where he met his second wife, Katherine \\"Kitty\\" Burke. He also served in California at Fairfield-Suisun Army Airfield and Hamilton Army Airfield, where he also had the opportunity to play ball. At war's end, Bob Neighbors decided against returning to professional baseball, remaining in the military, although he did manage and play for the Maxwell Field team. Kitty gave birth to a son, Robert Cameron Neighbors, in 1950. Major Neighbors saw combat duty during the Korean War as a Douglas Invader pilot with the 13th Bomb Squadron of the 3rd Bomb Group. On August 8, 1952, during a night mission, Neighbors and his crew ‚Äì First-Lieutenant William Holcom and Staff-Sergeant Grady Weeks ‚Äì reported they had been hit and were bailing out.

Definition If H is a Hilbert space, then L1,‚àû(H) is the space of compact linear operators T on H such that the norm :\\\\T\\\\_{1,\\\\infty} = \\\\sup_N\\\\frac{\\\\sum_{i=1}^N \\\\mu_i(T)}{\\\\log(N)} is finite, where the numbers Œºi(T) are the eigenvalues of T arranged in decreasing order. Let :a_N = \\\\frac{\\\\sum_{i=1}^N \\\\mu_i(T)}{\\\\log(N)}. The Dixmier trace Trœâ(T) of T is defined for positive operators T of L1,‚àû(H) to be :\\\\operatorname{Tr}_\\\\omega(T)= \\\\lim_\\\\omega a_N where limœâ is a scale-invariant positive \\"extension\\" of the usual limit, to all bounded sequences. In other words, it has the following properties: *limœâ(Œ±n) ‚â• 0 if all Œ±n ‚â• 0 (positivity) *limœâ(Œ±n) = lim(Œ±n) whenever the ordinary limit exists *limœâ(Œ±1, Œ±1, Œ±2, Œ±2, Œ±3, ...) = limœâ(Œ±n) (scale invariance) There are many such extensions (such as a Banach limit of Œ±1, Œ±2, Œ±4, Œ±8,...) so there are many different Dixmier traces. As the Dixmier trace is linear, it extends by linearity to all operators of L1,‚àû(H). If the Dixmier trace of an operator is independent of the choice of limœâ then the operator is called measurable. Properties *Trœâ(T) is linear in T. *If T ‚â• 0 then Trœâ(T) ‚â• 0 *If S is bounded then Trœâ(ST) = Trœâ(TS) *Trœâ(T) does not depend on the choice of inner product on H. *Trœâ(T) = 0 for all trace class operators T, but there are compact operators for which it is equal to 1. A trace œÜ is called normal if œÜ(sup xŒ±) = sup œÜ( xŒ±) for every bounded increasing directed family of positive operators. Any normal trace on L^{1,\\\\infty}(H) is equal to the usual trace, so the Dixmier trace is an example of a non-normal trace. Examples A compact self-adjoint operator with eigenvalues 1, 1/2, 1/3, ... has Dixmier trace equal to 1. If the eigenvalues Œºi of the positive operator T have the property that :\\\\zeta_T(s)= \\\\operatorname{Tr}(T^s)= \\\\sum{\\\\mu_i^s} converges for Re(s)>1 and extends to a meromorphic function near s=1 with at most a simple pole at s=1, then the Dixmier trace of T is the residue at s=1 (and in particular is independent of the choice of œâ). showed that Wodzicki's noncommutative residue of a pseudodifferential operator on a manifold is equal to its Dixmier trace.

It is held on Independence Day, July 4. History The Molalla Buckeroo has been held annually since September 1913, when the railroad came to town. During the early years, the local firemen sponsored the rodeo as an equipment fundraiser. In 1923, the Molalla Buckeroo Association was formed and took over the operation of the Rodeo. No Buckeroo was held in 1917‚Äì18, 1942‚Äì45 nor 2020. =Mission= #Support community charitable programs, organizations, and causes #Support and promote a family oriented community event #Preserve the oldest form of American Heritage, the rodeo #Promote tourism and development in Clackamas County = Logo = The Molalla Buckeroo began work to re-design their logo in early 2006.  Organization  Currently the Molalla Buckeroo Rodeo Association, a nonprofit corporation, has over 60 active members who are all volunteers. These volunteers provide the management, production, and labor to ensure the continued success of the annual Buckeroo event, as well as helping with other events throughout the year. The Molalla Buckeroo Association is a major part of the Molalla community. The main structure of the Molalla Buckeroo Association is made up of a Board of Directors. The Board of Directors, under the association's bylaws allow up to 50 directors. There is also Honorary members, who have been elected to Honorary status by the Board of Directors. Honorary members are previous regular directors that can still be active or inactive in the Association. Like Directors, Honorary Directors can vote on decisions made by the Board of Directors. Associate Members are members who have been accepted into the association by the Executive Committee. after at least 1 year, an associate member can be voted into the Association as a Director by the Board of Directors when positions open up. The Buckeroo has a seven-member executive committee that is responsible for managing the extensive and varied committee structure of this organization. The Executive committee members are elected to the committee by the Board of Directors. As a member of the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA), the Molalla Buckeroo Association puts on one of the largest rodeos in the Pacific Northwest and of the Columbia River Circuit of the PRCA. The Molalla Buckeroo was named Columbia River Circuit Rodeo of the Year in 2005.Molalla Buckeroo Homepage In addition to the annual PRCA rodeo, the Molalla Buckeroo Association also hosts several Willamette Valley Junior Rodeo Association events, BRN 4D Barrel racing, and the annual Professional Bull Riders (PBR) Ross Coleman Invitational/Make-a-Wish Foundation event.

Located on the Hudson Strait, about north-east of Quebec's northernmost settlement of Ivujivik, it is also the northernmost tip of the Ungava Peninsula, which is in turn the northernmost part of the Labrador Peninsula. Its high rocky cliffs dominate the surroundings and mark the entrance to the Digges Sound. Here the strong currents from Hudson Bay and the Hudson Strait clash, sometimes even crushing trapped animals between the ice floes. The cape is the nesting place of one of the world's largest colonies of thick-billed murre. A area alongside the Hudson Strait and including the cape itself is being considered for becoming a park. It currently is a national park reserve, which is a temporary status until the territory obtains legal status. History On Henry Hudson's last mission in 1610, he mapped the coast and named the cape \\"Wolstenholme\\" to honour Sir John Wolstenholme (1562-1639), an English merchant who sponsored the expedition and was interested in finding the Northwest Passage. Shortly after, mutineers from Hudson's expedition clashed with local Inuit on nearby Digges Islands, the second recorded encounter between Europeans and Inuit. (The first was in 1606 when the expedition of John Knight came under attack on the coast of northern Labrador. Knight and three others from the crew of the Hopedale disappeared after going ashore in a boat. The remaining eight crew members waited for Knight and his party, but the following day came under attack by a large number of hostile natives. They managed to drive off the natives and eventually found their way to the safety of open water off the coast.) In 1697, Captain Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville and his crew, in search of commercial opportunities in Hudson Bay, conducted the first commercial trades with Inuit at Cape Wolstenholme. In 1909, the Hudson's Bay Company established a trading post called Wolstenholme in Erik Cove (), a small bay just east of the cape. Its first factor was Ralph Parsons who was to develop the Arctic fox fur trade by establishing new relationships with the Inuit, who already hunted the fox. No Inuit visited or traded at the post for 2 years but eventually it turned profitable and operated until 1947. Remnants of the post can still be found here. =Alternate names and spellings= In 1744, cartographer Jacques-Nicolas Bellin named it Cap Saint-Louis. Thereafter, the two names continued to identify this cape until Wolstenholme became official in 1968. \\"C Walsingam\\" is on the 1606 map Septentrio Americaby Jodocus Hondius. The 1645 map Regiones Sub Polo Arctico by Joan Blaeu shows the name \\"C. Worsnam\\". On the 1743 map Chart of Hudson's Bay & Straits, Baffin's Bay, Davis Strait and Labrador by C. Middelton \\"C.

The balls are hollow and have two small antipodal holes. These holes accept a short length of wire deformed on the end like a rivet so that the end is bound inside the ball. The wire is then connected to another ball using the same method. Many of the balls and wires are joined together to form a chain. Because of the connection method, the chain can swivel on itself unrestrictedly, which helps prevent kinking. However, the chain has a relatively low strength. Ball chains are also sometimes known as snake link or toilet chain. The most common ball chain accessories are connectors. Each end of a connector is able to surround a ball at the end of a chain and snap over its wire connection, which holds it secure. These can be used to connect two lengths of chain, or to connect the ends of the same chain to form a loop. The connectors require no tools to apply or remove and are reusable. Other common accessories include other terminations similar to the connectors, but with a different connection on one end, such as a screw hole for semi-permanent affixing of a chain. Common uses of ball chain are for pull cords on light fixtures and ceiling fans, keychains, as retaining chains for things such as counter pens, and dogtag chains. A typical width is Size #3, or 2.4mm steel ball chain. In the jewelry industry, pure 925 Sterling Silver may be in 1mm, 1.2mm, 1.5mm, 1.8mm, and 2.2mm ball chain.

Diego Hurtado de Mendoza (1367 - June 1404) was the Admiral of Castile, 1st Lord Canete, and tenth head of the House of Mendoza. He was the son of Pedro Gonz√°lez de Mendoza I and Aldonza L√≥pez de Ayala. He was married to Leonor Lasso de la Vega, head of the powerful House of Lasso de la Vega. Biography Diego was born in the city of Guadalajara. In the spring of 1379, while only a child, his father successfully convinced King Henry II of Castile shortly before Henry's death that Diego was to be married with Henry's illegitimate daughter, Mar√≠a. A lavish wedding was soon held. His father died in the Battle of Aljubarrota (August 14, 1385), though he saved the life of King John I of Castile which substantially aided the family's standing. Diego's ascendancy was quick. King John granted him the title of Admiral of Castile. Shortly afterward, in the reign of King Henry III, Diego fought against the Portuguese fleet for possession of the Strait of Gibraltar as part of his duties as admiral. In reward for this and other expressions of loyalty, King Henry made multiple donations and grants to him, and gave Diego rule over the town of Tendilla in 1395. His first wife Mar√≠a died in childbirth, though their daughter Aldonza de Mendoza, the future Countess of Arjona, lived. Diego married again in 1394 and chose Leonor Lasso de la Vega, a descendant of the rich and powerful counts of de la Vega. In August 1398, their son √ç√±igo L√≥pez de Mendoza was born. I√±igo would become the first Marquis of Santillana. The Admiral made a will in El Espinar (Segovia) in April 1400, before a new campaign against the Portuguese began. After returning safely, he added a codicil dated May 5 of 1404 in Guadalajara. He died shortly afterward in Guadalajara, the city of his birth. His widow had to plead for her son's rights to her stepdaughter do√±a Aldonza, and before that to Alfonso Enriquez, to whom Henry III had given the title of Admiral of Castile.

He played for Bath Rugby, Sale Sharks, Plymouth Albion and Launceston. Dawe earned 5 caps for England, from 1987 to 1995. He made his debut in the Five Nations in 1987. He was selected for the Rugby World Cup finals in 1987, playing a single match, and again in 1995 when he played against Manu Samoa. That was his last England cap, earned at the age of 36, his international career being limited by the presence in the England team of Brian Moore. He won 14 major trophies during 12 years at Bath before moving on to Sale and also represented the Barbarians, South West, Cornwall and Devon. Dawe became player-coach of Plymouth Albion in 1999, making his debut for his hometown team on his 40th birthday. He is believed to be the first 50-year-old to play professional rugby, turning out for Plymouth Albion in the Championship and British & Irish Cup. He guided Plymouth from the bottom of National League Three South to National League 1 (now known as the Championship). Albion nearly went all the way to the Premiership but narrowly missed out in 2004-05, the same season they reached their first Twickenham final. On 21 November 2011 Graham was relieved of his duties as Chairman of Rugby at Plymouth Albion due to lack of finance. After leaving Albion, Dawe worked as a coaching consultant and helped out Premiership club Saracens. He was persuaded to return to Plymouth in 2015 when they were sitting bottom of the Championship and having given notice of administration. Dawe totally rebuilt the squad and they won 22 of their 30 games in National One before he left the club following a change of ownership. He helped Devon reach six County Championship finals between 2000 and 2008. He finished coaching Devon in 2010 and in 2014 took over as head coach of Cornwall, helping them to three consecutive finals, winning it in 2015 and 2016, the first time Cornwall had won consecutive titles in their history.

In Ticino, it is referred to by a number of names specific to the region, including pane riga, reale or lireta. The bread is distinguishable by its shape‚Äîit is composed of several small loaves or rolls made to be broken off by hand‚Äîand by the addition of oil to the dough, which makes the bread particularly soft. History A similar bread depicted in The Beaneater by Annibale Carracci, 1584. Up until the early 20th century, pane ticinese and other white breads were luxury foods that most Ticinesi could not afford; bread made from rye or chestnut flour was the usual fare in the Ticino mountain villages. The 1930s book Atlas of Swiss Folklore notes that the white bread made in the Ticino is distinguished from other breads by its Reihenform, or sequential form: it is composed of a number of small loaves attached to each other that are intended to be broken off by hand. One of its names in a local dialect, riia pan (\\"bread in a line\\") reflects this shape. This shape of bread was originally brought to Ticino from Italy, where it has been known for a long time. A 1584 painting by the Italian artist Annibale Carracci depicts a man eating at a table and, to his right, a bread very similar to pane ticinese. According to the Atlas of Swiss Folklore, the Pane ticinese of that time weighed 1 kilogram (2 lb) and was composed of eight loaves; it was sold whole or in parts (one half, a quarter, one eighth or one sixteenth), which were easily produced by breaking individual loaves off the bread. The bread was made popular in the rest of Switzerland in the 1950s by the Swiss Bakers' Association, whose professional school at Richemont in Lucerne developed a range of specialty breads based on the baking traditions of each canton. Preparation Pane ticinese is made of a dough of water, white flour, biga (a mixture of flour, yeast and water), salt, and (in the contemporary recipe only) some oil. After being kneaded, the dough is divided into round pieces of about 2 kg, which are left to rise for a few minutes before being re-kneaded, flattened and formed into small individual loaves, or michette (plural of michetta). Each michetta is shaped by hand into an oval shape of about 10 cm in length, and attached to other michette to form a complete loaf. After being brushed with egg, the loaves are again allowed to rise until their volume has doubled, then baked for about 20 to 25 minutes at a temperature of , until the crust is a golden brown. Use Pane ticinese is enjoyed as a bread for everyday use. Available in most Swiss bakeries and supermarkets, it is typically sold as a composite loaf of four to six pieces weighing 250 grams, with an overall length of 20 to 25 centimeters. When stale, it is used in Ticino to make torta leventinese, a form of bread pudding.

His date of birth and date of death are not known, but is believed to have lived around the time of Sultan Hussain Mirza's rule in Herat around 1470. AncestorsChishti group= The founder of the Chishti group was Khwaja Moudod, who was born in 1039 AD and died in 1133 AD at Chisht, a suburb of Hirat. The founder and forefather of the Moudodi branch of the Chishti order is Qutub-ud-din Maudood Chishti, who was born in Chisht, Herat, Afghanistan. Khwaja Moinuddin, who flourished in the 12th century and whose shrine is in Ajmer, was a Chishti. The word Khwaja (\\"master\\") is used to show respect for the saints of the Chishti order. =Rukun-ud-din Hussain Chishti= Upon the death of the Sufi saint Najamuddin Ahmed Mushtaq (507‚Äì577 A.H.; 1129‚Äì1199 C.E.), the two elder sons ‚Äì Baha-ud-din Muhammad and Nizam-ud-din Ali ‚Äì could not decide as to who should be their father's successor while the third son ‚Äì Rukun-ud-din Hussain ‚Äì kept quiet. Finally the murids and Khulifa, having seen a miraculous sign, requested Rukun-ud-din to be the Sajjada nashin. His brothers also agreed, and despite his rank the Khwaja was always respectful to his brothers and gave them due regard. In 1220 CE, Genghis Khan invaded Afghanistan and the Muslim provinces with widespread destruction, looting, and death. Rukn-ud-din had a dream in which his father warned him about the impending threat of a Tatari attack on the Herat and advised him to seek shelter elsewhere. The Khwaja migrated to Ghour along with his family. It is said that he was in the fort of Ghour when the Tartar forces surrounded and besieged the city but the Khwaja's prayers prevented their conquering and they left. In another account, the Khwaja and his two sons stayed for six months in an area called Saghir. Khwaja Rukun-ud- din then returned to Chisht but found his extended family in turmoil: the few who had not been killed were in distress. Rukunuddin Hussain brought them together and gave them hope. The Khwaja asked his son Khwaja Mohiuddin Ali to proceed to India while his other son, Khwaja Sheikh Ul Islam Qududdin Muhammad, died. He often felt grief over this separation from his sons. It is said that after Sahib's arrival at Chisht whenever an attacking army passed near Chisht, most of the soldiers converted to Islam at Rukn-ud-din's hand so that thousands converted to Islam. He died in 635 AH at the age of 90 years. =Khwaja Qutub-ud-din Muhammad= Qutub-ud-din Muhammad Ibn-e-Muhammad Moududi Chishti was the grandson of Khwaja Rukn-ud-din Hussain. His father, Muhammad, had died when his grandfather was still alive so he assumed the position of Sajjada nashin after his grandfather's death. He wrote to his uncle Ali to return from India and offered him the seat but the latter declined to come back. Khwaja Qutub-ud-din belonged to the same era as Genghis Khan's nephew Hulagu Khan. After Genghis's death, his sons and many of his followers converted to Islam. Many of them became followers of Qutub-ud-din Muhammad. He gave them advice and explained to them the religion of Islam and responsibilities of being a Muslim. After the Tatari assault on Herat in 1221 A.C. many of the residents of Chisht and followers and relatives of Qutubuddin had permanently fled to other areas like Ghour, Ghazni, and Khurrassan (Ref Book: Mohammad Ibrahim Yukpasi by Dr. Tahir Taunsvi). However, the Mongols who had converted to Islam revered Khwaja Qutub-ud-din. Their ruler declared safe passage to anyone who wanted to return to Chisht and agreed to follow Qutub- ud-din, and he issued an order that none should be harmed in the vicinity of where the Khwaja lived. As a result, a large number of people came back to Chisht and settled in peace under the guidance of Qutub-ud-din Muhammad. He died in 680 AH and was buried at Chisht. =Khwaja Naqr-ud-din= Wali Kirani's father was Khwaja Naqr-ud-din and is a Sufi saint in his own right. In this book Khwaja Wali's father's name is mentioned as \\"Khwaja Nasir-ud- din,\\" but according to the hereditary Shijra of the Syeds of Kirani, it is \\"Khwaja Naqr_ud_din Shaal Pir Baba\\". Khwaja Naqr-ud-din's father's name was Khwaja Nasir_ud_din Waleed (born 1326 AC ‚Äì died 1417 AC); his shrine is in Chisht Sharif. Khwaja Naqr-ud-din and with his two brothers migrated from Chisht Herat about 600 years ago. Before 1470, Quetta (Shal) was a territory of Herat under the rule of Sultan Hussain Mirza, who subsequently conferred the territories of Shal, Pushang and Sibi on Amir Shuja-ud-din Zunnun, the Arghun. Because Quetta was called Shal at the time Khwaja Naqr-ud-din lived there, he is also known as \\"Shal Piran\\". The three brothers migrated to Minziki Pishin. One brother, Khwaja Ali, took permanent residence there, and his tomb remains in Minziki. (A few families live in the Manzakai in the Pishin Tahsil, where they were given the proprietary right in a sixth share of their land by \\"Alizai Tarins\\".) However, Khwaja Naqr-ud-din continued ahead to Quetta and settled there. His shrine is near the old Quetta fort, within the cantonment limits between the fort and the Leytton Road; the shrine is held in great esteem among the locals and the Tribes of Balochistan. The third brother, Khwaja Ibrahim, continued ahead and settled in Mastung; his tomb is in Mastung, Balochistan. = Family tree = Ancestry of Moudoi Chishti Kirani # Imam Ali ibn Abu Talib, buried at the Imam Ali Mosque in Najaf, Iraq (B 17 March 599 ‚Äì D 28 February 661; aged 61) # Imam Husayn ibn Ali, buried at the Imam Husayn Shrine in Karbala, Iraq (B 4h ‚Äì D 60h) # Imam Hassan ibn Alial- Sajjad, Zainu l-Abidin, buried at Jannat al-Baqi in Medina, Saudi Arabia (B ?h ‚Äì D 94h) # Imam Muhammad ibn Ali al-Baqir al-Ulum, buried at Jannat al Baqi in Medina, Saudi Arabia (B ?h ‚Äì D 114h) # Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq al-Sadiq ‚Äì at Jannat al-Baqi in Medina, Saudi Arabia (B 80h ‚Äì D 148h) # Imam Musa al- Kadhimal-Kazim in the Kadhimiya in Baghdad, Iraq (B 128h ‚Äì D 183h) #Imam Ali ibn Musa ar-Rida in the Imam Reza shrine, Mashad, Iran (B 153h ‚Äì D 203h) # Imam Muhammad ibn Ali at-Taqi al-Jawad in the Kadhimiya in Baghdad, Iraq (B 195h ‚Äì D 220h) #Imam Ali al-Hadi an-Naqi in the Al Askari Mosque in Samarra, Iraq (B 214h ‚Äì D 254h) #Abdullah Ali Akbar (B 238h ‚Äì D 292h) bin Hasan al- Askari # Abu Muhammed Al Hussain in Chist Hirat, Afghanistan (B ?h ‚Äì D 352h) # Abu Abdullah Muhammed in Chisht Herat, Afghanistan (B 270h ‚Äì D 324h) # Abu Jaffer Ibrahim in Chisht Herat, Afghanistan (B ?h ‚Äì D 370h) # Shamsu d-Din Abu Nassar Muhammed Saman in Chisht Herat, Afghanistan (B ?h ‚Äì D 398h) # Abu Yusuf Bin Saamaan in Chisht Herat, Afghanistan (B 375h ‚Äì D 459h) # Qutubuddin Maudood Chishti in Chisht Herat, Afghanistan (B 430h ‚Äì D 527h) # Khwaja Najamuddin Ahmed Mushtaq in Chisht Herat, Afghanistan (B 492h ‚Äì D 577h) # Rukn-ud-din Hussain Chishti in Chisht Herat, Afghanistan (B 545h ‚Äì D 635h) # Qudwaddin Mohammad in Chisht Herat, Afghanistan (B 584h ‚Äì D 624h) # Aududdin Khwaha Abu Ahmed Syed Muhammed in Chisht, Herat, Afghanistan # Taqiuddin Yusuf in Chisht Herat, Afghanistan (B 662h ‚Äì D 745h) # Nassar ud din Waleed in Chisht Herat, Afghanistan (B 727h ‚Äì D 820h) # Shaal Pir Baba Chishti Moudodi in Quetta, Chaowni, Balochistan, Pakistan # Wali Kirani Moudodi Chishti in Kirani, Quetta, Balochistan, Pakistan Life Wali Kirani was born during the time Naqr-ud-din lived in Quetta, although his date and year of birth are not known. Wali Kirani is a Husseini Syed and was from the line of Imam Ali Naqi's (the 10th imam) son, Imam Hasan al-Askari and his second son Sayyid Ali Akbar . He was a descendant of Khwaja Maudood Chishti and because of this was known as \\"Moudodi Chishti.\\" Wali Kirani Moudodi settled in Kirani. Wali Kirani is one of the foremost saints of his time. Khwaja Wali Kirani's date of death is not known.  Tomb  Initially the building of Sahib's tomb was made of mud. Before 1970 Sadat of Kirani had a brick and concrete boundary wall built and a main gate installed. After that in 1973, the then-prime minister Mr Zulfikar Ali Bhutto (Shaheed) provided the money for the tomb's renovation. Further improvements were made in 2006. In 2008, due to alarming increase in population in the immediate vicinity of the tomb, there was the danger of desecration of the tomb and the adjoining 600-year-old graveyard of the Sadat of Kirani. Therefore, the Government of Balochistan built a fortified boundary wall around the tomb as well as the graveyard. Chief Minister of Balochistan Mr. Nawab Mohammed Aslam Raisani signed a grant of Rs. 5 million for this project; his father, the late Mr. Nawab Ghous Bakhsh Rayesani, was also a close ally of the Sadat of Kirani. Another person who played an important role in the construction of this boundary wall was Mr. Mir Haji Ali Mudad Jatak, the Minister for Food, Balochistan. This project was possible because of his relentless efforts.  Descendants Migration= Most of Wali Kirani's descendants have migrated to various areas in what is now Pakistan. In Balochistan his descendants have settled in Sindh and are more prosperous. There are people from his Chishti line living in Nawab Shah; their forefather is believed to be Syed Imam Shah, who is also Wali Kirani's descendant. In the same way his descendants are spread throughout Tando Adam and Mirpur Khas. = Kirani = The Chishti Syeds of Kirani in the Quetta Tahsil claim Khwaja Naqr- ud-din (Shaal Pir Baba, or Shal Piran) as their ancestor. Kirani is a small village on the western outskirts of Quetta in the Baluchistan province of Pakistan. It was previously known as Shal Kot, the capital of the province. Initially the predominant population was descendants of Wali Kirani Chishti, along with some Baluchistan and Pathans who worked on their lands. At the time this area was green and lush and there were fruit orchards of all kinds that were irrigated by the local rivers. An abundance of forests and wildlife was there. The locals had to ask for permission from Wali Kirani's descendants in order to gather firewood from their lands. At the time most Balochi tribes were Bedouins who raised goats and sheep for a living. Slowly people spread their resources and took to selling wood that they cut from the forest. Many of these people made permanent houses for themselves on the uninhabited lands and started paying rent to the owners. Because there was lack of manpower and the land was only used in the rainy season, the owners had no qualms about the arrangement. But after a few decades these people filed for partial ownership of the land and occupied them permanently. As the Sadat population grew, land was distributed among their descendants; some families ended up with insufficient land to live on so they migrated to other areas. In this way the influence of non-Sadat increased in the area and many villages were formed. People took over thousands of acres of barren land. Today the Sadat are only limited to their own village; most have sold their lands and left the area. Syed Lutuf ullah shah, who was seventh in descent from Khwaja Naqr-ud-din Shah, accompanied Mir Nasir Khan 1 of Kalat (1749‚Äì1817) to Persia and was rewarded on his return with the revenue-free holdings of Chashma Shiekh Manda and Sadiq Karez in the Quetta tahsil and with two \\"angusht\\" of water at Dhader. The latter is now held by another branch of the family. Syeds are said to have rendered some service during the First Afghan War (1839‚Äì1842), their leading man being named Mubarak Shah. The principal men among the Sadat of Kirani received allowances from the Levy Service. Syeds of Kirani were instrumental in British communications during the Second Afghan War in 1878. British forces under Colonel Robert Sandeman could not get news from Kandahar, because the route was so deadly that messengers refused to traverse it. When consulted, the local sardars opined that the news could not be brought by any person other than the Syeds of Kirani because they had been wakeels (agents) of the Kabul courts since time immemorial. Colonel Sandeman therefore asked Mir Samunder Shah, Mir Jehan Shah, and Mir Aurang Shah ‚Äì all of whom were motabars of Kirani ‚Äì to bring the news from Kandahar. They readily undertook the mission and brought the news tidings regularly. A monthly sum of Rs. 300 was fixed for the services of Syed Aurang Shah and four other Syeds of Kirani; this was converted to a sum of Rs. 130 or 138 monthly for Syeds when the British forces returned and the country was reconciled. Syed Samander Shah and Jahan Shah died in November 1889, and their allowances were discontinued for a time. The Rs. 50 allowance payable to Aurang Shah was continued to his son, Syed Bahar Shah, and was paid through the political agent, Kalat, since October 1899. The question of the distribution of the remaining Rs. 80 was referred to jirga in September 1890, and as a result of its recommendation, the payment of Rs. 45 was sanctioned to certain members of Ata ullah Shah's family, and Rs. 35 to Amin ullah Shah's family. Kirani also became home to a large number of Hazara people, who came to Pakistan as refugees during the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan (1979‚Äì1989). They settled at Killi Kirani Quetta, famous for the tomb of Wali. = Quetta = When British control of Quetta was established, it was turned into an army garrison. Today where the Command and Staff College stands in Quetta, at that very place, was a fort called \\"Fort Durrani\\". When the British chose Quetta to be a military garrison, they bought this fort from the Durranis. In 1905 Asia's largest military academy staff college was established in Quetta and the Durranis were removed from the land. Therefore, Ghullam Sarver Khan Durrani s/o Sardar Saeed Khan Durrani bought a very large piece of land from Syed Mohammad Ashraf Shah s/o Syed Mohammad Sadiq Shah adjacent to killi Kirani Quetta and formed a village there called killi Gulzar. It is still present today and its record is present in land review records. In 1908, a Kirani Moudodi Chishti Syed family sold land in western Quetta to Haji Nasir Ali, who built housing there. The scheme attracted ethnic Hazara people, and the area became known as Hazara Town.

The film was jointly produced by Dharma Productions and Red Chillies Entertainment and was distributed by Fox Star Studios, which had bought the rights for the film for a sum of , making it the most expensive Bollywood film of 2010. It is also the highest buy over for any Indian film, surpassing Ghajini's record of . Before its release, the film generated a great deal of publicity for itself due to three main reasons: first, the multiple political controversies surrounding the film and its lead actor; second, Khan's presence in the film (he was last seen in a leading actor role in December 2008, when Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi was released); and third, the reunion and sixth collaboration of the \\"golden pair\\" of Khan and Kajol, who last appeared together in the film Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... in 2001. My Name Is Khan debuted in Abu Dhabi, UAE, on 17 February 2010. It premiered globally in cinemas on 12 February 2010. It was also screened as part of the 60th Berlin International Film Festival's official selection the same month. Upon its release, the film broke many box office records. My Name Is Khan was the highest-grossing Indian film overseas at the time, the first to gross over overseas, before it was overtaken by 3 Idiots (2009) in 2011. Within four weeks, the film crossed the mark in India and became the first film of 2010 to do so. In overseas markets, the film grossed US23.5 million. My Name Is Khan earned a worldwide gross of . The film was released in India on DVD on 21 April 2010. Blu-ray in India, plus a DVD release worldwide followed on 17 August 2010. My Name Is Khan received a leading 10 nominations at the 56th Filmfare Awards, including Best Film, and won three awards, that included Best Director for Karan Johar, Best Actor for Shah Rukh Khan, and Best Actress for Kajol. Plot Rizwan Khan is an autistic Muslim child who grew up with his brother Zakir and his mother in a middle class family in Borivali, Mumbai. His autism leads to special tutoring from a reclusive scholar and extra attention from his mother, all which leads to a heightened level of jealousy from Zakir, who eventually leaves his family for a life in San Francisco. Despite this, Zakir sponsors Rizwan to come and live with him after their mother's death. Zakir's wife Haseena diagnoses Rizwan as having Asperger‚Äôs syndrome. Rizwan also begins to work for Zakir's. He meets Hindu woman Mandira and her young son Sameer, born from a previous marriage. Despite Zakir's uncertainty, they marry and live in fictional Banville, where Mandira and Sam surnamed themselves with \\"Khan.\\" They also live next door to the Garrick family. Sam is close to their young son Reese. The Khan's perfect existence gets disrupted after the September 11 attacks. Mark goes to cover the war in Afghanistan and dies there. The Khan family begins to experience post 9‚Äì11 prejudice and Reese begins to turn against Sam, who finds himself in a racist fight against college ruffians, who damage his heart, killing him. Shocked Mandira blames Rizwan, stating that Sam \\"died only because of his surname.\\" She then declares a separation, sarcastically saying that to be back together, he has to tell the people and President of the United States that his name is Khan and he is not a terrorist. Rizwan thus sets out on a road trip to first meet President George W. Bush and later President-elect Barack Obama. He travels to fictional Wilhemina, Georgia and befriends Mama Jenny and her son Joel. In Los Angeles, he overhears violent rhetoric from Faisal Rahman; he reports this to the FBI but no response is given. While waiting in a crowd to meet President Bush, he repeats \\"My name is Khan and I am not a terrorist!\\" He is arrested due to misinterpretation as \\"I am a terrorist.\\" Rizwan is interrogated as a terrorist suspect and meets the psychiatrist Radha who believes he is innocent. He is later released after a media campaign by some Indian student reporters Raj, Komal and Bobby Ahuja, who prove his innocence by unearthing his attempts to inform the FBI about Faisal Rahman. After his release, he returns to hurricane-hit Wilhemina to help Mama Jenny, Joel, and everyone there, attracting attention. Reese confesses to Mandira and reveals the identity of the boys who beat up Sam. She informs Detective Garcia who has been assisting her on the case, and Detective Garcia arrests them. Mandira joins Rizwan in Georgia. At the moment she arrives, Rizwan is stabbed by Faisal's follower and is hospitalized. Rizwan survives and meets Obama who tells him: \\"Your name is Khan and you are not a terrorist.\\"  Cast  * Shah Rukh Khan as Rizwan Khan, Mandira's husband and Sameer's adoptive father **Tanay Chheda as Young Rizwan Khan * Kajol as Mandira Khan / Rathore, Rizwan's wife and Sameer's mother * Sonya Jehan as Haseena Khan, Zakir's wife * Jimmy Shergill as Zakir Khan, Rizwan's brother * Zarina Wahab as Razia Khan, Rizwan & Zakir's mother * Arjan Aujla as Sameer Khan / Rathore aka Sam , Mandira's son and Rizwan's adopted son ** Yuvaan Makaar as Young Sameer Rathore * Vinay Pathak as Jitesh (Motel owner) * Navneet Nishan as Rita Singh * Parvin Dabas as Bobby Ahuja, a news channel reporter * Arjun Mathur as Raj Burman * Sugandha Garg as Komal * Sumeet Raghavan as Dr. Faisal Rehman's follower who attacked Rizwan * Arif Zakaria as Faisal Rahman * Sheetal Menon as Radha * Pallavi Sharda as Sajida Khan * Kenton Duty as Reese Garrick, Sameer's friend * Katie A.

In an August 2009 interview, Shah Rukh Khan stated that My Name Is Khan is \\"not about terrorism, or 9/11. It's about a relationship between two people, between an individual and the State, and between an individual and the country. In short, there are the three important components: a love story, Islam, and a mild form of autism.\\" In an earlier July 2009 interview, Khan also noted that the film focuses on themes concerning \\"the relationship between the Western world and Islam and how that has changed over the past few years.\\" He describes the film as about \\"the journey of one family and how it changes because of 9/11\\" and suggests \\"we touch upon that in a very unbiased and educated way.\\" In another early interview, he also stated that, \\"it's not about a disabled man's fight against disability. It's a disabled man's fight against the disability that exists in the world‚Äîterrorism, hatred, fighting ... My Name Is Khan is also about Islam and the way the world looks at Islam but we are not taking any sides. We are only trying to say that there are only good people and bad people. There are no good Hindus, bad Hindus, good Christians, bad Christians. Either you are a good person or a bad person. Religion is not the criterion, humanity is.\\" Karan Johar said in an interview with Bollywood Hungama: \\"MNIK is an unusual Bollywood film, if at all, and doesn't have those quintessential pre-requisite elements that any Bollywood film has. It's telling a story with a strong message, professing humanity and goodness and putting it out on a big cinematic scale. So all put together it is definitely a different experience for mainstream India ... All I can say is that MNIK is going to open windows and doors to many people who have stories to tell and are shy to put their story on the celluloid\\" When asked about comparisons between the film and the 2009 release Kurbaan, noting that both have dealt with similar topics, he added: \\"I'd say that Kurbaan didn't have 'hope', whereas MNIK had 'hope'. Kurbaan was more darker, grittier and a grey look at a situation, whereas MNIK is a hopeful, far more positive and a lot more positivity in its finishing reels with a triumph to the human spirit. Kurbaan was very cinematic and interesting in its approach but it didn't offer a solution. Rather it just tells the problem. MNIK offers you that solution.\\" = Casting and filming = Production of the film took place in India and the United States. Filming began in Los Angeles during December 2008 and one of the locations used was UCLA. Johar next continued production in Mumbai during April 2009. During June 2009, production moved to San Francisco and the Bay Area, where they filmed a key scene at the Children's Discovery Museum of San Jose. Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol were cast in the lead roles, reuniting them after many years. The film faced a temporary setback in late December when actor Aamir Bashir was denied a visa to the United States. He was eventually replaced by Jimmy Sheirgill as Khan's younger brother. Although Shabana Azmi was originally cast as Shah Rukh Khan's mother she left the production after his shoulder injury delayed the filming schedule. She was replaced in the role by Zarina Wahab. Tanay Chheda portrayed Shah Rukh Khan's character as a child living in the Borivali section of Mumbai. Chheda was chosen because he resembles Khan and because he is recognizable to an international audience after portraying \\"middle Jamal\\" in Slumdog Millionaire. He had earlier worked with Khan in the remake of the 1970s film Don: The Chase Begins Again. American actor Christopher B. Duncan was chosen to portray President Barack Obama. Duncan is known for his impression of Obama on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. Johar had difficulties finding a mosque to film in. According to actor Arif Zakaria, \\"I don't know if Karan tried to get permission in Mumbai. But we were to shoot in a mosque in Los Angeles and hard as Karan tried to convince the authorities that his film would not propagate anti-social values, he was denied permission ... We finally shot the two-day scene with Shah Rukh Khan on the set of a mosque constructed at The Club in Andheri.\\" Johar also shot for an important scene inside of the studio of CBS 5. San Francisco's Film Commission Director Stephanie Coyote was responsible for giving permission to the crew to shoot in the film studio. While shooting for the film, Khan suffered from severe pain in the neck and headaches which were caused by the expressions and posture of Rizwan Khan. His character in the film who has Asperger's Syndrome, has a way of jutting his neck out at a particular angle and wears an expression which has his eyebrows raised in every scene. As he would shoot for hours, he'd get severe migraines. Director Karan Johar admitted that \\"Shah Rukh's character Rizwan had to arch his eyebrows and focus his eyes on a certain place before every take. Halfway through the shooting of the film, Shah Rukh developed severe headaches as result of all the pressure it would put on his head so he had to see a neurosurgeon for that.\\" Varun Dhawan and Siddharth Malhotra, who worked as assistant directors to Karan Johar on the film, made their acting debut two years later in Student of the Year, another Karan Johar directorial venture. After filming in Los Angeles was completed, Johar stated that, \\"in all my 11 years as a filmmaker, I've never felt the experience to be so different. The content of My Name Is Khan is diametrically opposite to whatever I've done in the past.\\" He described working with both Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol again as \\"magic. They build an inexplicable energy on screen.\\" Johar also stated that he was \\"blown away by Shah Rukh who had done monumental research on his autistic character in the film. I was zapped by how much he knew about the subject.\\" Johar also asked Khan to co-produce the film under his production company Red Chillies Entertainment, Talking about the initiative, the director said: > We were both passionate about the subject, we said why not co-produce the > film? We've known each other so long ... that this new initiative is just an > extension of our emotions. Besides, I can never make a film without Shah > Rukh.  Release  My Name Is Khan debuted in Abu Dhabi, UAE on 10 February 2010. It released globally in cinemas on 12 February 2010. MNIK had a two phase release. To begin with, it had a mainstream release in India coupled with a regular Diaspora release in UK, US, Gulf, Australia and various other countries. \\"After that in the months of April and May, we would be looking at a mainstream theatrical release in countries like Germany, Poland and other parts of North America,\\" detailed Johar. = Marketing = Khan, Kajol and Johar while unveiling the first look of the film My Name Is Khan was screened as part of 60th Berlin International Film Festival's Official Selection in February 2010, out of competition. The website eBay auctioned the tickets for the film's screening at the Berlin Film Festival for a record price of ¬£1,000 (60,000) each. All the tickets were sold out in five seconds. The first look of My Name Is Khan unveiled at a grand function at Mumbai by Johar, Khan and Kajol and was then be beamed across 70 countries worldwide on the Star TV Network. Says Karan, \\"This is a first in the history of Bollywood ‚Äì that the promos of a film will play across such a wide platform. And, this has mainly been made possible because of our synergy with Fox Star Studios ... and also the first time a Bollywood company is tying up with a mainstream Hollywood studio. So, there are many firsts to this venture.\\" The trailer of the film was released at the premiere of the Hollywood film, Avatar. My Name Is Khan marked the first instance of a film using the Roadblock advertising technique to market a film, in which the three-minute trailer was aired on all leading television channels simultaneously. The makers of the film made various brand tie-ups to for the promotion of the film. Dish TV entered into a strategic marketing alliance with Fox Star and spend approximately in a month-long 360-degree integrated marketing campaign which ran across all India to co- promote the brand and the movie. Reebok created an entire MNIK footwear and apparel collection to promote the film. On 1 February 2010, Khan and Kajol became the first Indian movie stars to ring the opening bell of the New York stock exchange NASDAQ. They were invited by Fox Searchlight Pictures to do so as part of their promotion for My Name Is Khan. Shah Rukh Khan also appeared on Friday Night with Jonathan Ross as part of its promotion in the UK, becoming only the second Indian after Shilpa Shetty to do so. = Pre-release revenues = On 7 August 2009, Karan Johar signed a deal for with Fox Searchlight Pictures, who will market and distribute it in India (FOXSTAR) and worldwide (Fox Searchlight). It covers all rights except music, which has been secured by Sony Music.  Reception  India = The film received highly positive reviews. Subhash K. Jha (film critic and author of The Essential Guide to Bollywood) gave My Name Is Khan a rave review arguing that Rizwan Khan \\"repairs almost anything, including irreparably damaged relationships. But this film about damaged lives needs no repairing. My Name Is Khan is a flawless work, as perfect in content, tone and treatment as any film can get ... My Name Is Khan is no ordinary film. Long after the wary-of-physical-touch Rizwan has finally shaken hands with President Obama, long after the heat and dust of racial and communal hatred has settled down the core of humanism that the film secretes stays with you. Yes, we finally know what they mean by a feelgood film.\\" Nikhat Kazmi of The Times of India also gave it five stars, describing My Name Is Khan as, \\"indubitably one of the most meaningful and moving films to be rolled out from the Bollywood mills in recent times.\\" Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave My Name Is Khan four and a half out of five stars and argues, \\"When a film stars two of the finest talents of the country, you expect nothing but the best. SRK, well, how does one describe his performance? To state that this is his best work so far would be cutting short the praise he truly deserves ... Kajol is pure dynamite and casting her for this character was the most appropriate decision. No other actress could've matched SRK in histrionics the way Kajol has. In fact, SRK and Kajol complement each other wonderfully well and this film only proves it yet again. It's a powerhouse performance from this supremely talented actress.\\" Sarita Tanwar of Mid-Day gave the film four and a half out of five stars and described it as \\"near-perfect\\", concluding that \\"The Karan-Shah Rukh-Kajol combo strikes once more.\\" Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave My Name Is Khan three and a half out of five stars, arguing that \\"the film shamelessly tugs at your heartstrings and on more than one occasion wallops you to weep. Aided by solid camerawork, tight editing and a layered story, Johar crafts an engaging, stirring saga that is earnest and noble. With this message movie in the mainstream format, the director takes a step in the right direction.\\" Sudhish Kamath from The Hindu wrote, \\"My Name Is Khan is populist, yet layered with rich political subtext. It's all about types, yet every character feels real. It's about generalisations and yet it chooses to dwell on the specifics. It's all heart and spirit that you can't help but overlook the flaws and admire it.\\" According to BBC critic Manish Gajjar, who gave the film four out of five stars, the film is \\"a fiction-based film refreshingly told with realism of racial profiling on American soil. It's a rare treat for Hindi commercial cinema and a crossover audience.\\" Pratim D. Gupta from The Telegraph in a positive review concluded, \\"My Name Is Khan has conscience and courage and two heartfelt performances. It can try your patience a bit but it will not leave you untouched.\\" Namrata Joshi from Outlook, giving the film 3.5 out of 4 stars, described it as \\"a gentle, affecting and heart-warming film that makes you smile through your tears. It looks at contentious issues but offers overwhelming hope and renewal.\\" = United States = Rotten Tomatoes lists an approval rating of 85%, with 23 positive and 4 negative reviews. As of 21 February 2010, the film has a score of 50 out of a scale of 100 on the review aggregate website Metacritic, based on 7 reviews. Rachel Saltz of The New York Times states, \\"Khan is one of a handful of Hindi films (New York, Kurbaan) about Indians living in a paranoid, post-9/11 America, and there's something fascinating about looking at this country through a Bollywood lens, even when the story is a kind of fairy tale. (Most interesting here is the link made between black Americans and Indians, especially Muslims.) Skilfully directed by Karan Johar and with an evocative score by Shankar, Ehsaan & Loy, Khan jerks tears with ease, while teaching lessons about Islam and tolerance.\\" According to Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter, My Name Is Khan is, \\"a film that delves compellingly into Americans' anti-Muslim hysteria\\" as it tackles \\"a subject American movies have mostly avoided ‚Äì that of racial profiling and the plight of Muslim-Americans. It also allows Shah Rukh Khan to display his talent to an even wider audience. It's well worth the 162-minute journey.\\" Jay Wesissberg of Variety describes My Name Is Khan as a \\"riotously overstuffed and enormously enjoyable drama\\" with \\"confident camerawork [which] is matched by exceptional production design\\" He also states that Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol are a \\"delight together and her natural warmth makes the relationship even more believable.\\" My Name Is Khan was not India's official entry to the Oscars as best foreign language film, but it was eligible for other nominations at the 83rd Academy Awards.  Box office  My Name Is Khan opened very well in most places across the world, and set many records in the process. However, the performance of the film could not sustain beyond the first or second week in some places, including India and USA.

In spite of this, the film managed to retain the No. 1 position at the box office for two consecutive weeks. It was in the top 5 list of the Indian box office for six consecutive weeks. Though the mid-week collections saw a drop of 60% from the opening weekend, it held up well against other major releases and secured the highest first quarter collections, a record previously held by the 2008 film Race. Thus, the film is a financial success owing to its record-breaking overseas collections and healthy domestic collections.  Awards  In 2017, Khan was honoured at the San Francisco Film festival for his role in the film, seven years after the release of MNIK.  Music  The soundtrack is composed by the critically acclaimed Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy, who previously teamed up with Karan Johar to give hit music for his movies like Kal Ho Naa Ho (2003) and Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna (2006). The lyrics are penned by Niranjan Iyengar. The audio rights of the film were purchased by Sony Music Entertainment who has also previously released the music for Karan Johar's movies Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... (2001), Kal Ho Naa Ho and Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna, which gained global musical success. The album was released on 1 January 2010. The musical soundtrack consists of 6 original songs and 4 bonus tracks that are taken from Karan Johar's previous successful films that have featured Shah Rukh Khan. The soundtrack includes one instrumental called \\"Khan Theme\\", composed by Indrajit Sharma and the strings for the song are performed by the Bombay Film Orchestra. The songs such as \\"Noor-e-Khuda\\" blend western bar blues and techno sounds with Indian classical styles such as Sufi and Hindustani. The song \\"Allah hi Rahem\\" sung by Ustad Rashid Khan is another example of Sufi thematic song. The soundtrack is thus representative of the \\"indie fusion genre\\". Unlike Karan Johar's other films, this film has no lip-sync songs. All the songs are in background. Although Niranjan Iyengar is alone credited for writing the lyrics for the songs, Niranjan penned the only two Sufi songs in the film, \\"Sajda\\" and \\"Allah Hi Rahem\\". The famous lyricist, Javed Akhtar was approached to write the lyrics for the remaining three songs. Earlier it was reported that he refused to write lyrics, because Javed Akhtar did not want to share the credits with another lyricist since Niranjan Iyengar has written two songs for the film. Later Karan Johar confirmed that Javed Akhtar penned the remaining songs, but Javed did not want him to be credited as the lyricist when the soundtrack released as he had to share the credits with Nirinjan Iyenger. Javed confirmed this and said, \\"I don't like to share the credits. I would have got the publicity but the other person, who has done a fine job, wouldn't have. I have read the songs penned by Niranjan and I think he has done a great job.\\" = Reception = Upon its release, the album received generally positive reviews from most music critics. Gianysh Toolsee of Planet Bollywood stated that the soundtrack was \\"very much about transcending the boundaries set by Bollywood by venturing into an emotional state through Sufism and spirituality.\\" and gave the album 8/10. Joginder Tuteja of Bollywood Hungama gave the album a three out of five stars, suggesting that director Karan Johar along with musicians Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy and lyricist Niranjan Iyengar \\"have brought not a partial but a substantial difference to the way music in [Johar's] films is being looked at.\\" Hindustan Times rated the album 3.5 out of 5 and stated \\"Every song in the album is above average. The composers have stuck to the theme of the film and the soundtrack has the potential to rock the charts.\\" Sukanya Verma of Rediff gave the album 3 out of 5 stating, \\"As for the soundtrack, it's neither fancy nor groundbreaking but warm enough to make us like it.\\" Glamsham rated the album 4/5 with a statement \\"Karan has crafted a beautiful film, while SRK has authored a marketing strategy that will be hard for even Aamir Khan to beat!\\" The BBC review stated, \\"With four bonus songs taken from the director's box office successes that have featured Shah Rukh and Kajol together (plus a theatrical trailer for My Name Is Khan), there are plenty of extras goodies for hardcore Bollywood fans. But placed side by side, Shankar, Ehsaan and Loy's latest soundtrack may not seem as memorable as past collaborations.\\"  Controversies  Airport security = Khan has stated that due to his last name and religion, he (like Rizwan Khan) is frequently subject to excess security checks at airports. On 14 August 2009, Khan arrived in the United States to promote My Name Is Khan and to participate in South Asian-related events around the country (including Indian Independence Day). Upon arriving at Newark Airport in New Jersey, he was pulled aside by immigration officers after his name popped up on their computers, questioned for over an hour (Khan claims it was at least two hours) about the nature of his visit, and was later released. According to the Times Online, \\"In Delhi, Timothy J. Roemer, the American Ambassador to India, said that the embassy was trying to 'ascertain the facts of the case.' He added: 'Shah Rukh Khan, the actor and global icon, is a welcome guest in the United States.'\\" Khan said he was told that it was because \\"they said my name was common to some name that popped up on the computer.\\" The officials asked if he could provide names of people to vouch for him. Khan noted that he \\"had all the documents; they were asking me where I was going to be staying. I gave the name of FOX people with whom I had finalised a deal a few days ago as contacts.\\" However, because they wanted to check his luggage which the airline had lost, Khan said that he \\"was taken to a room where many people were awaiting a secondary check on visa, most were South Asians. In fact many officers were reluctantly vouching for me, some people were asking for autographs and a Pakistani fan even said he knew who I was. But the officers said it was procedure and kept taking numbers from me.\\" While he was not allowed to use his own phone, Khan was permitted one phone call. He was thus released after officials from the Indian Consulate intervened. Civil Aviation Minister Praful Patel stated that the event will be further explored with U.S. officials. According to the BBC, \\"Elmer Camacho, a spokesman for the US Bureau of Customs and Border Protection, said the questioning was part of the agency's routine process to screen foreign travellers.\\" When asked if he would demand an apology, Khan replied that he would not. The director of My Name Is Khan, Karan Johar, was asked during an August 2009 interview with MiD DAY if the event was a publicity stunt for the film. Johar denied that it was and responded: \\"It's upsetting because I got a text message this morning asking me if it was a publicity plug for my movie. (Sarcastically) I mean, if I had that much power over the Homeland Security, why would I allow Shah Rukh to go through something like this? ... What's really shocking is the fact that when I was writing the film, I never thought that what happened to the protagonist of the film would happen to Shah Rukh.\\" During a January 2010 interview, Khan referred to the implication that the event was a publicity stunt for the film as \\"lowdown and cheap.\\" Christopher B. Duncan, who portrays President Obama in My Name Is Khan, also commented on the incident stating: \\"I was very disappointed with what SRK experienced at the airport. We're living in times where the levels of fear can sometimes spill over into paranoia. Here's a man who is an international superstar, being detained for an excessive amount of time at an airport in the United States. It had to be very upsetting for him. Imagine Oprah (Winfrey) being detained at an airport in India for a long time, during a kind of interrogation.\\" In addition, the incident sparked debate and commentary among Indian politicians, actors, and others. It also led to demonstrations in India. California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger later invited Khan to have dinner with him \\"in a bid to diffuse what has become a slight diplomatic row.\\" In another event, on 5 February 2010, while promoting My Name Is Khan on the British talk show Friday Night with Jonathan Ross, Khan claimed that female security staff at Heathrow Airport in London had printed a naked image of him taken using the newly installed body scanner that he was asked to go through. He said that he autographed it for them, though it is not clear if his comments were intended as a joke. In relation to Khan's comments, The Economic Times has raised concerns over the new body scanners and the possibilities of it being abused to distribute naked pictures of celebrities. His comments have restarted the debate in Britain over whether the new scanners violate individual privacy. = Shiv Sena controversy = After Shah Rukh Khan (who owns the Kolkata Knight Riders cricket team) criticised the fact that members of the Pakistani Cricket Team were not bought by the clubs competing in the 2010 Indian Premier League (IPL), he was condemned by Shiv Sena, a Hindu nationalist political party. There were consequent protests and demonstrations against him and demands that cinemas in India refuse to screen My Name Is Khan. Khan responded by stating, \\"What did I say that was wrong? All I said was that I wanted people to come to my country.\\" Khan continued by stating that: \\"I have no idea what I am supposed to apologise for ... If I am in wrong I would like to apologise but someone needs to explain to me what is wrong.\\" He also stated that he does \\"not want any confrontation. I am trying to explain myself on every platform ... I have not said anything that is anti- national.\\" Khan said that he was willing to meet with Bal Thackeray to discuss the issue. Initially, Shiv Sena rescinded its demand to block release of My Name Is Khan after it was announced that Khan would be allowed to release it \\"in as many theatres\\" as he would like. However, on 17 February 2010, when cinemas opened for advanced bookings, individuals disguised as \\"cinegoers\\" began to attack cinemas and booking centres. Director Karan Johar and distributors met with police to ask for additional security. In response, Chief Minister of Maharashtra Ashok Chavan threatened to withdraw security cover for party leader Uddhav Thackeray. Later, some security was withdrawn and the Maharashtra government has \\"called in five battalions of the State Reserve Police Force to protect 63 cinemas in the city that will screen the film directed by Karan Johar from this Friday.\\" There were multiple arrests and leave of all police officials were cancelled. The distributor, Fox Star, stated that the film would still be released on its scheduled opening date, 12 February. It opened to full cinema houses across India.

Their power is derived from the emotional spectrum relating to rage.https://www.dccomics.com/characters/atrocitus Publication history They debuted in Green Lantern vol. 4 #25 (December 2007) and were created by Geoff Johns and Ethan Van Sciver. Some of their characteristics were inspired by 28 Days Later, which is one of Van Sciver's favorite films.Blackest Night: Tales of the Corps #2 (July 2009) Fictional group history The Red Lantern Corps are first mentioned during the \\"Sinestro Corps War\\" storyline. Foreshadowing another major crossover event in the DC Universe, former- Guardian Ganthet reveals the Blackest Night prophecy to Hal Jordan, Guy Gardner, John Stewart, and Kyle Rayner. The prophecy describes a War of Light among seven Corps powered by the lights of the emotional spectrum. Part of the prophecy reads: \\"A force of hate will rise as the red lantern is anointed in blood, the bearer's rage unfiltered and unchecked.\\"Green Lantern vol. 4 #25 (January 2008) According to DC continuity, before recruiting sentient beings to the Green Lantern Corps, the Guardians formed a robotic army called the Manhunters to maintain order across the universe. After eons of service, the renegade Guardian Krona altered their central programming, leading them to believe that the only way of maintaining order was to completely rid the universe of all known life. Sector 666 falls victim to this new philosophy when the Manhunters slaughter all but five of its inhabitants. The five survivors become known as the Five Inversions: a terrorist cell bent on the destruction of the Guardians of the Universe.Green Lantern vol. 4 #33 (September 2008) They are incarcerated on the planet Ysmault, where one member, Atrocitus, is so consumed by his rage that it results in the formation of the first red power battery. Atrocitus had previously escaped at times, only to be defeated and returned. On one such occasion, he fatally attacked Green Lantern Abin Sur;Green Lantern vol. 4 #30 (June 2008) but Atrocitus is returned to confinement by (then-Green Lantern) Sinestro.Green Lantern vol. 4 #35 (November 2008) Atrocitus uses his power battery to bludgeon Qull and the other Inversions to death; however, he expresses more interest in exacting revenge on Sinestro.Green Lantern vol. 4 #28 (April 2008) Geoff Johns describes the Red Lantern Corps as likely being \\"the most violent of the Corps [...] based on violent reaction driven by emotional eruption ‚Äì rage ‚Äì instead of any clear-cut plan of war.\\" He describes Atrocitus as \\"the most coherent and in control of the Red Lanterns,\\" but notes that he will have trouble controlling the other, more feral members. Sinestro is their primary target.Geoff Johns on Final Crisis: Rage of the Red Lanterns, Newsarama, October 27, 2008 As the power of rage consumes and drowns the intelligence of the users, the average Red Lantern is left in a barely animalistic mindset, with limited speech abilities and lacking any ability of abstract thought and understanding, and of every other form of volition but endless rage, driven by hatred and a dim memory of his past life, focused on the circumstances forcing him to hate in the first place. Atrocitus is able to restore his fellow Red Lanterns to their previous mental acuity with his shamanistic magic. The ritual, employed only once on Bleez, restored her previous mindset and capacity for coherent thought without dimming her rage. As such, Bleez, like Atrocitus, is still consumed by rage, but also loathes her endless suffering. =Rage of the Red Lanterns= In Final Crisis: Rage of the Red Lanterns, Atrocitus is shown in a flashback as having apparently formed a central power battery by using the blood of the other Inversions in blood magic rituals. The battery stands before a great lake of blood from which he forms his red power ring (crystallized by his anger), as well as other rings and batteries used to form the Red Lantern Corps. Harnessing the red light of rage, he sends his rings out into the universe; however, upon accepting the rings, his recruits' hearts are rendered useless. Their blood spoils from within, forcing them to expel the violently flammable and corrosive material from their mouths. Additionally, the Red Lanterns are reduced to an almost animalistic state, with only Atrocitus appearing to be in full control of himself. Once Atrocitus assembles a sufficient force, he leads them on a mission to capture Sinestro (who is being transferred to Korugar for his execution). Coincidentally, the Sinestro Corps have similar plans and they launch an ambush on the Green Lantern escort to rescue their leader. In turn, both groups are then ambushed by the Red Lanterns, who are able to take Sinestro captive by slaughtering Green Lanterns and Sinestro Corpsmen alike.Final Crisis: Rage of the Red Lanterns (October 2008) Among the many Red Lanterns being seen by readers for the first time is one familiar face: former Green Lantern Laira. After being tried and found guilty for the murder of Amon Sur, she is expelled from the Green Lantern Corps. While being escorted away from Oa, her ship is attacked by a red power ring. It attaches itself to her, and provides her with a vehicle to achieve the vengeance against Sinestro that she seeks. The introduction of the fully formed Red Lantern Corps continues in the main Green Lantern title, where Atrocitus brings Sinestro to Ysmault and intends to use his blood in another ritual. As Johns promised, Atrocitus strikes at Laira to keep her and the other Red Lanterns from attacking him themselves. With the help of Saint Walker and Brother Warth from the newly formed Blue Lantern Corps, Hal Jordan heads for Ysmault to free Sinestro (due to Ganthet believing he has an important role to play in the approaching Blackest Night conflict).Green Lantern vol. 4 #36 (December 2008) Separating from his companions, Jordan finds Sinestro but is captured by the Red Lantern Corps. Just as Atrocitus orders Laira to kill him, the Sinestro Corps also arrives on Ysmault to rescue their leader. Chaos ensues, but it's temporarily relieved upon the arrival of the Blue Lanterns. The two are able to keep the battling factions from destroying one another for a time until Sinestro is released from confinement and kills Laira while Jordan attempts to calm her rage. Furious, Jordan's anger attracts Laira's ring and he becomes a member of the Red Lantern Corps himself.Green Lantern vol. 4 #37 (January 2009) With his green power ring now inactive, Jordan attacks the Blue Lanterns and Sinestro. Saint Walker (whose powers are neutralized without the influence of a green ring) manages to get his blue power ring on Jordan's finger, which causes the red ring to explode when combined with the power of his reawakened green ring. Drained of power by Jordan's Blue Lantern abilities, the Sinestro Corps escapes. Wounded and seemingly beaten for now, Atrocitus and his own Corps also flee. At the conclusion of the issue, Atrocitus is seen using a blood ritual to locate the Blue Lantern Corps homeworld.Green Lantern vol. 4 #38 (February 2009) =Sciencell riot= In Green Lantern Corps, Vice becomes the first Red Lantern to become a prisoner of the Green Lanterns. He attacks Kilowog and Salaak on the way back from the Red Lantern ambush, but is detained. Fixed with a muzzle to keep from using his corrosive plasma as a means of escape, he is placed in a sciencell on Oa. No longer under the allegiance of the Guardians, Scar removes the muzzle remotely as part of her own plans of bringing the Blackest Night prophecy into realization. Free of his restraints, Vice easily escapes and attacks the sciencell warden, Voz.Green Lantern Corps vol. 2 #34 (May 2009) To the amusement of the Sinestro Corps members imprisoned in their own sciencells, Vice overcomes and brutally assaults Voz. Sinestro's soldiers are horrified to find, however, that Vice is equally likely to attack them. As Vice begins culling the Sinestro Corps detainees, Scar releases their yellow power rings from confinement elsewhere on Oa. As the rings find their respective bearers, rioting ensues that necessitates the immediate attention of the Green Lantern Corps.Green Lantern Corps vol. 2 #35 (June 2009) The riot in the sciencells is eventually contained by the Green Lanterns and Alpha Lanterns. Vice, though given ample opportunity to escape, remains behind to shed more blood, and is subsequently captured and reimprisoned.Green Lantern Corps vol. 2 #38 (September 2009) =Blackest Night= During the Blackest Night event, the Guardians of the Universe are shown observing the War of Light unfolding among the various Corps of the emotional spectrum; one of the scenes depicting the Lost Lanterns confronting the Red Lantern Corps in order to retrieve Laira's body from Ysmault. As the seven Corps battle one another, a new eighth group powered by death is introduced to the DC Universe: the Black Lantern Corps. Black Hand, a leader of the new Corps, releases black power rings that reanimated the deceased in order to recruit members to their ranks.Blackest Night #1 (September 2009) Just as Atrocitus steps into the fight against the Lost Lanterns, the black rings descend on Ysmault, seeking the bodies of Laira and the four deceased Inversions.Green Lantern vol. 4 #45 (October 2009) The passage taken from The Book of the Black at the end of Blackest Night #3 states that rage will be the second emotion to fall in the Black Lantern Corps' crusade against the colored lights. Love is depicted as being the first which is fulfilled in Green Lantern vol. 4 #46, when the Black Lanterns devastate the Star Sapphires' homeworld of Zamaron. On Ysmault, the four Inversions attack Atrocitus and rip out his heart. However, the insatiable wrath contained within his ring prevents him from dying (having functionally replaced his heart), and temporarily destroys the Black Lantern Inversions. Later, Atrocitus is seen temporarily destroying the Black Lanterns in pursuit of Larfleeze, and demands that he surrender the Orange Central Power Battery.Green Lantern vol. 4 #46 (November 2009) After a brief conflict over the Orange Central Power Battery, the two characters are joined by Hal Jordan, Sinestro, Carol Ferris, Indigo-1, Saint Walker, Ganthet, and Sayd. The group needs Larfleeze and Atrocitus to represent their respective colored lights in the emotional spectrum in a group effort to create a collective white light that will destroy the Black Lantern Corps. Atrocitus initially refuses to cooperate, but after deciding that the Black Lanterns are as much a creation of the Guardians as the Manhunter droids responsible for destroying his world, he changes his mind and complies.Green Lantern vol. 4 #47 (December 2009) During the fight on Earth, Mera is temporarily inducted into the Red Lantern Corps as a 'deputy' to help hold the line against the Black Lanterns,Blackest Night #6 but Wonder Woman is able to use her Star Sapphire ring to hold back Mera's rage and grant her a degree of control, with the ring being removed completely when Aquaman is resurrected as Mera's love for him compromises her rage (although Carol and Saint Walker are required to restart Mera's heart).Blackest Night #8 During the Black Lantern siege of the Green Central Power Battery, Kyle Rayner and Guy Gardner release Vice; hoping that the Red Lantern will be able to destroy the Black Lanterns faster than they can regenerate, thereby weakening a giant black construct attempting to destroy the battery. Believing that Vice has escaped (rather than being released), Alpha Lantern Chaselon kills him. Vice's ring later attaches itself to Guy Gardner, who has become full of rage following Kyle Rayner's death.Green Lantern Corps vol. 2 #42 (November 2009) Using both his green and red power rings, Guy slaughters dozens of Black Lanterns.Green Lantern Corps vol. 2 #43 (December 2009) After the planetary Green Lantern Mogo manages to neutralise the Black Lanterns, Guy turns his rage on his fellow Green Lanterns.Green Lantern Corps vol. 2 #44 (December 2009) Mogo uses a special pool of antibodies to remove most of the Red Lantern energies from Guy's body, telling him the only way to completely cleanse him is to bathe in the light of a Blue Lantern.Green Lantern Corps vol. 2 #45 (February 2010) Guy temporarily returns to the Red Lanterns when he uses Atrocitus's ring to fight off the Green Lantern Corps under Krona's control- Guy's green ring being compromised and reasoning that he has some experience with the red ring, while Atrocitus has been trapped in the Book of the Black by Krona- with Kyle Rayner's temporary blue ring allowing him to fully heal Guy of the red ring's influence once the crisis is over and Atrocitus has been freed. =The New 52 and solo title= In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, the Red Lantern backstory, despite having not been radically altered, was explained and expanded in the eponymous series written by Peter Milligan,MILLIGAN WRITES \\"RED LANTERN CORPS\\", Comic Book Resources, January 3, 2011 ultimately released after the end of the \\"Flashpoint\\" storyline. After the end of the War of the Green Lanterns, disappointed at the fact that he was not the one who killed Krona, the culprit of the Ryut Massacre, Atrocitus, feeling his rage dimming, is left without a purpose and faced with the drawbacks of leading an army of devolved, animalistic underlings driven by rage only.Red Lanterns #1 (September 2011) He decides to choose an individual to be his equal and right hand, on whom to bestow his or her full mental faculties.Red Lanterns #2 (October 2011) He chooses Bleez,Red Lanterns #3 (November 2011) but soon believes she may have manipulated him into doing this. At the same time on Earth, after watching his brother being beaten to death, a young Englishman named Jack Moore becomes a Red Lantern,Red Lanterns #4 (December 2011) subsequently helping Atrocitus when other Red Lanterns turn on him due to his rage having lessened. Bleez becomes the Red Lantern representative in the New Guardians team consisting of seven representatives from the seven different Corps working together for mutual interest. The group investigates a mysterious Orrery in the Vega System,Green Lantern: New Guardians #4 traveling back to Earth with Kyle Rayner to recover his power battery after he is officially discharged from the Green Lantern Corps ‚Äì while retaining his ring and access to the Oan network ‚Äì in order to protect him if the Guardians should try and capture him.Green Lantern: New Guardians #8 Following the defeat of the powerful Volthoom, Hal Jordan sends Guy Gardner to join the Red Lanterns as an undercover operative to keep them in check, with Guy swiftly defeating Atrocitus and taking command of the group. It is revealed that part of his decision to join with the Red Lanterns is feeling as if he has never fit in as a Green Lantern.Red Lanterns vol. 1 #21 (June 2013) As a Red Lantern Gardner manages to keep his rage in check, successfully leading most of the Red Lanterns; Atrocitus leads a splinter group and allows new Red rings to cause murderous justice-based rampages to continue. After joining with the Green Lanterns to defeat the cosmic terrorist Relic, Hal promises to give the Red Lanterns a sector for them to watch over after Guy rejects the initial offer of being released from his new role in the Corps. However, this sector becomes Sector 2814, where Earth resides, giving guardianship of Earth to the Red Lantern Corps.Red Lanterns vol. 1 #28 Both Gardner's Red Lanterns and Atrocitus' Red Lanterns come into conflict with each other, which ends when a recently inducted Red Lantern, Judge Sheko, determines that Atrocitus, his Red Lantern splinter group, and herself are all guilty and she destroys them. However, Atrocitus and Dex-Starr survived but are apparently killed when Guy takes control of all of Atrocitus' newly- created Red Power Rings, stripping them of their rings and removing their life support. In Green Lantern: The Lost Army, Guy Gardner is flung into the pre- Universe and is suddenly wearing both a Green and Red Power Ring. He manages to reunite with the Green Lantern Corps who were also trapped in the pre- Universe. During the last fight between the Green Lantern Corps and the various Lightsmiths, Guy's Red Power Ring is turned green.Green Lantern: The Lost Army #1-6 In Green Lantern Corps: Edge of Oblivion, Guy is once again a fully fledged Green Lantern and helps the others to try and escape the impending death of the pre-Universe and back into their own.Green Lantern Corps: Edge of Oblivion #1-6 =DC Rebirth= As part of DC Rebirth, it is revealed that Atrocitus and Dex-Starr are alive and Red Lanterns once again, with the former regaining his title as their leader, and Bleez is once again allied with Atrocitus. Atrocitus wishes to bring forth the Red Dawn and obtain a mysterious new power ring that has been recently discovered.Green Lanterns Rebirth #1 Atrocitus begins to bring forth the Red Dawn by implanting a Hell Tower within Earth and converting humans into rage conduits, waiting until the Hell Tower is ready to insert a Rage Seed.Green Lanterns #1-2 The Red Lanterns head to Earth to make sure their plans proceed on schedule and Bleez heads off to deal with Green Lanterns Simon Baz and Jessica Cruz. Simon Baz somehow heals Bleez, restoring her to her original form. Bleez reveals Atrocitus' plan to Simon but when Jessica intervenes and attacks Bleez, she succumbs to rage once more and returns to her Red Lantern appearance, deciding to go into hiding from the Green Lanterns and Atrocitus.Green Lanterns #3 Jessica Cruz inadvertently becomes a rage conduit and attacks Simon. Simon is able to purify her in a similar way he did to Bleez, and the two are then confronted by Atrocitus and a group of Red Lanterns.Green Lanterns #4 Prominent members Only a few of the Red Lanterns have been identified by name in Green Lantern titles. Many of the known Red Lanterns were victimized by the Sinestro Corps before becoming Red Lanterns. =Leadership= * Atrocitus (of Sector 666): A struggling psychologist from the planet Ryut who survived the massacre executed by the Manhunters on his sector with four others who teamed up with him to form the Five Inversions, a terrorist cabal bent on the destruction of the Guardians of the Universe. He was formerly the only Red Lantern that had complete control over himself (unlike the other feral members of the Red Lantern Corps) and also lead the Corps until the induction of Guy Gardner, who killed Atrocitus with his bare hands when he removed Atrocitus' red power ring and took the leadership from him. However, while every Red Lantern believes Atrocitus is dead, he was actually saved by Dex-Starr who was able to create a heart construct to replace the one Atrocitus lost (due to his heart being forcibly removed by his former members of the Five Inversions, which were temporarily resurrected as Black Lanterns during the events of the Blackest Night saga). Vowing to get revenge on Guy Gardner, Atrocitus then went to Sector 718 to look for a replacement ring. When he reached the planet Styge Prime, he found the embodiment of Rage, the Butcher, in captivity. After he and Dex-Starr defeated his captors, Atrocitus was able to possess the Butcher, thereby regaining his powers and possibly becoming more powerful. However, the entity is taken away by Kyle Rayner and the other entities, excluding Parallax who is still under Sinestro's control. Atrocitus and Dex-Starr then find another feral Red Lantern, kill it and take its ring. He then captures Rankorr and forces a bug inside him to make him feral. He then poisons the blood on Ysmult and, using a second lake on Styge Prime, he creates hundreds of rings and sends them to Earth. He then uses these newly-formed reds from earth to fight Guy Gardner, but Gardner beats him by proving his rage greater than Atrocitus' and taking away his ring along with Dex-star's and all the newly- formed reds as well. Although it is presumed he is dead, Gardner still refers to him as alive. Atrocitus is revealed to be alive and a Red Lantern again, having regained control of the Lantern Corps he founded. He plans to bring forth the Red Dawn on Earth. * Guy Gardner (of Sector 2814): After Kyle Rayner's presumed death in Green Lantern Corps (vol 2) #43, Guy is consumed by rage, attracting Vice's red power ring in the following issue. Like Hal Jordan, Guy is notable as one of the few Red Lanterns capable of creating red light constructs. Uniquely, Guy maintains control of his green power ring as well, and is capable of using both in conjunction with one another. Guy is able to overcome the red ring's influence with the aid of Mogo; however, the planetary Green Lantern warns Guy that some influence of the red still remains and that only a Blue Lantern's power ring could completely remove the influence of the red ring. During the \\"War of the Green Lantern Corps\\" story- arc, Guy is forced to remove his green power ring to avoid being contaminated by the yellow impurity.Green Lantern: Emerald Warriors #8 (March 2011) Later, Hal Jordan gave him the choice of another power ring so they could fight against Krona, which he chose the red ring of Atrocitus (due to his previous experience with a red power ring).Green Lantern vol. 4 #65 (April 2011) Afterwards, Kyle Rayner uses Saint Walker's ring to purify Guy from the effects of the ring.Green Lantern: Emerald Warriors #10 (May 2011) Following the defeat of Volthoom, the First Lantern, Guy was tasked by Hal Jordan to go undercover and re-enlist with the Red Lanterns as a mole, given Gardner‚Äôs rage issues and the fact that the red ring turns its user into a violent lunatic. It‚Äôs no small request, especially since Gardner had only just purged its effects from his system. Following the conflict with Relic, Gardner chose to remain with the Red Lanterns and arranged for them to gain jurisdiction over Sector 2814. Under Gardner's leadership, the Red Lantern Corps began to hunt down criminals and tyrants across the universe. However, unlike the Green Lanterns who delivered their prey to the authorities, Gardner's Red Lanterns executed them. Following the decimation of his forces from Atrocitus' uprising and the conflict with the New Gods, Guy is no longer a Red Lantern and is a Green Lantern once again,Green Lantern: Lost Army #1 his red ring later converted back to green.Green Lantern: Lost Army #6 =Ring bearers= * Bleez (of Sector 33): A princess from the planet Havania who was kidnapped by the Sinestro Corps during a visit by suitors and then tortured and raped while imprisoned on Ranx the Sentient City. However, it was due to her vow to exact vengeance on those who kidnapped her that she was bailed out of captivity by a red power ring that saved her from being caught escaping during a Green Lantern assault on Ranx and deformed her into a member of the Red Lantern Corps. In early appearances, she is seen as only having one skeletal wing, the partner of which, Shane Davis suggests, was removed during her imprisonment.Road to Blackest Night: Red Kitty Rage, Newsarama, May 13, 2009 In Blackest Night: Tales of the Corps #2, the power of her red ring reduced her two feathered wings to bone; her depictions with one wing are retconned. In her current backstory, both her wings were mutilated during her torture, thus having the ring \\"heal\\" them in their current skeletal form. Bleez serves as the representative of the Red Lanterns Corps in the Green Lantern: New Guardians series prior to the \\"Rise of the Third Army\\" crossover event. Atrocitus also restored Bleez' intelligence to assist him in maintaining his control over the other animalistic Red Lanterns. * Dex-Starr (of Sector 2814): An abandoned stray blue house cat from Earth adopted by a single woman in Brooklyn who names him Dexter. During a break-in, Dex-Starr scratched the burglar before his owner was killed and he was evicted by police. Homeless, he was grabbed by two street thugs and thrown off the Brooklyn Bridge, but the rage he felt caught the attention of a red power ring and it came to him before he hit the water. As a member of the Red Lantern Corps, he killed the two thugs and slept on their skulls, proclaiming himself to be a \\"good kitty\\" using thoughts expressed in simple sentences. He was described by Geoff Johns in an interview with Wizard as \\"the most sadistic and malicious\\" of the Red Lanterns. Originally intended as a joke by Shane Davis, he began being featured more prominently due to positive reception. Dex-Starr frequently travels with Atrocitus, his vengeful quest centering on finding the burglar that murdered his owner. Dex-Starr gained the ability to create constructs after drinking the blood of Rankorr, and unbeknownst to his fellow Red Lanterns, he used his new-found ability to save Atrocitus from certain death after the former leader of the Red Lanterns saw his red power ring being taken by Guy Gardner. * Rankorr (Jack Moore) (of Sector 2814): A child punk from Earth who was taken in alongside his brother, Ray, by their grandfather after their mother died. Ever since, he always repressed his growing feelings of rage over the tragedy by attending Oxford University and reading books, until he witnessed his grandfather's murder during a robbery committed by his old classmate Baxter and Ray's brutal beating at the hands of the local police, who caught him trying to firebomb Baxter's house. Unable to repress his feelings anymore and going out to rescue Ray, Jack unknowingly allowed a red power ring that appeared before him to induct him into the Red Lantern Corps, becoming the fifth human to bear a red power ring after Hal Jordan, Mera, Guy Gardner and Kyle Rayner (the sixth terrestrial including Dex-Starr). After killing one of the officers and escaping, Jack went after Baxter, who was being transported to a safe house by the police in a van, but was stopped by Guy Gardner, who Jack pleaded for help after rescuing from getting run over by a truck. Only too late could Jack be helped as his ring transported to Ysmault for training.Red Lanterns #5 (March 2012) As with Hal and Guy, Jack Moore manages to hold on part of his rationality, and he is one of the few able to create constructs. After giving his grandfather's grave a last farewell, he decides to avenge him and his brother by slaying his killer, the man he held responsible by trying to smash him with his grandfather's tombstone, but he's prevented from doing so by Guy Gardener.Red Lanterns #6 (February 2012) He was then confronted by Guy, making the Green Lantern Corps aware of his existence, until he is called to Ryut to join Atrocitus in his fight towards Abysmus and the Abysmorphs.Red Lanterns #7 (March 2012) He is made a true red after he finally kills the man responsible for his grandfather's death. His construct creation ability can be gained by other red lanterns if they drink his blood. * Skallox: A loyal goat-headed member of a crime syndicate hired to commit acts of violence by a man named Lancer. Lancer wrongly accuses Skallox of disloyalty and throws him in an oven, rotting his head into what resembles a goat's skull. Skallox, enraged by what he was turned into, was then visited by a red power ring that crashed through the oven window and convinced him that he'd deserve better respect as a member of the Red Lantern Corps. He is shown among the Red Lanterns during Final Crisis: Rage of the Red Lanterns and then named in Blackest Night #0. Part of his origin story is shown in the Red Lantern series, after Atrocitus throws him into the blood ocean. Skallox is killed by Atrocitus when the latter snaps his neck.Red Lanterns #34 However, he is shown to be alive and allied with Atrocitus once more. * Ratchet: A large floating brain with jellyfish-like features that is shown among the Red Lanterns during Final Crisis: Rage of the Red Lanterns and then named in Blackest Night #0. In Red Lanterns #4 and 5, his origin story is revealed after Atrocitus throws him in the blood ocean on Ysmault. First depicted as a small, alien life form not resembling his current jellyfish-like appearance, his body is mutilated and deformed by his society's law enforcement by defying their cultural rule of physical isolation. Finding a place with the Red Lanterns, his rage, born of his forced isolation, gradually starts to diminish. Before it can fade completely, he sacrifices himself in battle. * Zilius Zox (of Sector 3544): First shown in Final Crisis: Rage of the Red Lanterns, he devours a Sinestro Corps member during Sinestro's abduction. He appears to be the same species as late Green Lantern Galius Zed. In Red Lanterns, Atrocitus throws him into the blood ocean in an attempt to restore his intelligence like Bleez. Zilius Zox joins Guy Gardner's Red Lanterns and in Red Lanterns Annual #1 he is fatally injured by Rankorr (who was possessed by Red Lantern Votun). Zilius Zox sacrifices himself to crash his ship into Atrocitus' Red Lantern Temple and destroy the new Blood Lake.Red Lanterns Annual #1 However, he is shown to be alive and allied with Atrocitus once more. * The Judge (Judge Sheko) (of Sector 775): Once chief judge of her home planet of Primeen, a world in which its politics, justice and worse its nobility were hideously steeped in corruption and decadence. The concepts of law and order were disreputably bought and sold by those rich enough and powerful enough to afford to have them changed or annulled. This greatly irked Sheko to no end for the past couple of decades. But her fury didn't come to a head until the duplicitous king's son she intended to have punished accordingly had her own bailiff kill her in front of a courtroom. As she died while drowning in the pools where justice is carried out, she finally let the slowly budding fury that she kept close to her heart consume her. It was then when a red rage ring called out to her and transformed her into a monstrous personification of that fury. Unlike other newly-created lanterns, Sheko retained her logical mindset but was still under a cold, ruthless, tranquil fury which pushed her to violently judge and murder everyone around her, starting with her traitorous aide and the debauched royal family who nearly destroyed her, as well as all of the attendants watching the trial. After that, she began playing judge, jury, and executioner with everyone in the city she once called home. She was stopped by Guy Gardner's sect of Red Lanterns before Atrocitous could sway her to his side using the blood of Ysmault to bring back her rationality. Atrocitus tried to recruit her into his Red Lantern Corps but she wishes to 'judge' both factions and goes to see Gardener's reds. Finally, during the Atrocities storyline of the Red Lanterns, she deems Atrocitus reds guilty and herself guilty as well and generates a mental blast that kills her and renders the guilty reds unconscious.Red Lanterns #30 * Veon (of Sector 435): A purple alien with one eye and one of Atrocitus's first recruits, he is shown in Final Crisis: Rage of the Red Lanterns and named during Hal's attempted rescue of Sinestro when his ring says \\"Veon rage.\\" In Green Lantern vol. 4 #45, he is killed by Boodikka when the Green Lanterns retrieve Laira's body from Ysmault. * Vice (of Sector 13): The most ruthless of the Red Lanterns, whose mate was murdered by the Sinestro Corps drill sergeant, Arkillo. His forehead and jaw contain spikes which he uses to decapitate his enemies. He is later captured and sent to the sciencells on Oa, but is freed by Scar. He starts a riot among the prisoners, attacking Green Lanterns and Sinestro corpsmen alike. He is later killed by Alpha Lantern Chaselon during an attack by the Black Lanterns. * Laira (of Sector 112): A former Green Lantern who is chosen by a red power ring after being punished and expelled for killing Amon Sur.Green Lantern vol. 4 #26 (February 2008) Her rage regresses her to a semi-feral state where she is capable of saying little more than \\"Sinestro.\\" Hal Jordan meets her again on Ysmault and attempts to calm her rage. Just as Laira and her red power ring simultaneously utter \\"Help me,\\" she is killed by Sinestro. * Abyssma: First identified by name by Ethan Van Sciver during an interview, Hal Jordan is shown fighting this Red Lantern during a battle between the Corps.Ethan Van Sciver - Behind the Lanterns' Looks, Newsarama, April 25, 2009 * Antipathy: A favorite creation of Ethan Van Sciver, she is shown fighting Lantern Soranik during the epic battle between the Corps. She is distinguished as being one of the few Red Lanterns to create constructs using her ring, as she is depicted wielding scissor-like blades made of red light. * Fury-6: First identified by name in the promotional imagery contained inside Blackest Night #0, he was first seen as a participant in the abduction of Sinestro.Blackest Night #0 (April 2009) * Haggor: First identified by name in the promotional imagery contained inside Blackest Night #0, he is similar in appearance to Abyssma. * Nite-Lik: Unique to the members of the Red Lantern Corps, Nite-Lik was designed specifically for Mattel‚Äôs series of Green Lantern figures by Four Horsemen Studios and was named after Mattel's Scott Neitlich by Geoff Johns.Rage of the Red Lanterns: GLC series 2 Skallox and Nite-Lik Review, MTV Geek, April 19, 2011 The packaging for Nite-Lik's figure (which is a body that includes interchangeable heads for Nite-Like and Skallox) states that his first appearance is in Green Lantern (Volume 4) #61, however, he doesn't actually make his debut until the first issue of Red Lanterns.Green Lantern vol. 4 #61 (December 2010) =Former members= * Supergirl (Kara Zor-El) (of Sector 2813): The biological cousin of Superman. In the New 52, the grief and rage from her past experiences attracts a red power ring to her.Supergirl Vol. 6 #28 After being captured by the Green Lantern Corps, she is taken to Ysmault and the Blood Lake restores her sanity where she joins Guy Gardner's Red Lantern group.Green Lantern vol. 5 #28 and Red Lanterns vol. 1 #28 She is later discharged by Guy so she doesn't need to die needlessly in the coming war against Atrocitus.Red Lanterns vol. 1 #32 Later, to avoid being possessed by an alien armor, she removes her ring while at the core of Earth's yellow sun, but survives due to the healing factor from her Kryptonian powers as a result of absorbing so much yellow solar radiation.Supergirl Vol. 6 #33 She is the only known former member of the Red Lantern Corps who has been able to destroy her own ring and did not need to be purified by a Blue Lantern afterwards. * Hal Jordan (of Sector 2814): A Green Lantern officer given a red power ring during his attempt to rescue Sinestro from the Red Lanterns and to calm Laira's rage, only to have Sinestro kill her just as he appears to be breaking through. Enraged, Laira's red power ring detects Hal's anger and forces itself onto his finger, temporarily transforming him into a member of the Red Lantern Corps. Hal is able to overcome the red ring's influence with the aid of the Blue Lantern Corps. * James Kim (of Sector 2814): A man whose daughter was cruelly murdered. Though not in possession of a red power ring, as the host of The Butcher, he has no need for one. * Krona (of Sector 0): During the War of the Green Lanterns, Krona was briefly able to take control of Atrocitus' ring and the other six rings, using them against the Green Lantern Corps, but the ring returned to its master after Hal Jordan killed Krona.Green Lantern vol. 4 #67 (July 2011) * Mera (of Sector 2814): The queen of the underwater kingdom of Atlantis. Mera is chosen as a deputy Red Lantern during the war against the Black Lantern Corps.Blackest Night #6 (December 2009) When Aquaman is later resurrected by the White Entity, Mera's love for him severs the connection to her ring. Fortunately, she is spared from death through the combined efforts of Carol Ferris and Saint Walker.Blackest Night #8 (March 2010) * Spectre (of Sector 2814): After being freed of the possession of a black power ring by Parallax during the Blackest Night event, Atrocitus attempts to recruit the Spectre to the Red Lantern Corps. After taking on the Red Lantern symbol and signature regurgitation of blood, The Spectre is able to shrug off the effects of the intrusion (explaining that he is God's rage, not Atrocitus').Green Lantern vol. 4 #51 (February 2010) * Kyle Rayner (of Sector 2814): One of the six Green Lanterns of Earth, Kyle had become a \\"magnet\\" to all the corps rings with one red ring appearing to him claiming him as its bearer. It has since been revealed that Kyle must channel all the powers of the emotional spectrum while without possessing a red ring, he can access, at will, the powers of the red light, also turning him disturbingly cold when he does. * Superman-Prime (of sector 2813): Superman- Prime temporarily becomes a member of the Red Lantern Corps during the Blackest Night storyline as his rage causes the black power ring that tries to turn him into a Black Lantern to temporarily turn him into a Red Lantern. * Lobo (of Sector 3500): During the Brightest Day story, Atrocitus hired Lobo to attack the leader of the Red Lanterns in order to gain the trust of Hal Jordan, Carol Ferris, and Sinestro. As payment for his services, Atrocitus rewarded Lobo with a red ring. It is unknown if the ring was ever used. Entity The red rage entity is called The Butcher and takes the form of an Earth bull with a forehead bone structure resembling the Red Lantern symbol, created by the first act of murder. As with the other emotional entities, the Butcher was attracted to Earth by the Entity and is hunted by Krona. The white Entity intones for Hal, Carol, and Sinestro to find them before it is too late. According to Atrocitus' divining ritual, the Butcher can be found in the northwestern United States.Green Lantern vol. 4 #54 (May 2010) The Butcher goes on the run all the while trying to find a host.Green Lantern vol. 4 #58 (October 2010) Atrocitus is currently searching for it, along with Dex-Starr and Sinestro. The Spectre is also seen searching for the Entity.Green Lantern vol. 4 #55 (June 2010) The Butcher eventually tries to possess a man named James Kim whose daughter was cruelly murdered; however, the Spectre prevented it, claiming that the Butcher was too chaotic and too dangerous to be left alone on Earth, and as he tried to kill the rage entity, Atrocitus comes to the rescue. Taking the opportunity, the Butcher finally possesses James Kim, goading him with words of his daughter's killer to empower its rage which led to James killing the murderer. However, by killing him, James rage began subsiding, forcing the Butcher to choose another host. Atrocitus tricks the entity into exposing itself, and with the help of the Spectre, Atrocitus manages to contain the entity in the red lantern battery by chanting the Red Lantern Corps oath. Later, when Krona is attempting to obtain the last of the entities, he uses Ophidian's powers to get Atrocitus to release The Butcher and claim it. During the assault on Oa, Krona allows the Butcher and the other entities (except for Parallax) to take one of the six remaining Guardians as hosts. The Butcher was eventually freed from Krona's control after Hal Jordan defeated and killed the rogue Guardian. The Butcher roamed at large in the universe once again. The Butcher soon began suffering from a strange illness, later revealed to be the reservoir of the emotional spectrum becoming exhausted. After Relic wiped out the Blue Lantern Corps and forcefully drained the green light from Oa's Central Power Battery and destroying the planet in the process, the Butcher sacrifices himself, passing into the Source Wall to repair the emotional spectrum. However, it appears that a new rage entity has since been born from the excess rage left on Earth from the war with Atrocitus.Red Lanterns #39 During the Rebirth run, Atrocitus enacts a scheme to take Earth as a new homeworld for the Red Lanterns dubbing this endeavor as the prophetic Red Dawn in following after the Blackest Night and Brightest Day occurrences.Green Lanterns: Rebirth Vol 1 #1 In the aftermath, a new Rage Entity is currently growing in the center of the Earth's core which will grow and feed on humanity's wrath until it is mature enough to bring about what he's envisioned.Green Lanterns Vol 1 #6 Oath Like other Corps in the DC Universe, Atrocitus created an oath for the Red Lanterns to use when recharging their rings. As the other members of his Corps are rarely seen as being capable of speech, it's unknown how often they use it (if they are able to at all). However, it has been shown how Atrocitus is able to restore intelligence and abstract thought, along with full speech capabilities, to his fellow Red Lanterns by the use of his shamanistic magic, making them able to recite the full oath. The Red Lantern Corps oath is recited as follows: Green Lantern: The Animated Series features an adjusted version of this oath: Aya also created an alternative that was ultimately unable to activate the ring and battery: Powers and abilities Laira's Red Power Ring Red Lanterns use red power rings, fueled by the rage of their users and those around them. Like other power rings, the ring covers the user in a protective aura which shields them from harm and enables flight, and can create \\"hard light\\" constructs. The power ring fires blasts of rage energy. The user's blood is replaced by a form of corrosive, rage-energized blood. The user can regurgitate this blood. The blood has the effect of bursting into flames of rage; the flames are so potent that they will burn even in space. The blood can melt through the constructs of other ring wielders, penetrate their personal force fields (sometimes burning them to death in the process), and corrupt their rings, depleting their energy at an accelerated rate. The red rings' \\"blood\\" is one of the few known substances that can destroy a Black Lantern's corpse faster than even they can regenerate. Since the red ring completely takes over the circulatory processes of the wearer, removing the heart of a Red Lantern only temporarily incapacitates them. One of the Red Lantern's signature moves is throwing up blood on the enemy Injustice 2 A red power ring operates by expelling the blood of the wearer, replacing it with red light. As a result, removing a Red Lantern's ring will result in the wearer's death. However, a Blue Lantern's ring can reverse this process, freeing the wearer from the ring. The combined powers of blue and green rings can destroy a red ring. Also, if the heart of the wearer fills with love, which is the opposite emotion to rage in the Emotional Spectrum, the rage gets compromised and the connection with the ring breaks, instantly destroying the ring. But the light of a Blue Lantern is still needed to heal the former Red Lantern because his/her heart goes into cardiac arrest by the lack of blood. To date, Mera is the only Red Lantern who was freed this way. Though most red ring wielders are little more than beasts driven by rage, individuals with strong willpower are able to manipulate the energy to create constructs. The Red Lantern ring is unique in that the user can manipulate its base of power, rage. A Red Lantern can detect the rage in the heart of others and, by connection, the blood that pumps that rage. Those who face a Red Lantern already in a state of anger are even more vulnerable to a red power ring's attack, as their anger only feeds the attack and increases its destructive power. The red power ring has also displayed a number of weaknesses as well. To wear a red power ring is to be overtaken by the red light of rage, reducing the wearer to act on pure instinct, driven to kill and destroy with little reason or forethought. Supposedly because Atrocitus is the creator of the corps, he is one of the few who has retained his personality without drowning in the Blood Lake of Ysmault. The only other member to retain their sanity is Rankorr of Earth. This was done through sheer willpower, which may be why he is the only Red Lantern capable of creating hard light constructs, though a Blue Lantern can, at least partially, restore a Red Lantern's cognitive functions while retaining their Red Lantern abilities. If a Red Lantern Ring wielder is placed in the Lake of Blood on Ysmault, he or she will have their intelligence restored. Atrocitus intentionally set the rings to select beings who cannot control their rage, and the rings have attempted to leave wielders who gain control of their rage on a few occasions (although as all of these were with members of the Green Lantern Corps, they may be set instead to leave those whose willpower is too strong to be influenced). In the new continuum, the red rings are either given or revealed to have a host of other powers due to their scientific/mystical origin. Through Atrocitus' foul craft using a lantern called the Rage Mother, he could resurrect any number of Red Lanterns previously killed through her plasmoid blood.Lobo vol 3 The rings themselves have unique properties to them that only some of the more coherent Lanterns can access. One example is rage telepathy, where a user can lock onto a person's rage and sift through their mindscape to learn what they wish to know from the individual, as well as summarily execute them in a visceral fashion if deemed guilty. The only drawback is if the user isn't strong enough to handle such baleful thought processes, their minds will be overwhelmed.Red Lanterns #30 In those whose fury, as their minds, are particularly powerful, they undergo startling transformations. Rankorr of Earth and Shekeo of Primeen gained a semblance which seemed to physically manifest their inherent fury, making them tougher and stronger than many of their feral brethren while also maintaining their cognitive functions after a fashion. Other powers include learning different abilities from other ring wielders by partaking of some of their blood, as was the case with Dex-Starr who used it to save his handler and master Atrocitus. Other versionsThe Lightsmiths= In the universe prior to the current one, groups managed to tap into the wellspring of power created by the Emotional Spectrum. In this universe, those who tapped into the red light were known as the Lightsmiths of the Red Light of Fury and were the ones that rejected Relic.Green Lantern #23.1 Reception Critical reception for the Red Lantern Corps has been mixed. Their first appearance, during the Final Crisis event in 2008, was met with a mostly positive critical response. Jesse Schedeen, writing for IGN, remarked that \\"the Red Lanterns are an excellent addition to the increasingly crowded Lantern mythos.\\" J. Montes, writing for Weekly Comic Book Review, noted that \\"The Red Lanterns are vicious and make the relentlessness of the Sinestro Corps almost wimpy by comparison.\\" Likewise, Red Lantern Bleez's origin story, as told in Blackest Night: Tales of the Corps #2, received widespread praise, particularly for Eddie Barrows's artwork. Their solo series, launched in 2011 as part of the New 52, initially received a mixed to negative response. Most reviewers praised the artwork by Ed Benes and Miguel Sepulveda, while criticizing the weak plot, inconsistent characterization, and uneven pacing of the story. In other mediaTelevision= * The Red Lantern Corps are the primary antagonists of the first arc of Green Lantern: The Animated Series. Known members are Atrocitus (voiced by Jonathan Adams), Zilius Zox (voiced by Tom Kenny), Bleez (voiced by Grey DeLisle), Veon (voiced by Jason Spisak), and Skallox (voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson). New members that are original to the series include Razer (voiced by Jason Spisak) ‚Äî a 'reformed' Red Lantern who sought to escape his past by working with Hal and Kilowog ‚Äî Cleric Loran (voiced by Corey Burton), and Ragnar (voiced by Will Friedle). However, there are a number of differences between their representation on the show and how they appear in the comic. This version of the Red Lantern Corps is not mindless, for instance, and all of the members depicted appear to be fully in control of their actions. The energy produced by their rings also does not produce persistent damage effects or increased violent tendencies in their targets (although it is demonstrated on multiple occasions to be more powerful than Green Lantern energy in sheer output), and Red Lantern rings can be removed without instantly killing the user in this continuity. In this version, Red Lantern energy isn't necessarily a negative emotion, depending on the user and their intentions, as \\"anger\\" is part of the emotions of sentient life. While the version in the comics was blind, unthinking rage, the TV series version of Red Lantern energy is said to cover a broad definition of \\"anger\\", ranging from \\"rage\\" on one end, but also \\"righteous fury\\" on the other. The Red Lantern Corps organization under Atrocitus, however, focuses on rage. Membership is voluntary, with the organization preaching a fascist-protectionist ethos. There also appears to be a cult of personality centered around the veneration of Atrocitus as a prophet figure. It has been revealed that while membership is voluntary, Atrocitus has on at least one occasion plunged an entire planet into generations of war simply to produce a single Red Lantern candidate, manipulating the entire life of Razer in order to fill him with hate. So far, Zilius Zox, Atrocitus, Bleez, Veon, and Skallox have all appeared as members of the animated Red Lantern Corps. Their powers are negated by the proximity of Blue Lantern Corps energy, although extreme anger or \\"righteous fury\\" can overcome that weakness. * The Red Lantern Corps appear in the Justice League Action episode \\"Rage of the Red Lanterns.\\" Known members include Atrocitus (voiced by Michael Dorn), Zilius Zox (voiced by Armin Shimerman), Bleez (voiced by Rachel Kimsey), Skallox, and Dex-Starr (voiced by Jason J. Lewis). They arrive on Earth to pursue the person who stole three newly-forged Red Lantern Rings. This culprit turns out to be Lobo, who orchestrates events to get the Red Lanterns to fight Superman, Wonder Woman, Batman, and Cyborg. When Lobo gets his hands on the Spider Gauntlet during the fight and attacks both sides, the Justice League and the Red Lantern Corps have to work together to fight him. With help from Dex- Starr, Batman was able to defeat Lobo and disarm him of the Spider Gauntlet. While Lobo is taken away to a prison at the edge of the solar system, the Red Lantern Corps reclaim the rings and head back to their base. In the episode \\"Unleashed\\", Dex-Starr infiltrates the Watchtower while most of the heroes are away and tries to use the equipment to open a portal to let the rest of the Red Lantern Corps in. He is defeated and captured by Krypto the Superdog, Streaky the Supercat, and Plastic Man. * Dex-Starr appears in the DC Super- Hero Girls episode #RageCat voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson. Jessica Cruz tries to get the cat adopted. Unlike most versions of the character, he can talk, though only through the Red Lantern ring. He also becomes Jessica's pet. =Video games= * The Red Lantern Corps appear as enemies to both heroes and villains in DC Universe Online as part of the first DLC pack. Atrocitus and Vice are present in this game. They are seen attacking Ferris Aircraft in Coast City. The Red Lantern eventually became a playable power for both heroes and villains in the first of three new DLC packs for DC Universe Online, titled \\"War of the Light: Part I\\" released early 2014. * A Red Lantern can be seen flying in the background battling a Green Lantern in the alternate reality-Metropolis level in the Injustice: Gods Among Us. * Atrocitus, Bleez, and Dex-Starr appear as playable characters in Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham with Atrocitus voiced by Ike Amadi, Bleez voiced by Erica Luttrell, and Dex- Starr voiced by Dee Bradley Baker. * The Red Lantern Corps appear in Injustice 2. Atrocitus is a playable character with Dex-Starr as a companion whom Atrocitus can summon to fight alongside him as his character power. During the main story, Atrocitus tries to recruit the reformed Green Lantern Hal Jordan during Brainiac's attack on Atlantis. However, Hal refuses to give in to his rage and manages to defeat Atrocitus and Dex-Starr, who retreat. In Atrocitus' character ending, he kills Brainiac to avenge all the worlds he had destroyed; however, Atrocitus was unaware that the worlds in Brainiac's collection would also be destroyed, preventing them from being restored. The other Red Lanterns were overcome by the rage generated by countless beings in Brainiac's collection perishing as a result of Atrocitus' killing Brainiac. The Red Lantern Corps force him to flee from Ysmault. However, as they are about to kill him, he is protected by Proselyte, the Entity of compassion as Atrocitus had been unaware that the worlds could be saved. As a result, Atrocitus realizes that the Emotional Spectrum requires balance and that his Red Lanterns Corps must punish the worst offenders but must not allow their rage to blindly consume those deserving compassion. As a result, Atrocitus reforms the Red Lantern Corps under this new philosophy and it is implied that the Red Lanterns start working together with the other Lantern Corps. =Toys= * Atrocitus and Bleez were both featured in the DC Comics Super Hero Collection. * Red Lanterns Skallox, Dex-Starr, and Nite-Lik were featured in the Green Lantern Classics toyline in 2011. * Atrocitus, Mera, and Dex-Starr were released as part of the Blackest Night collection. * A Red Lantern Guy Gardner figure was released as part of the Green Lantern, Series 4 collection. * Atrocitus is part of DC Universe Club Infinite Earths. =Fan films= A few nonprofit fan films have begun to circulate due to Red Lantern popularity. * Red Lantern's Oath (DC Fan Film) by ZenithFilms Media Production * Red Lantern Short Film \\"Red-Birth\\" by LLPros * Dark Superman Full Movie by Jamal Johns Collected editions * Red Lanterns Vol. 1: Blood and Rage (Red Lanterns #1‚Äì7) * Red Lanterns Vol. 2: Death of the Red Lanterns (Red Lanterns #8‚Äì12 and Stormwatch #9) * Stormwatch Vol. 2: Enemies of Earth (Red Lanterns #10 and Stormwatch #7‚Äì12) * Red Lanterns Vol. 3: The Second Prophecy (Red Lanterns #13‚Äì20, #0, Green Lantern (vol. 5) #20) * Green Lantern : Rise of the Third Army (collects Green Lantern Annual #1, Green Lantern (vol. 5) #13‚Äì16, Green Lantern Corps (vol. 3) #13‚Äì16, Green Lantern: New Guardians #13‚Äì16, Red Lantern #13‚Äì16, Green Lantern Corps Annual #1, 416 pages, Hardcover, September 10, 2013, ) * Green Lantern: Wrath of the First Lantern (collects Green Lantern vol. 5 #17‚Äì20, Green Lantern Corps vol. 3 #17‚Äì20, Green Lantern: New Guardians #17‚Äì20, Red Lantern #17‚Äì20, 416 pages, hardcover, February 25, 2014, ) * Red Lanterns Vol. 4: Blood Brothers (collects Red Lanterns #21‚Äì26, Green Lantern Annual #2, 176 pages, Paperback, June 3, 2014, ) * Green Lantern: Lights Out (collects Green Lantern #24, Green Lantern Corps #24, Green Lantern: New Guardians #23-24, Red Lanterns #24, Green Lantern Annual #2, Green Lantern #23.1: Relic, 192 pages, Hardcover, June 24, 2014, ) * Red Lanterns Vol. 5: Atrocities (collects Green Lantern/Red Lanterns #28, Red Lanterns #27, #29-34, Red Lanterns Annual #1, Supergirl #31, 272 pages, Paperback, December 9, 2014, ) * Red Lanterns Vol. 6: Forged in Blood (collects Red Lanterns #35-40, Red Lanterns: Futures End #1, Paperback, 2015, ) ReferencesExternal links * Category:Characters created by Geoff Johns Category:Characters created by Ethan Van Sciver Category:DC Comics supervillain teams Category:DC Comics aliens Category:DC Comics demons Category:Extraterrestrial supervillains Category:Green Lantern characters Category:DC Comics superhero teams ","title":"Red Lantern Corps"},{"id":"20927430","text":"John Stein \\"Tacks\\" Neuer (June 8, 1877 ‚Äì January 14, 1966) was a Major League Baseball pitcher who played for the New York Highlanders in . In seven career games, he had a 4‚Äì2 record, with a 2.17 earned run average (ERA) and 22 strikeouts. A veteran of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, Neuer worked as a brakeman before taking up baseball professionally. He played for various minor league teams in 1905 and 1907 before making his debut for the New York Highlanders. With New York, he threw three shutouts in seven games, and was praised by manager Clark Griffith for his pitching ability during that stretch. However, his control deteriorated after that season, and over the next three years he played for various minor league teams. He retired after 1910 and became an umpire. He then worked at Bendix Aviation until his retirement in 1942. Early life and career Neuer was born in Fremont, Ohio, and was one of eight children born to Henry Neuer and Jennie Catherman. He and his family moved to Sunbury, Pennsylvania, when he was a child. In 1898, Neuer enlisted in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War as a private, and was discharged the following year. After his discharge, he worked as a brakeman for a local railroad for the next few years. In late 1904, the Detroit Tigers intended to sign Neuer to a contract. However, nothing came of it and he never played a game with the organization. Six months after the rumored signing, Neuer was signed by the Wilkes-Barre Barons of the New York State League. He made his professional debut on July 27, 1905, and threw a one-hit shutout against the Syracuse Stars. He pitched for Wilkes-Barre the rest of the season. In his final game for them, he pitched both games of a doubleheader, winning one and losing the other. In 1906, Wilkes-Barre planned to re-sign Neuer, praising his hitting ability to the point that they were considering trying him out as an outfielder or first baseman. They were unable to agree on a contract, and as a result he sat out the 1906 season. In December 1906, the Philadelphia Phillies signed Neuer to a contract. He played with the Phillies through the spring, but was cut before the season started and sent to the Providence Grays of the Eastern League. He debuted for them in May, and after being on the team for five days was sent back to Philadelphia. The Phillies stated that they released him outright to Providence; the issue led to a dispute on which club should pay him for that month, which was settled the following year. After the dispute, Neuer was assigned to the Savannah Indians of the South Atlantic League. He played with the team for three months, and threw multiple shutouts for the team. As a result, New York Highlanders manager Clark Griffith purchased Neuer on August 23 \\"for immediate delivery.\\" New York Highlanders Neuer made his debut for New York on August 28, 1907, against the Boston Americans. He pitched a shutout and earned a 1‚Äì0 victory in which he showed \\"excellent speed and control.\\" A week later, he again faced the Americans, and while his pitching was not as \\"unsolvable\\" as in his debut, the Highlanders again won, 10‚Äì5. His next appearance was against the Washington Senators on September 9. In that game, he allowed two hits and threw his second shutout of the season. A rematch against Washington five days later resulted in a 10‚Äì2 loss that \\"came as a great shock\\" due to his victory earlier in the month. On September 21, Neuer made an appearance as a relief pitcher in a game against the Detroit Tigers, taking over for Bill Hogg due to the latter's ineffectiveness. His next appearance as a starter was against the St. Louis Browns. He was unable to control the baseball due to rain; the 5‚Äì2 game was called after six innings as a result, giving Neuer his second loss. His final appearance of the season was on October 3 against the Chicago White Sox. In that game, he allowed three hits in an 8‚Äì0 victory for his third and final shutout of the season. Neuer spent the offseason working as a hotel clerk, and after signing a contract for the 1908 season, he joined the team for spring training. Griffith continued to have faith in Neuer during the exhibition season, and said he could potentially be \\"one of the greatest ever in the twirling line.\\" Instead of working on his control during that time, which was considered the main thing he needed to work on, he practiced throwing the knuckleball and spitball. Griffith encouraged him to do so, believing that developing these trick pitches would allow him to become a great pitcher, and as a result, he practiced these pitches until, according to one sportswriter, \\"he was so wild he couldn‚Äôt hit the grand stand.\\" In one exhibition game against Atlanta, he appeared in relief of Jack Chesbro, and allowed four runs in less than an inning due to his lack of control. His pitching continued to get worse, and by the end of spring training he was sent to the Newark Indians of the Eastern League. He never returned to the major leagues, becoming the only person to throw a shutout in both his major league debut and his final game. Later life In Neuer's debut for Newark, he allowed nine walks, eight runs, and made two errors; his pitching was noted as the direct cause of the 8‚Äì5 loss. By the beginning of June, Newark returned him to New York; in his short time in the Eastern League, Neuer set the record for most strikeouts in a game and most walks in a game, with 13 each. Griffith sent him back to Newark almost immediately, and they in turn sent him to the Toronto Maple Leafs, who in turn released him. He then signed with the Little Rock Travelers of the Southern Association, and pitched for them before being released on August 1. The Chicago Cubs decided to give Neuer a tryout, hoping to add some pitching depth to help them, as they were in a pennant race. He did not make the roster, and was sent to the Johnstown Johnnies of the Tri- State League, where he finished the 1908 season. In 1909, he was increasingly referred to with the nickname of \\"Tacks\\", a nickname reserved for \\"restless, uneasy, erratic athletes\\", due to both his lack of control and his general inconsistency on the mound. That season, he played with many teams, both professional and semi-pro, and was frequently released to his inability to control the ball. The following year, he attempted one more comeback with the Binghamton Bingoes of the New York State League. Manager Jack Warner found his control to be so bad that he refused to use him in a regular season game, and Neuer's release from Binghamton marked the end of his professional career. After retiring from baseball, Neuer became an umpire for local semi-pro and amateur baseball games, and worked for Bendix Aviation Corporation in Greene, New York until retiring in 1942. As an umpire, he was known for his entertaining style, adding extra emphasis on his calls to amuse game attendees. Neuer was married twice and had one son, Eugene, from his first marriage. He moved to Northumberland, Pennsylvania in the 1940s, where he lived until his death in 1966.

The district includes the western half of Detroit, along with several of its western suburbs and much of the Downriver area. A member of the Democratic Party, Tlaib represented the 6th and 12th districts of the Michigan House of Representatives before her election to Congress. In 2018, Tlaib won the Democratic nomination for the United States House of Representatives seat from Michigan's 13th congressional district. She ran unopposed in the general election and became the first woman of Palestinian descent in Congress, the first Muslim woman to serve in the Michigan legislature, and one of the first two Muslim women elected to Congress, along with Ilhan Omar (D-MN). Tlaib is a member of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA). She and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) are the first female DSA members to serve in Congress. Tlaib has been a vocal critic of the Trump administration and advocated Trump's impeachment. On foreign affairs, she has sharply criticized the Israeli government, called for an end to U.S. aid to Israel, and expressed support for the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaign. Tlaib has gained notice for being a member of \\"The Squad\\" along with fellow House freshmen Omar, Ayanna Pressley (D-MA), and Ocasio-Cortez. Early life and education The eldest of 14 children, Rashida Harbi was born on July 24, 1976, to working-class Palestinian immigrants in Detroit. Her mother was born in Beit Ur El Foka, near the West Bank city of Ramallah. Her father was born in Beit Hanina, a neighborhood in East Jerusalem. He moved first to Nicaragua, then to Detroit. He worked on an assembly line in a Ford Motor Company plant. As the eldest, Tlaib played a role in raising her siblings while her parents worked. ‚Äî Full version at the blog of Niraj Warikoo Harbi attended elementary school at Harms, Bennett Elementary, and Phoenix Academy. She graduated from Southwestern High School in Detroit in 1994. Tlaib gained a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science from Wayne State University in 1998 and then graduated as a Juris Doctor at Western Michigan University Cooley Law School in 2004.  Michigan House of Representatives  Tlaib began her political career in 2004 when she interned with State Representative Steve Tobocman. When Tobocman became Majority Floor Leader in 2007, he hired Tlaib to his staff. In 2008 Tobocman encouraged Tlaib to run for his seat, which he was vacating due to term limits. The urban district is 40% Hispanic, 25% African- American, 30% non-Hispanic white Americans, and 2% Arab American. Tlaib faced a crowded primary that included several Latinos, including former State Representative Belda Garza. She emerged victorious, carrying 44% of the vote in the eight-way Democratic primary and winning the general election with over 90% of the vote. In 2010, Tlaib faced a primary election challenge from Jim Czachorowski in his first bid for office. Tlaib picked up 85% of the vote to Czachorowski's 15%, and won the general election with 92% of the vote against Republican challenger Darrin Daigle. In 2012, Tlaib won reelection again to the Michigan House in the newly redrawn 6th district against fellow incumbent Maureen Stapleton. She could not run for the Michigan House a fourth time in 2014 because of term limits and ran for the Michigan Senate, losing to incumbent Senator Virgil Smith Jr. in the Democratic primary in August 2014. During her tenure as a legislator, Tlaib was one of ten Muslims serving in state legislatures across the United States. She is the second Muslim to serve in the Michigan State House of Representatives, after James Karoub. Tlaib is the second Muslim woman to serve in a state legislature nationwide, after Jamilah Nasheed of Missouri. She and Justin Amash, a Republican who was also elected in 2008, were the first two Palestinian-American members of the Michigan legislature. After leaving the state legislature, Tlaib worked at Sugar Law Center, a Detroit nonprofit that provides free legal representation for workers.  U.S. House of Representatives  Rashida Tlaib at her campaign headquarters in 2018 = Elections = 2018 special election  In 2018, Tlaib announced her intention to run for John Conyers's seat in Congress. She filed in both the Democratic primary in the special election for the balance of Conyers's 27th term and in the general election for a full two- year term. Both elections were to be held the same day. As of July 16, 2018, Tlaib had raised $893,030 in funds, more than her five opponents in the August 7 Democratic primary. Tlaib as a member of the Justice Democrats made a guest appearance on the political interview show Rebel HQ of the progressive media network The Young Turks (TYT). In the Democratic primary for the special election, Tlaib finished second to Detroit City Council president Brenda Jones, who received 32,727 votes (37.7% of the total) to Tlaib's 31,084 (35.9%). Bill Wild, mayor of Westland, received 13,152 votes (15.2%) and Ian Conyers, the great-nephew of former Congressman Conyers, took fourth with 9,740 (11.2%). Jones faced no major-party opposition in the special election. 2018 general election In the Democratic primary for the general election, Tlaib defeated Jones and Wild, among others. She received 27,803 votes, or 31.2%. She faced no major-party opposition in November 2018, though Jones mounted an eleventh-hour write-in bid. Tlaib became the first Palestinian-American woman to be elected to Congress and simultaneously one of the first two Muslim women in Congress, along with fellow Democrat Ilhan Omar of Minnesota. She took the congressional oath of office on January 3, 2019, swearing in on an English-language translation of the Quran. She wore a thawb (thobe), a traditional embroidered Arab dress, to the swearing-in ceremony. This inspired a number of Palestinian and Palestinian-American women to share pictures on social media with the hashtag #TweetYourThobe.  2020 election  Jones challenged Tlaib in the 2020 Democratic primary. Tlaib won, 66%-34%, spending over $2,000,000 in campaign funds to Jones's $140,000. = Committee assignments = * Committee on Financial Services ** United States House Financial Services Subcommittee on Consumer Protection and Financial Institutions ** United States House Financial Services Subcommittee on Housing, Community Development and Insurance * Committee on Oversight and Reform ** United States House Oversight Subcommittee on Economic and Consumer Policy ** United States House Oversight Subcommittee on Environment = Caucus memberships = * Congressional Progressive Caucus Political positionsIsraeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict= Tlaib has said she opposed providing aid to a \\"Netanyahu Israel\\" and supported the Palestinian right of return and a one- state solution. Tlaib is one of the few members of Congress to openly support the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement against Israel. She has defended her support of the boycott on free speech grounds and as a response to Israel's military occupation of the West Bank and settlement building, which the international community considers illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. In January 2019, she criticized anti-BDS legislation proposed by Senators Marco Rubio and Jim Risch. Tlaib argued that boycotting is a right and that Rubio and Risch \\"forgot what country they represent\\". Tlaib's comments were criticized by several groups, including the Anti-Defamation League, which said, \\"Though the legislation discussed is sponsored by four non-Jewish Senators, any charge of dual loyalty has special sensitivity and resonance for Jews, particularly in an environment of rising anti-Semitism.\\" Tlaib responded that her comments were directed at Rubio and Risch, not the Jewish American community. She was one of 17 members of Congress to vote against a July 2019 House resolution condemning the BDS movement, which passed by a margin of 381 votes. Tlaib suggested boycotting HBO host Bill Maher after he denounced the BDS movement. Ban from entering Israel On August 15, 2019, Israel announced that Tlaib and her colleague Ilhan Omar would be denied entry into the country. According to The Times of Israel, Deputy Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Hotovely said Israel would not \\"allow those who deny our right to exist in this world to enter\\" and called it a \\"very justified decision.\\" President Trump had pressed the government of Benjamin Netanyahu to make such a decision. The next day, Israeli authorities granted a request by Tlaib to visit her relatives in the Israeli-occupied West Bank on humanitarian grounds and under certain restrictions on political statements. But Tlaib declined to go, saying that she did not want to make the trip \\"under these oppressive conditions.\\" The Israeli interior ministry stated that Tlaib had previously agreed to abide by any rules the government set in exchange for being permitted to visit the country and accused her of making a \\"provocative request aimed at bashing the State of Israel\\". =Saudi Arabia= Tlaib has criticized Saudi Arabia's human rights violations and the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen. =Trump administration= Tlaib supports efforts to impeach President Trump. In August 2016 she protested a speech Trump gave at Cobo Center and was ejected from the venue. On her first day in Congress, January 3, 2019, she called for the impeachment of Trump in an op-ed article co-authored with John Bonifaz for the Detroit Free Press. In the op-ed Tlaib differs from top Democratic leaders on how to move forward with impeachment: \\"Those who say we must wait for Special Counsel Mueller to complete his criminal investigation before Congress can start any impeachment proceedings ignore this crucial distinction [referring to Congressional powers of impeachment].\\" Later that day Tlaib attended a reception for the MoveOn campaign and spoke on stage. She ended the speech recounting a conversation she had with her son, him saying: \\"Look, mama, you won. Bullies don't win.\\" Tlaib replied to him, she recounted, \\"Baby, they don't, because we're gonna go in there and impeach the motherfucker.\\" The next day at a White House press conference, Trump said, \\"Well, you can't impeach somebody that's doing a great job... I think she dishonored herself and I think she dishonored her family. I thought it was highly disrespectful to the United States of America.\\" In a radio interview with Mehdi Hasan of The Intercept, Tlaib reiterated her frequent call for Trump's impeachment, saying, \\"Look, it's not a waste of time to hold the president of the United States accountable... We need to understand our duties as members of Congress and I believe looking at even Nixon's impeachment, or his‚Äîliterally, his resignation, it was Republicans and Democrats coming together and putting country first, coming together and putting our values first. You're seeing it now more and more. Even now, they're standing up to Steve King.\\" = Other issues = * Democratic Party: Tlaib, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, aligns politically with the left wing of the Democratic Party. * Domestic policy: She supports domestic reforms, including \\"Medicare For All\\" (single-payer healthcare) and a $18 to $20 hourly minimum wage. * Immigration: Tlaib was an early supporter of the movement to abolish the Immigration Customs Enforcement agency. In June 2019 she was one of four Democratic representatives to vote against the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations for Humanitarian Assistance and Security at the Southern Border Act, a $4.5 billion border funding bill that required Customs and Border Protection enact health standards for individuals in custody such as forming standards for individuals for \\"medical emergencies; nutrition, hygiene, and facilities; and personnel training.\\" * Abortion: Tlaib supports abortion rights and has criticized what she called \\"white men trying to force women to not have the right to seek legal abortions\\". She was endorsed by abortion rights organization NARAL. Personal life In 1998, at the age of 22, Tlaib married Fayez Tlaib. They have two sons, Adam and Yousif. The couple have since divorced. In 2018 a campaign spokesperson referred to Tlaib as a single mother. In September 2018, The New York Times reported that Tlaib walked into her family's mosque to express her gratitude for the opportunity to run for Congress by saying \\"Today I was being thankful, embracing how incredibly blessed I am to grow up here, to have this tremendous opportunity...Sometimes I say 'Thank her' because my Allah is She.\\" The Detroit Free Press reported that, although she recognizes that some in her faith community consider her not \\"Muslim enough\\", she believes that \\"Allah ... understands\\" and \\"knows that I am ... giving back and doing things that I think are reflective of Islam\\".

Early life He was born in Grenfell, Saskatchewan, Canada. After attending various grade schools in Saskatchewan and British Columbia he graduated from Grenfell High School in 1919. He received his bachelor's degree from the University of Saskatchewan in 1924 before coming to the United States and receiving a master's degree from Iowa State College of Agriculture in 1925. For the next few years he remained on the staff at Iowa State College as an agricultural economist and marketing specialist. While attending Harvard University he participated in a Brookings Institution sponsored study of agriculture during the New Deal and three years after becoming a naturalized citizen in 1935, he received his Ph.D. from Harvard University. Government career FitzGerald then began his service with the U.S. government in 1935 when he became head of the Economic and Research Section, North Central Division, Bureau of Agricultural Economics, U.S. Department of Agriculture. For the next several years he held many positions within the U.S. Department of Agriculture and gained administrative experience plus exposure to the problems of food distribution in a war ravaged world. In 1946 he accompanied former President Herbert Hoover on a world trip to survey the food situation in various countries. Upon his return, he served for the next couple of years as Secretary General, International Emergency Food Council, a United Nations agency composed of representatives of 32 countries interested in dealing with worldwide food shortages during the years following World War II. In 1948 the U.S. began implementing a massive program of economic assistance to Europe in order to support European recovery from the losses of World War II. This program, popularly known as the Marshall Plan, affected significantly Dennis FitzGerald's career. Paul Hoffman, Director of the Economic Cooperation Administration, the agency established to administer Marshall Plan programs, asked FitzGerald to help organize the Agricultural Division of the Economic Cooperation Administration Thus began FitzGerald‚Äôs 16-year career as an administrator of U.S. government foreign assistance programs. For roughly his first year on the job, FitzGerald was dual-hatted as Director of Foreign Agricultural Relations at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Over the years the name of the agency responsible for these programs changed from Economic Cooperation Administration to the Mutual Security Administration; then it became the Foreign Operations Administration followed by the International Cooperation Administration until finally, in 1961 the Kennedy Administration established the U.S. Agency for International Development which currently administers foreign economic assistance programs. FitzGerald served in important positions through all of these changes in agency names and presidential administrations until the fall of 1961 when he was removed by Fowler Hamilton, President Kennedy‚Äôs first head of the U.S. Agency for International Development. During these years FitzGerald was primarily an administrator who from 1955 on had the operational responsibility of his agency. In this capacity he exercised broad supervision of U.S. overseas missions and instructed each mission to submit draft programs for each fiscal year. He provided continuity within an agency characterized by frequent changes at the top level. Although a professionally trained agricultural economist with years of administrative experience with foreign aid programs, FitzGerald was also a political appointee and thus subject to the fate of holdover political appointees who are normally replaced by an incoming presidential administration wanting to pick its own people to carry out its policies and programs. While he was shuffled out of his position as Deputy Director of Operations after the creation of the new Agency for International Development in 1961, FitzGerald retained his connections with the Agency as a consultant to Fowler Hamilton until December 1962. Meanwhile, in September 1962 he joined the Senior Staff of Brookings Institution as a research scholar and remained at Brookings until 1966. While at Brookings FitzGerald conducted research on issues involving foreign economic assistance, participated in Council on Foreign Relations discussions and in the spring of 1963 served as a consultant for the United Nations Special Fund which provided development assistance to Indonesia. In July 1966 he became Vice President of Checci and Company in Washington, DC. He retired in June 1972. See also Foreign Agricultural Service ReferencesExternal links * Papers of Dennis A.

In South Florida they are invasive in rivers, canals or lakes.Everglades Cooperative Invasive Species Management Area As with a number of other closely related species, P. brachypomus is often referred to as the red-bellied pacu in reference to the appearance of the juveniles. This has resulted in a great deal of confusion about the nature and needs of all the species involved, with the reputation and requirements of one frequently being wrongly attributed to the others.Gamefish of the Amazon Basin, Tambaqui and Pirapitinga Ecology In general, the behavior resembles that of the closely related tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum). The pirapitinga is migratory, but the pattern is poorly understood.Araujo-Lima, C.A.R.M.; and M.L. Ruffino (2003). Migratory Fishes of the Brazilian Amazon. Pp. 233‚Äî302 in: Carolsfeld, J.; B. Harvey; C. Ross; and A. Baer (editors). Migratory Fishes of South America. Spawning occurs at the beginning of the flood season between November and February. Larvae of the pirapitinga are found in whitewater rivers, but adults mainly live in flooded forests and floodplains of variours river types, including both nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor. Unlike the tambaqui, the pirapitinga also occurs in the headwaters of nutrient-poor rivers (not just in the lower sections). It mainly feeds on fruits, seeds and nuts, but it is opportunistic and will also take zooplankton, insects, crustaceans and small fish, especially in the dry season. In general, more seeds are able to pass undamaged through the pirapitinga than the tambaqui, meaning that the former overall is a more efficient seed disperser. Appearance Skull from side and above P. brachypomus can reach up to in length and in weight. Juveniles have a distinct red chest and belly, and are easily confused with the carnivorous red-bellied piranha (Pygocentrus nattereri), but the two can be separated by their teeth, which are molar-like in Piaractus. This similarity is believed to be mimicry by P. brachypomus in an attempt of avoiding predation by other species. Adults lack the bright red chest and belly, and resemble the tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum), but can be separated by several meristic and morphological features: The pirapitinga has a smaller adipose fin that lacks rays, as well as differences in teeth and operculum.Lauzanna, L.; and G. Loubens (1985). Peces del Rio Marmor√©. . The pirapitinga also has a more rounded head profile (less elongated and pointed).Cagauan, A.G (2007). Red- bellied Pacu in the Philippines. Journal of Environmental Science and Management 10(1): 42‚Äî47. The other member of its genus, P. mesopotamicus, can be distinguished by its smaller scale-sizeOPEFE (27 December 2011). genus Piaractus. Retrieved 2 March 2017. and the higher number of lateral scales (more than 110). Connection to humans The pirapitinga supports major fisheries and based on a review by IBAMA, it was the 12th most caught fish by weight in the Brazilian Amazon in 1998 (just after of the tambaqui). The pirapitinga is often kept in aquaculture. Hybrids between this species and the tambaqui have been produced in aquaculture.Gomes, Schneider, Barros, Sampaio, Hashimoto, Porto-Foresti, and Sampaio (2012). Innovative molecular approach to the identification of Colossoma macropomum and its hybrids. An. Acad. Bras. Ci√™nc. 84(2). It can also hybridize with P. orinoquensis, but the offspring appears to be sterile. =In aquariums= Juvenile pirapitinga long, sometimes labelled as \\"vegetarian piranha\\" or \\"red-bellied pacu\\", are frequently seen in the aquarium trade, but they rapidly grow to a large size and require an enormous tank. It reaches a very large size, but is smaller than its well- known relative Colossoma macropomum. It can and will grow quickly under favourable conditions. The overall size to which it can grow remains a matter of considerable debate and no small amount of confusion. Much of the confusion stems from the fact that one species can and often is easily mistaken for another, and the size attainable in captivity is usually less than the size attainable in the wild. However, it can easily outgrow the majority of home aquaria: they are strong and robust fish which need a lot of swimming space and make very heavy demands of the filtration system. At larger sizes, the P. brachypomus needs a correspondingly large tank to thrive in captivity. The temperature of the water in which they are kept should be within and the system should be well filtered and oxygenated. Larger P. brachypomus are sometimes classed as \\"monster fish\\" and find a place in aquariums which house other large fish. They tend to be timid and retiring and will retreat to cover if they feel insecure. Some squabbling may become apparent if they are kept in a group.It can take a lot of time for them to get accustomed to the aquarium, and may try to jump out frequently. Captive diet In the aquarium offer it a varied diet consisting of quality dried pellets or floating sticks, along with plenty of fruit and vegetables. Spinach, lettuce leaves, and fruit and vegetables such as apple, banana, peach, grapes, courgette, peas, cabbage and carrot all work well. They will also sometimes \\"snatch\\" floating food, which results in a lot of splashing and makes a lid essential. In captivity, it is inadvisable to keep this species with anything small enough to be regarded as food, though they are usually safe around larger fish.

Originally released on 1 October 2008 as an exclusive iOS title, the game was later ported to Nintendo DSi, PlayStation Portable, PlayStation 3, and mobile phones. It was released on the Android platform in July 2011, on the Amazon Appstore and Android Market. On 25 October 2011, it was ported to HTML5 by Gradient Studios and Bocoup and released on the Chrome Web Store with the first level, Grasslands, playable for free. It is the first release of developer Subatomic Studios. Gameplay Unlike in other tower defense games, turrets can be placed anywhere and the enemies will go around them, forcing them to walk along any path the player makes. It is not possible to block the path however. Fieldrunners offers three types of gameplay: Classic, Extended and Endless. Playing in Classic and Extended modes limits the number of rounds in which the player must defend to 100. Classic only lets players build the original four towers, Gatling, Goo, Missile, and Tesla (except Skyway which substitutes Laser for Tesla and Frostbite which substitutes Ice for Goo). Extended mode adds the two new towers, Flame Tower and Mortar Tower (except Skyway which adds Tesla instead of Mortar). In Endless mode, the player may defend indefinitely. In any mode, the player may play in Easy, Medium, or Hard mode. =Maps= Maps were released over a course of updates. Only Grasslands was present during the initial release, featuring an open field in which enemies enter from the left and exit to the right. Crossroads was later released, also featuring an open field but enemies cross from top to bottom in addition from left to right. Drylands later followed, featuring an open field with three entry points, two from left to right and one from top to bottom. Two maps were included as in-app purchases, Skyway and Frostbite. Skyway features a field containing obstacles and with one leftmost entrance. Frostbite has four entrances on each side of the map which all converge in the center. Another update introduced a free map, Crystal Caves, and two in-app purchase maps, MudSlide, and LavaFlow. Crystal Caves features an open field with one entrance encircled by an additional train route. Mudslide features a field containing obstacles, a left entrance and an intersecting train route. Lavaflow features a field with two intersecting train routes and one left entrance. Reception Fieldrunners has received generally positive reviews, with the PSP version scoring 81% at the review aggregate website Metacritic. IGN gave the game an eight out of ten rating, and highly recommended it. Select Start Media was highly critical of the PC port, however expressed enjoyment of the mobile releases. Of the iPhone version, Stuart Dredge of Pocket Gamer noted its \\"clever controls and cartoony visuals\\", calling it \\"the best Tower Defense game on iPhone so far\\". The PSP version of Fieldrunners scored a high 81/100 on Metacritic. Reviews for the iPad Fieldrunners HD version have been positive. However, ratings on the game have been relatively lower than other games due to the fact it is a paid game that has IAP (In app purchases) for the full game and the high crash rate for some players. https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fieldrunners/id292421271?mt=8 See also * Fieldrunners 2 ReferencesExternal links * Category:2008 video games Category:Android (operating system) games Category:DSiWare games Category:IOS games Category:Linux games Category:MacOS games Category:Mobile games Category:PlayStation 3 games Category:PlayStation Network games Category:PlayStation Portable games Category:Tower defense video games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Windows games ","title":"Fieldrunners"},{"id":"20927709","text":"Charles Edward Brown (August 17, 1871 - April 3, 1938) was a professional baseball pitcher.

In 1966, she recorded some songs at Stax studios, a rarity for a white singer. She also had several chart hits in South Africa in the 1970s.  1960s  Based in Johannesburg, South Africa, Tandy appeared in South Africa's first beat film, Africa Shakes, and moved to England in 1964 at the suggestion of Frank Fenter, UK head of Atlantic Records, whom she later married. She released several singles between 1965 and 1969, and although none was a hit, she appeared on several contemporary television programmes, such as Beat Club. She has been described by Richie Unterberger as \\"blue-eyed soul singer rather in the mold of Dusty Springfield, both in terms of her voice and her versatility, blending various shades of soul, British pop, and even some tinges of mod-psychedelia.\\" Her voice has also been compared to those of Julie Driscoll and Christine Perfect. In 1966 she recorded tracks at Stax Records' McLemore Avenue studios, backed by Booker T. & the M.G.'s and Isaac Hayes, and was an opening act on the 1967 Stax/Volt Tour of Europe. That year she also teamed up with another of Fenter's bands, Les Fleur de Lys and recorded several singles for the Atlantic label and a session for John Peel's \\"Top Gear\\".featuring \\"Always Something There to Remind Me\\", \\"Our Day Will Come\\" and \\"Hold On\\" She recorded a single for Polydor in 1967 credited to \\"Debrah Aire\\" featuring more pop styled tracks, but this also flopped. The combination of lack of commercial success and the breakdown of her relationship with Fenter led to her return to South Africa in 1970.  Later career  As half of various duets, Tandy scored three South African Top Ten hits between 1972 and 1978. However, little success followed these recordings. In 1989, she appeared in the South African boxing film Brutal Glory as a singer.

In the film, a space-cargo transport ship is attacked by an unknown alien life form that manipulates all organic life into releasing their inner evil psyche.  Plot  After months of hyper-sleep aboard the cargo transport ship Solar System Shipping Vessel No.17 (SSS-17), two crew members awaken - Christopher 'Chris' McNiel (Jason London) and Theta Kaplan (Missy Crider). They discover that they've been awakened from hyper-sleep, by the ship's computer, almost ten months past their scheduled time, as something has gone terribly wrong on board. The ship's internal systems are badly damaged, they have almost no fuel and their position is some way off the ecliptic. They slowly realize that the vessel's first shift probably killed each other and caused the ship's desolation but, as of yet, they don't know why. They calculate that they have only nine hours of life-support power left and then it will fail. With the help of the ship's log they discover a space probe that one of the crew of the first shift brought on board. They then find a strange substance and begin to analyze it. Soon after the discovery of the probe and the substance they start to argue, which quickly escalates into violence. They then try to kill each other in a running struggle throughout the damaged ship. Meanwhile, the crew of a nearby deep-space research ship following a comet and which has been alerted to their predicament evaluate if they can attempt a rescue. Trapped in the freezing cargo hold, a near hypothermic Kaplan regains her senses and realises that the strange substance must be a biological agent which induces psychosis but becomes inert at low body temperatures. Based upon this information the ship's computer suggests a drug which should cure the infection. After injecting herself with the cure, Kaplan manages to trap a still psychotic McNiel and treat him. The two then have to convince the reluctant research ship to try a rescue plan to slingshot the crew over. As they make departure preparations, they discover that the drug had only a temporary affect and that they are still infected and cannot risk contaminating the rest of the crew or their rescuers. They decide to transfer the uninfected sleepers over with minutes to spare before their sleep chambers fail. McNiel and Kaplan decide to remain with No.17 as it hurtles towards the sun, to prevent future contamination. To while away the time left, they dismantle the probe and discover that it contains a canister of the blue contaminant. It is discovered that the probe was originally from Earth and they speculate that it picked up the virus in space and went on to accidentally contaminate an unknown alien race, who then sent the probe back where it came from as some kind of retaliation.

Walker, Santa Maria Convent of the Sisters of the Holy Rosary, Jerusalem, May 1948; photo taken by John Roy Carlson On 19 May 1948, The Scotsman quoted a report by Wasson saying the British Consul had a \\"narrow escape\\" when the consulate came under gunfire. On 22 May, it was reported that Wasson had attempted to stop the Arab Legion shelling of the Hadassah Hospital and Hebrew University on Mount Scopus: \\"The American Consul is reported to have contacted the Legion requesting it to stop firing on Jewish positions in and around the buildings. The Legion's commander replied that the buildings were being used by Jewish forces to mortar and machine-gun the Arab-occupied Sheikh Jarrah quarter and handed the Consul surrender terms to convey to the Jews. The commander asked that all fighting Jews in the hospital and university surrender as prisoners of war and that all doctors, nurses, professors, and scientists be handed over to the Red Cross.\\" Later the same day, just after 2.00pm, Wasson was shot while returning to the US Consulate from a meeting of the UN Truce Commission at the French Consulate in Jerusalem.

Basic biomedical research is based on studies of disease processes using, for example, cell cultures or animal models. The adjective \\"translational\\" refers to the \\"translation\\" (the term derives from the Latin for \\"carrying over\\") of basic scientific findings in a laboratory setting into potential treatments for disease.  Definitions  Translational medicine is defined by the European Society for Translational Medicine (EUSTM) as \\"an interdisciplinary branch of the biomedical field supported by three main pillars: benchside, bedside and community.\\" It is defined for school-based education by the Education Futures Collaboration (www.meshguides.org) as research which translates concepts to classroom practice. Examples of translational research are commonly found in education subject association journals and in the MESHGuides which have been designed for this purpose. Translational research applies findings from basic science to enhance human health and well-being. Translational research adopts a scientific investigation/ enquiry into a given problem facing medical/health practices to surmount such problem which will helps to raise aggregate health performance.Akarowhe K (2018) Translational Research: Definitions and Relevance. J Biol Med Res Vol.2 No.2:13 In a medical research context, it aims to \\"translate\\" findings in fundamental research into medical practice and meaningful health outcomes. Translational research implements a \\"bench-to- bedside\\", from laboratory experiments through clinical trials to point-of-care patient applications, model, harnessing knowledge from basic sciences to produce new drugs, devices, and treatment options for patients. The end point of translational research is the production of a promising new treatment that can be used with practical applications, that can then be used clinically or are able to be commercialized. As a relatively new research discipline, translational research incorporates aspects of both basic science and clinical research, requiring skills and resources that are not readily available in a basic laboratory or clinical setting. Translational research is conceived due to the elongated time often taken to bring to bear discovered medical idea in practical terms in a health system. It is for these reasons that translational research is more effective in dedicated university science departments or isolated, dedicated research centers. Since 2009, the field has had specialized journals, the American Journal of Translational Research and Translational Research dedicated to translational research and its findings. Translational research is broken down into different stages, including two- stage (T1 and T2), four-stage (T1, T2, T3, and T4), and five-stage (T1, T2, T3, T4, and T5) schemes. In a two-stage model, T1 research, refers to the \\"bench-to-bedside\\" enterprise of translating knowledge from the basic sciences into the development of new treatments and T2 research refers to translating the findings from clinical trials into everyday practice. In a five-stage scheme, T1 involves basic research, T2 involves pre-clinical research, T3 involves clinical research, T4 involves clinical implementation, and T5 involves implementation in the public health sphere. Waldman et al. propose a scheme going from T0 to T5. T0 is laboratory (before human) research. In T1-translation, new laboratory discoveries are first translated to human application, which includes phase I & II clinical trials. In T2-translation, candidate health applications progress through clinical development to engender the evidence base for integration into clinical practice guidelines. This includes phase III clinical trials. In T3-translation, dissemination into community practices happens. T4-translation seeks to (1) advance scientific knowledge to paradigms of disease prevention, and (2) move health practices established in T3 into population health impact. Finally, T5-translation focuses on improving the wellness of populations by reforming suboptimal social structures. In a two-stage scheme, translational research includes two areas of translation. One is the process of applying discoveries generated during research in the laboratory, and in preclinical studies, to the development of trials and studies in humans. The second area of translation concerns research aimed at enhancing the adoption of best practices in the community. Cost-effectiveness of prevention and treatment strategies is also an important part of translational science.  Comparison to basic research or applied research  Basic research is the systematic study directed toward greater knowledge or understanding of the fundamental aspects of phenomena and is performed without thought of practical ends. It results in general knowledge and understanding of nature and its laws.\\"What is basic research?\\" (PDF). National Science Foundation. Retrieved 2014-05-31. Applied research is a form of systematic inquiry involving the practical application of science. It accesses and uses the research communities' accumulated theories, knowledge, methods, and techniques, for a specific, often state, business, or client-driven purpose. In medicine, translational research is increasingly a separate research field. A citation pattern between the applied and basic sides in cancer research appeared around 2000.  Challenges and criticisms  Critics of translational research (to the exclusion of more basic research) point to examples of important drugs that arose from fortuitous discoveries in the course of basic research such as penicillin and benzodiazepines, and the importance of basic research in improving our understanding of basic biological facts (e.g. the function and structure of DNA) that go on to transform applied medical research. Examples of failed translational research in the pharmaceutical industry include the failure of anti-aŒ≤ therapeutics in Alzheimer's disease. Other problems have stemmed from the widespread irreproducibility thought to exist in translational research literature. Facilities In U.S., the National Institutes of Health has implemented a major national initiative to leverage existing academic health center infrastructure through the Clinical and Translational Science Awards. The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) was established on December 23, 2011. Although translational research is relatively new, it is being recognized and embraced globally. Some major centers for translational research include: * About 60 hubs of the Clinical and Translational Science Awards program. * Translational Research Institute (Australia), Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. * Stanford University Medical Center, Stanford, California, United States. * Translational Genomics Research Institute, Phoenix, Arizona, United States. * Maine Medical Center in Portland, Maine, United States has a dedicated translational research institute. * Scripps Research Institute, Florida, United States, has a dedicated translational research institute. * UC Davis Clinical and Translational Science Center, Sacramento, California * Clinical and Translational Science Institute, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvaniahttps://ctsi.pitt.edu/about- us/ Additionally, translational research is now acknowledged by some universities as a dedicated field to study a PhD or graduate certificate in, in a medical context. These institutes currently include Monash University in Victoria, Australia, the University of Queensland, Diamantina Institute in Brisbane, Australia, at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, America, at Creighton University in Omaha, Nebraska at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, and at The George Washington University in Washington, D.C.. The industry and academic interactions to promote translational science initiatives has been carried out by various global centers such as European Commission, GlaxoSmithKline and Novartis Institute for Biomedical Research.

Elizabeth Key won her freedom and that of her infant son John Grinstead on July 21, 1656 in the colony of Virginia. Key based her suit on the fact that her father was a white Englishman who had acknowledged her and arranged her baptism as a Christian in the established Church of England. He was a high-ranking planter who had tried to protect her by establishing a guardianship for her when she was young, before his death. Based on these factors, her English attorney and common-law husband (also white) William Grinstead argued successfully that she should be freed. The lawsuit was one of the earliest \\"freedom suits\\" by an African-descended person in the English colonies. In response to Key's suit and other challenges, the Virginia House of Burgesses passed a law in 1662 establishing that the social status of children born in the colony (\\"bond\\" or \\"free\\") would follow the social status of their respective mothers. This law differed from English common law, in which children's social status was determined by their fathers, who had an obligation to support both legitimate and illegitimate children. Virginia and other colonies incorporated a principle known as partus sequitur ventrem or partus, relating to chattel property. The legislation hardened the boundaries of slavery by ensuring that all children born to enslaved women, regardless of paternity or proportion of European ancestry, would be born into slavery unless explicitly freed. Early life and education Elizabeth Key (perhaps Kaye) was born in 1630 in Warwick County, Virginia. Her mother was an enslaved African woman and her father was Thomas Key, a white Englishman who was a planter and a member of the Virginia House of Burgesses, representing Warwick County (today's Newport News). Thomas Key's legal white wife lived across the James River in Isle of Wight County, Virginia, where she owned considerable property. Born in England, the Keys were considered pioneer planters as they had come to Virginia before 1616, remained for more than three years, paid their own passage, and survived the Indian massacre of 1622. Around 1636, in a civic case at Blunt Point court, Thomas Key was charged with fathering the mixed-race Elizabeth Key. Initially, he denied the charge. Complaints about illegitimate children were brought to court so that fathers would be required to provide support for those children, under English common law, including arranging for apprenticeships so that they could learn skills necessary for their livelihood. Thomas Key first said an unidentified \\"Turk\\" was Elizabeth's father, but the Court relied on witnesses who testified to his paternity. Thomas Key then took responsibility for Elizabeth, arranging for her baptism in the established Church of England. Sometime before his death in 1636, Thomas placed Elizabeth (then age six) in the custody of Humphrey Higginson by a nine-year indenture. Higginson, a wealthy planter, was expected to act as her guardian until Elizabeth Key reached the age of 15 (considered the \\"coming of age\\" for girls; during this period, girls frequently married or began working for wages at age 15). Upon reaching age 15, Elizabeth Key would be free. During this period in early Virginia, both African and English servants were likely to be indentured for a period of years, usually to pay off passage to the Americas. The colony required illegitimate children to be indentured for a period of apprenticeship until they \\"came of age\\" and could be expected to support themselves. It was common for indentured servants to earn their freedom. Working class people of different ethnicities lived, worked, ate, and played together as equals, and many married or formed unions during the colonial period. Key intended Higginson to act as Elizabeth's guardian, but the latter did not keep his commitment to take the girl with him if he returned to England. Instead, he transferred (or sold) her indenture to Col. John Mottram, Northumberland County's first settler. About 1640, Mottram moved to the undeveloped county, taking Elizabeth at age 10 with him as a servant. There is little record of Key's next 15 years. In about 1650, Mottram paid for passage for a group of 20 young white English indentured servants to Coan Hall, his plantation in Northumberland County. To encourage development, the Crown awarded Virginia colonists headrights of of land for each person they transported to the colony; generally, these persons were indentured servants. Each indentured person would serve for six years to pay for the passage from England. One of these servants was 16-year-old William Grinstead (also spelled Greenstead), a young lawyer. Although Grinstead's parents are not known, he may have learned law as the younger son of an attorney. Under the English common law of primogeniture, only the eldest son could inherit the father's real property, so many younger sons crossed the Atlantic to seek their lives and fortunes in the American colonies. Recognizing Grinstead's value, Mottram used the young man for representation in legal matters for Coan Hall. During this period, Grinstead and Elizabeth Key began a relationship and had a son together, whom they named John. They were prohibited from marrying while Grinstead was serving his indenture. Elizabeth Key's future was uncertain. Freedom suit After Mottram died in 1655, the overseers of his estate classified Elizabeth Key and her infant son, John, as Negroes (and essentially as slaves and part of the property assets of the estate). With William Grinstead acting as her attorney, Key sued the estate over her status, claiming that she was an indentured servant who had served past her term and who had a freeborn son. At 25, Elizabeth had been a servant for a total of 19 years, having served 15 years with Mottram. According to Taunya Lovell Banks in the Akron Law Review (2008), at that time \\"English subjecthood\\" rather than \\"citizenship\\" was more important for determining social status in the colony and in England. In the early 17th century, > children born to English parents outside the country became English subjects > at birth, others could become \\"naturalized subjects\\" (although there was no > process at the time in the colonies). What was unsettled was the status of > children if only one of the parents was an English subject, as foreigners > (including Africans) were not considered subjects. Because non-whites came > to be denied civil rights as foreigners, mixed-race people seeking freedom > often had to stress their English ancestry (and later, European). Elizabeth had served as a servant ten years beyond the terms of her indenture. In trying to establish whether Key's father was a free English man, the Court relied on the testimony of witnesses who knew the people in the case. Nicholas Jurnew, 53, testified in 1655 that he had > heard a flying report [rumor] at Yorke that Elizabeth a Negro Servant to the > Estate of Col. John Mottrom (deceased) was the Childe of Mr. Kaye but... Mr. > Kaye said that a Turke of Capt. Mathewes was Father to the Girle.Hardcastle, > \\"Black History shines new light on 'color'\\", Dayton Daily News, Dayton, > Ohio, 30 January 2003, accessed 5 January 2011 If the Court had believed his testimony, it would have influenced the outcome. In 1655, the English colonists would not have considered a Turk a free English subject or a Christian. \\"The most persuasive evidence\\" came from Elizabeth Newman, 80 years old and a former servant of Mottram, who testified that > it was a common Fame in Virginia that Elizabeth a Molletto (sic mulatto), > now (e) servant to the Estate of Col. John Mottrom, deceased, was the > Daughter of Mr. Kaye; and the said Kaye was brought to Blunt-Point Court and > there fined for getting his Negro woman with Childe, which said Negroe was > the Mother of the said Molletto, and the said fine was for getting the Negro > with Childe which Childe was the said Elizabeth. Similar testimony was asserted by other witnesses. Believing Thomas Key's paternity proved, by common law the Court granted Elizabeth Key her freedom. Mottram's estate appealed the decision to the General Court, which overturned it and ruled that Elizabeth was a slave because of her mother's status as Negro.Taunya Lovell Banks, \\"Dangerous Woman: Elizabeth Key's Freedom Suit - Subjecthood and Racialized Identity in Seventeenth Century Colonial Virginia\\", 41 Akron Law Review 799 (2008), Digital Commons Law, University of Maryland Law School, accessed 21 Apr 2009 Through Grinstead, Elizabeth Key took the case to the Virginia General Assembly, which appointed a committee to investigate. They sent the case back to the courts for retrial. Elizabeth Key finally won her freedom on three counts: the most important was that, by English common law, the status of the father determined the status of the child. Her father was a free Englishman, and she was a practicing Christian. Other cases had demonstrated that (black) Negro or Indian Christians could not be held in servitude for life. The Assembly may also have been influenced by the reputation of her father Thomas Key and wanted to carry out his wishes as he had acknowledged his daughter. In addition, the father of her mixed-race child (three-quarters white) was himself an English subject. The court ordered Mottram's estate to compensate Key with corn and clothes for her lost years. Although Elizabeth Key won her court battle for freedom for her and her son John, she and Grinstead could not marry until he completed his indenture in 1656. Theirs was one of the few recorded marriages in the seventeenth century between an Englishman and a free woman of African descent. They had two sons together before William Grinstead died early in 1661. The widow Elizabeth Grinstead later remarried, to the widower John Parse (Pearce). Upon his death, she and her sons John and William Grinstead II inherited , helping to secure their future. This property enabled Elizabeth Grinstead and her sons to get on in the world. Among the many descendants of Elizabeth (Key) and William Grinstead in the South are believed to be those named Grinstead and people with variations of the surname, such as Greenstead, Grinsted and Grimsted.Paul Heinegg, Free African Americans of North Carolina, Virginia, and South Carolina from the colonial period to about 1820, Volume 2 (Google eBook), Baltimore, Maryland: Genealogical Publishing Com, 2005, accessed 7 January 2011 Aftermath As a result of the Elizabeth Key freedom suit (and similar challenges), in December 1662 the Virginia House of Burgesses passed a colonial law to clarify the status of children of women of Negro descent around ‚Äúdoubts [that] have arisen whether children got by an Englishmen upon a negro woman should be slave or free.‚Äù It required the children born in the colony to take the status of the mother, whether bond or free, using the principle of partus sequitur ventrum. The statute was a departure from the English common law tradition in which a child of English subjects received his or her social status and an obligation of support from his or her father. Some historians believe the law was based mostly in the economic demands of a colony that was short on labor; the law enabled slaveholders to control the children of women slaves as laborers. But it also freed the English fathers from acknowledging the children as theirs, providing financial support, or arranging for apprenticeships, as they were required to do in England, or emancipating them. Some white fathers did take an interest in their mixed-race children and passed on social capital, such as education or land; many others abandoned them. Other English colonies (and later American states) passed similar laws, which defined all children born to slave mothers as slaves. If they had free white fathers, as many did under the power conditions of the time, the fathers had to take separate legal action to free their children. In the early 19th century, following slave rebellions in which free blacks played a part, the legislatures of the South made such manumissions more difficult, requiring an act of legislature for each manumission. They also imposed legal restrictions on the rights of free people of color. After the American Revolutionary War, the new constitution counted slaves as only 3/5 persons in figuring apportionment for Congressional seats as a compromise between Southern States who wanted to obtain greater representation by counting slaves as whole persons and Northern States who feared being dominated by the South. Northern states generally abolished slavery in the early 19th century, sometimes on a gradual basis. Northern territories (such as the Northwest Territory) and new states admitted to the Union in the northern latitudes prohibited slavery. States settled by Southerners, such as Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, and Missouri, and those of the Deep South, authorized slavery. Only in 1865 did the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution end slavery in the South and across the United States except for slaves owned by Native Americans who were not freed by American Indian law until one year later in 1866.

Bacon would serve on many commissions. The Privy Council constantly called upon him to conduct inquiries. Bacon was a leader of puritanism in Suffolk. The power and prestige of the puritan ministries in many areas of the country owed their power to Bacon. Sir Nicholas Bacon was considered a good Christian by his contemporaries. Especially his chaplain, Robert Allen. Robert Allen stated that Sir Bacon's wife was dedicated to \\"God‚Äôs holy religion and worship by every good and Christian means in the sight of men.\\" Allen would even dedicate his Doctrine of the Gospel to Sir Nicholas and other members of the family.  Biography  Bacon was born the eldest son of Sir Nicholas Bacon, Lord Keeper of the Great Seal and his first wife, Jane Ferneley. He was the half brother of Sir Francis Bacon. Sir Nicholas Bacon was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge. Bacon was admitted to Gray's Inn in 1562, He entered Parliament in 1563 as a member for Beverley. He obtained this position with the help of Sir Robert Dudley. In 1572, with the help of his father obtained the position of representing Suffolk. He would have this position until 1583. By 1576 Bacon had became an \\"ancient\\" member of the Gray's Inn society. Nicholas Bacon was knighted in 22 August 1578 by Queen Elizabeth. Later, in 1568 he would build an estate in Culford, the estate would be finished in 1591. Bacon would use the estate as a sheep farm. He owned other estates in Blackbourne, Shipmeadow, Redgrave, Ingham and Barnham. In 1586 Bacon accused a man named Thomas Lovell of interfering with witnesses in a trial. This resulted in Lovell trying to fight a duel with Bacon. However, before the duel could take place, in 1593 the debate was settled and Lovell was kicked of a commission. In 1595 Nicholas married his daughter to Bassingbourne Gawdy II. Together with the Gawdy family, Bacon's family would stand in opposition to the Lovell Family. Nicholas was appointed High Sheriff of Suffolk in 1581. In 1609 he and his wife inherited Foxearth Hall and Westons estate in Essex. On 22 May 1611, Bacon was created a baronet, of Redgrave in Suffolk, by James VI and I. This made him England's premier baronet. He married Anne Butts, granddaughter of Sir William Butts of Thornage, Norfolk, who had been a physician of Henry VIII. Because of this marriage he received many estates. In 1612, he was visited by the king. The king came to Culford in January 1619, to see his granddaughter Anne Gawdye, who was widely praised at this time, and admired by Prince Charles.John Nichols, Progresses of James the First, vol. 3 (London, 1828), pp. 525-6. Nicholas Bacon died in 1624. Shortly before Nicholas' death, it was uncovered that he had embezzled funds. In Bacon's will he left his household stuff among three younger sons and a daughter-in-law. He gave some of his wealth to his relatives, grandchildren and a great number of servants. Bacon left ¬£100 to the poor people living on his manors, and directed the creation of a trust towards the repair of the Hepworth and Wattisfield causeway. His two eldest sons, were charged with the repayment of his debts, including ¬£1,000 due to his old colleague in county administration, Sir Robert Jermyn.

He practised law at the Court of Appeals of Paris and the New York State Bar Association. He was the author of several books about World War II and his father-in-law, Vichy France Prime Minister Pierre Laval, to whom he served as legal counsel. He defended Coco Chanel in her lawsuit against Pierre Wertheimer over her marketing rights to Chanel No. 5. He was the chairman of Baccarat, the crystal manufacturer, from 1960 to 1992. Early life Ren√© de Chambrun was born on August 23, 1906 in Paris, France. His father, Aldebert de Chambrun, was a general in the French Army, and his mother was Clara Eleanor Longworth, sister of Nicholas Longworth, (who married Alice Roosevelt, daughter of the U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt). On his paternal side, he was a member of the aristocratic Pineton de Chambrun family. Moreover, Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza was one of his paternal uncles. Chambrun's godfather was Philippe P√©tain. Chambrun was a great-great-grandson of Lafayette. As a result, he was both a French and U.S. citizen. His U.S. citizenship was questioned by members of the United States House of Representatives in 1942 due to his support for his father-in-law. Chambrun graduated from Sciences Po. He received a PhD in Law from the University of Paris. Career Chambrun was a lawyer at the Court of Appeals of Paris and the New York State Bar Association. By 1935, he helped establish a Franco-American cultural center in New York City to promote bilateral relations. The center was aimed at students and businessmen. When the Second World War broke out, Chambrun served as a captain, but, with the collapse of France looming by mid-May 1940, the Prime Minister, Paul Reynaud, sent Chambrun as a special emissary to Washington to stiffen President Roosevelt's resolve to help the Allies. Between his first meeting with Roosevelt on 16 June and his last on 1 August, Reynaud's government had fallen. Later that year Chambrun published the book I Saw France Fall, which helped to alert American opinion about the fate of his country. After the Liberation of France and the consequent fall of Laval's collaborationist government, Chambrun was a defender of Laval: The Chambruns threw themselves into the task of assisting Laval in his defense before the High Court of Justice. After Laval's sentence and execution in October 1945, Chambrun was put on police watch in Paris on the suspicion that he may have helped the Nazis during the war; in 1942 Chevalier had been named on a list of French collaborators with Germany to be killed during the war, or tried after it. By 1947, Chambrun officially applied for a U.S. passport. Meanwhile, Chambrun and his wife devoted their energies over the following decades to the cause of his rehabilitation in the eyes of history. For example, he wrote a letter to President Dwight Eisenhower in which he objected to his characterisation of Laval as \\"Hitler's most evil puppet\\" in his 1948 memoir entitled Crusade in Europe. Chambrun based his argument on another book authored by Spanish Foreign Minister Ram√≥n Serrano Su√±er in which the latter quoted Hitler describing Laval as \\"no better than De Gaulle\\". By 1949, Eisenhower agreed to remove the passage from subsequent reprints. A decade later, in 1959, his wife wrote the foreword of Tout ce qu'on vous a cache, a book based on \\"German secret files\\" authored by Jacques Baraduc, Laval's lawyer. The book attempted to show that Laval \\"refused repeatedly to yield to German demands for a reduction in the number of United States agents in French North Africa and a limitation on their activity.\\" In 1969, Chambrun made an appearance in Marcel Oph√ºls's documentary on collaboration between the Vichy government and Nazi Germany during World War II, The Sorrow and the Pity (Le chagrin et la piti√©). Chambrun wrote three books on the subject between 1983 and 1990. The Chambruns set up a foundation, the Jos√©e and Ren√© de Chambrun Foundation, which collected documents on Laval for publication by the Hoover Institution. After Laval's death, the Chambruns brought flowers to his grave every October 15, to commemorate the day he was executed. After World War II, Chambrun was hired by Peter II of Yugoslavia when the latter filed for divorce in 1953; the couple reconciled two years later. He represented fashion designer Coco Chanel when she sued manufacturer Pierre Wertheimer to regain the marketing rights to her perfume, Chanel No. 5. Wertheimer settled the case, and Chanel became a millionaire as a result. In 1970 Chambrun defended Greek shipping magnate Stavros Niarchos over false allegations that he killed his ex-wife, Eugenia Livanos. Additionally, Chambrun was hired by Somerset Maugham's daughter to prove that she was indeed his daughter. Chambrun served as the chairman of Baccarat, the crystal manufacturer, from 1960 to 1992. Personal life and death 6 bis, Place du Palais-Bourbon. The Ch√¢teau de la Grange-Bl√©neau in 2008. Chambrun married Jos√©e Laval (1911‚Äì1992), the only daughter of Pierre Laval in 1935. Their wedding was held at the town hall of the 7th arrondissement of Paris, followed by the Sainte-Clotilde the next day. They resided 6 bis, Place du Palais-Bourbon in the 7th arrondissement. In 1956, he bought the Ch√¢teau de la Grange-Bl√©neau, a castle in the commune of Courpalay in the Seine-et-Marne d√©partement of France, from his cousin, Louis de Lasteyrie, a descendant of La Fayette, in 1935, with a life tenancy. Upon Louis de Lasteyrie's death in 1955, Chambrun discovered the large cache of documents in the attic of the castle, and he founded a private museum about Lafayette. News of his discovery brought many historians to his door, but Chambrun denied access, except to Andr√© Maurois whom he authorized to write a biography of Adrienne de Lafayette.Ren√© de Crambrun, Introduction, Adrienne: The Life of the Marquise de la Fayette, Andr√© Maurois; McGraw-Hill, 1961, p. x Chambrun produced a book using the documents he discovered covering the period of 1792‚Äì97 when Lafayette was in an Austrian prison. He organized and described the family archives, a collection dating from 1457 to 1990. The papers were microfilmed at La Grange in 1995 and 1996, for the Library of Congress. It took two years and several microfilm teams from the Library of Congress to film the 50,000 pages. Lafayette's papers are now in the Cornell University Library. Meanwhile, Chambrun purchased a sword used in battle by Lafayette in 1976, outbidding the Smithsonian Institution.

Huaraches are also often paired with fried cactus leaves, or Nopales. This dish is most popular in its hometown of Mexico City and is also sold in cities with Mexican-American populations such as Los Angeles, Chicago, Minneapolis, New York, San Francisco, San Antonio, Dallas, and Houston, but have yet to become widely available across the entire United States. Still, huaraches and other Mexican dishes have increased their presence in the Midwest due to increasing numbers of Latinos in rural America. The name \\"Huarache\\" is derived from the shape of the masa, similar to the popular sandals of the same name. The word Huarache is originally from Pur√©pecha and the Nahuatl word for huarache is kwarachi. Huaraches are similar to sopes and tlacoyos but differ in shape. Origin Huaraches originated in Mexico City in about the early 1930s. Their origin was at a stall along La Viga navigation channel, where Mrs. Carmen Gomez Medina prepared tlacoyos.Robb Walsh \\"Historic Huaraches in Stafford\\"Houston Press. July 01, 2008. When the navigation channel was covered to make the \\"Calzada de la Viga\\", Mrs. Gomez moved to another place and after 1957, when the Mercado de Jamaica was founded, she moved there, and then to a little place at Torno street.

The situation was summarized by a grim Solidarity poster that appeared on Polish streets in early summer 1981. It showed a black skull with a crossed knife and fork under it.

It was announced, that starting in August 1981, some 16 million citizens would be able to purchase up to of meats monthly, instead of before (provided that there was any meat on the market). This announcement raised angry comments, Solidarity demanded control of food production, and there were rumors that the government was keeping meat away from the public. People were spending days, if not weeks, in lines to buy necessary products. In many cases, special Queue Social Committees were formed, which nominated the Head of the Queue ‚Äì a person who drew up a list of those waiting, and at appointed times, checked the names.

Some 2,000 people participated in it, and it was the first street protest in Poland since August 1980, as Solidarity had previously been trying to limit its actions to factories.

This is his recollection of the demonstration: \\"In those years, ≈Å√≥d≈∫ became famous in Poland with the so-called hunger march, frequently shown on public TV during the Martial law. The communist propaganda was trying to convince the Poles that food shortages were directly connected with strikes. However, back in mid-1981, when the situation in ≈Å√≥d≈∫ became tragic and there was no guarantee for one to purchase a piece of cheese or a fish, we realized that we could not control the workers any longer. Therefore, instead of another strike, we organized a street protest.

John Gray's origins were thought to be unknown but he appears to have originated from Newcastle. John Gray was born 29 August 1810 in Newcastle upon Tyne, Northumberland, England. From a portrait of John Gray and his wife Sarah. CareerInnovations= In 1838 he was working for the Liverpool and Manchester Railway where he was the first engineer to use the balanced slide valve on locomotives, and later applied a form of expansion gear. In 1840 he was appointed locomotive superintendent of the Hull and Selby Railway where he became the first locomotive engineer to use long-travel valve motion. =Locomotive superintendent= In 1845 he was appointed locomotive superintendent of the Croydon Dover and Brighton Joint Committee, which then operated the pooled locomotive fleets of the London and Croydon Railway, the South Eastern Railway and the London and Brighton Railway. On the dissolution of this committee and the formation of the London Brighton and South Coast Railway in 1846 Gray was appointed Locomotive Superintendent at Brighton works. However in 1847 he was dismissed from this post as a result of problems over the late delivery of locomotives from Timothy Hackworth.

Business Knights, a resident of Dulwich in south east London, started an engineering business in 1908. In 1911 he purchased the Astbury Engineering Works, Peckham, as a going concern. During the First World War he manufactured Stokes bombs for the British Army. He was also active in the Volunteer Force, the home defence organisation, holding the rank of captain. He was awarded the MBE in the 1918 Birthday Honours. In 1918 he was one of the founding directors of the British And South African Insurance Corporation. In the following year the new company merged with the British and Australasian Insurance Company to form the Greater Britain Insurance Corporation, with Newton Knights as chairman. He resigned in March 1921. Local politics He entered local politics, and was elected to Camberwell Borough Council as a member of the Conservative-backed Municipal Reform Party. He was mayor of Camberwell in 1913‚Äì1914. He was co-opted on 15 October 1918 onto the London County Council by the Municipal Reform party to represent the Dulwich division of the Borough of Camberwell. He held the office of Sheriff of the City of London in 1920 ‚Äì 1921. Member of Parliament He was elected as a Coalition Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) for Camberwell North at the 1918 general election. Illness and bankruptcy In April 1921 his family issued an appeal for information on his whereabouts when he failed to return from a visit to Folkestone a week earlier. He was eventually discovered a week later on a roadside between Dymchurch and Hythe, having suffered a nervous breakdown and unable to give any account of his movements. Admitted to a Kent nursing home, he resigned as sheriff a month later. In June 1921 he informed the North Camberwell Unionist Association that he would not be fit to stand as a parliamentary candidate at future elections. In July 1921 he was judged bankrupt and it emerged in court that ¬£10,000 excess profits duty had been charged against his business, and that he owed ¬£56,000 to creditors while having assets of only ¬£3,150. Newton Knights explained that much of the loss could be attributed to his unsuccessful speculation on the metal exchange. He had also not been able to pay for the hire of the state coach while serving as sheriff of the City. As an undischarged bankrupt, Newton Knights was ineligible to sit in the Commons, and resigned his seat on 9 January 1922 through appointment as Steward of the Chiltern Hundreds. Death He died at Morden College, Blackheath in October 1959 aged 87, and was cremated at Eltham Crematorium.

Other areas of the body are also affected by malformations, such as the face, skull, reproductive organs, anus and pelvis. The disorder is caused by mutations in the WNT3 gene. Presentation Tetra-amelia syndrome is characterized by the complete absence of all four limbs. The syndrome causes severe malformations of various parts of the body, including the face and head, heart, nervous system, skeleton, and genitalia. In many cases, the lungs are underdeveloped, which makes breathing difficult or impossible. Because children with tetra-amelia syndrome have such serious medical problems, most are stillborn or die shortly after birth. Cause  inheritance. =WNT3 gene= Researchers have found a mutation in the WNT3 gene in people with tetra-amelia syndrome from one large family. This gene is part of a family of WNT genes that play critical roles in development before birth. The WNT3 gene is located at human chromosome 17q21. The protein produced from the WNT3 gene is involved in the formation of the limbs and other body systems during embryonic development. Mutations in the WNT3 gene prevent cells from producing functional WNT3 protein, which disrupts normal limb formation and leads to the other serious birth defects associated with tetra-amelia syndrome. =Genetics within families= In some affected families, the cause of tetra-amelia syndrome has not been determined. Some researchers believe that unidentified mutations in WNT3 or other genes involved in limb development may be responsible for the disorder. In most of the families reported so far, tetra-amelia syndrome appears to have an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. This means the defective gene responsible for the disorder is located on an autosome (chromosome 17 is an autosome), and two copies of the defective gene (one inherited from each parent) are required in order to be born with the disorder. The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive disorder both carry one copy of the defective gene, but usually do not experience any signs or symptoms of the disorder. Epidemiology Tetra-amelia syndrome has been reported in only a few families worldwide. According to a 2011 study by Bermejo-Sanchez, amelia ‚Äì that is, the lacking of one or more limbs ‚Äì occurs in roughly 1 out of every 71,000 pregnancies.

It was the final one-shot until 1968. Chuck Jones' ending sequence from Now Hear This and Bartholomew Versus the Wheel was used in this cartoon and this was the final cartoon to have this ending sequence.

They won't let her go to Prince Don Jose Miguel's big fiesta, but her fairy godmother comes through with a gorgeous wardrobe and a beautiful \\"transporte\\" drawn by a team of mules (formerly cockroaches). At the fiesta, the prince is bored out of his mind while the girls, including Senorella's strapsiblings, dance to impress him and fail miserably. However, he immediately becomes smitten when he sees Se√±orella. She and Prince Don Jose tango the night away, and his father, Don Miguel, is happy. However at midnight Se√±orella vamooses, leaving her glass huarache (a Mexican sandal) behind. Prince Don Jose has every girl in the kingdom try on the glass huarache, hoping to find the mysterious princess he fell in love with. However, none of the girls' feet fit the tiny shoe. Before arriving at the house, the strapmother intentionally tosses a tied up Se√±orella outside in the mud with the pigs out of fear that she'll be revealed as the mysterious princess and win Don Jose's love. Both her daughters try the shoe, but their feet are too big. Prince Don Jose sees a small foot sticking out from the window and he goes to it. He places the huarache on the foot and it fits. Don Jose sees a pig help Se√±orella up from the mud and she is revealed to be his mysterious princess. After having her cleaned up, she and Don Jose are married. The man revealed that Se√±orella's story may have ended happily ever after, but his own story didn't. When his friend asks him what happened to the strapmother and her daughters, the man sadly reveals that he's married to her. This proves to be true as she picks him up and forcibly takes him home.

The brigade fought on the Western Front during World War I from December 1915 to November 1918, and in Normandy and north- west Europe in 1944‚Äì1945 during World War II. It was a square formation of four infantry battalions during World War I, but was reduced to a triangular formation of three battalions during World War II. HistoryWorld War I= Raised in December 1915 in France, the 8th Brigade formed part of the 3rd Canadian Division, and was formed from six Mounted Rifles regiments that were converted into infantry units, forming four infantry battalions. The brigade's first major action was fought around Mount Sorrel, where the brigade's commander, Brigadier General Victor Williams, was captured. After this, the brigade took part in most of the major actions fought by the Canadians on the Western Front for the next two-and-a-half years until the armistice in November 1918. =World War II= Formed once again as part of the 3rd Canadian Division, the 8th Brigade headquarters formed in September 1940, consisting of three infantry battalions supported by an anti-tank company. Training was conducted in Canada, and by July 1941, the brigade departed for the United Kingdom. After training in Britain, the 8th Brigade formed part of the assault forces on D-Day, at Juno Beach. The 8th went ashore in the area Courseulles-sur-Mer, Berni√®res-sur-Mer and St Aubin-sur-Mer, its task was to clear the beach and establish a beachhead perimeter before moving inland. Clearance of Courseilles was quickly done, thanks to detailed planning.

It is where Liu Bei met Zhuge Liang and the story of the Longzhong Plan occurred. Liu Bei made three trips before he was able to see Zhuge Liang. Zhuge Liang showed Liu Bei the Longzhong Plan, a long-term strategy that outlined how Liu Bei could compete with Cao Cao.

Biography Bradley was born in Sharptown, Maryland on May 5, 1852, the oldest child of Thomas Dryden Badley and Margaret Matilda Morris. After the Civil War, his family moved to Wilmington, Delaware and then to Camden, New Jersey. In Camden he worked as a receiver at the Storey Cotton Company. In 1873 he joined the American Dredging Company of Philadelphia as a patternmaker, and rose through the ranks to become Chief Engineer and later General Superintendent of the Camden yards. In 1895 he designed the hydraulic dredge Delaware, and supervised its construction‚Äîon time and below budget‚Äîin a collaborative effort with the Bucyrus Steam Shovel & Dredge Company. Bradley became president of American Dredging in April 1908 on the death of his predecessor, L. Y. Schermerhorn. Bradley's political career began in 1892, when he was elected to the Camden City Council. He was also elected to the General Assembly and was re-elected four times. He was named Speaker of the Assembly for the 1901 and 1902 sessions. In 1902 he was elected to the State Senate, serving three terms for Camden County. He was chosen as President of the Senate in 1905 and 1906. Bradley was one of the few politicians in state history to hold the leadership posts in both the Assembly and the Senate. In 1911, Bradley diverged from his Republican colleagues, supporting a number of legislative reforms favored by Governor Woodrow Wilson. In retaliation, Republican party leadership defeated his renomination to the Senate. Bradley died on October 13, 1916 following an emergency operation for uremic poisoning at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. His widow received the following condolences from President Wilson: \\"My dear Mrs Bradley, It is with genuine grief that I have heard of the death of your husband. I learned in my association with him at Trenton to respect his character and judgment very deeply, and I feel that in him we have lost a man of high principle and great public usefulness. I felt that I could not deny myself this expression of admiration and deep regret. Cordially and sincerely yours, Woodrow Wilson.\\" ReferencesExternal links * William J.

It stands as a liberal example of when UK courts may lift the veil of incorporation of a company. The decision was, however, doubted in Woolfson v Strathclyde Regional Council1978 SLT 159 and qualified in Adams v Cape Industries plc.[1990] Ch 433 Facts DHN imported groceries and provision and had a cash-and-carry grocery business. Its premises were owned by its subsidiary which was called Bronze. It had a warehouse in Malmesbury Road, in Bow, the East End of London. Bronze‚Äôs directors were DHN‚Äôs. Bronze had no business and the only asset were the premises, of which DHN was the licensee. Another wholly owned subsidiary, called DHN Food Transport Ltd, owned the vehicles. In 1970 Tower Hamlets London Borough Council compulsorily acquired the premises to build houses. As a result, DHN had to close down. Compensation was already paid to Bronze, one and a half times the land value. DHN could only get compensation too if it had more than a license interest. The Lands Tribunal held no further compensation was payable. Judgment The Court of Appeal held that DHN and Bronze were part of a single economic entity. Therefore, as if DHN had owned the land itself, it was entitled to compensation for the loss of business. Lord Denning MR's judgment went as follows. Goff LJ concurred and read his judgment. Shaw LJ concurred with both judgments, and concluded with the following.[1976] 1 WLR 852, 867-868 See also *UK company law *R&B; Customs Brokers Ltd v United Dominions Trust Ltd [1988] 1 WLR 321, Dillon LJ suggests that the corporate veil could be lifted to identify a business as a consumer.

The estate is built in the grounds of the former family seat of the Rushout family, the Barons Northwick. The Northwick Park mansion, now divided into residential accommodation, is a Grade 1 listed building. History In medieval times Northwick was a collection of smallholder's cottages surrounding a mansion owned by the Childe family. In 1683 it was bought by Sir James Rushout, Bt, the son of a rich Flemish merchant, who carried out extensive remodelling in 1686. The 4th Baronet continued the work, commissioning the architect Lord Burlington to design a Palladian east front and entrance hall in the 1730s. The 5th Baronet, later Baron Northwick, employed architect John Woolfe to carry out further improvements c.1828 and William Emes to landscape the parkland. It then passed down in the family to the 3rd Baron Northwick, whose widow in 1912 left the estate to her grandson, Captain George Spencer-Churchill, who moved into the mansion. Because the area was under the authority of the Bishops of Worcester, it was actually a small enclave of the county of Worcestershire surrounded by Gloucestershire - and is shown that way on all maps prior to 1931, when such enclaves were rationalised. The estate includes the site of the former hamlet of Northwick. During the Second World War, Northwick Park was an American field hospital. It became a camp for Polish displaced persons until the 1960s. Northwick Park collection The second Baron was an avid collector of works of art, antiques and coins. Much of his collection was housed at Thirlestaine House in Cheltenham and in 1848 he published a catalogue of his holdings there. Although he died intestate and therefore his collection was sold after his death, many items were repurchased by the 3rd Baron. This collection passed to the Spencer-Churchill family. After the death of Captain EG Spencer-Churchill, the collection was sold by Christie's in 1965. Items from this collection can be found in the National Gallery, London and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.Met web site The provenance of items from the collection can be investigated using published catalogues of the 1859 sale, the 1864 sale and the 1965 sale.Western Michigan University There is also an inventory of the collection produced in 1921 by Tancred Borenius.

The film was produced and directed by the veteran Venezuelan filmmaker Roman Chalbaud. It is a documentary drama, not only about the titular tragedy but also putting it in historical perspective. The film cost 3 billion bol√≠vares, provided by the Ministry of Culture. Story and narrative The film opens in August 2002, when the activist Simon Petrov is reading the declaration from the Inter-American Court of Human Rights that ordered the Venezuelan government to compensate the families of those murdered in the riot that changed the nation, el Caracazo of 27 February 1989. Everyone at the meeting then recalls the tragic event, the film built around stories told to camera by actors and the real people, and images of the violence. The film is largely told from the perspective of a broken family; Mara and her daughter Alejandra in the present, a pregnant Mara and her fiance Alejandro in the past, who is killed in El Caracazo. Told in two intersecting narratives ‚Äî the washed out memories and the brightly coloured facts ‚Äî the story also reflects on the political situation of the time, and the repercussions still affecting the country in the present. Not only do the characters seem insecure of their memories from both before and during el Caracazo, the film was released in 2005 and so the Venezuelan audience were acutely aware that the number of deaths was never fully counted and that their government never faced punishment or awarded the ordered compensation, leading reviews to call the film timely and necessary to keep the memory alive. Fr√©d√©rique Langue also mentioned in a 2006 article that the film contains hints at a \\"known national reality\\" and some \\"very specific references\\", including allusions to the rise of Hugo Ch√°vez in the intervening years. She then adds that it would be unlikely the film could be successful outside of Venezuela due to this. Production The film was shot as a documentary, and though, as in many documentaries, some of the interviews and scenes were \\"staged\\", these were still inspired by the peoples' real experiences and emotions. However, at least one source has referred to the film as \\"a fictional look back to [el Caracazo]\\". In the film, particularly for the recreation of scenes of rioting and massacre, there are 134 principal actors, and 5000 extras: the most performers ever in a Venezuelan film. It was shot on 35mm film, chosen for its visual properties by cinematographer Jos√© Mar√≠a Hermo. A riot scene from the film, with dozens of 'rioters' and a bus that they push over then set alight In an interview, Chalbaud said that the first scenes shot were done at the Teresa Carre√±o Cultural Complex, and the last scenes were outside the Central University of Venezuela, showing the repression of a student protest in Plaza Venezuela. Though production only saw one suspension of filming for rain, the importation of explosives from Los Angeles for the special effects needed caused difficulties, causing the original schedule to be discarded and shooting done when it was possible. The filming of many of these violent scenes required a heavy police and even military presence on location. The Venezuelan Ministry of Culture requested 24 copies of the film when it was released, and Chalbaud delivered these himself. The Ministry had contracted Chalbaud to make the running time of the film at least 90 minutes, funding what was the biggest budget in Venezuelan cinema. This was part of the Ch√°vez attempt called \\"Bolivarian Cinecitta\\", funding films that promoted Bolivarianism. It has been reported as the only film made about the historic event, though at least three others have been made, more contemporaneously.:40-41 Response Internally, the film saw a low admission rate, of 70,000 people, in keeping with the reduced viewership for Venezuelan films. However, Variety compared this to the 2006 Venezuelan film El Don, which drew over 400,000 people. It won the Glauber Rocha prize at the 2005 Havana \\"International Festival of New Latin American Cinema\\". It was shown at the 2006 San Sebasti√°n International Film Festival as part of the Latin American films not released in Spain official selection, at the 2006 Miami Latin Film Festival, and at the 2006 Trieste Film Festival. It has been suggested that the films relatively positive critical reception in Latin America was due to critics being supportive of the opposition who denounce the event and its political fallout, it has also sometimes been stigmatised as a \\"film for activists\\" only. The film is \\"Ch√°vez's favorite\\". Luisela Alvaray connects this and other parts of the film's release and production to place it within what is described as \\"part of a wider trend in state-funded cinema and academia that revisits history from a chavista perspective\\":fn 77 in order to reinvent history for political gain in the present. Chalbaud was criticized for the film, with the media in Venezuela ‚Äî largely anti-Chav√©z ‚Äî \\"losing respect\\" for him after its release because of their perception that he had become \\"a director serving the government\\" rather than an artist. One critic, Pablo Abraham, has called the film a \\"poorly-conceived manifesto\\" while conceding that it was \\"unworthy\\" of being directed by Chalbaud, though Abraham does write that the film is \\"unpalatable\\" because of Chalbaud: with him at the helm it is \\"full of an irritating militarist ideology\\".

Bowmansville is in the northwest corner of the town and is centered on the Genesee Street Bridge (NY Route 33) over a cataract in Ellicott Creek. Downstream from Bowmansville, in the town of Cheektowaga, bordered by Ellicott Creek, is the Pfohl Brothers Landfill, a Superfund site.  History  The first settlers of the town of Lancaster, as near as can be ascertained, were James and Asa Woodward, in 1803, in Bowmansville. In 1808 a road was cut from Buffalo through Lancaster village eastward, and in the same year Daniel Robinson built the first sawmill in town at Bowmansville. In about 1810 Benjamin Bowman purchased this mill and built another, and ever since then the place has been designated by his name. The gristmills were owned by the Bowman family for about fifty years; the gristmill passed to John Pentelow and is now abandoned. Bowmansville also had a train station for the West Shore Railroad just off Maple Drive north of the hamlet. Economy Significant businesses in the area include Audi Buffalo, founded in 1921, on Genesee Street, Salvatore's Italian Gardens Restaurant on Transit Road, the former Harris Hill Golf Center (closed in 2015), and the offices of Dr. Philip Penepent.

In ‚ÄúMortal Love‚Äù, Rivka Keren raises some basic, universal questions: to what extent do we shape our lives? What happens when we ignore our fundamental nature? Is there predestination? Plot and characters ‚ÄúMortal Love‚Äù traces the story of five central figures, the devastating impact of love on them and the ways in which their lives are intertwined. The plot is not linear, leaping back and forth in space and time between anticipation and memory, set in Jerusalem, Hungary and Greece. There are several perspectives and the characters are connected not by unbreakable cables but by translucent, easily frayed willowy threads. The chapters written in first and third person and connected by short \\"fragments\\" representing sessions of psychotherapy that illuminate the plot from different angles, in the style of \\"Rashomon\\". Beno (Benjamin) Gottzeit, a self-righteous and domineering Holocaust survivor, is obsessed with rectifying past injustices, those that he suffered as well as those that he caused. His compulsive need to set things right wreaks havoc on his relationships with two women, his lover Margit Cimbalom and his daughter Edna. Margit, a talented but disturbed artist, is tormented by Beno‚Äôs inability to match the intensity of her devotion to him. Edna, unable to extricate herself from the powerful influence of her father, perches on the brink of self-destruction as she tries to reconcile her own yearnings with the expectations of those around her. The unexpected details of their lives unfold through streams of memory and confession, revealing a history as intricate and fragile as an origami bird. The struggle between intent and reality, hope and disappointment, expands to include more characters. Zohar, Edna‚Äôs husband is a history teacher-turned- land surveyor, orphaned at a young age and desperately searching for the love and security that he did not get as a child. Ilias, a Greek Orthodox monk, was raised in Greece, like Edna in Hungary, by a father with rigid and unreasonable expectations: it is his arrival in Jerusalem that unexpectedly shapes the destiny of all the others and brings the novel to its conclusion.

Also known as the common paper wasp, this species can be identified by their long thin legs and banded yellow and black coloring. This species has been known to re-utilize old nests. While the species does not exhibit morphological class differences, there are distinct behavioral differences between queens and workers. In addition, the species is eusocial and benefits from relatedness between individuals. This species of wasp is known for delivering a painful sting, especially when their nest is disturbed, a behavior that has been developed as a nest defense mechanism. While wasps are often viewed negatively, they play an important pollination role for many plants. Taxonomy and phylogeny Polistes humilis is in the genus Polistes, which consists of 150 species that can be found in all regions except the world's coldest climates. Polistes humilis was the only species of the tribe Polistini found in New Zealand after it was accidentally introduced from Australia, prior to the introduction of the Asian paper wasp, Polistes chinensis in 1979. There are 11 different Polistes species found in Australia, and the Polistes humilis is the most prevalent one. Historically, Polistes variabilis has often been misidentified as a sub-species of Polistes humilis. But, recent photogenic analysis has indicated that these are two separate species. The species can be divided into two subspecies, P. humilis humilis which is found in northern Australia and P.humilis synoeus which can be found in the south. Description and identification This species of wasp can be identified by its slender body structure and banded coloring. Adults have yellow faces and are 10-15mm long with a tannish-red coloration. Males can be distinguished from females by a yellow marking on the abdomen area. In addition, Polistes humilis are generally bigger than most other paper wasps. Nests of this species can be identified by their cone shaped appearance with multiple hexagonal cells. The species builds its nest out of grey wood fiber material, which is a mixture of its own saliva and wood. Unlike most species of wasps, Polistes humilis colonies have been know to re-utilize old nests from year to year. Some colonies overwinter and shelter above the comb in colder months. Distribution and habitat Polistes humilis is mostly found in Australia, particularly in southern Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. While this species is native to Australia, the species was accidentally introduced to New Zealand in the 1880s and has established a stable population in that country, largely confined to the North Island north of Tauranga and west of Te Kuiti. Environmentally, the highest abundance of P. humilis can be found in shrublands. However, the species can also be found in flax swamps and forest sites. Colony cycle The colony cycle of Polistes humilis starts in the spring and can begin in three ways. Firstly, the colony cycle can begin with the founding of a new nest, typically by several foundresses. Secondly, the cycle can start with the re-utilization of an old nest, which can be several years old. Thirdly, the cycle can also begin with the continued use of an old nest as this species can overwinter. In situations where old nests are used, new eggs are typically laid around the old cells. Throughout the year, production of Polistes humilis nests typically follow a distinctive cycle. In the spring, nests are founded by females that have overwintered and have been previously inseminated. After founding, worker females are produced in the late spring and early summer. Males and queen females are produced in the late summer and early fall. BehaviorDominance hierarchy= In Polistes humilis nests, there is an observable hierarchy between reproducing queens and sterile workers. There are no outward physical differences between females; even small females have been known to produce eggs. Since there are no morphological differences between females, behavioral characteristics are the primary determinate of whether a female reproduces or not. These females can be determined by observation as they often receive solid food, honey, and water from worker females returning from foraging. Dominance is often displayed by a \\"tail wagging\\" behavior of the lower segment of the species. However, unlike most species that use behavioral characteristics to determine reproductive success, Polistes humilis does not exhibit high competition between females within the nest. This is likely due to the high degree of relatedness among nestmates. =Mating behavior= Polistes humilis queens are singly mated, meaning that the eggs of the queen are fertilized by a single male and only one fertilization event occurs per female. However, within each colony, there are an average of two queens. This multiple queen behavior likely developed as a defense mechanism for the nest. Since different males can fertilize each female in the nest, genetic diversity is increased within the nest, which can help defend against disease. In addition, a distinctive characteristic of this species is that there is no inbreeding within P. humilis colonies. This suggests that dispersal is primarily male based and that males do not reproduce in their native colony. Dispersal of males likely happens before mating. Kin selectionGenetic relatedness within colonies= Polistes humilis are a haplodiploid species, with females developing from a fertilized egg and males developing from an unfertilized egg. In this system, queens are singly mated with full sisters sharing the paternal genetic information and either one of the maternal alleles. Therefore, sisters that share the same mother are 75% related in accordance with the haplodiploidy hypothesis. However, this ratio is skewed, making siblings less related, by having multiple queens in a nest. While this might benefit disease defense, skewing the relatedness ratio could disrupt the fragile eusocial behavior within the nest as some females within the nest are more related than others. =Costs and benefits of sociality= In Polistes humilis there are distinct benefits to having larger nest sizes. As nest size increases, the number of reproducing females directly increases. On one hand, this decreases the genetic relatedness of individuals and could cause a breakdown of the dominance hierarchy of the nest as it increases the gene pool of the nest. This correlation likely evolved as a defense against disease transmission, as increased genetic variability has been shown to reduce disease transmission within nests and could prevent a nest from dying out. On the other hand, as nests get larger, there are increased numbers of individuals and therefore increased nest defense. For this reason, larger nests have better defense against predators and human intervention. =Worker queen conflict= Since queen females have few morphological differences from worker females, they must use behavioral means to prevent them from laying eggs. As each queen selfishly wants to have as many offspring as possible, it is likely that oophagy occurs in Polistes humilis. This practice limits the eggs that weaker females can produce and reduces the genetic variability of the nest. Dominance of females can also be established through behavioral displays. Dominant females display their dominance by horizontal vibrations of the gaster and by mounting and wrestling with other females. These behaviors help the queens maximize their offspring's ability to survive and increases the genetic relatedness within the nest. Interactions with other speciesDiet= Polistes humilis are observed to subsist on food brought back to the nest by worker wasps. Once food is brought back to the nest, workers distribute the food to the queen and larvae. The species consumes primary water, pulp, carbohydrate and protein prey. In southern Australia, Polistes humilis appears to specialize in consuming lepidopteran larvae for protein as well as small spiders. Polistes humilis has to compete with other species for food, particularly the newly introduced, invasive species Vespula germanica. While Polistes humilis is very common now, competition for food could reduce its population in the future. =Defense against intruders= As a stinging wasp, Polistes humilis has a very powerful defense mechanism. The venom in the sting of the species helps with prey capture and nest defense from predators. The venom comes from the two tubular glands and is secreted by powerful muscles that coat the reservoir and squeeze out the venom. The venom is known to be used in fights between species and is often used in limited amounts. The venom is largely made of serotonin, histamine, tyramine, and dopamine which are all considered major pain producing components of the venom. =Defense against disease= Polistes humilis also has developed two defenses against disease: genetic diversity and the production of cuticular antimicrobial compounds. There is a trade-off between these mechanisms, with larger colony sizes having more genetic diversity and smaller colonies having increased antimicrobials. This trade-off has likely developed by evolution as the cuticular compounds are metabolically expensive to produce so larger colonies may not be able to support this mechanism. In successful colonies, these mechanisms work together, as shown by the Pc80 locus. Genetic analysis shows that increased variation at this locus is positively correlated with antimicrobial strength. However, as the success of these mechanisms is very important for colony survival, these mechanisms are important limiting factors for maximum colony threshold size. Since antimicrobial compounds in Polistes humilis are found in the species' venom and only females produce the sting venom, larger colonies with more males might have lower effectiveness of this mechanism. Group size and microbial defense are important characteristics to consider when determining disease susceptibility. Human importanceNest location and stings= View of the nest with adult. Polistes humilis is probably most known to humans by its painful sting. These stings often result from agitation of nest sites. Polistes humilis nests are often found in \\"modified habitats\\" where there is a mix of human structures and vegetation. Since nests are typically found in walls, eaves of buildings, and fences, humans are particularly at risk of accidentally disturbing a nest site. However, while the sting is very painful, humans are not at risk of serious injury from the sting unless they are allergic. The best way to avoid a sting is to simply stay away from known nest sites if possible, as these wasps typically only sting as a defense mechanism. =Agriculture= Polistes humilis are important to the overall ecosystem as pollinators. Since this species is one of the most populous species in Australia, it is responsible for the survival of many native wildlife. Polistes humilis appear to be widespread pollinators, not only in abundance but also in the species of plants pollinated. While this behavior is good for native plants, it has important implications for non-native species. The success of an introduced invasive species largely depends on the availability of pollinator relationships. Since Polistes humilis are general pollinators, they have been observed to contribute to the success of invasive species, such as the milkweeds Asclepias curassavica and Gomphocarpus fruticosus.

Susan asks Lee if she can go clubbing with him for the night, and they go out together. While at the club, Susan receives a call from Jackson who tells her he's been offered a job away from Fairview, and he asks her to move with him. She and Lee talk about it at the club and Susan decides she's going to move. The next morning, however, she wakes up with Lee in bed next to her and assumes that they've slept together when she goes downstairs to see a Jazz CD in the player and two empty bottles of wine on the table. Susan asks Gaby for advice without telling her who it was, believing she purposely slept with Lee to sabotage her relationship with Jackson. When Bob comes over to ask if Lee stayed the night, Gaby puts two and two together. Later on, Susan directly asks Lee if they slept together, to find to her relief that they didn't. Lee advises Susan that she shouldn't move away with Jackson until she is in love with him and she is sure that is what she wants. Gaby becomes tired of struggling to provide for her family, and her hopes are raised when she runs into an old work friend of Carlos's, Bradley, who is after someone for a six-figure-salary job. Gaby speaks for Carlos telling him he'll take it, but Gaby discovers Carlos is already after a job at the community center to help the blind. Gaby arranges a dinner with Bradley and his wife to convince Carlos otherwise. At dinner we learn of Bradley's wife's discontent for him. While Gaby is trying to push Carlos to take the job, Bradley's wife convinces Carlos to be a good person and take the job helping people at the Community Center.

History Commemorative tablet at Plattling station The first station building for Plattling station was erected near the town and the station was opened on 20 September 1860 as the Bavarian Eastern Railway Company's eastern route between Straubing and Passau went into service. From 1866 to 1877 the goods line operated by the Deggendorf-Plattling Railway company ended at goods yard at the western end of the station. When the Bavarian Forest railway was built via Zwiesel to Bayerisch Eisenstein in 1874 the passenger station was moved westwards to accommodate the junction with this route and was built at the same height as the goods station in its present-day location. On 15 October 1875, Plattling was given another junction, this time to the south via Pilsting to M√ºhldorf (the M√ºhldorf‚ÄìPilsting railway), which was expanded in 1880 by a branch to Landshut. On 16 April 1945 the entire station was destroyed in a bombing raid that lasted just seven minutes.PNP 16 April 1945: The day the bombers came The station building which was fully demolished during this attack was rebuilt again after the Second World War on the same spot. With the electrification of the main line from Regensburg to Passau in May 1959 and the general changeover of motive power in the DB, the Bahnbetriebswerk at Plattling soon lost its function in maintaining steam locomotives. The last train hauled by a steam locomotive ran on 6 March 1974 from Plattling into the Bavarian Forest. The roundhouse and turntable were dismantled. As a memorial of the steam era, railway fans have put a DRG Class 64 steam engine on display in the station yard.

The National Park Service manages the wilderness. The wilderness is named for California's Congressman Phillip Burton who served in the US House of Representatives from 1964 until his death on April 10, 1983. The US Congress passed legislation (Public Law 94-544) in 1976 that created the Point Reyes Wilderness, and in 1985, Congress, in recognition of Burton's dedication to wilderness preservation, especially his work on the California Wilderness Act of 1984, renamed the wilderness after him (P.L. 99-68). > \\"...his leadership in establishing units of the National Park System and > preserving their integrity against threats to those resources ... his > tireless efforts that led to the enactment of the California Wilderness Act > ... shall henceforth be known as the \\"Phillip Burton Wilderness.\\"Text of > law. Wilderness areas There are three separate units: The Southeastern area protects the Inverness Ridge down to a long coastline and is the largest unit. Within this area are forests of Douglas fir and California buckeye, coastal foothills, terraces, caves, beaches, several small inland lakes and the high point of Mount Wittenberg. The four trailcamps are in this section, with Wildcat and Coast camps located near shore, and Sky and Glen camps inland. Each camp has a different number of individual sites, with 52 sites total and four group sites. The Central section, which is separated from the southeastern unit by Limantour Road, protects the crest of the Inverness Ridge, the east shore of Estero de Limantour and the Limantour Spit. An endemic (restricted to one area) and rare coastal pine known as the Bishop pine grows here. The North segment includes the Tomales Point area, which is an open grassland peninsula that separates the Pacific Ocean to the west from the Tomales Bay, a submerged valley, on the east. A reserve for the reintroduced tule elk is in this section. Although there are no trailcamps, boat-in camping is allowed on Tomales Bay. Nearly half of the Point Reyes National Seashore is within the Phillip Burton Wilderness and has one of the most diverse landscapes of the California coast. The United Nations' Biosphere Program, which began in the 1970s to preserve the world's major biotic regions, included the Point Reyes area in 1988 when it designated the Central California Coast Biosphere Reserve (now the Golden Gate Biosphere Reserve) in recognition of the vast array of plants, animals and ecosystems. This is the first U.S. biosphere reserve firmly integrated within a large metropolitan area that is home to over 8 million people. Report on the UN Madrid meeting. There are at least 42 rare and endangered plants of the more than 850 plant species identified. Almost 40 species of land mammals plus a dozen marine mammals such as the harbor seal live or migrate through this area. Bird species counts are well over 400. Wilderness regulations Light green areas are wilderness. =Backpacking= A permit is required for backpacking trips to any of the four trailcamps, and this is limited to one night. Permits must be reserved in advance and picked up at the Bear Valley Visitor Center and fees are charged. Campsites can be reserved three months in advance. All four trailcamps allow bicycle access but no dogs. =Day hikes= The of trails offer the full spectrum of landscapes from the Douglas fir forests on the Inverness Ridge to the sandy beaches, rocky headlands and salt marshes near the ocean and estuaries. Cross-country travel is allowed but caution is advised as there are poison oak, stinging nettles, unstable cliffs and fragile meadows. Several miles of trail are open to bicycles and horseback riders, and at least one trail allows leashed pets. The legislation that created the wilderness contains special provisions, one of which allows mechanized vehicles on four trails or closed roads within the wilderness boundaries. =Boat camping= Boat-in overnight camping is allowed with permit on the westside beaches of Tomales Bay. A required beachfire permit is available at no charge. There are 10 boat-in campsites along the wilderness portion of Tomales Bay (see map). The Bear Valley Visitor Center has copies of the recommended brochure \\"Backpack Camping Information\\". Bishop pine 220px Although the bishop pine (Pinus muricata) varies in growth habit it is always found within 12 miles of the Pacific Ocean. The tree can be a wind-twisted shrub to a straight-boled \\"timber tree\\" high. It has vexed scientists for decades for several reasons, including the apparent inability to breed between the northern and southern varieties of bishop pine. No such cross barrier has ever been seen elsewhere in the pine species.Lanner, Ronald Conifers of California pp 89-90 The bishop pines of the Phillip Burton Wilderness are considered an \\"intermediate\\" between the northern variety (Pinus muricata v. borealis) and the southern (Pinus muricata v. muricata). Native rare plants The Point Reyes area has more than 50 species of rare, threatened or endangered plants. Perennial wildflowers include the yellow larkspur (Delphinium luteum), federally listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act in 2000, and state listed as rare since 1979. It has yellow flowers that bloom from March through May, grows in plant communities of coastal scrub, and is extremely poisonous (major toxicity class 1 ). Rare grasses include the endemic Sonoma shortawn foxtail (Alopecurus aequalis var. sonomensis) in the family Poaceae, federally listed as endangered since 1997. The California Native Plant Society lists this subspecies population as seriously endangered, and that more taxonomic information is needed. In addition to the bishop pine, there is the Monterey cypress (Callitropsis macrocarpa), a closed-cone conifer. Tule elk The Tule Elk Reserve comprises 2,600 acresNPS tule elk information page and was started in 1978 by the National Park Service (NPS). By 2000 the elk herd had increased in size to the point that it had outgrown the restricted area. NPS relocated about 50 animals to the Phillip Burton Wilderness section near Drake's Bay. Tule elk at Point Reyes National Seashore A full-grown elk can weigh 500 pounds or more and run at the speed of a racehorse.KQED The elk were California's version of the bison and roamed freely in massive herds, up to half a million, until the mid-19th century when they were wiped out by hunting and believed extinct. In 1874, a small group was discovered in a marsh thicket on the cattle ranch of Henry Miller near Bakersfield, California. Miller set aside some of his property for this herd, which survived, and 100 years later, the tule elk received federal protection under the Tule Elk Preservation Act (P.L. 94-38) that was passed on August 14, 1976.Fish and Wildlife Service law digest.

It was neither honorable nor dishonorable. The blue ticket became the discharge of choice for commanders seeking to remove homosexual service members from the ranks. They were also issued disproportionately to African Americans. Service members holding a blue discharge were subjected to discrimination in civilian life. They were denied the benefits of the G.I. Bill by the Veterans Administration and had difficulty finding work because employers were aware of the negative connotations of a blue discharge. Following intense criticism in the press‚Äîespecially the black press, because of the high percentage of African Americans who received blue discharges‚Äîand in Congress, the blue discharge was discontinued in 1947, replaced by two new classifications: general and undesirable. History The blue discharge was created in 1916 to replace two previous discharge classifications, the administrative discharge without honor and the \\"unclassified\\" discharge.. The discharges were printed on blue paper, hence the name. They were also sometimes called \\"blue tickets\\".. One early use of the blue discharge was for service members who had enlisted to fight in World War I while underage, but this practice was abolished by law and all such discharges were upgraded to honorable. Association with homosexuality The United States military had a long- standing policy that service members found to be homosexual or to have engaged in homosexual conduct were to be court-martialed for sodomy, imprisoned, and dishonorably discharged. However, with the mobilization of troops following the United States' entry into World War II, it became impractical to convene court-martial boards of commissioned officers, and some commanders began issuing administrative discharges instead. Several waves of reform addressing the handling of homosexuals in the military resulted in a 1944 policy directive that called for homosexuals to be committed to military hospitals, examined by psychiatrists, and discharged under Regulation 615-360, section 8 as \\"unfit for service\\".. It is unknown exactly how many gay and lesbian service members were given blue discharges under this regulation, but in 1946 the Army estimated that it had issued between 49,000 and 68,000 blue discharges, with approximately 5,000 of them issued to homosexuals, while the Navy's estimates of blue-discharge homosexuals was around 4,000. The period of time covered by these estimates is unclear.. The psychiatrists responsible for creating and implementing screening procedures to exclude homosexuals from military service. initially supported giving gay service members blue discharges. However, when they learned of the difficulties that blue-ticket holders faced in civilian life, they urged the military to discontinue the practice. William C. Menninger, who served as the Director of the Psychiatry Consultants Division for the Surgeon General of the United States Army from 1944 to 1946, tried to persuade the military to issue honorable discharges to gay service members who had not committed any crimes during their military service.. One press account said the purpose of administrative blue discharges, \\"discharges which are not dishonorable but are based on habits or traits of the individual that make his continuation in service undesirable\\", was the need to return soldiers to civilian life as quickly as possible: \\"to get the non-disabled soldier back into the nation's economic life with as little delay and red tape as possible, and to help him solve his own personal problems such as unemployment, educational opportunities, or finances.\\" Discrimination The Veterans Administration (VA), charged with implementing the provisions of the G.I. Bill, denied benefits to blue-discharge veterans,. despite the Bill's explicit language that made only a dishonorable discharge grounds for denying benefits to a veteran.. In 1945, the VA issued a directive that all blue-discharges for homosexuality would be denied benefits.. On December 22, 1955, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit denied an appeal from Raymond W. Longernecker, who had been denied his G.I. Bill benefits by the VA because of his blue discharge. The Court found that the VA had discretion in awarding benefits and that Congress had specifically foreclosed the courts from overruling it. Nevertheless, the Court noted that the denial of benefits should only have occurred if Longernecker had been dishonorably discharged and that the VA Administrator was acting without authority in treating a blue discharge as if it were dishonorable. Senator Bennett Champ Clark, a sponsor of the G.I. Bill, supported benefits for soldiers with blue discharges. Most employers required that job applicants who had served in the military present their discharge papers as part of the application process.. Blue-discharge veterans experienced difficulty in securing employment because many employers were aware that the blue discharge meant that the holder was considered undesirable. Those employers who did not know had access to a list of the Separation Program Numbers or \\"spin\\" numbers that the military used to classify discharges. At least four such spin numbers indicated a gay-related discharge.. Congress had expressed concern about possible misuse of the blue discharge when it began work on the G.I. Bill in 1944. In discussions about the legislation's details, the American Legion insisted on a specific provision to provide benefits to veterans discharged under any circumstance other than dishonorable.. The Legion believed a large number of veterans had been given blue and other less-than-honorable discharges for reasons that it considered unreasonable or trivial.. In testimony before the United States Senate, Rear Admiral Randall Jacobs strongly opposed this provision on the grounds that it would undermine morale and remove any incentive to maintain a good service record. Senator Bennett Champ Clark, a sponsor of the bill, dismissed his concerns, calling them \\"some of the most stupid, short-sighted objections which could be raised\\". Clark went on to say: > The Army is giving blue discharges, namely discharges without honor, to > those who have had no fault other than they have not shown sufficient > aptitude for military service. I say that when the government drafts a man > from civil life and puts him in the military service ... and, thereafter, > because the man does not show sufficient aptitude gives him a blue > discharge, or a discharge without honor, that fact should not be permitted > to prevent the man from receiving the benefits to which soldiers are > generally entitled. The G.I. Bill also provided for discharge review boards to review an appeal of any discharge other than dishonorable. From 1945 until early 1947, these boards routinely upgraded to honorable the blue discharges of homosexual service members who had not committed any known sex acts during their military service.. About one-third of all blue discharges reviewed were upgraded to honorable. Black press criticism Another minority group disproportionately issued blue discharges were African Americans. Of the 48,603 blue discharges issued by the Army between December 1, 1941, and June 30, 1945, 10,806 were issued to African Americans, or 22.23% of all blue discharges. At this time, African Americans constituted 6.5% of the Army.. In October 1945, Black- interest newspaper The Pittsburgh Courier launched a investigation against the discharge and its abuses, calling the discharge \\"a vicious instrument that should not be perpetrated against the American Soldier\\", and rebuked the Army for \\"allowing prejudiced officers to use it as a means of punishing Negro soldiers who do not like specifically unbearable conditions\\". The Courier specifically noted the discrimination faced by homosexual blue-tickets, calling them \\"'unfortunates' of the Nation...being preyed upon by the blue discharge\\" and demanded to know \\"why the Army chooses to penalize these 'unfortunates' who seem most in need of Army benefits and the opportunity to become better citizens under the educational benefits of the GI Bill of Rights\\".. The Courier printed instructions on how to appeal a blue discharge and warned readers against accepting a blue ticket out of the service because of the negative effect it would likely have on their lives.. In addition to the Courier, other groups and institutions that decried the punitive use of the blue discharge included the American Legion, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the Congress of Industrial Organizations, and the Veterans Benevolent Association. In the U.S. Senate, the chairman of the Senate Veterans Committee, Sen. Edwin C. Johnson (D-Colorado), read the Courier's editorial into the record. On October 29, 1945, noting that a blue discharge meant the veteran had not been convicted and yet had been separated from the military without being able to defend himself, he said: \\"There ought not to be a twilight zone between innocence and guilt. Blue discharges are certain to be a headache for Congress from now on.\\" House Report on blue discharges In response to reports about the disparate treatment of blue- ticket veterans, the House Committee on Military Affairs appointed a special committee to review the Veterans Administration's procedures. The committee, headed by Rep. Carl T. Durham (D-NC), issued its report officially called \\"Investigations of the National War Effort\\", commonly known as \\"Blue Discharges\\", on January 30, 1946.; The other members of the committee were: Robert L. F. Sikes (D-Florida), Arthur Winstead (D-Mississippi), Melvin Price (D-Illinois), Thomas E. Martin (R-Iowa), Ivor D. Fenton (R-Pennsylvania), J. Leroy Johnson (R-California). . The committee expressed its amazement that anyone with a blue discharge would risk further stigmatization by speaking out against the discrimination: In examining case histories of blue-discharge veterans, the committee found that \\"the procedure lends itself to dismissals based on prejudice and antagonism\\". Further, the committee found that the effects of a blue discharge \\"differ little from those of a dishonorable discharge...the discharged man finds it difficult to get or keep a job. The suspicion of society is aroused against him, all the worse in some ways for carrying an atmosphere of mystery.\\" The report said that \\"nothing could more clearly prove the anomalous and illogical and disingenuous nature of the blue discharge than this policy of the Veterans Administration\\". The committee called the system for dealing with blue-ticket veterans \\"a squeeze play between the war department and the veterans' administration\\" and took the agency to task for assuming \\"the right to separate the sheep from the goats\\" and \\"passing moral verdicts on the history of any soldier\\". To reform the discharge system the committee recommended: * Automatic review for all blue discharges * That the Army be required to demonstrate that it made multiple attempts to rehabilitate the service member before issuing a blue discharge * The right to counsel for service members being given a blue discharge, either provided by the military or private counsel * Copies of procedural regulations regarding the blue discharge process be provided upon request * That any discharge that did not specify the quality of service state plainly that it is not dishonorable The committee also recommended changing the discharge system to four classifications: honorable and dishonorable, with no change in their definitions; \\"under honorable conditions\\" to replace the blue discharge; and general, to cover separation for misconduct. Aftermath Despite the Committee's report, the VA continued to discriminate against homosexual blue- tickets, renewing its 1945 directive in 1946 and again in 1949. Blue discharges were discontinued as of July 1, 1947, and two new headings, general and undesirable, took their place. A general discharge was considered to be under honorable conditions‚Äîdistinct from an \\"honorable discharge\\"‚Äîand an undesirable discharge was under conditions other than honorable‚Äîdistinct from a \\"dishonorable discharge\\". At the same time, the Army changed its regulations to ensure that gay and lesbian service members would not qualify for general discharges.. Those found guilty of engaging in homosexual conduct still received dishonorable discharges, while those identified as homosexuals but not to have committed any homosexual acts now received undesirable discharges. via By the 1970s, a service member who had not committed any homosexual acts would tend to receive a general discharge, while those found to have engaged in homosexual sex tended to receive undesirable discharges.. Gay service members continued to receive a disproportionate percentage of the undesirable discharges issued.. This was the status quo until replaced in 1993 by the policy commonly known as \\"don't ask, don't tell\\". It has been suggested that the large gay populations in port cities like San Francisco, Chicago and New York City are in part the result of the blue discharge. The theory asserts that many gay blue-ticket veterans from smaller urban or rural areas who felt they were unable to return to their home communities because of the shame associated with their discharges relocated to larger areas with established gay subcultures or simply stayed in the city through which they were returned to the United States..

Plot Eli Scruggs (portrayed by Beau Bridges), the neighborhood handy man, is at Susan Mayer's house when he is approached by an angry Karen McCluskey. McCluskey is annoyed that Eli has sent out cards to everyone in the neighbourhood announcing his retirement. While fixing the shingle on Susan Mayer's house, he suffers a heart attack and suddenly dies. Once Bree, Gabrielle, Susan and Lynette meet up for poker and to discuss Eli's funeral, they start thinking through flashbacks how much he affected their lives. Gaby recalls how when she moved into the neighbourhood Carlos was working a lot and she found herself extremely bored. She recalls how Eli suggested she host the girl's weekly poker game in order to make friends. Gabrielle flaunts her wealth in front of the other women and makes a bad impression which Eli berates her for. Gabrielle realises how obnoxious she has been and apologizes to the other housewives, admitting that her life isn't all it cracked up to be. Back in the present day Bree suggests that she prepares food for the funeral. Whilst looking at Gabrielle's copy of her cookbook she recalls a brunch she held with her late husband Rex, a heavily pregnant Lynette and Tom. Complaining that she needs a new stove, Rex suggests that she gets a job. Taking him up on his suggestion Rex walks in on Bree preparing notes for a cookbook whilst Eli is fixing the sink. Rex teases Bree about her idea and her skills as a cook. Disheartened, Bree throws the papers away. After Rex's funeral Eli reveals to Bree that he kept the papers and that, when she feels up to it, someday she should go ahead and write her cookbook. In the present day news reaches Dave and Edie that Eli has died. Edie is extremely upset and recalls the time that when she was having marital problems with her ex-husband Umberto Roswell. Feeling insecure about her appearance Eli reassures Edie and makes her feel better. After Umberto reveals he is gay and leaves Edie, Eli is there and a man-hungry and drunk Edie cheers herself up by having sex with him. Back in the present day Lynette's daughter Penny shows up at Gabrielle's house, asking for her mother. Lynette recalls how when she was pregnant with Penny she planned on going back to work as soon as Penny is born. She finally realizes she is putting too much importance on getting her career back on track when she is distracted on the phone and leaves Penny in a hot car outside. Eli retrieves Penny and Lynette is moved to tears, disgusted with herself for putting work above caring for her daughter. Back at her house Susan opens a bottle of wine and looks at Eli's toolbox still on her kitchen table. She recalls how Eli changed the locks for her when Karl left her for Brandi and Mike left her after the car accident. Distraught at losing Mike, Eli comforts Susan by saying although he has little experience of love he is inspired by how Susan always manages to pick herself up again and move on after each failure with a man. Susan then recalls the day that Eli died, before he began working on her roof. Eli shows up with a spare set of keys he had cut for Jackson. Susan reveals that she has just broken up with Jackson but is remarkable calm about the situation. Eli then tells her that this is his last day as a handy man before he retires, so Susan's roof will be his last job. Susan rushes to the store to buy a bottle of wine so that she and Eli can toast to his retirement. When Susan returns, Eli has died. It is this wine that Susan is drinking and raises a glass in memory of Eli. At Eli's funeral Mary Alice herself recalls how she changed Eli's life. She remembers how one morning before he had any steady work, he approached her and introduced himself. Initially commenting that she doesn't have any work for him Mary Alice changes her mind when she notices Eli is wearing worn shoes and had obviously fallen on hard times. She asks him if he will fix a vase she broke for her. Eli appreciates her sympathy and initially declines but Mary Alice is insistent. A few years later now that Eli has found steady work thanks to Mary Alice recommending him to the women of the neighbourhood, Eli walks in on Mary Alice reading a note. Mary Alice tries to be upbeat despite the fact that something is obviously troubling her, and offers Eli the vase that he fixed for her a few years ago. Eli gratefully accepts and leaves, worried about Mary Alice's fragile state but thinking it best to leave her alone. It is then revealed that the note Mary Alice was reading is the one she was blackmailed with and that day is the one that she killed herself. An ambulance arrives and the neighbourhood shows up in force to find out what happened to Mary Alice complete with Martha Huber (the blackmailer) gossiping with other women about Mary Alice's suicide. Eli watches from afar and regrets having done nothing to stop Mary Alice's suicide. From that day forward he makes a vow to not only fix people's belongings but their lives as much as he can as well. At his funeral the women gather around Eli's coffin and Bree fixes Eli's flower arrangement before the coffin is lowered, remarking that after all the fixing Eli did for them, she wanted to fix something for him. Casting Mary Alice Young (Brenda Strong) is seen in this episode for the first and only time in the fifth season. This is her 7th appearance on the show since the first season, having appeared in three episodes during the second season, one during the third and two during the fourth season.

Bust of Sir Thomas Gascoigne, 8th Baronet, by Christopher Hewetson at the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. Sir Thomas Gascoigne, 8th Baronet (7 March 1745 ‚Äì 11 February 1810) was born on 7 March 1745 on the Continent into a devout Catholic gentry family based in Yorkshire. Despite receiving a solid Catholic education at institutions in northern France and Italy, Gascoigne would later renounce his religion to become a Foxite Whig Member of Parliament. Prior to his apostasy he travelled extensively as a Grand Tourist throughout much of Spain, France and Italy in the company of the noted travel writer Henry Swinburne, who would later record their journeys in two popular travel guides Travels through Spain in the Years 1775 and 1776 (1779) and Travels in the Two Sicilies, 1777‚Äì1780 (1783‚Äì5). Together they gained close access to the leading courts of Europe, particularly in Spain and Naples. An honorary member of the Board of Agriculture, Gascoigne was an important advocate of agricultural reform as well as a considerable coal owner who helped pioneer technological developments in the extractive industries. He is emblematic of how movements within the Enlightenment were having a major influence on the attitudes, activities and outlook of many leading English Catholic gentry families in the period.Alexander Lock, Catholicism, Identity and Politics in the Age of Enlightenment: The Life and Career of Sir Thomas Gascoigne, 1745-1810 (Woodbridge: Boydell and Brewer, 2016) Early life, education and Grand Tour Sir Thomas Gascoigne was born at the English Benedictine convent at Cambrai, the third son of Sir Edward Gascoigne, 6th Baronet of Parlington Hall, Yorkshire, and his wife, Mary (1711‚Äì1764), daughter and heiress of Sir Francis Hungate of Saxton, Yorkshire.Alexander Lock, Catholicism, Identity and Politics in the Age of Enlightenment: The Life and Career of Sir Thomas Gascoigne, 1745-1810 , Studies in Modern British Religious History (Woodbridge: Boydell and Brewer, 2016). The Gascoigne family were a staunch Catholic family and Sir Thomas was raised, and remained, a Catholic until his apostasy for a political preferment and a seat in Parliament in June 1780.Alexander Lock, ‚ÄòCatholicism, Apostasy and Politics in late-Eighteenth- Century England: The Case of Sir Thomas Gascoigne and Charles Howard, Earl of Surrey‚Äô, Recusant History, 30 (2010), 275‚Äì98 He succeeded his elder brother, Sir Edward Gascoigne, 7th Bart., who died of smallpox in Paris in January 1762.Alexander Lock, ‚ÄòGascoigne, Sir Thomas, eighth baronet (1745‚Äì1810)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, ed. by David Cannadine (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004), online edn. He was educated alongside postulants at the English Benedictine school at St Gregory's Priory, Douai, and in 1762, as a result of concerns about his indolence and lack of application, was transferred with a private tutor to study philosophy at the Coll√®ge des Quatre Nations, Paris. Briefly visiting England and his estates for the first time in late 1763, Gascoigne returned to the Continent in January 1764 to attend the Academy at Turin, with a new tutor Harry Fermor, which marked in essence the beginning of his first continental Grand Tour - a tour that was designed to introduce him to both elite British and Italian society. At Turin, Gascoigne made the acquaintance of the King of Sardinia Charles Emmanuel III, the British charge d'affaires Louis Dutens, the distinguished English Catholic natural philosopher John Turberville Needham, and the historian Edward Gibbon; becoming a member of Gibbon's Roman Club upon his return to England later that year.Alexander Lock, Catholicism, Identity and Politics in the Age of Enlightenment: The Life and Career of Sir Thomas Gascoigne, 1745-1810 (Woodbridge: Boydell and Brewer, 2016) Following his time at the Academy, Gascoigne embarked upon a broader tour of Italy in the company of two eccentric friends he had made at Turin, John Damer and his brother George Damer. Sadly, this first tour was to end in tragedy when in March 1765 Gascoigne was implicated, along with George Damer, in the murder of a coachman in Rome. In the aftermath the Governor of Rome, Cardinal Eneo Silvio Piccolomini, assisted Gascoigne and Damer's escape and even obtained a papal pardon for them from Pope Clement XIII on 6 September 1765.West Yorkshire Archive Service, Leeds, WYL115/Box 72 'Pardon Granted by Papal Curia', 6 Sep. 1765. Following the murder in Rome, Gascoigne was forced to return to England and did not return to the Continent again until 1774. On returning to England, Sir Thomas concentrated on the management of his estates and on county affairs, so far as his religion would allow. In December 1770 he was appointed grand master of the Freemasons of the York Grand Lodge, a position he held until 1772. In 1771 he employed the agriculturalist and gardener John Kennedy, and together the pair experimented with the cultivation of a wide range of plants, though most importantly with the pioneering use of cabbages and carrots as fodder crops for livestock. These experiments would subsequently receive international praise and encouragement most notably from Henry Home, Lord Kames. Gascoigne also spent much of the late 1760s and 1770s extending his estate's mineral assets, which included limestone quarries, coalmines and a small spa at Thorpe Arch, which as a result of Gascoigne's initiatives later became the popular spa resort of Boston Spa.Phyllis Hembry, The English Spa 1560-1815 (London, 1990), pp. 173-4 Gascoigne was also committed to horse racing and the breeding of race horses at his stud at Parlington, his horses twice winning the St Leger stakes in 1778, with Hollandoise, and in 1798 with Symmetry. Some of his racing cups can be seen at Lotherton Hall, near Leeds. After a hiatus of nine years, Gascoigne returned to the Continent where he was welcomed by court society. Between 1774 and 1779 Gascoigne travelled extensively throughout in Europe visiting areas, such as Spain and Italy south of Naples, that received relatively few foreign visitors. Beginning at Spa in the bishopric of Li√®ge where he sought a cure for rheumatism, he was in Bordeaux by April 1775 where he met and befriended the Catholic English travel writer Henry Swinburne who proposed they visit Iberia together. Gascoigne paid the bulk of the costs of the tour to Spain which was planned by Swinburne to form the basis for a published travel guide. The pair arrived in Spain, in October 1775, and toured extensively throughout the country, making long term friendships with the British ambassador to Spain, Thomas Robinson, 2nd Baron Grantham. The pair were also well received by the Spanish court, gaining the acquaintance of King Charles III who offered them considerable assistance in aiding their tour of the country. Swinburne would later publish a guide based on their tour, Travels through Spain in the Years 1775 and 1776 (1779), which established his reputation as a travel writer.Kathryn Moore Heleniak, 'An English Gentleman's Encounter with Islamic Architecture: Henry Swinburne's Travels Through Spain (1779)', British Journal for Eighteenth-Century Studies, vol. 28, no. 2 (2005), pp. 181-200 In December 1776 Gascoigne accompanied Swinburne and his family on a visit to southern Italy, based around Naples. Here Gascoigne settled with the Swinburnes and again the pair became intimately connected with the Neapolitan court and British expatriate community. It was thought that their close friendships with King Ferdinand IV and his wife Maria Carolina was strengthened by the fact of their shared Catholicism. Gascoigne accompanied Swinburne on several excursions, which formed the basis for Swinburne's Travels in the Two Sicilies, 1777‚Äì1780 (1783‚Äì5). In April 1778 Gascoigne travelled with the Swinburne family to Rome where, as well-connected Catholics, they mixed with the city's prominent cultural figures, meeting Pope Pius VI in May 1778, before returning to England in July of the following year. Politics Upon returning to England, Gascoigne renounced his Roman Catholic religion in order to circumvent the penal laws and take a seat in Parliament. Alongside his Catholic friend, Charles Howard, Earl of Surrey, Sir Thomas renounced ‚Äòthe errors of the Church of Rome before the Archbishop of Canterbury‚Äô on 4 June 1780.London Chronicle, 6 June 1780 Evidence would suggest that his apostasy was motivated solely by his legal need to be an Anglican as a Member of Parliament rather than from any religious conviction. The date he apostatised purposefully coincided with George III birthday and both Gascoigne and Surrey had earlier been promised parliamentary seats by the Duke of Portland and the Marquess of Rockingham, who had recently bought the seat at Thirsk for which Gascoigne was returned on 12 September 1780. Indeed, privately, Gascoigne seems to have remained Catholic in sympathy throughout his life, continuing to support the Catholic mission in Yorkshire, and only publicly adopted Anglicanism because of the legal need to be an Anglican as an MP.Alexander Lock, 'Catholicism, Apostasy and Politics in Late Eighteenth-Century England: The Case of Sir Thomas Gascoigne and Charles Howard, Earl of Surrey', Recusant History, vol. 30, no. 2 (2010), pp. 275-298. Triumphal Arch at Parlington Hall, designed by Thomas Leverton and erected 1783. Gascoigne was a strong supporter of the cause of American Independence and built a commemorative arch to the American victory in the War of Independence, at the entrance to his Parlington Hall estate.Article about the Parlington Triumphal Arch.Victoria and Albert Museum website: Search the Collections The main frieze read 'Liberty in N. America Triumphant MDCCLXXXIII' and whilst it categorically supported the American cause, the arch also subtly indicated Gascoigne's approval of Rockingham who had vocally opposed both Lord North, and the war, in Parliament.George Sheeran, 'Patriotic Views: Aristocratic Ideology and the Eighteenth-Century Landscape', Landscapes, vol. 7, no. 2 (2006), pp. 1-23. The Parlington arch still stands and in 1975, on the advice of Nikolaus Pevsner, the British Government made unsuccessful enquiries into the possibility of gifting it to the United States of America to mark the bicentenary of American Independence.The National Archives, London, Foreign and Commonwealth Office Records, FCO 13/774, 'Centrepiece for celebrations of bicentenary of USA', 1975. In parliament Gascoigne was a committed Foxite whig and loyal to the Wentworth‚ÄìWoodhouse connection headed first by Rockingham, and after 1782 by the second Earl Fitzwilliam. At the general election of 1784 Fitzwilliam nominated Gascoigne to be the election manager for the York County election supporting the Foxites Francis Ferrand Foljambe and William Weddell fight against the Pittite candidates William Wilberforce and Henry Duncombe. Despite his best efforts the county election fell into chaos and Gascoigne's committee declined the poll the night preceding the election.Alexander Lock, 'The Electoral Management of the Yorkshire Election of 1784', Northern History, vol. 47, no. 2 (2010), pp. 271-296. Since December 1782 Gascoigne had been a member of Christopher Wyvill's Yorkshire Association, which agitated for parliamentary reform. Despite eagerly supporting the cause of reform Sir Thomas was forced to resign from the Association during the election when Wyvill came out strongly in support of William Pitt against Fox, nationally, and Fitzwilliam's Wentworth‚ÄìWoodhouse connection locally in Yorkshire. During the election Gascoigne was offered the parliamentary seat at Malton, which he held until August 1784. Between February 1795 and May 1796 Gascoigne was elected MP for Arundel in the gift of his friend Charles Howard, now eleventh Duke of Norfolk (with whom he had earlier apostatised). Despite antagonisms during the Yorkshire election of 1784 Sir Thomas soon renewed his friendship with Christopher Wyvill and together they opposed the Treasonable Practices Act and Seditious Meetings Act (what became popularly known as 'the Two Acts'), with Gascoigne chairing a tumultuous meeting against both bills in York in December 1795. Gascoigne remained committed to Parliamentary reform and in 1797 worked closely with Wyvill in an attempt to revive the reform movement in Yorkshire; the attempt was unsuccessful as by the late 1790s both Wyvill and Gascoigne had lost what little political influence they once had. In 1788 Sir Thomas became a captain in the 1st West Riding militia, attaining the rank of lieutenant-colonel in 1794, a position from which he resigned in 1798 in support of his patron, the Duke of Norfolk, who had been dismissed from the lord lieutenancy (and de facto command of the militia) for expressing Jacobin sentiments at a political dinner. Three months later Gascoigne took command of a new militia - the Barkston Ash and Skyrack Volunteers. Later years and personal life On 4 November 1784, at All Saints' Church, Aston upon Trent, Derbyshire, Gascoigne married Lady Mary Turner, n√©e Shuttleworth (1751‚Äì1786), widow of Sir Charles Turner (c.1727‚Äì1783). Mary died from complications following childbirth on 1 February 1786, having given birth to a son, Thomas Charles Gascoigne, in the previous month. Gascoigne never remarried and continued to raise his only son and three children from Mary's first marriage on his Parlington estate.Alexander Lock, ‚ÄòGascoigne, Sir Thomas, eighth baronet (1745‚Äì1810)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (Oxford: Oxford University Press, May 2013). His marriage to Mary Turner was Sir Thomas' first and only marriage; the much repeated claim that he had married a Miss Montgomery in 1772 is incorrect. Although Barbara Montgomery (made famous as one of the graces in Joshua Reynolds's painting Three Ladies Adorning a Term of Hymen (1773)) was certainly romantically attached to Sir Thomas they were never married.Alexander Lock, Catholicism, Identity and Politics in the Age of Enlightenment: The Life and Career of Sir Thomas Gascoigne, 1745-1810 , Studies in Modern British Religious History (Woodbridge: Boydell and Brewer, 2016). Since inheriting the baronetcy in 1763 Sir Thomas had always taken an active personal interest in the management of the estate and adopted pioneering techniques in both agriculture and the extractive industries, especially in coal mining. His estate comprised property in many of the townships stretching between Tadcaster and Leeds in the West Riding and included not only extensive farmland, but limestone quarries at Huddlestone and coal mines at Parlington, Garforth, Barnbow, Sturton, and Seacroft. Gascoigne was responsive to new developments in the extractive industries and eager to adopt these new techniques to exploit his mineral assets to the full. As a result, he managed to double the vend from his coal mines from some 51,000 tons in 1762 to 115,950 tons in 1810. In late 1790 and again in 1801 Sir Thomas employed the Catholic coal viewer John Curr to advise on his mines. Curr was the colliery steward to Charles Howard, Duke of Norfolk, and was likely to have been recommended to Gascoigne by the Duke.Alexander Lock, ‚ÄòCurr, John (1756‚Äì1823)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, ed. by David Cannadine (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004), online edn. Curr recommended the introduction into the mines of iron tramways underground - some of the earliest introduced in Britain - and the installation of atmospheric steam engines for both draining the pits and winding the coal. The introduction of these measures by Curr, and in particular his iron tramways, significantly extended the working life of each pit and enabled the greater exploitation of coal at the Gascoigne collieries.Alexander Lock, Catholicism, Identity and Politics in the Age of Enlightenment: The Life and Career of Sir Thomas Gascoigne, 1745-1810 , Studies in Modern British Religious History (Woodbridge: Boydell and Brewer, 2016). Sir Thomas Gascoigne died at Parlington Hall, Parlington, near Aberford, on 11 February 1810 and was buried in the family vault in All Saints' Church, Barwick-in-Elmet. His only son had been killed in a hunting accident four months earlier in October 1809 and it was widely suggested that Sir Thomas's death was hastened by this loss. With no direct descendants the estate passed to Richard Oliver of Castle Oliver in County Limerick ‚Äî the husband of Mary Turner, Gascoigne's stepdaughter ‚Äî on condition that he change his name to Oliver Gascoigne.

It is an example of a well-preserved highway motel during the early age of motoring. It appears this is also an early example of a motel in Iowa and may be one of the earliest in the Midwest. The motel was built by Ted Port in 1940, and it included 24 units on two floors. Two of the units had a kitchenette, and there were living quarters for the motel clerk behind the lobby. The idea for the Spanish Colonial Revival design came from the Pan- American Courts in San Antonio, Texas, an establishment that Port had visited. Charles Chrestensen, a local contractor, drew up plans for the motel based on an illustration of the Texas motel. While it is not an exact copy, it follows the design quite closely. The Park Motel was built across U.S. Highway 30 from a cafe and a service station. While not the traditional one-stop facility owned by a single owner on the same property, the cafe and the motel were marketed together. Port built all three buildings, but he no longer owned the service station or the cafe when the motel was built. Port sold the property in 1945, but it has remained in operation as a motel. Two wings flank the original structure at an angle, and were built in 1965. The motel was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000, although the 1965 wings are not part of the historic designation. Notable guests include Denison- native Donna Reed, Elizabeth Dole, Ethel Kennedy, and Iowa governor Terry Branstad.
