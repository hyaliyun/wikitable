Following her Canadian naval career, Anticosti was sold to commercial interests. Design The ship was initially constructed for use as an offshore drill-rig supply vessel by International Offshore Services. As a supply vessel, Jean Tide was with a deadweight tonnage of 1,196 tons. She was long overall and between perpendiculars with a beam of and a draught of . The Anticosti class was powered by four NOHAB Polar SF 16RS diesel engines driving two shafts creating and one Gil Jet azimuth bow thruster. This created a maximum speed of and an endurance of at . The vessels were rated as ice class 3 and suitable for employment in light ice. The vessel was purchased in 1988 by Maritime Command (MARCOM) of the Canadian Forces and converted into a minesweeping auxiliary. Anticosti had astern refuelling gear fitted in 1995. In military use the vessels had a complement of 5 officers and 18 ratings. The two ships of the class were equipped two Racal Decca navigation radars operating on the I band. For minesweeping purposes, they were provided with mechanical minesweeping equipment and a high frequency, towed side scan variable depth sonar. Service history The ship was laid down as Lady Jean by Allied Shipbuilders Ltd. of Vancouver with the yard number 182 and launched on 17 April 1973. The vessel was renamed Jean Tide in 1974. After completion the vessel served as the oil rig logistics support vessel Jean Tide for International Offshore Service of Liberia. In 1975 she was sold to Tidewater Marine. The ship remained with this company until her sale in 1988. As part of the plan for the Naval Reserve to take over minesweeping and coastal operations, MARCOM began its effort to provide ships for training. MARCOM acquired two ships, one being Jean Tide in March 1988. The ship was sailed from Europe to Canada for conversion by Finco Mclaren Incorporated at Halifax, Nova Scotia and commissioning. Anticosti was commissioned on 7 May 1989 with hull number MSA 110. Her homeport was at Halifax. searches for Swissair Flight 111 debris with HMCS Anticosti (centre), (right), and a (rear). The vessel sailed to Marystown, Newfoundland for conversion in 1991. On 3 September 1991, Anticosti performed a goodwill tour of the St. Lawrence River and the Great Lakes. Anticosti was assigned to Maritime Forces Atlantic (MARLANT) as a minesweeping training vessel in preparation for the Maritime Coastal Defence Vessel Project (MCDV), which would become the Kingston class in the late 1990s. Anticosti was deployed by MARLANT in the annual MARCOT exercises as a minelayer. During the investigation into the Swissair Flight 111 crash in September 1998, Anticosti was among the Maritime Command vessels that responded to the crash site. She among the many ships scoured the sea looking for the aircraft's black box as part of Operation \\"Persistence\\". In March 1999, the ship sailed with Kingston- class vessels and to the Baltic Sea to participate in the NATO naval exercise \\"Blue Game\\". After the Kingston class entered service, Anticosti was identified as surplus and paid off on 21 March 2000. She was sold to commercial interests in January 2002. Anticosti left Halifax in tow of Escort Protector on 10 December 2001 for Clarenville, Newfoundland for the ship's new owners, Star Line Inc. and it was registered without change of name in 2002.

A member of the Western Massachusetts Regional Library System (WMRLS), the library participates in resources sharing and collaboration with all other libraries in the WRMLS. The library owns approximately 109,000 books according to the 2005 IMLS Public Library Report. In addition, they have 4,200 media items and send and receive over 35,000 interlibrary loan requests. In the fiscal year 2008, the city of Chicopee spent 1.1% of its budget ($1,401,141) on its public library, around $25 per person.July 1, 2007 through June 30, 2008; cf. The FY2008 Municipal Pie: What‚Äôs Your Share? Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Board of Library Commissioners. Boston: 2009. Available: Municipal Pie Reports . Retrieved 2010-08-04  History  In 1851, Massachusetts towns and cities were legally authorized to designate funds for libraries. On March 11, 1853, an article was issued \\"to see if the town will take measures to establish and maintain a public library for the use of the inhabitants of the town and appropriate money therefore, as petitioned for by John Wells and others\\". The town accepted the article, establishing the first free public library in the Western part of the state. In 1853, 900 books were donated to the city by the Cabot Institute, a literary and social club of at least 150 members, including D.K. Pearson, a local doctor who also donated money to Mount Holyoke College for the building of Pearson's dormitory, and John Chase, who planned and built the dams to power the mills in Chicopee. In 1863 library duties were performed by the town clerks, among them J.R. Childs, William L. Bemis and Lester Dickinson. In 1864 the Town of Chicopee voted to \\"put [the duties of the library] in the hands of a library committee and such remained the official designation of the officers until acceptance of the present charter\\". John Wells (1864‚Äì1875), Edwin O. Carter (1864-1800) and Simon G. Southworth were among the first committee of the library. From 1857 to 1864, George V. Wheelock was the elected librarian of the library. The first library catalogue was printed in 1859, with a supplement issued in 1866. In 1872 the library moved Cabot Hall to City Hall. A second catalogue was printed in 1875. In 1879 the library committee began sending books to a second branch of the library in Union Hall, Chicopee Falls, where Miss Gorton acted a librarian for the salary of twenty cents per week. In 1884 the library received US$500 to pay for the expansion of the Chicopee Falls branch into a room in Bray's building. The Women's Christian Temperance Union donated approximately 300 books to Chicopee Falls, and additional books were donated by Chicopee Falls residents including Bilad B. Belcher. The Chicopee Falls branch continued to grow until it occupied a room in the Wildes Hotel, a store at the corner of Market and Church Streets, and then the basement of the George S. Taylor School. In 1879 a reading room was opened in the evenings and used by the library. The reading book was a private subscription run by J.W. Cumnock, Rev. I. F. Porter, George A. Denison, A. F. Gaylord and William W. McClench. In May 1884, the townspeople of Chicopee voted to make the library free. Until that point, patrons had been charged an annual fee of fifty cents on the grounds that \\"theoretically people are more appreciative of privileges if it costs something\\". In 1888 the library outgrew its space in City Hall, and the library trustees issued a statement saying \\"we feel justified in calling upon our public spirited citizens to unite and erect a public library building from private funds\\". In 1890 Chicopee became a city and the rooms occupied by the library were needed for meetings of the city council. As a result, the building next to the library, which was the home of Jerome Wells, the first president of Chicopee Savings Bank (then Cabot Bank), was purchased and the library housed within. In 1899 an addition was made to the building which greatly enlarged the storage capacity. In 1898 a branch was opened in Willimansett. However, this branch was not as extensively used as the Chicopee Falls branch and the Trustees report of 1913 highlights the low usage. In 1906 the Trustees transferred 1,000 books to the Chicopee Falls branch and 500 to the Willimansett branch, and a card catalogue was completed in the same year. 1910 saw another branch established in Fairview. In 1907 Mrs. Spaulding, the wife of Justin Spaulding, founder of Spaulding, left US$20,000 in her will to the city for the construction of a new library. The plans for the new building in Market Square were drawn up by Kirkham & Parlet and the construction was completed by Denis Murphy and Patrick Rourke. The new library on the Market Square site was dedicated on May 13, 1913. The 1913 Trustees report stated that \\"the trustees hope in the near future to enlarge the usefulness of the library by keeping the main building open every day from nine o'clock in the forenoon to nine o'clock in the evening and a part of a Sunday afternoon\\". The library today Over time, the building built with the donations from Spaulding and others became too small as the population and the collection grew, and the once state-of-the-art facilities could not accommodate the technological needs of the new century. In response, planning began for a new public library building to meet the needs of the large community and the new century. On March 20, 2007, the Chicopee Public Library building in Market Square was closed and on May 22, 2004, during National Library Week, a new library building opened at 449 Front Street. The formal dedication was held on May 21, 2004; Mayor Richard R. Goyette and Lt. Gov. Kerry Healey addressed state legislators, trustees, friends of the library, supporters and regional library commissioners. Other speakers included John Krzeminski Jr, a representative of the Partyka family, who donated US$500,000 in the name of Emily Partyka to the \\"Raise the Roof\\" campaign for a new library. The new US$9.3 million Front Street location houses the collection, now totalling over 100,000 items, and the facility also provides room for the collection to grow. The library has two levels with a local history room, as well as a quiet study room, a computer lab for classes, and a community room that can seat over 150 people. It is handicap accessible and has increased parking space compared to the previous building. The library is open 9am-9pm Monday-Thursday, 9-5pm Friday, and is only closed weekends during the summer.Hours and Directions The trustees are the managers of the library according to the current charter. Library services include: interlibrary loan with the whole of Massachusetts; lending of museum passes, as well as DVDs, Playaways, VHS, CDs, books, magazines, and newspapers; virtual reference with Meebo from the Chicopee Library Staff; access to electronic databases; eBooks, eAudiobooks, and eVideos from C/W MARS; and computer skills and programming classes for adults, children, and young adults.

Most sources claim the house was built circa 1793 by the great-grandson of Richard Bourne, a missionary who was one of Mashpee's first colonial settlers. The National Register nomination for the property claims that the house was built about 1830, state legislation governing Mashpee's status as an Indian reservation preventing much construction prior to 1819. Its builder would have been John Phinney, one of a small number of white residents of Mashpee at the time. In 1863, the house was acquired by Timothy Pocknet, a Wampanoag. Pocknet is important in Wampanoag history of the period as one of the signatories of an 1833 petition for self-government, which resulted in the state granting the tribe a measure of autonomy. For many years the house belonged to Mabel Avant, a respected Wampanoag elder and tribal historian. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, concerned about rapid development on Cape Cod, the tribe began restoring the building, and opened it as a museum in 1973, with great pride and excitement. Its first director and driving force was Amelia Peters Bingham. However, the museum was soon shut down by the town of Mashpee amid conflict over Mashpee Tribe v. New Seabury Corp., in which the tribe attempted to regain thousands of acres land that had been illegally sold during the nineteenth century. The building was returned to the tribe in 1998. The Museum is open once again to the Mashpee community and its visitors.

The complex consists of a number of athletic facilities on a plot of land near the Nashua River. There are indoor and outdoor playing areas, an outdoor stadium, a field house, and a ticket booth and concession stand. The site is enclosed on three sides by a wrought iron fence resting on a concrete base, with periodic square concrete pillars. Most of the complex was built in 1918, with landscaping designed by the Olmsted Brothers. The facility was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001 as the Crocker Field Historic District. History Crocker Field was created as a gift to the city in 1916 by Alvah Crocker II, the president of Crocker, Burbank & Co., then a major paper manufacturer in Fitchburg. Crocker's stated purpose for the gift was to encourage the engagement of the city's youth in outdoor recreational athletic activities. At the time, the city's public schools did not have organized athletics programs, but these were soon started in order to capitalize on the gift. Crocker hired the noted Olmsted Brothers firm to design an athletic campus that would provide facilities for baseball, football, and tennis, as well as a running track and a field house. Its features were designed by Olmsted employee Percival Gallagher to be as durable as possible, using stone, brick, and concrete, so that maintenance costs would be low. Crocker also provided a $38,000 endowment to fund its maintenance. In 1921, Crocker funded additional features of the park, including a hockey field and a sprinting track. Since its construction, the field as served as the principal playing ground for high school athletic teams, hosting popular events such as rivalry football games with neighboring Leominster. It is also the normal location for high school graduation ceremonies, and often hosts regional athletic events.

With a construction history dating to the 1840s, it is one of the city's oldest surviving textile mills, now readapted to residential use. The complex, long used to produce cotton duck, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. Description and history The former Duck Mill complex is located southwest of downtown Fitchburg, at the junction of Duck Mill Road and Bemis Street. The complex consists of a series of mostly interconnected brick buildings, ranging in height from one to 3-1/2 stories. The main building is oriented at an angle to Duck Mill Road, and has a central projecting tower with a bell-shaped cupola that was added in 1887. This particular site, set not far from the Nashua River, has a documented history of industrial use as far back as 1832, when George Blackburn began producing cotton fabric. His first mill was destroyed by fire in 1843, and he rebuilt, opening the oldest portion of the complex the following year. The mill's success was enhanced by the arrival of the railroad nearby in 1845, and it was repeatedly enlarged. Of the city's many textile mills, it was the only one to produce heavy cotton duck fabric, which was used by the Union Army during the American Civil War. In later years of the 19th century it produced sailcloth. It was originally powered by water from the river that was delivered by a now- filled raceway, which was in the 20th century supplemented by electricity. Manufacture of textiles ceased in 1947, and the mill saw a variety of industrial tenants before its conversion to apartments.

It is five bays wide and three deep, with ground-floor windows set in round- arch openings capped by terra cotta keystones. The building corners are quoined, and the roof line is adorned with modillions and dentil moulding. The main entrance, located at the center of the Grove Street facade, has an elaborate surround, with engaged columns rising to an entablature and shallow balcony with iron railing. The building was constructed in 1912 to a design by Henry Francis, at the time one of Fitchburg's leading architects. The building is one of the city's finest examples of Georgian Revival architecture, and has been relatively little-altered during the society's ownership.

The district has one of the city's finest assemblages of high-quality architecture, including a number of civic, religious, and commercial buildings near the park. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. Description and history Fitchburg's Monument Park is located near the center of its downtown Main Street commercial area, flanked by Wallace Avenue (west), Elm Street (north), Hartwell Street (east), and Main Street (south). It is 2/3 acre in size, and is a basically flat and rectangular parcel, with grass and mature maple trees encircled by shrubs and a low iron fence. At its center is a statue of a winged figure depicting Victory, which was created by sculptor Martin Milmore and is dedicated to the city's American Civil War military. The park was established by the city in 1874. The west side of the park is flanked by two buildings. The southern building is a modern construction whose facade faces Main Street; when the district was created, a heavily altered Greek Revival church building stood here. The northern building is Fitchburg's state armory, designed by Wait and Cutter and completed in 1891, with an addition by noted Fitchburg architect H.M. Francis in 1914. It is a brick building with Gothic towers and parapets. At the northwest corner of the park stands the old post office, a large Classical Revival building completed in 1903 and enlarged in the 1930s. The north side of the square is faced by the High Victorian Gothic district courthouse, designed by Worcester architect Elbridge Boyden, and completed in 1871. To its right stands the district's only (formerly) residential property, a fashionable Queen Anne Victorian designed by H.M. Francis. The east side of the square is completely taken up by the Gothic Christ Church, designed by Richard Upjohn and built in 1868 with numerous later sympathetic additions. To its east, facing Main Street one block away from the square, is the former 1894 YMCA building, another H.M. Francis design. The original submission for the district included several buildings on the south side of Main Street, including the Modernist library designed by Carl Koch and several non-contributing commercial buildings; these elements were rejected by the National Park Service because they were out of character with the rest of the district.

It is a large and distinctive red brick building with sandstone trim, 2-1/2 stories in height, with asymmetrical massing and trim typical of the Late Victorian Gothic period. It is covered by a hip roof with a gabled peak, and has projecting gabled sections to the north and east, along with two chimney stacks with decorative corbelling. The interior of the ground floor is largely intact, with original woodwork carving and panels, as well as painted frescoes. Club history George Flagg Fay was a prominent businessman in Fitchburg, and was a charter member of the Park Club, founded in 1881 and housed in a building at the corner of Main Street and Wallace Street. He built the house at 658 Main in 1883-4; its position allowed him to walk across the street to the Club's facility. When he died, his daughter Lucy inherited the property, and continued to reside there until 1910, when she moved to another part of the country. She decided to donate the house to her father's club; the donation was gratefully received, and to mark its significance, the club voted to change its name to the Lucy Club. At the time located at the center of a thriving business community, the club served both as a meetingplace, dining facility, and a networking spot. Later, as families of members moved through its auspices, it became a center for weddings, showers, and reunions. However, as the city grew and transferred its vibrant core toward its suburbs, the Club membership dwindled. For the last 30 years of its existence the facility was closed during the summer months, re-opening in September. Then in June 2015, the Board determined that that year's closure would be permanent.

Built between 1885 and 1915, it was one of three mill complexes of the Parkill Company, one of the city's largest employers of the period. The mill complex was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2008. The complex has been restored and is used by a variety of public and private businesses, and as residential space. Description and history The Parkhill Mill complex is located west of downtown Fitchburg, on the south bank of the Nashua River east of Oak Hill Road and north of Cleghorn Street. The complex consists of four buildings, three of which are joined in a U shape open to the south; the fourth, the mill's former boiler house, is located just east of these three, oriented north-south and parallel to the eastern leg of the U. Other features of the complex include its original brick chimney stack, and a former railroad bridge spanning the Nashua River. The main mill buildings are four stories in height, and are built out of red brick. Windows are set in segmented-arch openings, and the roof is of low pitch, with a projecting eave adorned with exposed rafters. The oldest portion of the complex, part of the U's base, was built in 1885 by Andrew Cleghorn, a Scottish immigrant who operated it as a textile mill. He sold the mill to John Parkhill, his brother- in-law, in 1889. Parkhill was also a Scottish immigrant who had worked for many years in the mills of Adams, Massachusetts. Parkhill had begun his business in a former chair factory in 1879, and expanded into a second complex in Fitchburg in 1887 before buying this one. The Parkhill Manufacturing Company principally produced gingham fabrics, and at its peak employed more than 1,000 people.

The band was originally formed by Mark Frith and Johnny Molyneux in 2005, and they split in late 2009 but reformed in late 2011. Their debut single, \\"Gimme Love\\" was released in 2007, and reached Number 20 on the Radio 1 Indie Chart in November. Their second single, \\"(I'm Not) Superstitious\\" was released in June 2008 reaching Number 8 in the UK Indie Singles Chart. Their album The Troubadours was never released in the UK but was successful in Japan securing a top ten chart placing and single \\"Gimme Love\\" spent three months on top of the MTV Japan video chart. History The Troubadours originally started in 2005, when Mark Frith (songwriter/lead vocalist/guitarist) decided to get a band together to play his growing number of self-penned songs. He began work with Johnny Molyneux (lead guitar) immediately. Without a bassist or a drummer, he put adverts in local newspapers in and around the Liverpool area. with the name The Troubadours already born, the band soon recruited Tony Ferguson to play bass, and Nathan Watts to be their drummer after both expressed a strong interest in joining the band. After countless gigs, they built up a large fan base, amongst them was the record producer, John Leckie, known for his previous work with The Stone Roses, Pink Floyd and Radiohead. In 2007, Leckie offered to produce two of their songs, which the band accepted. They recorded \\"Gimme Love\\" and \\"Here Comes The Tide\\" under the production of John Leckie in May 2007 at the Dog House Studios in Henley-on-Thames. Their debut single, \\"Gimme Love\\" was released soon after recordings were finished. In the February 2008 edition of Q magazine, the Troubadours were included in the \\"10 Best New Acts of 2008\\". 2008 also saw the band support Paul Weller during his UK tour. Their second single, \\"(I'm Not) Superstitious\\" was released in June 2008. The summer of 2008 saw the band playing many festivals including V festival in Chelmsford/Stafford and Summer Sonic Festival in Tokyo. Late 2008 saw the departure of original lead guitarist, Johnny Molyneux. The permanent replacement was announced to be Robbie Taylor in January 2009. The recording and mixing of their debut album was completed in September 2008, and was released in Japan in the same month. The album was originally supposed to be released in early/mid-2009, but was pushed to an early 2010 release. In late 2009 the band went into a supposed hiatus after heavy touring schedules through 2008 and 2009. But it turned out that the band had actually split. Even though many sources close to the band already knew of the split, it was confirmed on 8 June by Frith, who posted a message to fans on the networking site, Facebook. The Troubadours announced in October 2011 that they would be reforming and went on to perform a sell-out show at the Liverpool Lomax on Friday 23 December. Sound and influences The Troubadours' distinct style comes from a blend of genres such as 1950s rockabilly, 1960s garage and blues. Their unique tunes have been noted by both Paul Weller and John Leckie as 'classic British songwriting'. The artists that have influenced their sound include Beefheart, Love, The Rolling Stones and The Seeds. The band members also cite The Byrds, Bob Dylan, The Stone Roses and The Who as other major influences. Their distinctive sound has been compared to many other, more recent bands from the north-west of England, including The La's, The Coral, Cast and The Zutons. Friths strange yet captivating vocal style has been compared to that of the frontman of The La's, Lee Mavers.

This, in turn, illustrates the transition of mankind from being symbols for the gods (the literal meaning of kii) into the keeper of these symbols in the form of idols and the like. The Kumulipo was recited during the time of Makahiki, to honor the god of fertility, Lono.Beckwith, Martha Warren. \\"Lono of the Makahiki.\\" The Kumulipo, a Hawaiian Creation Chant (Chicago: University of Chicago, 1951), 18. =Kahuna and Kapu= King Kamehameha II The kahuna were well respected, educated individuals that made up a social hierarchy class that served the King and the Courtiers and assisted the Maka'ainana (Common People). Selected to serve many practical and governmental purposes, Kahuna often were healers, navigators, builders, prophets/temple workers, and philosophers. They also talked with the spirits. Kahuna K≈´paiulu of Maui in 1867 described a counter-sorcery ritual to heal someone ill due to hoopiopio, another‚Äôs evil thoughts. He said a kapa (cloth) was shaken. Prayers were said. Then, \\"If the evil spirit suddenly appears (puoho) and possesses the patient, then he or she can be immediately saved by the conversation between the practitioner and that spirit.\\" Pukui and others believed kahuna did not have mystical transcendent experiences as described in other religions. Although a person who was possessed (noho) would go into a trance-like state, it was not an ecstatic experience but simply a communion with the known spirits. Kapu refers to a system of taboos designed to separate the spiritually pure from the potentially unclean. Thought to have arrived with PƒÅao, a priest or chief from Tahiti who arrived in Hawaii sometime around 1200 AD,Pukui, Nana i ke Kumu: Look to the Source, Vol. II, 1972, p. 296 the kapu imposed a series of restrictions on daily life. Prohibitions included: * The separation of men and women during mealtimes (a restriction known as aikapu) * Restrictions on the gathering and preparation of food * Women separated from the community during their menses * Restrictions on looking at, touching, or being in close proximity with chiefs and individuals of known spiritual power * Restrictions on overfishing Hawaiian tradition shows that Aikapu was an idea led by the kahuna in order for WƒÅkea, the sky father, to get alone with his daughter, Hoohokukalani without his wahine, or wife, Papa, the earth mother, noticing. The spiritually pure or laa, meaning \\"sacred\\" and unclean or haumia were to be separated. Aikapu included: * The use of a different ovens to cook the food of male and female * Different eating places * Women were forbidden to eat pig, coconut, banana, and certain red foods because of their male symbolism.LilikalƒÅ Kameeleihiwa, Native Land and Foreign Desires: Pehea LƒÅ E Pono Ai?

Bernice P. Bishop Museum Special Publication 2, Second Edition. (Honolulu: Bishop Museum Press, 1951) Other Kapus included MƒÅlama ƒÄina, meaning \\"caring of the land\\" and Niaupio. Tradition says that mƒÅlama ƒÅina originated from the first child of WƒÅkea and Hoohokukalani being deformed so they buried him in the ground and what sprouted became the first kalo, also known as taro. The Hawaiian islands are all children of Papa, WƒÅkea and Hoohokukalani so basically meaning that they are older siblings of the Hawaiian chiefs.LilikalƒÅ Kameeleihiwa, Native Land and Foreign Desires: Pehea LƒÅ E Pono Ai? (Honolulu: Bishop Museum Press, 1992.),24 Second child of WƒÅkea and Hoohokukalani became the first Alii Nui, or \\"Grand Chief\\". This came to be called Niaupio, the chiefly incest to create the \\"godly child\\".LilikalƒÅ Kameeleihiwa, Native Land and Foreign Desires: Pehea LƒÅ E Pono Ai? (Honolulu: Bishop Museum Press, 1992.),25 Punishments for breaking the kapu could include death, although if one could escape to a puuhonua, a city of refuge, one could be saved. KƒÅhuna nui mandated long periods when the entire village must have absolute silence. No baby could cry, dog howl, or rooster crow, on pain of death. Human sacrifice was not unknown. The kapu system remained in place until 1819 (see below). =Prayer and heiau= Puukohola Heiau, a Hawaiian temple used as a place of worship and sacrifice. Prayer was an essential part of Hawaiian life, employed when building a house, making a canoe, and giving lomilomi massage. Hawaiians addressed prayers to various gods depending on the situation. When healers picked herbs for medicine, they usually prayed to K≈´ and Hina, male and female, right and left, upright and supine. The people worshiped Lono during Makahiki season and K≈´ during times of war. Histories from the 19th century describe prayer throughout the day, with specific prayers associated with mundane activities such as sleeping, eating, drinking, and traveling. However, it has been suggested that the activity of prayer differed from the subservient styles of prayer often seen in the Western world: Heiau, served as focal points for prayer in Hawaii. Offerings, sacrifices, and prayers were offered at these temples, the thousands of koa (shrines), a multitude of wahi pana (sacred places), and at small kuahu (altars) in individual homes. History Figure of Lono =Origins= Although it is unclear when settlers first came to the Hawaiian Islands, there is significant evidence that the islands were settled no later than 800 AD and immigration continued to about 1300 AD. Settlers came from the Marquesas, Tonga, Samoa, Easter Island, and greater Polynesia. At some point, a significant influx of Tahitian settlers landed on the Hawaiian islands, bringing with them their religious beliefs. Early Hawaiian religion resembled other Polynesian religions in that it was largely focused on natural forces such as the tides, the sky, and volcanic activity as well as man's dependence on nature for subsistence. The major early gods reflected these characteristics, as the early Hawaiians worshiped KƒÅne (the god of the sky and creation), K≈´ (the god of war and male pursuits), Lono (the god of peace, rain, and fertility) and Kanaloa (the god of the ocean). =Early Hawaiian religion= As an indigenous culture, spread among eight islands, with waves of immigration over hundreds of years from various parts of the South Pacific, religious practices evolved over time and from place to place in different ways. Hawaiian scholar Mary Kawena Pukui, who was raised in Ka ª≈´, Hawaii, maintained that the early Hawaiian gods were benign. One Molokai tradition follows this line of thought. Author and researcher Pali Jae Lee writes: \\"During these ancient times, the only 'religion' was one of family and oneness with all things. The people were in tune with nature, plants, trees, animals, the ‚ÄòƒÅina, and each other. They respected all things and took care of all things. All was pono.\\" \\"In the dominant current of Western thought there is a fundamental separation between humanity and divinity. ... In many other cultures, however, such differences between human and divine do not exist. Some peoples have no concept of a ‚ÄòSupreme Being‚Äô or ‚ÄòCreator God‚Äô who is by nature ‚Äòother than‚Äô his creation. They do, however, claim to experience a spirit world in which beings more powerful than they are concerned for them and can be called upon for help.\\" \\"Along with ancestors and gods, spirits are part of the family of Hawaiians. \\"There are many kinds of spirits that help for good and many that aid in evil. Some lie and deceive, and some are truthful ... It is a wonderful thing how the spirits ( ªuhane) of the dead and the ‚Äòangels‚Äô (anela) of the  ªaumƒÅkua can possess living persons. Nothing is impossible to god-spirits, akua.\\" =Contemporary= Hula being performed during a ceremony at  ªIolani Palace where the Navy returned control of Kaho ªolawe to the State of Hawaii. Kamehameha the Great died in 1819. In the aftermath, two of his wives, Ka ªahumanu and Ke≈çp≈´olani, then the two most powerful people in the kingdom, conferred with the kahuna nui, Hewahewa. They convinced young Liholiho, Kamehameha II, to overthrow the kapu system. They ordered the people to burn the wooden statues and tear down the rock temples. Without the hierarchical system of religion in place, some abandoned the old gods, and others continued with cultural traditions of worshipping them, especially their family  ªaumƒÅkua. Missionaries arrived in 1820, and most of the alii converted to Christianity, including Kaahumanu and Ke≈çp≈´olani, but it took 11 years for Kaahumanu to proclaim laws against ancient religious practices: Offerings presented by Hawaiian religious practitioners at Ulupo Heiau, 2009 Although traditional Hawaiian religion was outlawed, a number of traditions typically associated with it survived by integration, practicing in hiding, or practicing in rural communities in the islands. Surviving traditions include the worship of family ancestral gods or aumƒÅkua, veneration of iwi or bones, and preservation of sacred places or wahi pana. Hula was outlawed at one time as a religious practice but today is performed in both spiritual and secular contexts. Traditional beliefs have also played a role in the politics of post-Contact Hawaii. In the 1970s the Hawaiian religion experienced a resurgence during the Hawaiian Renaissance. In 1976, the members of a group \\"Protect Kahoolawe Ohana\\" filed suit in federal court over the use of Kahoolawe by the United States Navy for target practice. Charging that the practice disturbed important cultural and religious sites Aluli et al. v. Brown forced the Navy to survey and protect important sites, perform conservation activities, and allow limited access to the island for religious purposes. Similarly, outrage over the unearthing of 1,000 graves dating back to 850 AD during the construction of a Ritz-Carlton hotel on Maui in 1988 resulted in the redesign and relocation of the hotel inland as well as the appointment of the site as a state historic place. Since 2014, an ongoing series of protests and demonstrations have been taking place on the Island of Hawaii in the United States regarding the choosing of Mauna Kea for the site location of the Thirty Meter Telescope. These protests have been known as the Thirty Meter Telescope Protests. Mauna Kea is considered by some Hawaiians to be the most sacred mountain of Native Hawaiian religion and culture. Native Hawaiian cultural practitioners have repeatedly failed in court to prove that these practices predate 1893, which is the threshold for protection under Hawaii State law. Protests began locally within the state of Hawaii on October 7, 2014 but went global within weeks of the April 2, 2015 arrest of 31 people who had blockaded the roadway to keep construction crews off the summit. On July 14, 2019, an online petition titled \\"The Immediate Halt to the Construction of the TMT telescope on Mauna Kea\\" was posted on Change.org. The petition has gathered over 100,000 signatures. Along with the surviving traditions, some Hawaiians practice Christianized versions of old traditions. Others practice it as a co-religion. In the 1930s, non-Hawaiian author Max Freedom Long created a philosophy and practice he called \\"Huna\\".Long, Max Freedom (2009) [1954]. The Secret Science Behind Miracles. Wildside Press. . While Long and his successors have misrepresented this invention as a type of ancient, Hawaiian occultism, it is actually a New Age product of cultural misappropriation and fantasy, and not representative of traditional Hawaiian religion.

The four story brick building was built in 1895 by Frank E. Wellington, who manufactured piano cases for upright and grand pianos. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. It underwent conversion to residences in 2002. Description and history The former Wellington Piano Case Company Building is located on the west side of Green Street, a short way north of the junction of Massachusetts Routes 12 and 13, north of downtown Leominster. The building consists of three large sections, all of brick construction. The original central block is a four-story structure, finished in pressed red brick with granite sills, and a corbelled cornice. Windows are set in segmented-arch openings, and a six-story square tower with crenellated top projects near its center. To the left (south) it is connected to what is now a five-story structure with similar styling, and to the right is an attached two-story section. The Wellington Piano Case Company was founded in 1895 by Frank E. Wellington, who had risen through the ranks of other piano case manufacturers in Leominster. The main block, built in 1895, was lauded into the 1930s as one of the city's finest and most modern factory facilities. The southern addition was made in 1906, and was originally six stories in height; the top floor was damaged in the New England Hurricane of 1938 and removed. The northern addition, originally used as a dry kiln, was made in 1919. Wellington's company was the last piano case maker to be established in the city. His company was later acquired by the Cable Piano Company.Antiquepianoshop.Com The building, after standing vacant for some years, was converted into condominium residences in 2002.

Built in 1848, this typical Greek Revival worker's cottage is notable as a stop on the Underground Railroad during the pre-Civil War years. Frances and Jonathan Drake are documented as having hosted Shadrach Minkins after he was successfully extracted from custody at a Boston court hearing. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008. Description and history The Drake House is located southwest of downtown Leominster, on the north side of Franklin Street, on a lot that extends between the street and Monoosnoc Brook, the principal source of water power for the city's 19th-century industries. It is a 1-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. The front facade is three bays wide on the ground floor, with the entrance in the left bay. It is set in a recess with sidelight windows; the outside of the recess is framed by post and lintel moulding. The front-facing gable has frieze bands along the raking edges, and corner returns. The interior of the house retains a number of original features, while others have been restored. The most unusual feature is a trapdoor in the front parlor, which provides access to the house's full basement. This trapdoor was apparently built at the same time as the floor, and is thus an original feature created by the house builder, Jonathan Drake. A Victorian porch, probably added in the late 19th century, has been removed during restoration of the property. The house, now owned by the city, underwent a major rehabilition in the 2010s, to return it to its appearance in the 1850s. The house was built about 1848 by Jonathan Drake, and is a fairly typical Greek Revival worker's cottage. Jonathan and his wife Frances were ardent abolitionists, and their house has been documented as a stop on the Underground Railroad. It was in particular associated with the flight of Shadrach Minkins, one of the first fugitive slaves taken after the passage of the 1850 Fugitive Slave Act. Minkins was spirited out of a Boston courtroom by abolitionist activists, and was hidden at the Drake house to avoid authorities known to be hunting him in Fitchburg. He was later spirited to Canada.

The five-building complex was developed between 1887 and 1910, and was home to one of the city's leading employers until the 1930s. Most of the complex converted into a residential complex known as Riverway Apartments in 1981. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Description and history The former Wachusett Shirt Company complex is located northeast of downtown Leominster's Monument Square, flanking Water Street just southwest of Monoosnuc Brook, which was historically the source of the mill's power. The complex consists of five buildings: four buildings on the west side of Water Street, three of which are adjacent, and one building on the east side. Four are of brick construction, and range in height from two to four stories. A wood-frame bridge passes over Water Street, connecting two of the buildings. The original main mill is the east side building: it is a T-shaped four-story structure, with an elaborately decorated Renaissance Revival projecting stem. The three- building structure across the street includes a wood-frame structure, and is more simply decorated. Adjacent to it stands the two-story office building, whose most prominent feature is its main entrance, which is recessed in a large round-headed arch. The shirt industry was a major employer in Leominster between about 1880 and 1930. Its genesis was with a company founded in 1880 by G.F. Morse, one of whose employees, George Gane, founded the Wachusett Shirt Company in 1882. He eventually took on as a partner F.A. Whitney, who had an established mill complex (northeast of this one) where carriages and chairs were made. The company worked in those premises until 1887, when the first of this complex's buildings was built. The success of the company and the concentration of experienced shirtmakers brought Cluett Peabody & Company, maker of the Arrow brand of shirts, to Leominster. The shirtmaking industry peaked in the city in 1902, with 3,000 workers, and had declined to 1,500 by 1915. Wachusett Shirt went out of business in the 1930s.

It dates, with a different name, from the mid-19th century and was absorbed by Westpoint Pepperell in the 1980s. The Arrow name is still licensed to brand men's shirts and ties. The company manufactured shirts and collars in a historic building at 123 First Street in Leominster, Massachusetts. The building was constructed in 1902 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. History The Arrow shirt company was founded by William H.Titus and his partner in Chicago Illinois and in the late 1800s merged with Cluett Peabody.

Titus remained on the board of directors until the time of his death even though his residence was in Glencoe, Illinois. In 1851, Maullin & Blanchard, manufacturers of collars, began operations at 282 River Street in Troy, NY. This company was succeeded in 1856 by Maullin & Bigelow, and in 1861 by Maullin, Bigelow, & Co., when Mr. George B. Cluett, a clerk in the company since 1854, became a partner. Upon the dissolution of the partnership in 1862, Joseph Maullin and George B. Cluett formed the firm Maullin & Cluett. On the death of Mr. Maullin in 1863, the firm Geo. B. Cluett, Bros., & Co. was formed. In 1891, Geo. B. Cluett, Bros., & Co merged with Coon & Co., also of Troy, NY, to form Cluett, Coon & Co., bringing Frederick F. Peabody into the firm. The Cluett, Coon & Co soon became the Cluett, Peabody & Co. in 1899. Prior to 1919, the principal business for Cluett, Peabody & Co. was manufacturing men's shirt collars. Beginning in the 1920s the demand for collar-attached shirts grew considerably, while the detached collar business experienced a decline. In 1929 Cluett, Peabody & Co. established a national menswear business under the Arrow brand name. The \\"Arrow\\" name gradually grew into a product line that included shirts, collars, handkerchiefs, cravats, pajamas, and underwear for men and boys. By 1935 Cluett Peabody operated eleven plants, mostly in the Northeast, including a plant at 123 First Street in Leominster, MA. In 1945 sales for Cluett Peabody were $31.3 million, and by 1955 sales had nearly tripled, to $87.4 million. At their heyday, the owned plants numbered 13 with an additional two in a wholly owned subsidiary and the weekly production approximated 67,700 dozen. In addition in the mid 70's the company arranged production from contractors of an additional wkly 31,000 dz. for a total 98,700 dozen. At this time additional shirt production lines were being contracted from Korea.Phillip holt, former production analyst 2020 Cluett, Peabody & Co. was acquired by WestPoint Pepperell, Inc in 1985. Bidermann Industries purchased Cluett, Peabody & Co. from WestPoint Pepperell in 1990. Cluett American Group (Vestar Capital Partners) bought the company in 1998. In 2004, Phillips-Van Heusen Corporation acquired the Arrow brand and the related licensing business from Cluett American Group for approximately $70 million.

This chapter is divided into 58 verses. =Textual witnesses= Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter are: *Codex Vaticanus (325‚Äì350) *Codex Sinaiticus (330‚Äì360) *Papyrus 123 (4th century; extant verses 3‚Äì6) *Codex Alexandrinus (400‚Äì440) *Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus (c. 450; extant verses 41‚Äì58). *Codex Freerianus (c. 450; extant verses 3, 15, 27‚Äì28, 38‚Äì39, 49‚Äì50) *Codex Claromontanus (c. 550) Verses 1‚Äì11: Kerygma of the death and resurrection of JesusVerses 1‚Äì2= :Now I would remind you, brothers and sisters, of the good news that I proclaimed to you, which you in turn received, in which also you stand, through which also you are being saved, if you hold firmly to the message that I proclaimed to you‚Äîunless you have come to believe in vain. NRSV =Verses 3‚Äì7= :For I handed on to you as of first importance what I in turn had received: ::that Christ died for our sins :::in accordance with the scriptures, ::and that he was buried, :: and that he was raised on the third day :::in accordance with the scriptures, ::and that he appeared to Cephas, ::then to the twelve. ::Then he appeared to more than five hundred brothers and sisters at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have died. ::Then he appeared to James, ::then to all the apostles. NRSV \\"According to the scriptures\\" Soon after his death, Jesus' followers believed he was raised from death by God and exalted to divine status as Lord (Kyrios) \\"at God's 'right hand',\\" which \\"associates him in astonishing ways with God.\\" According to Larry Hurtado, powerful religious experiences were an indispensable factor in the emergence of this Christ-devotion. Those experiences \\"seem to have included visions of (and/or ascents to) God's heaven, in which the glorified Christ was seen in an exalted position.\\" Those experiences were interpreted in the framework of God's redemptive purposes, as reflected in the scriptures, in a \\"dynamic interaction between devout, prayerful searching for, and pondering over, scriptural texts and continuing powerful religious experiences.\\" This initiated a \\"new devotional pattern unprecedented in Jewish monotheism,\\" that is, the worship of Jesus next to God, giving a central place to Jesus because his ministry, and its consequences, had a strong impact on his early followers. Revelations, including those visions, but also inspired and spontaneous utterances, and \\"charismatic exegesis\\" of the Jewish scriptures, convinced them that this devotion was commanded by God. \\"Died for our sins\\" In the Jerusalem ekklƒìsia, from which Paul received this creed, the phrase \\"died for our sins\\" probably was an apologetic rationale for the death of Jesus as being part of God's plan and purpose, as evidenced in the scriptures. The phrase \\"died for our sins\\" was derived from Isaiah, especially , and Maccabees 4, especially .James F. McGrath (2007), What‚Äôs Wrong With Penal Substitution? (NRSV): (NRSV): According to Geza Vermes, for Paul 1 Corinthians 15:3 may have referred to (NRSV), narrating the Binding of Isaac, in which Abraham is willing to sacrifice Isaac, his only son, obeying to the will of God. \\"Raised on the third day\\" \\"Raised on the third day\\" is derived from : Origins of the creed The account of the resurrection appearances of Jesus in verses 3‚Äì7 appears to be an early pre-Pauline creedal statement.Neufeld, The Earliest Christian Confessions (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1964) p. 47; Reginald Fuller, The Formation of the Resurrection Narratives (New York: Macmillan, 1971) p. 10 (); Wolfhart Pannenberg, Jesus ‚Äì God and Man translated Lewis Wilkins and Duane Pribe (Philadelphia: Westminster, 1968) p. 90 (); Oscar Cullmann, The Early Church: Studies in Early Christian History and Theology, ed.

Brown, The Virginal Conception and Bodily Resurrection of Jesus (New York: Paulist Press, 1973) pp. 81, 92 () Verses 3‚Äì5 (plus possible additional verses) may be one of the earliest creeds about Jesus' death and resurrection. Most biblical scholars note the antiquity of the creed, probably originating from the Jerusalem apostolic community.see Wolfhart Pannenberg, Jesus ‚Äì God and Man translated Lewis Wilkins and Duane Pribe (Philadelphia: Westminster, 1968) p. 90; Oscar Cullmann, The Early church: Studies in Early Christian History and Theology, ed. A. J. B. Higgins (Philadelphia: Westminster, 1966) p. 66; R. E.

M. Stewart (Edinburgh: Saint Andrew, 1977) p. 2; Hans Grass, Ostergeschen und Osterberichte, Second Edition (Gottingen: Vandenhoeck und Ruprecht, 1962) p. 96; Grass favors the origin in Damascus. The antiquity of the creed has been placed to no more than five years after Jesus' death by most biblical scholars. The linguistic analysis suggests that the version received by Paul seems to have included verses 3b‚Äì6a and 7. The creed has been deemed to be historically reliable and is claimed to preserve a unique and verifiable testimony of the time.Hans von Campenhausen, \\"The Events of Easter and the Empty Tomb,\\" in Tradition and Life in the Church (Philadelphia: Fortress, 1968) p. 44Archibald Hunter, Works and Words of Jesus (1973) p. 100 () Geza Vermes is representative of the common understanding of the origins of this creed in The Resurrection, stating that the words of Paul are \\"a tradition he has inherited from his seniors in the faith concerning the death, burial and resurrection of Jesus\\".Geza Vermes (2008) The Resurrection. London, Penguin: 121‚Äì2 (; ) Gary R. Habermas argues, \\"Essentially all critical scholars today agree that in Corinthians 15:3‚Äì8, Paul records an ancient oral tradition(s) that summarizes the content of the Christian gospel,\\" in which Paul \\"uses the explicit language of oral transmission,\\" according to Donald Hagner. In other words, Paul's account has been described by scholars as \\"the very early tradition that was common to all Christians\\", as \\"a sacred tradition\\", and contained in \\"the oldest strata of tradition\\". According to Paul's Epistle to the Galatians he had previously met two of the people mentioned in these verses as witnesses of the resurrection: James the Just and Cephas/Peter: Moreover, even skeptical scholars agree that the creed in 1 Corinthians 15 is not an interpolation but was a creed formulated and taught at a very early date after Jesus' death. Gerd L√ºdemann, a skeptic scholar, maintains that \\"the elements in the tradition are to be dated to the first two years after the crucifixion of Jesus... not later than three years...\\" Michael Goulder, another skeptic scholar, states that it \\"goes back at least to what Paul was taught when he was converted, a couple of years after the crucifixion\\". =Verses 8‚Äì11= (NRSV): Verses 12-58: resurrection of the deadJesus and the believers 12‚Äì19= In verses 12‚Äì19, St Paul, in response to some expressed doubts of the Corinthian congregation, whom he is addressing in the letter, adduces the fundamental importance of the resurrection as a Christian doctrine. Through those verses, Paul is stressing the importance of the resurrection of Jesus Christ and its relevance to the core of Christianity. Paul rebukes the Corinth Church by saying if Jesus did not resurrect after the crucifixion, then there is no point in the Christianity faith (1 Cor 15:12‚Äì19 ESV). Verse 17 : And if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins. KJV =Verses 20‚Äì28: the last enemy= In verses 20‚Äì28, Paul states that Christ will return in power and put his \\"enemies under his feet\\" (25) and even death, \\"the last enemy\\", shall be destroyed: Verse 26 : The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death. KJV Verse 27 refers to Psalm . Ephesians also refers to this verse of Psalm 8. =Verse 29: baptism for the dead= : Otherwise, what will they do who are baptized for the dead, if the dead do not rise at all? Why then are they baptized for the dead? NKJV Verse 29 suggests that there existed a practice at Corinth whereby a living person would be baptized instead of some convert who had recently died. Teignmouth Shore, writing in Ellicott's Commentary for Modern Readers, notes that among the \\"numerous and ingenious conjectures\\" about this passage, the only tenable interpretation is that there existed a practice of baptising a living person to substitute those who had died before that sacrament could have been administered in Corinth, as also existed among the Marcionites in the second century, or still earlier than that, among a sect called \\"the Corinthians\\".Teignmouth Shore, Ellicott's Commentary for Modern Readers on 1 Corinthians 15, accessed 12 April 2017 The Jerusalem Bible states that \\"What this practice was is unknown. Paul does not say if he approved of it or not: he uses it merely for an ad hominem argument\\".Jerusalem Bible (1966), note at 1 Corinthians 15:29 The Latter Day Saint movement interprets this passage to support the practice of baptism for the dead. This principle of vicarious work for the dead is an important work of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the dispensation of the fulness of times. This interpretation is rejected by other denominations of Christianity. =Be not deceived: 33‚Äì4= Verse 33 contains a quotation from classical Greek literature. According to the church historian Socrates of ConstantinopleThe Ecclesiastical History of Socrates ... , London: George Bell, 1897. book III, chapter 16, verse 114, page 194. See also the introductory essay to Samson Agonistes by John Milton, Of that sort of Dramatic Poem which is call'd Tragedy. it is taken from a Greek tragedy of Euripides, but modern scholarship, following JeromeCommentarium ad Titum 100.1 attributes it to the comedy Thaƒ©s by Menander, or Menander quoting Euripides. It might not have been a direct quote by Paul: \\"This saying was widely known as a familiar quotation.\\" =Resurrection of the body: 35‚Äì58= The Last Trump, illumination by Facundus, 1047. Madrid, Biblioteca Nacional de Espa√±a. The chapter closes with an account of the nature of the resurrection, that in the Last Judgement the dead will be raised and both the living and the dead transformed into \\"spiritual bodies\\" (verse 44):E.P. Sanders (1991) Paul. Oxford University Press: 29‚Äì30 (). For a homiletic application, see \\"When I Get to the End of the Way\\" (References). Hence, through the power of Jesus Christ \\"Death is swallowed up in victory\\" (verse 54). Referring to a verse in the Book of Hosea, Paul asks: \\"O death where is thy sting? O grave where is thy victory?\\" (verse 55), thus, equating sin with death and the Judaic Law which have now been conquered and superseded by the victory of Christ.

His athletic and academic career was interrupted by World War II, as was the case with one of his college buddies and fellow baseball players, Keo Nakama. Serving a four-year-stint as a machine gunner for the Marines in World War II, Jim Reeder earned the Purple Heart and Bronze Star. At the end of World War II, Reeder earned his B.S. degree from O.S.U. and later his M.S. from Indiana University in 1953. He taught and coached in Oberlin, Ohio, and Ypsilanti, Michigan. He mentored countless young men during his years as a coach, including American Football Coach Jim Young (Purdue, Army). In 1955, Reeder moved his family west to Los Angeles where he became the baseball coach for the then fledgling California State University, Los Angeles. He remained Cal State's head coach and assisted major league baseball teams with scouting until his untimely death at the age of 47 in January, 1972. He coached seven All-Americans during his short life and never had a losing season at Cal State L.A.. At the time of his death, the university renamed the baseball field the Jim Reeder Memorial Field. When the field was being built, Coach Reeder used his knowledge of and familiarity with professional baseball fields to assist in the design of this field, and to this day, descriptions of Reeder Field include the fact that it is considered to be unique among college baseball fields.

Aldrich House and Resthaven Chapel are a historic house and chapel at 111 Providence Street in Mendon, Massachusetts. The house, built c. 1830, is an example of Greek Revival architecture in stone, while the chapel is a Late Gothic structure completed in 1900. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006. Description and history The Nathan C. Aldrich House is located in a rural-residential area southeast of the center of Mendon, on the west side of Providence Street just south of its crossing of Spring Brook. It is a two-story masonry structure, built out of locally quarried granite that has been formed into dressed blocks. It is capped by a gabled roof, and has a series of ells that telescope in size. Its main facade faces south, and is five bays wide, with a transomed entrance at the center. The interior has retained a significant number of original finishes, despite its adaptation for institutional use. The chapel, also built of stone, is located near the rear of the property, overlooking Spring Brook. The date of construction of Nathan Aldrich's stone house is not known; it is estimated to have been built c. 1830 based on its Greek Revival details. Stone farmhouses of the period are rare in Mendon, and are predominantly associated with Quakers like Aldrich. The property was acquired in 1891 by Catherine Regina Seabury, who established a rural retreat for women on the property, including the construction of a chapel on the grounds in 1899-1900. The retreat was transformed into a boarding school in 1912, but it did not survive Seabury's death in 1929. The next owner, Doctor Joseph Ashkins, transformed the property into a country estate, removing many of the trappings and alterations made to accommodate the institutional needs.

Description Shorter lead times improve quality, reduce cost and eliminate non-value-added waste within the organization while simultaneously increasing the organization's competitiveness and market share by serving customers better and faster. The time-based framework of QRM accommodates strategic variability such as offering custom-engineered products while eliminating dysfunctional variability such as rework and changing due dates. For this reason, companies making products in low or varying volumes have used QRM as an alternative or to complement other strategies such as Lean Manufacturing, Total quality management, Six Sigma or Kaizen. However, the benefits of QRM are still mooted and contested by experts around. Many opposers of QRM criticize its approach being very \\"marketing-style\\" rather than academic or statistical. HistoryBackground= QRM is rooted in the concept of Time-based competition (TBC) pioneered by Japanese enterprises in the 1980s and first formulated by George Stalk Jr. in his 1988 article entitled Time ‚Äì The Next Source of Competitive Advantage. Time-based competition is a broad- based competitive strategy emphasizing time as the major factor for achieving and maintaining a sustainable competitive advantage. It seeks to compress the time required to propose, develop, manufacture, market and deliver products . QRM advocates a companywide focus on short lead times that include quick response to demand for existing products as well as new product and design changes. This combination has led to the implementation of QRM in many high- mix, low-volume companies. Some argue that Quick Response Manufacturing differs from Quick Response (QR) methods used in the apparel industry and the fast fashion market. QRM is a companywide management strategy applicable to a wide variety of businesses, whereas QR primarily stands for a specific business model in a particular industry. However, the important difference to note is that QR was a competitive industry initiative introduced in the US Textile Industry in 1984 as a means of improving efficiencies in manufacturing and supply chain processes and as such was one of the earliest pioneers of putting into practice time-based competition prior to Stalk's seminal article. Thus QR crossed the traditional boundaries of organization and was not limited to a single organizational efficiency improvement such as that advocated by proponents of QRM. In this respect the Textile Industry initiative was innovative and visionary in its application of QR techniques across the supply chain.Hines, T. 2004. Supply chain strategies: Customer driven and customer focused. Oxford: Elsevier. =Development= The concept of Quick Response Manufacturing (QRM) was first developed in the late 1980s by Rajan Suri, at the time professor of Industrial and Systems Engineering at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Combining growing academic research in Time-based Competition (TBC) with his own observations from various lead time reduction projects, Suri conceived QRM as a concept espousing a relentless emphasis on lead time reduction that has a long-term impact on every aspect of the company. In 1993, Suri, along with a few U.S. Midwest companies and academic colleagues at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, launched the Center for Quick Response Manufacturing , a consortium dedicated to the development and implementation of QRM principles in an industry setting. Proposed by Suri, the newly coined term \\"Quick Response Manufacturing\\" (QRM) signifies the new strategy. QRM extends basic principles of time-based competition while including these new aspects: *Singular focus on lead time reduction *Focus on manufacturing enterprises *Clarification of the misunderstanding and misconceptions managers have about how to apply time-based strategies *Companywide approach reaching beyond shop floor to other areas such as office operations and the supply chain *Use of cellular organization structure throughout the business with more holistic and flexible cells *Inclusion of basic principles of systems dynamics to provide insight on how to best reorganize an enterprise to achieve quick response *New material planning and control approach (POLCA) *Specific QRM principles on how to rethink manufacturing process and equipment decisions *Novel performance measure *Focus on implementation and sustainability *Manufacturing Critical-path Time (MCT) metric to measure lead times Suri's continued research into QRM through industry projects along with enthusiastic responses to various articles on lead time reduction issues led him to develop a comprehensive theory on implementing speed in a manufacturing company, covering all areas in the enterprise. He formulated his theory in the book Quick Response Manufacturing: A Companywide Approach to Reducing Lead Times (1998), providing a framework for the implementation of QRM in manufacturing companies. QRM Strategies and ToolsLead time as a management strategy= Traditionally, U.S. manufacturing firms have focused on scale and cost management strategies based on the division of labor practices formalized by Frederick Winslow Taylor and pioneered by Henry Ford. From the time-based perspective of QRM, the high degree of labor specialization and hierarchical department structures at purely cost-based organizations have these negative effects on lead times: *Products and product orders require long routes through numerous departments *Hierarchical communication structures involving various management levels require a significant amount of time to resolve even routine issues *Focus on efficiency and resource utilization encourages workers and managers to build backlogs, slowing the response to customer requests *Trying to minimize costly machine setups, managers and workers resort to running large batch sizes. Large batch sizes result in long run times, leaving other jobs waiting and increasing lead times *Making large product quantities to stock leads to high inventory, often prone to inventory obsolescence ‚Äì when stored products have to be discarded because of market or engineering changes *Low skill levels lead to low quality and high levels of rework All these factors contribute to long lead times, ultimately resulting in waste throughout the enterprise such as excessive forecasting, planning, scheduling, expediting, work in progress (WIP), finished goods costs and obsolescence. These increase the overall costs and lower the organization's competitiveness. QRM suggests that an enterprisewide focus on reducing lead times will result in improvements in both quality and cost. Eliminating the time-consuming ‚Äì and often self- reinforcing ‚Äì practices described above can lead to large cost savings while improving product quality and customer responsiveness. Hence, on a management level, QRM advocates a mindset change from cost-based to time-based thinking, making short lead times the yardstick for organizational success. Manufacturing Critical-path Time (MCT) QRM's strong focus on lead time reduction requires a comprehensive definition of lead time. To accomplish this, QRM introduces Manufacturing Critical-path Time (MCT). It is based on the standard critical path method; defined as the typical amount of calendar time from when a customer creates an order, until the first piece of that order is delivered to the customer. A metric designed to calculate waste and highlight opportunities for improvement, MCT gives an estimate of the time it takes to fulfill an order, quantifying the longest critical-path duration of order-fulfillment activities. =Organizational structure= QRM requires four fundamental structural changes to transform a company organized around cost- based management strategies to a time-based focus: *Functional to Cellular: Functional departments must be dissolved. In their place, QRM cells become the main organizational unit. QRM cells are more flexible and holistic in their implementation compared to other cell concepts, and can be applied outside the shop floor *Top-down Control to Team Ownership: Top-down control of processes by managers and supervisors in departments needs to be transformed to a decision-making structure in which QRM cells manage themselves and have ownership of the entire process within the cell *Specialized Workers to a Cross-trained Workforce: Workers need to be trained to perform multiple tasks *Efficiency/Utilization Goals to Lead Time Reduction: To support this new structure, companies must replace cost-based goals of efficiency and utilization with the overarching goal of lead time reduction QRM Cell The main building block of the QRM organization is the QRM cell. Extending the concept of cellular manufacturing, QRM cells are designed around a Focused Target Market Segment (FTMS) ‚Äì a segment of the market in which shorter product lead times provide the company with maximum benefits. Resources in a cell are dedicated (only to be used for jobs in the cell), collocated (located in close proximity to each other) and multifunctional (cover different functions). QRM cells complete a sequence of operations ensuring that jobs leave the cell completed and do not need to return. The work organization in QRM cells is based on team ownership. Provided with a job and a completion deadline, teams can decide independently on how to complete the job. To ensure quick response to high-variety demand, workers in QRM cells need to go through cross training. The main performance measure for a QRM cell is lead time as defined by MCT. To measure MCT reduction, managers can use the QRM number, a metric designed to show management lead time trends for cells. =System Dynamics= In QRM, the product-focused cell structure has to be complemented by a thorough understanding of system dynamics in order to make better decisions to reduce lead times. Based on principles of system dynamics, QRM identifies high utilization of machines and labor as well as running large batch sizes as major obstacles to lead time reduction. Create spare capacity Many cost-based organizations aim for machines and labor to be utilized at close to 100% of capacity. QRM criticizes this approach as counterproductive to lead time reduction based on queuing theory, which shows that high utilization increases waiting times for products. In order to be able to handle high variability in demand and products, QRM advises companies to operate at 80 percent capacity on critical resources. Optimize batch sizes Common efficiency measures encourage production of parts in large batch sizes. From the QRM perspective, large batch sizes lead to long waiting times, high WIP and inventory, and ultimately long lead times. Long lead times in turn result in multiple forms of waste and increased cost as described above. Thus, QRM encourages enterprise to strive towards batch sizes that minimize lead times. =Enterprisewide Application= QRM emphasizes time- based thinking throughout the organization, creating a unified management strategy for the entire enterprise. Extending beyond traditional efforts to optimize shop floor operations, QRM applies time-based management principles to all other parts of the organization. Office Operations QRM identifies office operations such as quoting, engineering, scheduling and order processing as major contributors to lead times. To achieve short lead times in the office environment, QRM suggests implementing several changes according to the time-based approach described above. The main requirement for reorganizing office operations in QRM is the formation of a Quick Response Office Cell (Q-ROC) around a Focus Target Market Segment (FTMS). In their focus on closed-loop, collocated, multifunctional, cross-trained teams, Q-ROCs are similar to QRM Cells. Q-ROCs, like QRM cells on the shop floor, break down functional departments and can complete jobs through multiple functional steps. Material Planning QRM criticizes commonly used material planning and scheduling systems such as Material Requirements Planning (MRP), Manufacturing resource planning (MRP II), and Enterprise resource planning (ERP) for not incorporating system dynamics in their analysis and not accounting for the cost of long lead times. QRM recommends simplifying existing MRP systems to a Higher Level MRP (HL/MRP) concerned with high-level planning and coordination of material and not with detailed scheduling of operations. Production Control To coordinate and control flow within the QRM structure of cells and HL/MRP, QRM utilizes POLCA (Paired-cell Overlapping Loops of Cards with Authorization). POLCA is a card-based shop floor control system, designed as the QRM alternative to Kanban. POLCA differs from commonly used Kanban systems in the type of signal it sends to move jobs/material through the shop floor. POLCA constitutes a capacity signal, showing that a cell is ready to work on a new job, whereas Kanban systems rely on inventory signals designed to replenish a certain quantity of parts. For this reason, POLCA works well for low-volume and/or custom products. The first QRM shop floor control system was developed by PROPOS software . PROPOS software was also the first to develop a digital version of the POLCA card system. In March 2018 Rajan Suri published The Practitioner's Guide to POLCA: The Production Control System for High-Mix, Low-Volume and Custom Products] in which Suri describes a practical approach to POLCA to maximize production efficiency, reduce WIP (Work in Process) and prevent bottlenecks from forming. Suri also describes the use of PROPOS QRM software and digital POLCA, illustrated by a case at BOSCH Scharnieren. This Dutch manufacturer produces custom metal hinges and managed to greatly reduce lead times and optimize the production flow in their job shop using QRM and POLCA principles . Supply Chain QRM encourages companies to work with suppliers to reduce their MCT. Long supplier lead times can incur \\"hidden\\" costs such as high inventory, freight cost for rush shipments, unplanned engineering changes creating obsolete inventory, and reduced flexibility to respond to demand changes. QRM recommends that MCT be included as a significant factor in sourcing decisions. New Product Introduction QRM highlights strategic advantages of rapid New Product Introduction (NPI). Applying the MCT metric to the NPI process provides valuable information on the current NPI performance. Based on these findings, QRM encourages managers to rethink cost-based decisions in terms of their impact on the NPI MCT. For example, cost-based purchasing policies can result in long purchasing times for prototype materials, in turn delaying the NPI. Implementation QRM theory recommends following four common steps when implementing QRM: =Creating a QRM mindset= QRM implementation requires company personnel to embrace the strategy's time-based principles. In a first step, a team of management and employees trained in QRM principles should compile a list of wastes due to long MCT, creating awareness for the negative impact of long lead times on operations. If the company decides to take action, QRM theory recommends the creation of an organizational framework for the implementation effort. In this framework, a high-level QRM Steering Committee oversees all QRM efforts, while a QRM Champion ‚Äì an experienced employee with sound QRM training ‚Äì is charged with driving and overseeing projects on a day-to-day basis. With this structure in place, the Steering Committee can pick a set of products as the target for the first QRM project. =Changing of organizational structure= Following the general direction of the Steering Committee, a cross-functional planning team starts studying the project, including a detailed analysis of the MCT, product volumes, strategic needs and other factors. This analysis leads to the definition of the FTMS for the QRM project. Using QRM principles, the planning team designs a QRM cell for the FTMS. With approval from management, an implementation team consisting of the people in the new cell and members of the planning team can start training activities, cross-training of operators and ‚Äì if needed ‚Äì relocation of equipment to launch the cell. After cell launching, the implementation team continues support for the new cell and measures MCT to monitor lead time changes. =Inclusion of system dynamics= During both design of the cell and its operation, the implementation team should reexamine policies on utilization to properly plan the loading of the cells and to maintain spare capacity. Furthermore, cells teams should be encouraged to engage in a program of batch size reduction. =Enterprisewide expansion of QRM= After completing the initial project, the company needs to evaluate the results of these QRM efforts and publicize successes throughout the organization. Following the same pattern as described above, the company should identify additional FTMSs for other QRM projects and start the implementation process. As more cells are formed, restructuring of the MRP system and implementation of POLCA may become necessary. To maximize benefits of a time-based management strategy, QRM projects should span across office operations, the shop floor and supply chain. Practice Quick Response Manufacturing is used by a variety of companies from different sectors worldwide. As an enterprisewide strategy, QRM has found applications in all areas of the company from shop floor to office operations to supply chain and beyond. In the apparel industry, QRM has also become closely intertwined with the concepts of Fast Fashion and Fast Fit, both of which are intended to reduce the timeframes typically associated with bringing catwalk style to the high street. Many companies use QRM to address lead time issues in some parts of their organization or as an addition to existing continuous improvement efforts such as Lean, Six Sigma or others. Another group of companies including Alexandria Extrusion, Omnipress, RenewAire and Phoenix Products have transformed their entire operation according to QRM principles making full use of QRM's enterprisewide reach. In a 2008 article in Barron's magazine profiling the five companies most successful at boosting their sales and cash flow from among the 500 largest (by sales) publicly traded companies in the U.S. and Canada, Merrill Miller, chairman and CEO of National Oilwell Varco mentions improved manufacturing efficiencies based on QRM as a large part of NOV's growth. In recent years, QRM principles have also found applications in the healthcare and pharmaceutical sector. Center for Quick Response Manufacturing Founded in 1993 by Rajan Suri, along with a few U.S. Midwest companies and academic colleagues at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, the Center for Quick Response Manufacturing has been a driving force in the development and implementation of QRM. Organized as a public-private consortium including faculty, students and company members, the Center has assisted more than 220 companies in applying QRM principles over the past 20 years. The Center provides general information on QRM and hosts a variety of training events each year. Companies interested in implementing QRM can become members of the Center and take part in improvement projects conducted in cooperation with engineering students and university faculty. Following the public-private partnership model, a new QRM Center at HAN University of Applied Sciences in Arnhem, Netherlands (founded 2010) is helping European companies implement QRM strategies.

When a system participant attempts to periodically access data that will never be altered by another party, but those data share a cache block with data that are altered, the caching protocol may force the first participant to reload the whole unit despite a lack of logical necessity. The caching system is unaware of activity within this block and forces the first participant to bear the caching system overhead required by true shared access of a resource. By far the most common usage of this term is in modern multiprocessor CPU caches, where memory is cached in lines of some small power of two word size (e.g., 64 aligned, contiguous bytes). If two processors operate on independent data in the same memory address region storable in a single line, the cache coherency mechanisms in the system may force the whole line across the bus or interconnect with every data write, forcing memory stalls in addition to wasting system bandwidth. False sharing is an inherent artifact of automatically synchronized cache protocols and can also exist in environments such as distributed file systems or databases, but current prevalence is limited to RAM caches. Example struct foo { int x; int y; }; static struct foo f; /* The two following functions are running concurrently: */ int sum_a(void) { int s = 0; for (int i = 0; i < 1000000; ++i) s += f.x; return s; } void inc_b(void) { for (int i = 0; i < 1000000; ++i) ++f.y; } Here, \`sum_a\` may need to continually re-read \`x\` from main memory (instead of from cache) even though \`inc_b\`'s concurrent modification of \`y\` should be irrelevant.

It is a relatively rare surviving example of an Ohio and Erie Canal aqueduct. It was originally constructed in 1825-1827 by, and re- built due to flood damage in 1845 and 1905. Tinkers Creek Aqueduct was included in a National Historic Landmark district established in 1966, and it was separately listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. The original Tinkers Creek Aqueduct was a wood plank, steel truss, and Ashlar- sandstone structure constructed in 1827, south of the present aqueduct's location. Cuyahoga River and Tinkers Creek flooding caused continual damage to the original aqueduct, so successive structures were built in 1845 and 1905 in the present location. Today, Tinkers Creek Aqueduct is the only aqueduct which remains of the four original aqueducts in the Cuyahoga Valley. Of Furnace Run Aqueduct, Mill Creek Aqueduct, Peninsula Aqueduct, and (? Yellow Creek ?) Aqueduct; Mill Creek Aqueduct, of newer construction, is the only aqueduct which still carries Ohio and Erie Canal water. After 102 years of flooding, weathering, and deterioration, Tinkers Creek Aqueduct was removed in 2007.

Condition The Tinkers Creek Aqueduct is a contributing structure on the NHL portion of the canal and continues to deteriorate rapidly. Due to the advanced state of decay, the aqueduct structure and the associated towpath Trial bridge will be removed and eventually replace with a newer aqueduct and bridge. Phase 1 of the project will involve removal of the existing aqueduct and Towpath Bridge, installation of a new Towpath Bridge, installation of temporary steel pipes to carry the canal water over the creek, restoration of portions of the sandstone abutment walls, and installation of a temporary high-water overflow structure. A later phase will include replacement of the aqueduct structure with a new design and restoration of the existing sandstone center pier and remaining abutment walls. Phase 1 is to begin in FY 2007. The increased numbers of flood events in recent years has caused significant damage to the river and stream banks which potentially threatens the canal basin. Ongoing monitoring and stabilization of river and stream banks will continue as needed. Flooding The aqueduct and surrounding area are subject to flooding by the Cuyahoga River and Tinkers Creek.

Five years after the original hotel was destroyed, a new one was built nearby and was named the Shepheard Hotel. History The Story of a Historic Hostelry - Shepheard's Cairo The hotel was originally established in 1841 by Samuel Shepheard under the name \\"Hotel des Anglais\\" (English Hotel),Elaine Denby - Grand Hotels: Reality & Illusion (New York: McGraw-Hill; London: Reaktion Books, 1998) and was later renamed \\"Shepheard's Hotel\\".Michael Bird - Samuel Shepheard of Cairo: A Portrait (London: Michael Joseph, 1957) Shepheard, an Englishman who was once described as \\"an undistinguished apprentice pastry chef\\", came from Preston Capes, Northamptonshire. He co-owned the hotel with Mr. Hill, Mohammed Ali Pasha's head coachman, and proved to be a successful entrepreneur and businessman. On one occasion, when soldiers staying at the hotel were suddenly moved to Crimea, leaving unpaid bills, Shepheard travelled personally to Sevastopol in order to collect payment. In 1845, Hill relinquished his interest in the hotel, and Shepheard became the sole owner. Shepheard sold the hotel in 1861 for ¬£10,000 and retired to Eathorpe Hall, Eathorpe, Warwickshire, England. Richard Burton, a close friend of Shepheard, left a detailed description of his generous character and successful career, describing him as \\"a remarkable man in many points, and in all things the model John Bull\\".Richard F. Burton, The Gold-Mines of Midian (C.Kegan Paul & Co, London, 1878), pp. 43-46 Shepheard's Hotel was famed for its grandeur, for its guests, and as a base for the military. It was renowned for its opulence, with stained glass, Persian carpets, gardens, terraces, and great granite pillars resembling those of the Ancient Egyptian temples. Its American Bar was frequented not only by Americans but also by French and British officers. There were nightly dances at which men appeared in military uniform and women in evening gowns. The bar was also known as the \\"long bar\\" because it was always so crowded that it required considerable waiting to get a drink.Stadiem, William Too Rich The High Life and Tragic Death of King Farouk, New York, Carroll & Graf, 1991 page 181. In 1941-42, when there were very real fears that the Wehrmacht's Afrika Korps under Erwin Rommel might take Cairo, a popular joke amongst the British and Australian soldiers waiting for service at the \\"long bar\\" was: \\"Wait until he [Rommel] gets to Shepheard's; that'll hold him up\\".Stadiem, William Too Rich The High Life and Tragic Death of King Farouk, New York, Carroll & Graf, 1991 page 181. The Suffering Bastard cocktail was created at the bar. Bartender Joe Scialom was looking to make a hangover drink for allied troops and according to story made one as a \\"cure\\" for the suffering soldiers who complained about the poor quality of liquor in the area. During the fighting, Nazi General Rommel allegedly said \\"I'll be drinking champagne in the master suite at Shepheard's soon\\". The \\"long bar\\" was popular with the cabinet of the Greek government-in-exile, and Harold Macmillan wrote in his diary on 21 August 1944 that the Greek government-in- exile should move to Italy to escape the \\"poisonous atmosphere of intrigue which reigns in Cairo. All previous Greek governments-in-exile have been broken in the bar of Shepheard's\\".Clogg, Richard \\"The Greek Government-in- Exile 1941-4\\" pages 376-398 from The International History Review, Volume 1, No. 3, July 1979 pages 378-379. Tourist shops faced the hotel from across the street, and there was a storeroom where officers could leave their excess luggage. Reviews of the hotel's cuisine varied over time. At an early stage, its food was said to leave \\"much to be desired\\"Sir John Gardner Wilkinson - A Handbook for Travellers in Egypt (London: John Murray, 1858) but, by the middle of the 20th century, others were describing the food as \\"as good as anything at Paris' Ritz, or Berlin's Adlon, or Rome's Grand\\". Among its famous guests were Aga Khan, the Maharajah of Jodhpur and Winston Churchill. On 26 January 1952 the hotel was destroyed during the Cairo Fire, a period of anti- British riots and dramatic civil unrest that led to the Egyptian Revolution of 1952.Nina Nelson - Helnan Shepheard Hotel Cairo-Egypt (Cairo: Al Ahram, 1992) In popular culture The hotel has had many notable fictional guests. It was portrayed in the 1934 British film The Camels are Coming. The hotel is the setting for a number of scenes in the 1996 film The English Patient but actual filming of the scenes happened at The Grand Hotel des Bains in Venice Lido, Italy. The hotel is used as a base of operations in The Race Colonization series by Harry Turtledove, as a location in Agatha Christie's Crooked House, and is mentioned in Anthony Trollope's short-story, An Unprotected Female at the Pyramids (1861). It also features regularly in Elizabeth Peters' Amelia Peabody novels. Modern Shepheard Hotel A \\"Shepheard Hotel\\" was erected in 1957 by Egyptian Hotels Ltd. in Garden City, Cairo, about from the site of the original hotel. The new hotel, and the land on which it sits, is owned by E.G.O.T.H. (The Egyptian General Company for Tourism & Hotels). The hotel was managed by Helnan International Hotels and known as the Helnan Shepheard Hotel until September 29, 2009, when the Rocco Forte Company was chosen as the hotel's management company.

He also gave his name to the nearby South African town of Cullinan. He was honored by the African Methodist Episcopal Church in Tembisa which named their church after him (Sir Thomas Cullinan AME Church).

In 1887, he moved to Johannesburg.Regimental Headquarters: The View There he became a bricklayer, and after he earned some money, he turned to prospecting. In 1897 he moved to Parktown, the up-and-coming suburb of the Randlords and had 'The View', his home built. He discovered the Premier diamond fields in 1898. They lay a considerable distance from the existing diamond fields, but from the find of a diamond on the surface near a farm fence, he deduced that the diamond (found in alluvial soil) must have been washed from some higher diamond-bearing geological position. Such a position presented itself in the shape of a nearby koppie, which concealed a diamond-bearing blue ground pipe. The owner of the mine, Joachim Prinsloo, had sold land to both gold and diamond prospectors before, and would not sell. However Cullinan succeeded in purchasing the land for ¬£52,000 from Prinsloo's daughter, who inherited the farm after her father's death.Hahn, _Diamond_ , Chapter 4, p.125ff on Farlang.com Cullinan was one of the co-founders and chairman of what became the Transvaal Chamber of Industries.Cullinan Diamonds He was a member of the Transvaal Legislative Assembly and the first Union Parliament of 1910, representing the Pretoria Western district.

Gameplay  The premise of WarpSpeed is to rid the current scenario of enemy fighters. Scenarios make use of quadrants in which the player flies sector by sector or uses faster-than-light travel to warp from sector to sector. Most space flight consists of navigating asteroid fields, although some sectors contain mines that must be destroyed. During the course of gameplay, the player receives transmissions regarding various topics, consisting of clearing out minefields to travelling to a specific sector to obtain some manner of space technology before the enemy reaches it. Other transmissions are distress signals from space stations asking for assistance from approaching enemy fighters. Features WarpSpeed features pseudo 3D gameplay, allowing the player to supposedly travel in 360 degrees in flight; however, the quadrant is laid out in a 2-D configuration so that the player only really travels along an X-axis and a Y-axis. Wormholes are also located in various quadrants and allow transport to other quadrants; however, they slowly deplete the vessel's warp drive reserves. The game allows four different space craft for the player to use, each with progressively stronger weapons. The players accumulated game score eventually allows the player to automatically upgrade to the next available craft. The game also features an award system based on the number of points that players have gained from destroying enemy fighters to achieving other goals. The game also features a damage system that affects the performance of the player's craft. For instance, if the damage control screen indicates the players' engines have been damaged, their maximum speed will decrease; if their weapons system has taken damage, the players' weapons will not always fire correctly, etc. Throughout the quadrant, there may be one or multiple space stations for the player to dock with, refuel and replenish their ship's systems, ammunition, and warp drive reserves. These stations are critical to the player and if they are lost, they can not be replaced. If the players craft suffers too much damage, the vessel will be destroyed. The player has three lives to complete the chosen scenario. If the player loses all three lives, the game is over.

Under the Minerals and Mining Law, mining companies must pay royalties; companies may also pay corporate taxes at standard rates. Companies are exempt from custom duties on accessories, equipment, machinery, and plants used for mining operations, but must pay local property taxes on their immovable properties. The 1986 mining law had been instrumental in attracting more than $5 billion in foreign investment to the Ghanaian mining industry between 1986 and 2002. The 1994 amendments reduced the 45% general mining corporate tax rate to 35%, which is the same as that imposed on other industries. On December 15, 2005, the Ghanaian Parliament passed into law a new minerals and mining bill. Some of the provisions under the new Minerals and Mining Law, law No. 703, included access to mineral rights on a first-come, first-considered basis; a specific timeframe within which all applications are expected to be granted; the right for applicants to demand written reasons from the Minister if an application is rejected; the Government‚Äôs right to acquire land or authorize its occupation and use if the land is required for mining purposes; the establishment of a cadastral system for the administration of mineral rights; a provision establishing the range of royalty rates, which is not to be less than 3% or exceed 6% of total mining revenues; the Government‚Äôs right to obtain a 10% free-carried interest in mining leases; and the establishment of the period of duration of a mining lease, which is not to exceed 30 years and which may be renewed once for a period not to exceed an additional 30 years.

According to the authors, the restrictive nature of a brassiere inhibits the lymphatic system, leading to an increased risk of breast cancer. The book's claims are considered unfounded by the scientific community, and researchers have criticized the authors' methodology as faulty. Major medical organizations including the National Institutes of Health and the American Cancer Society have found no evidence that bra-wearing increases breast-cancer risk.  Background  Singer and Grismaijer argued that bra-wearing might cause breast cancer because of a purported effect on lymphatic circulation. They believed that constriction from tightly worn bras inhibited the proper functioning of the lymphatic system and led to a buildup of fluid within the breast tissue. According to the authors, bra-induced constriction of the breast lymphatic vessels could concentrate unnamed, hypothetical toxins within the breast tissue, which might ultimately lead to cancer. In Dressed to Kill, Singer and Grismaijer claim to have examined the bra-wearing attitudes and behaviors of over 4,700 US women in 5 major cities, and that half of the women questioned had had breast cancer. Women who had had breast cancer were asked about their bra-wearing habits prior to their diagnosis of cancer. The data presented in the book have never been published in a peer-reviewed journal, and researchers identified a number of methodological flaws in the authors' claims. After publishing Dressed to Kill, Singer and Grismaijer wrote Get It Off!, another book about the dangers of wearing bras, and a series of other books in which they claim that sleeping on a tilted bed can prevent Alzheimer's disease and impotence; that frequent defecation and urination can prevent many conditions such as prostate enlargement and menopausal symptoms; and that high blood pressure is a \\"major medical scam\\" because \\"blood pressure measurements can be whatever the doctor wants them to be.\\" Scientific reception Medical and scientific bodies have generally not supported the book's claims about bras and breast cancer: * The National Cancer Institute (US) states that bras have not been shown to increase a woman's risk of breast cancer.Fact Sheet on Breast Cancer Risk Factors, from the U.S. National Cancer Institute. Accessed July 10, 2008. * The American Cancer Society states, \\"There are no scientifically valid studies that show wearing bras of any type causes breast cancer.\\" * The U.S. National Institutes of Health states, \\"Breast implants, using antiperspirants, and wearing underwire bras do not raise your risk for breast cancer.\\"Breast Cancer Information from MedlinePlus. Accessed July 10, 2008. * In 2000, as a follow-up to misreporting of a UK study, British health professionals stated that bras cause no increase in breast cancer risk. * A study conducted by the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center found \\"no aspect of bra wearing, including bra cup size, recency, average number of hours a day worn, wearing a bra with an underwire, or age first began regularly wearing a bra, was associated with risks\\" of breast cancer. The study included detailed studies of women's lifestyle and bra-wearing habits and found no correlation between bra use and cancer. The authors' proposal that bras block the lymphatic system which leads to accumulated toxins and cancer was likewise contradicted by scientific study. The National Institutes of Health examined cancer rates among women who had their underarm lymph nodes removed as part of melanoma treatment: \\"The surgery, which is known to block lymph drainage from breast tissue, did not detectably increase breast cancer rates, the study found, meaning that it is extremely unlikely that wearing a bra, which affects lymph flow minimally if at all, would do so.\\" ReferencesExternal links * * Category:1995 non-fiction books Category:Brassieres Category:Breast cancer Category:Books about cancer Category:Health and wellness books Category:Pseudoscience literature ","title":"Dressed to Kill (book)"},{"id":"17991364","text":"Keith Morris (15 August 1938 ‚Äì 17 June 2005) was an English rock photographer.

An exhibition of his Drake photographs was exhibited in 2004 at the Redfern's Music Picture Gallery in west London. Morris said: \\"Although I knew Nick on and off for about four years, I photographed him only three times, on three separate days, each time linked to one of his albums\\". In the mid-1970s, Morris developed a passion for scuba diving and, within a decade, he was one of Britain's top divers and became a senior instructor for Technical Divers International. Morris went missing from a dive on a submarine wreck in the English Channel around 17 June 2005.

The United States Congress, in the Ratification Act of 1929, provided that until the Congress shall provide for the Government of the islands of American Samoa all civil, judicial, and military powers shall be vested in such person or persons and exercised in such manner as the President of the United States shall direct. In , the President of the United States directed that the Secretary of the Interior should take care for the administration of civil government in American Samoa. The Secretary promulgated the Constitution of American Samoa which was approved by a Constitutional Convention of the people of American Samoa and a majority of the voters of American Samoa voting at the 1966 election, and came into effect in 1967. The Secretary retains ultimate authority. The government operates under a framework of a presidential representative democratic dependency, whereby the Governor of American Samoa is the head of government. Legislative power is vested in the American Samoa Fono. The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature. Executive The power of the executive is formally vested The governor and the lieutenant governor are elected on the same ticket by popular vote for four-year terms. Legislature The Legislature, or Fono, has two chambers. The House of Representatives has 18 members, elected for a two-year term, 17 in single-seat constituencies and one by a public meeting on Swain Island. The Senate also has 18 members, elected for a four-year term by and from the chiefs of the islands. Judiciary The Judiciary of American Samoa is defined under the Constitution of American Samoa and the American Samoa Code. It consists of the High Court of American Samoa and a local district court under the administration and supervision of the Chief Justice of the High Court. Both courts are located in the capital of Pago Pago. The Chief Justice and the Associate Justice of the High Court are appointed by the United States Secretary of the Interior, and the six associate judges of the High Court and one local district court judge are appointed by the Governor of American Samoa. Because American Samoa does not have a federal court like the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, or the United States Virgin Islands, matters of federal law arising in American Samoa have generally been adjudicated in the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii or the District Court for the District of Columbia.

It covers , and extends predominantly along North Street, between Esty Road and Powers Road, and eastward along Hopedale Street and Trask Road. The area has been a rural agricultural area since the early days of Mendon's history in the 17th century. The present landscape retains boundaries and land-use patterns that were established in the 18th and 19th centuries, although some features (generally within individual farms) have been lost or obscured to accommodate modern farming practices. The architecture of the area is predominantly 19th century; the oldest building in the district appears to be the Federal style house of the Seth Davenport Farm at 133 North Avenue, built c. 1780.

The filter beds were constructed in 1895 as part of the reservoir construction to improve the water quality of Marlborough and Walker Brooks, and are the best-preserved of two such facilities built as part of the public water supply serving Boston and surrounding communities. The site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. Description and history The filter beds are located on a straddling the border between Marlborough and Southborough on the west side of the Sudbury Reservoir, and are now largely overgrown with vegetation. They are roughly bounded by three roadways: Walker Street to the north, Massachusetts Route 85 to the west (which is Maple Street in Marlborough and Marlboro Street in Southborough), and Acre Bridge Road in Southborough, which becomes Framingham Road in Marlborough. The northernmost portion, where Marlborough Brook enters after crossing under Walker Street, is a settling reservoir. From this, water was diverted over a stone and concrete weir into a channel running along the eastern edge of the beds. Sluiceways controlled the channeling of water into a series of 17 beds to the west, which consist of shallow basins with about of sand set at the bottom on top of a tile bed. The water would filter through these beds by gravity. Further down the main channel another sluiceway channeled water into a larger holding bed, or into a second series of 10 \\"natural\\" beds, which fashioned out of already- extant gravel. When The Sudbury Reservoir was built in 1893-95, it was predominantly fed by the Sudbury River, but also received water from a number of smaller surrounding streams. Marlborough and Walker Brooks were two of these, and were identified from an early date as having substandard water quality. The engineering staff of the Metropolitan Water Board, predecessor to today's Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA), designed these structures in order to improve the quality of the water entering the reservoir from these two streams, and were completed by 1899. Only one other location in the Boston water supply had similar structures, which were later storm-damaged and partially filled in. These filter beds are no longer in service, and the Sudbury Reservoir is part of the MWRA's backup facilities.

The district is centered on a stretch of Main Street which connects two triangular intersections. It includes many of the town's oldest buildings, including the c. 1724 Cushing House, and the c. 1730 Stillman Stone House. Three of the town's most significant institutional buildings were built before 1850: the town hall (a former Unitarian church), the Congregational church, and the Methodist church. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. Description and history Lunenburg was settled in 1718 and incorporated in 1728. For most of its history before World War I, it was a rural agrarian community, bypassed by industrialization due to a lack of good water power, and by improved transportation methods such as the railroad. The town center was laid out on a piece of high ground near its geographic center known as Turkey Hill, and is now defined mainly by the junction of Massachusetts Avenue (Massachusetts Route 2A) with Leominster Road and Lancaster Avenue. The town green, where its early colonial meeting house was the focus of civic life, is located just south of this junction, bounded by Leominster Road, Lancaster Avenue, and Whiting Avenue. Small cottage industries contributed to the town center's development most notably an early bookbinding business (producing Bibles despite the banning of their printing in British colonies) and barrel making. The town center's place as the focus of civic life was cemented in the mid-19th century by the construction of several churches, one of which (a former Greek Revival Unitarian Church) now serves as town hall. The district is in size, and includes 77 historically significant buildings. It extends for some distance along the roads radiating away from the common, as well as Massachusetts Avenue to the east and west, and Main and Highland Streets to the north. Most of the buildings in it are residential and of wood frame construction. Historic brick buildings include an 1835 district schoolhouse. Most of the buildings are in vernacular styles popular at the time of their construction, with the Greek Revival and Federal period particularly well- represented.

The girls became wards of the province and the parents relinquished their rights as guardians. The facility housed an average of 120 girls annually, with 30 or so held in a secure facility known as Churchill House. Girls were typically sentenced under the federal Juvenile Delinquents Act (JDA, 1908) and the provincial Training School Act (TSA, 1931, 1939). The so-called \\"training school\\" was created primarily to rehabilitate working-class girls perceived to be destined for adult criminality. While many of the girls had committed minor crimes, many were sent to the facility because they had been pronounced \\"unmanageable\\" under the Juvenile Delinquents Act for reasons such as truancy, drug or alcohol use, or \\"sexual immorality\\". The school consisted of five brick buildings situated on 72 acres of land. Following the closure of the facility in 1976, many former residents came forward with accusations of physical, sexual, and psychological abuse by the staff. The abuse didn't become publicly known, however, until 1991, when two women who were being treated by the same psychologist each told him of very similar experiences of abuse that occurred while they were incarcerated at Grandview. The psychologist introduced the two women to each other and they subsequently made appearances on television, asking others who had been at Grandview to contact the police or the provincial government. In the summer of 1991, the Ontario Provincial Police and Waterloo Regional Police Service began a joint investigation into the allegations.Kaufman Report, Chapter 16 In December 1992, in order to assist those who had come forward, a Victim Witness Program was established in Kitchener, Ontario. At about the same time, a small group of women, which would later expand to over 300, created the Grandview Survivor's Support Group to investigate collective compensation. In 1999, then Member of Provincial Parliament Jim Flaherty apologized in the provincial legislature on behalf of the Ontario government to the Grandview Survivors Support Group for the abuses suffered.

Additionally, during each end year-session, cadets must undergo Single Service Training (LKPT)‚Äîwhich generally is regarded by cadets to be the \\"worst 6 weeks of the year.\\" Cadets learn military skills, including leadership, through a military program (LKU) that begins on their first day at the university. Most military training takes place during the end-semester holiday, with new cadets undergoing Cadet Basic Training (LFI) ‚Äî or \\"Square bashing\\". Additionally, cadets are housed in barracks style floor-by-floor management at accommodation blocks and have leadership positions and responsibilities throughout the academic year. Every mid-semester, the young men and women train at the campus camp; campus fields for physical trainings, 1RAMD obstacle course and shooting range for obstacle course exercise and shooting practice, and RMC's parade ground for drills. In this six-week part of LKU at the campus, the cadets are introduced to a basic firearms and training exercises. The battalions are in command of appointed rank holders and final year cadets. The super-seniors are in officer positions such as Platoon leader and Company commanders. At the end of the six-week UKMHK session, awards are given out to the best battalion based on the best performance at each training site. Moral-ethical development occurs throughout the formal programs. These include formal instruction in the values of the military profession, religious programs, and interaction with staff and faculty role models. The foundation of the ethical code at the university is found in the institution's motto, \\"Duty, Honor, Integrity.\\" Cadets adhere to the Cadet Honor Code, which states \\"A cadet will not lie, cheat, steal, or tolerate those who do.\\" =Programme= Academic programme =Language Centre= * Language and Cross Culture Communication =Defence Engineering Faculty= * Civil engineering * Electric & Electronic (Power) engineering * Electric & Electronic (Communication) engineering * Mechanical engineering * Mechanical - Automotive engineering * Mechanical - Aeronautic engineering * Mechanical - Marine technology engineering * Art defence engineering =Defence Sciences Faculty= * Computer science (Security system) * Computer science (Artificial intelligence) * Maritime technology =Faculty of Defence Management Studies= * Defence human resource management * Strategic studies * Security and defence management =Faculty of Medicine and Defence Health Sciences= * Bachelor of Medicine =Rank= Unlike virtually all other bachelor-degree granting institutions in Malaysia (but like the other military academies in Malaysia), the university does not refer to its students as freshmen, sophomores, juniors, or seniors; they are instead called by their year of intake e.g. \\"2002\\", \\"2003\\", \\"2004\\", \\"20XX\\". Colloquially, the freshmen are \\"tahun asas (basic year)\\"; sophomores, \\"tahun satu (year 1)\\"; juniors, \\"tahun dua (year 2)\\"; seniors, \\"tahun tiga (year 3)\\"; super-senior, \\"tahun empat (year 4)\\". Most cadets consider basic year to be the most difficult because of the rules and restrictions developed to help students transition from civilian to military cadet. However, the third and fourth years are generally considered to be the hardest academically. Within the university, cadets who reached year three or four can hold positions of increasing responsibility with a cadet rank: * Cadet: Member of platoon - year 1 to year 4 cadet. * Cadet Corporal: - year 1 to year 4 cadet. * Cadet Sergeant: Leader of a platoon - year 3 and year 4 cadet. * Cadet CSM (KSM): Cadet Company Sergeant Major. Second in charge of a company - year 3 and year 4 cadet. * Cadet JUO (PRM): Cadet Junior Under Officer. Leading a company/second in charge of a battalion - year 3 and year 4 cadet. * Cadet SUO (PRK): Cadet Senior Under Officer. Leading a battalion or the cadet brigade - year 4 cadet. =Organization= Cadet officers on exercise In the UPNM student organisation, they are divided by two which is Student Representative Council or Majlis Perwakilan Pelajar (consist of military and civilian students) and also rank holder and cadet mess secretariat. see the website of SRC UPNM - *National Defence University of Malaysia Students Representative Council The cadets have the following organisation: :(The number of cadets is approximate and varies year to year) * 1 brigade (1,500 cadets) which consists of: * 4 battalions * 9 companies (120 cadets) which each company consist of: * 3 platoons (40 cadets) There are 9 companies in the Cadet Brigade and these are as follows: * Hang Tuah * Hang Jebat * Hang Kasturi * Hang Lekir * Hang Lekiu * Tun Perak * Hang Nadim * Tun Teja * A Company Zulu Battalion Except 'Zulu', each of the companies of the 3 battalions are named after legendary heroes of Malay folklore. Each battalion has their own identity such as insignia, emblem, motto, song and war dance. Every cadet holds their battalion's pride in high spirit which can be seen during inter-battalion sports or military competition. The Hang Lekiu battalion is the battalion for foundation/basic year cadets, who are living with their own intake for a year before reporting to any one of the battalions as first year cadets. Zulu Battalion is the battalion for final year cadets prior to their commissioning. A cadet will leave their battalion to join Zulu after a batch of previous Zulu have been commissioned, usually in January. Admission Admission to the university is by applying through the Education Ministry's University Central Unit where academic qualification will be evaluated. Candidates then undergo physical, mental and leadership tests for a period of 1‚Äì3 weeks which is conducted by the Ministry of Defence.MOHE: \\"UPNM; permohonan - permohonan IPT\\", Nov 2007 =Admissions requirements= To be admitted, candidates must be between 18 and 20 years old upon entrance for the foundation level, not be married, and have no legal obligation to support a child, and be of good moral character. The process includes a university application, standardised testing, and personal references. Candidates for admission have a physical aptitude test as well as a complete physical exam, including a separate visual acuity test to be eligible for appointment, although medical waivers are available. Usually, candidates with vision uncorrectable to 20/20, as well as a range of other injuries or illnesses, will be automatically considered for a medical waiver only if they are highly competitive. =Graduation= The military graduates of the NDUM receive a bachelor's degree and are commissioned as young officers in the Army or equivalent rank in the navy or air force with an obligation to serve 10 years active service in the military. Eligibility for particular specialties (infantry, artillery, armour, engineers, etc.) is determined by academic performance and personal preference. A cadet is a first class graduate if he or she has earned a 3.70 or above Accumulated Grade Pointer Average (CPA), second class if 3.0-3.69 or third class if 2.99 and below. Each of these new officers receives their new shoulder boards in the presence of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, the commander in chief of the MAF.New Straits Times: \\"UPNM inaugural convocation; UPNM all set to celebrate first convocation\\", 8 October 2010 The civilian graduates, who also receive degrees, are guaranteed employment in private and public sector firms.

The 2008/2009 edition which was published at the end of October 2008, launched the first in an annual series, which ranked and showcased the top 20 restaurants in Asia, as well as categorised restaurants according to the city and country they are in. It is published by Singapore-based Ate Media, and officially sponsored by the German home appliance maker Miele. Other official partners include TIME Magazine, Visa Inc. and Hyatt Hotels. The guide does not accept advertising and none of the official partners have any influence on the multi-round judging process.

He is the author of six collections of poetry and three verse translations of epics by Virgil and Homer.  Biography  He was educated in local schools in Rhode Island and spent two and one half years at Our Lady of Providence Seminary in Warwick Neck, RI. From 1955 to 1959 he served with the U.S. Navy as an aircraft electrician, visiting ports in England and Greece. He then resumed his education at Assumption College in Worcester, MA, graduating in 1962, and taking the MA in English from Villanova University in 1964. He began his career as an English Professor at Providence College in September 1964, and continued graduate work at Brown University, earning the Ph.D. in the spring of 1970. He had married his first wife, Therese McNeil of Central Falls, RI, in the summer of 1959. The two had four daughters over the years, Jeanne, Julia, Joyce and Cynthia. He began publishing short poems in many literary journals in 1969 and saw his first book into print, After a Cremation, in 1974. Brief translations of Virgil's Aeneid in that first book led to further experiments. Encouraged by Robert Bly and William Arrowsmith, among others, he published a verse translation of Virgil's epic in its entirety in 1991. This Collector's Edition from Donald Grant Press having won wide acclaim, the University of Michigan Press followed with a trade and a paperback edition. He traveled widely and wrote more in Costa Rica, Europe and China, leading to the publication of his second book of poems, Needle Man, in 1999, with BrickHouse Books Press. Acupuncture was a principal focus in this work. He was soon promoted through the ranks at Providence College as a result primarily of his poetry and translations. In fact an esteemed colleague, Rodney Delasanta, by this time a nationally reputed Chaucerian, convinced his colleagues on the Rank and Tenure Committee that the publication of a single exceptional poem was worth ten good scholarly articles. Until this time his poetry had focused on family and social issues, its style lyrical and occasionally narrative. The election of George W. Bush to the U.S. Presidency in the fall of 2000, however, followed by the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on September 11, 2001, drastically changed McCrorie's outlook, his whole political and literary orientation. Concerned with dramatizing essential American values, he began a story in verse called Washington's Night, depicting the psychological, political and military pressures on George Washington in December 1776, and culminating in his victory at the Battle of Trenton on December 26. America, the poem makes clear, stresses not only military power, but the longing for political freedom and especially a fundamental fairness, the justice for which the nation has become famous. He was greatly helped in all this by his second marriage. Beatrice Beebe, whose work in New York City had explored mother-infant communication, and whose psychoanalytic practice had established her firmly in that field, was galvanized, like her husband, by the events of September 11. Her struggle to help the mothers and children who had lost their men that day would prove invaluable to her patients and, in time, to McCrorie. But first, after a ten-year effort assisted by many Greek scholars, notably the late William Wyatt of Brown University, he published a verse translation of Homer's Odyssey with The Johns Hopkins University Press in 2004. In all his translations he persisted with the idea of close approximation: not only the sense but the sound of Homer's Greek he attempted to capture in English verse. Responses to this work were highly favorable; he would soon go on to Homer's Iliad. Before then, the death of his mother prompted a number of poems in McCrorie's next book, published in 2010 by BrickHouse Books and called Gone Games. Childhood play also connects to this title, as do romances that come and go in one's adult life. In the same year McCrorie published his first chapbook, Gretchen, with BrickHouse Books, and his first e-book with Amazon by the same title. For some time he had been working on a story in verse focusing on the life and political vision of Woodrow Wilson. Gretchen Schreiber, a German-American character in this story, suffers exceedingly when the U. S., following Wilson, goes to war with Germany in 1917. Generally Wilson will try to treat Germany fairly at the end of the war, however; indeed, McCrorie's principal aim in the story is to explore the question, How shall America send her best abroad? No President before Wilson had worked so hard trying to embody an answer to this question. His League of Nations was a crowning achievement in Paris, 1919. On September 11, 2011, Beebe and other psychotherapists celebrated the tenth anniversary of their work with mothers and children who had lost their men in the World Trade Center attacks: they published, in the Journal of Infant, Child and Adolescent Psychotherapy, their 'Primary Prevention Project.' Profoundly moved by some of these chapters, McCrorie began a series of 'Pretend Ballads.' That book was published, in three separate editions, by the International Psychoanalytic Press in September, 2014. In the fall of 2012, McCrorie had published his translation of Homer's Iliad with The Johns Hopkins University Press. Again the translator's aim was to approximate closely the meaning and music of the original, especially since the very word for poet in Homer's Greek is aeidos, singer. He has often presented the work to appreciative audiences, especially at Brown University, and the translation has been highly recommended in reviews. The crisis of 2008, during which American and world economies floundered, had also turned McCrorie's attention to the Hebrew Bible. After reading Harold Bloom's essay, in which the author concluded that an English translation of the Psalms probably could not be faithful to the Hebrew and graceful as English both, McCrorie found himself powerfully drawn to the Prophecy of Jeremiah. Here was a work which warned of disaster for the Jews in the sixth century BCE and, in McCrorie's mind, portended extreme danger for his own people. Translating Jeremiah then became a work-in-progress. He finished a first draft after four years and, with help from Jewish friends like Catherine Hiller and retired Rabbi David Kline, himself a translator of Genesis, McCrorie anticipated completion of the final draft in 2017. By 1916, scientists and ordinary families worldwide had become disturbed, some even despairing, about the earth's climate change. Among the many persons and sources McCrorie consulted, three women writers stood out: Gabrielle Walker, Elizabeth Kolbert and Adrian Klein explained past evidence and exposed present dangers in air and sea temperature, levels of carbon dioxide and the likely causes, including degradation by humans. Now with a fairly good picture of Homo sapiens' evolution over the past 200,000 years, often at the cost of many species' extinction, McCrorie began a series of poems about that evolution, hoping they would lead eventually to a book. Then important changes in his family and professional life led to new experiments. Advised by his grandson, Shayne Collins, now a graduate of UCLA, residing in North Hollywood and pursuing a film career, McCrorie tried adapting some narrative poetry for the screen. Then other friends and family suggested he try creating a novel first. Called Africa Dust, that work should be finished and looking for a publisher in 2017; if successful in that form, it should stand a better chance of pleasing a film producer in Los Angeles. Another friend, Al Alvarez, had meanwhile published Pondlife in 2013. Moved by its stories of healthy swimming in ponds north of London, McCrorie wrote Soundness: Stories of Good and Better Health from Childhood to Eighty. A memoir at times, a medical resource book often, the book now makes the rounds of literary agents.

His first job behind the microphone was at CKYL Peace RiverAlberta in 1971. A year later, in 1972, he moved to the newsroom of CKIQ Kelowna. His move to CKNW Vancouver came 2 years later in 1974. He hit the Vancouver newsroom of CKNW News talk 980 as a desk/anchor newsman and worked up to Assistant News Director under the leadership of his mentor Warren Barker. During Rutherford's time at CKNW, he was instrumental in the creation of the Western Information Network (WIN), which connected British Columbia radio stations with CKNW and its own legislature bureau. Rutherford left CKNW in 1983 to head up the newsroom of CHQR AM770 Calgary. During his time at QR77 he filled a variety of management positions; Program Director, News Director and Talk Show Host. He also served as a director of RTNDA (Radio Television News Direction Association) Canada. In 1992 CHQR AM770 Calgary launched its News Talk format and Rutherford worked double duty as News Director and Talk Show Host of The Rutherford Show. A year later, after his radio show was networked across Alberta, he decided to focus completely on his role as talk show host and the development of The Rutherford Show. With his strong news background and outspoken opinion, Dave hit the hot buttons with his listeners.

It was also known as the Bedford Beagle in estate form and Bedford Roma in small campervan form. The Beagle was an officially sanctioned conversion based on the 8 cwt van, carried out by Martin Walter of Folkestone, Kent. The Beagle received rear side windows and a fold- down rear seat; leaving of luggage space with the seat in use.Olyslager, p. 4 __TOC__ History 1968 Bedford HA The Bedford HA was extremely popular with utility companies in the United Kingdom, particularly the Post Office, British Rail,https://www.flickr.com/photos/albertsbite/2814261324/ electricity boards, British Telecom, and British Gas. Many other firms such as British European Airways, DER rental, and Meals on Wheels services had large fleets as well. It was the inspiration for Postman Pat's original van. It was originally available in 6 cwt and heavier duty 8 cwt models (payloads of ), with the chassis codes HAE and HAV respectively. Gross vehicle weights were respectively. The 8 cwt had a heavier rear axle, bigger tyres, and a sixth leaf in the rear springs. The 8 cwt was generally better equipped, offering a number of chromed trim parts (bumpers, mirrors, etcetera) and slightly plusher interior fittings. By 1971 the 6 cwt had been downgraded further yet, and now only came with a driver's seat as standard. A fold-down rear seat was available as an option.What has a Bedford HA van got..., p. 4 By the late seventies, the denominations had been changed to HA 110 and HA 130 respectively, with payload ratings of .Bedford HA range (1977), p. 2 In September 1964, for the 1965 model year, the Viva and HA Van received minor changes such as a quicker steering rack, new door trim, and a modified choke control.Olyslager, p. 5 In Australia, the Bedford HA was sold as the \\"Bedford Handi-Van\\" from 1964 until 1970. Engines The early version had a lower compression ratio than the Viva saloon (7.3:1 rather than the usual 8.5:1), producing gross, or net, both at 5200 rpm.Olyslager, p. 7 In 1967, the HA received the engine of the changed Viva. This was essentially the same as the earlier powerplant; although net power was down to a claimed at 4600 rpm. It ran on the lowest rated fuel and was fitted with a -bore carburettor for even higher fuel mileage.What has a Bedford HA van got..., pp. 3, 14 The later models powered by the 1256 cc engine offered gross at 5400 rpm, or net at 4600 rpm. By 1977 only net horsepower ratings were offered, with power up to at 4800 rpm. As for all three generations of HAs, the compression ratio remained 7.3 to 1. For the lighter duty HA 110 there was also an 'Economy' version, with a CD carburettor (constant depression), a redesigned manifold, and a different camshaft. This version offered up to 30% lower fuel consumption, although power did drop to at 3800 rpm. 1978 Walker Bodies Bedford HA pick up The HA soldiered on in production for twenty years, until 1983, where it was supplanted by the short lived Vauxhall Chevette based Bedford Chevanne which was in turn replaced by the Bedford Astravan / Bedford Astramax. Despite the fact that the Vauxhall Viva upon which it was based had gone through two further model generations, the bodywork of the HA van stayed the same until its eventual discontinuation in 1983. The engine arrived in 1967, followed by a in 1972. A pickup was also made by Martin Walter (Dormobile) - who also made the Beagle conversion - and by Walker Bodies of Watford. Made in very small numbers (believed to be around 60 in total) only a handful of these survive today: they were originally sold to companies and private buyers directly through Vauxhall/Bedford dealerships.  The BTV GM Amigo in Costa Rica In the early 1970s there were a number of basic vehicles developed for the developing world. Volkswagen (EA489), Citro√´n (FAF), and many others including General Motors tried to create cheap and basic transport which could be manufactured locally with a minimal up-front investment. GM's effort was developed by General Motors Overseas Operations (GMOO) and was called the BTV (\\"Basic Transportation Vehicle\\"). It was marketed under a variety of names depending on where it was built. The little truck has a simple body made up entirely of flat surfaces placed atop a basic frame, while most mechanicals and what interior there was derived from the HA. It also uses the HA's 1256 cc low compression engine, here with , which together with some of the other more complex elements was sent from Vauxhall's Luton plant. The BTV was at one time or another manufactured in Malaysia (as the Bedford Harimau, this was the first iteration to be manufactured, from May 1972), Costa Rica (Amigo), Ecuador (Andino), Paraguay (GM Mita√≠), the Philippines (Amigo), Portugal (Amigo), and in Surinam as the Moetete 1200/1300. It was also available in Indonesia in 1977 and 1978, with slightly different bodywork, as the Morina (without a company name). While Vauxhalls were unusual in Indonesia, the Morina's engine had been used in the Holden Torana (LJ and TA series), which was popular as a taxi in Jakarta. The Morina was built by General Motors' local subsidiary P.T. Garuda Diesel, and power was claimed to be SAE. \\"Morina\\" is a portmanteau for MObil Rakyat INdonesiA (Indonesian People's Car). A restored GM Amigo in Portugal The Ecuadorean Andino entered production in 1973 and continued until 1976. The Paraguayan Mita√≠ had its own bodywork which fully enveloped the front wheels, and was only available in red, white, or blue - the colors of their flag. Production was also planned for Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, Guatemala, and certain other countries. Some sources state that no more than 3000 BTVs were built across the world. General Motors also built another basic vehicle in the 1970s, the South African Chevrolet Nomad.

Parker, the fifth in his Jesse Stone series. Plot summary In his grittiest investigation to date, Jesse Stone hunts for the killer of a woman whose body washes up on shore. The woman turns out to be Florence ‚ÄúFlo‚Äù Horvath, of Miami, Florida. She was pushed off a boat, then run over; knocking her unconscious and causing her to drown. The investigation comes to a halt shortly after she is identified, until Jesse acquires a tape of Flo having sex with two men at the same time. He also discovers that Flo rented a boat before she was murdered, but that it was returned to the wrong place. During the investigation he is led to the yacht ‚ÄúThe Lady Jane.‚Äù He questions the yacht owner Harrison Darnell, and the other occupants, who of course all deny knowing Flo. In an attempt to get more information, Jesse sneaks onto the yacht and finds a stack of sex tapes. He takes one and reviews it, and although it is sexual in nature, he does not find anything criminal. Later seventeen-year-old Cathleen Holten comes to Chief Stone with accusations of rape. She claims that a man took her onto his yacht, The Lady Jane, forces her to strip for his friends and then rapes her in his cabin. Although, Jesse does not believe her, and the rape later proves to be consensual sex, he uses this opportunity to get a warrant and search the yacht. Having been there before he goes right for the video tapes and confiscates them. While reviewing them with Molly, she recognizes her daughter's fifteen-year-old friend as one of the sex partners. Although Jesse now has the yacht owner for statutory rape, he continues to investigate, determined to get the murderer. However, in the end he does have him and another man arrested for statutory rape. He next finds one of the men in Flo's sex tape and discovers that the men in the tape were brothers. He reveals that it was Flo's sisters that made the tape. He next interviews Flo's sisters, twins Claudia and Corless. They tell Jesse they learned of Flo's death from their friend Kimmie Young. They also tell him that they made the tape to make Flo's boyfriend, Harrison Darnell, jealous. Jesse strikes up a partnership with Miami detective Kelly Cruz, and has her interview Flo's parents and Kimmie. Although Flo's parents seem harmless, Kimmie tells Cruz that she had no idea that Flo was dead. She later tells Cruz that Flo's father raped her when she was fifteen and routinely had sex with all three of his daughters. Kelly Cruz also interviews Darnell's private pilot and discovers that he flew her to Boston a few days before her murder. Finally Chief Stone discovers through Flo's father's E-ZPass that he drove to Boston the week that she was murdered, although he denies the trip. After discovering this, Jesse flies down to Miami where he and Kelly Cruz confront him about the trip. His wife, in a drunken rage, accuses him of murdering their daughter and he confesses. Jesse later speculates that Flo's father had her rent a boat, pushed her off of it, then returns it to the first place he sees, explaining why it had been returned to the wrong place. He responds that he did indeed argue with her on the boat, and push her off, but that she simply drowned unbeknownst to him. After he discovered she had died he denied the trip all together fearing that he would be accused of murder. Jesse later asks the twins why they said they learned of Flo's death from Kimmie, because had they not said that he may have never suspected their father. They claim to not remember saying Kimmie. Jesse speculates that they may have subconsciously wanted their father caught. The twins also reveal that the sex tape was not made for Flo's boyfriend, but for their father. It is this tape that causes him to fly into a jealous rage and drive up to Boston to murder her. Having all seen the tape, it causes the twins and their mother all to suspect that he murdered Flo.Parker, Robert B. (2006). Sea Change. New York, New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons. Subplots Jesse stopped drinking by the end of Stone Cold, and continues his sobriety throughout this novel. At the end of the novel, on his one-year anniversary of sobriety, Jesse decides he can now drink in moderation. Furthermore, Jenn moves in with him and they finally commit to a monogamous relationship with each other. Film Differences The film plot is drastically different from the novel, with the title nearly the only similarity. Cathleen's apparent rape, revealed to be consensual, is the only significant plot detail maintained in the film, though relegated to a subplot. Reception The novel received a positive response from the majority of critics, including Publishers Weekly, who described the dialogue as \\"witty, flirtatious, droll, and sexually charged\\".

Theatre NO99 was a theatre in Tallinn, Estonia that began to operate in February 2005. It was a state-owned repertoire theatre that has its own building with two theatre halls in central Tallinn. The theatre closed in 2019. The name of the theatre was NO99, although it has no connection with classical No Theatre. NO is an abbreviation of the word ‚Äúnumber‚Äù and 99 has decreased by one with each new production. Description The theatre‚Äôs artistic director was Tiit Ojasoo, and Ene-Liis Semper is the chief stage designer-director. The troupe consisted of 10 actors, eight men and two women. The theatre produced two to four new stage productions for the large hall every season. In addition, co-production projects (for example, with the theatre school) premiered in the small hall. Drama productions were staged primarily in the large hall. They aspired towards artistic exactingness and social relevance. Texts were often composed by the directors themselves (or in cooperation with actors). Adaptations of film screenplays have been produced on several occasions. In some cases, finished drama texts have also been brought to the stage. Some of the authors that have been produced are McDonagh, Kurosawa, Tarkovski, Jarry, Mishima, Chekhov, Shakespeare, and others. In addition to productions in the large and small halls, plays have been staged in the open air as well: in an old swimming pool (Seven Samurais), and in three abandoned airplane hangars (King Ubu). The theatre also organised so called one-time \\"actions\\", in which the success or failure of a somewhat crazy idea is tested. In addition to Ojasoo and Semper, other Estonian directors also directed plays in the theatre, as do guests from abroad (for example, Sebastian Hartmann, Aleksander Pepeljajev). Guest actors from other theatres also participated in NO99 productions. Awards The theatre won several national and also international festival awards for productions, and for stage design and acting. Several productions have been invited to participate in international festivals in Austria (Wiener Festwochen), Germany, Russia, Switzerland, Poland, Russia, Finland, Lithuania, and other countries. The theatre has also issued several publications as an extension of its activities.

Hill, S.J. (1917-1985) was a leader of the campaign against pornography in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. He was one of the founders of Morality in Media, which was created in 1962 to fight pornography. President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed him to the President's Commission on Obscenity and Pornography. Believing that the Commission was stacked with supporters of loosening laws on pornography, Hill and another clergyman on the Commission, Dr. Winfrey C. Link, issued the Hill-Link Minority Report rebutting the conclusions of the majority report, which held that pornography should be decriminalized as there were no links between it and criminal behavior. Issued in 1970, the majority report was rejected by both President Richard Nixon and the United States Congress. The Hill-Link Report, which recommended maintaining anti-obscenity statutes, was read into the record of both the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives. It was cited by the Burger Court in its 1973 obscenity decisions, including Miller v. California. According to the Morality in Media site, Hill was influential in the Reagan Administration's efforts against pornography. In March 1983, he headed a coalition of groups spearheading the anti-pornography movement that met with President Reagan at the White House. Hill and his allies recommended that the President appoint an anti-pornography czar to coordinate the federal government's efforts to crack down on porn. The Morality in Media site states, \\"As a result of this meeting, a White House Working Group on Pornography was formed in June of 1983, and in December, President Reagan addressed the nation's U.S. Attorneys and called for tighter enforcement of the laws.\\" References in popular culture Father Hill debated novelist Gore Vidal on the David Susskind Show on March 17, 1968, in a program called \\"Read Any Dirty Books Lately?\\" The previous year, Vidal had published a #1 best-selling novel, Myra Breckenridge, which many considered pornographic. In the sequel to the book, Myron Vidal used Father Hill's name as a euphemism for a \\"dirty word\\" in order to conform to the U.S. Supreme Court's Miller v. California decision that enshrined \\"community standards\\" as the legal test for pornography. Sources *Obscenity.crimes.org, \\"FR. MORTON A.

The program began in 1958 as Open End, which referred to the fact that the program was open-ended, with no set scheduled end or timeslot restrictions. In this form, the program would continue until Susskind or his guests had felt the conversation had run its full course, or were exhausted and ended the episode by mutual agreement. Overview Susskind's interview of Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, which aired on October 9, 1960, during the height of the Cold War, generated national attention. Susskind and Khrushchev discussed Soviet-U.S. relations, state sovereignty, the United Nations, the unification of Germany, and other topics in world affairs. It is one of the very few talk show telecasts from that era that was preserved and can be viewed today.Battaglio, Stephen. David Susskind: A Televised Life. New York: St. Martin's Press, 2010Krushchev interview via Internet Archive In 1961, Open End began to be confined to a set two-hour timeslot, and went into national syndication through WNEW-TV in New York, which utilized its sister Metromedia stations to expand the program's reach before a national rollout. Susskind did a two-hour interview including commercials with Martin Luther King, Jr. in 1963, two months before the civil rights leader delivered his \\"I Have a Dream\\" speech. The New York Times reported what it considered the highlight of the interview on its front page: \\"The civil rights approach of the Kennedy Administration as compared with that of the Eisenhower Administration has merely substituted 'an inadequate approach for a miserable one,' the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. declared yesterday.\\" Few people have seen the video, which belongs to Historic Films Archive, since 1963.http://www.historicfilms.com/tapes/19960 The title of Susskind's talk show was changed from Open End to The David Susskind Show for its telecast on Sunday night, October 2, 1966. Shows would occasionally tape in Los Angeles, at the studios of KCOP-TV. On October 10, 1971, the show invited seven lesbian women to be on a panel for a segment called \\"Women Who Love Women‚Äù. The lesbians included Barbara Gittings, Lilli Vincenz, and Barbara Love. They were among the first open lesbians to appear on television in the US, and debated long-held stereotypes about gays with Susskind.Bullough, Vern, ed. (2002) Before Stonewall: Activists for gay and lesbian rights in historical context. Page 247. Harrington Park Press; This segment is remembered for Gittings saying, \\"Homosexuals today are taking it for granted that their homosexuality is not at all something dreadful ‚Äì it‚Äôs good, it‚Äôs right, it‚Äôs natural, it‚Äôs moral, and this is the way they are going to be!\\".Barnhurst, K. G. (2007). Media Q: Media/queered: Visibility and its discontents. New York: Peter Lang. In May 1973, to acknowledge Digestive Disease Week, the show invited three gastroenterologists to discuss therapies for peptic ulcer. Viewer William Dufty had bet that \\"These three distinguished specialists could go on for the entire ninety minutes without ever mentioning the word sugar.\\" Afterward he noted, \\"In ninety minutes, they were unable to come up with a single constructive suggestion for the average person to manage their diet in a way that might prevent ulcers.\\"William Dufty (1975) Sugar Blues, pp 184 to 7 A December 16, 1981 debate on chiropractic had as participants, among others, Stephen Barrett, a psychiatrist, consumer activist, medical writer and skeptic nowadays mostly known as the webmaster of Quackwatch, and Chester Wilk, a chiropractor who was the plaintiff in Wilk v. American Medical Ass'n. The show continued until September 1986, at which point WNEW-TV, now under the ownership of Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation and beginning the transition to being the flagship of the new commercial network Fox, had moved the program to an late Sunday-to-early Monday timeslot, albeit still filling two hours. Susskind chose to end the program himself, six months before his death from a heart attack .Battaglio, Stephen. David Susskind: A Televised Life. New York: St. Martin's Press, 2010 As the successor to Metromedia and WNEW-TV, Fox and WNYW maintain much of the series' archives.

Schools have used Ashokan's \\"classroom\\" of forests, waterfalls, stream-fed ponds, and open meadows for over 40 years. Music camps, blacksmithing conferences, and retreat groups have called Ashokan home while schools are not in residence. The name Ashokan means \\"place of many fishes\\" or \\"where waters converge\\". The location was the inspiration for Jay Ungar's song \\"Ashokan Farewell\\", which was used as the theme music for PBS's The Civil War.. In 2019 it was listed on the NRHP.  History  The first homesteaders on the land were a third generation Dutchman named Jacobus Bush and his wife, Eycke Vandermerke, born in Marbletown, Ulster County, New York in 1692 and 1687 respectively. Jacobus Jr. and his wife Annetje Merkel recorded their ownership on a deed of remembrance in 1762. In 1755, his brother Thomas and his wife's sister Elizabeth built a homestead a few hundred yards up the road. This is the house from which his son Fredrick's children were kidnapped by Tory inspired \\"Indians\\". Thomas was an outspoken proponent of the patriot cause. This was the frontier during the American Revolutionary War and it was a common practice for Tories and their Indian allies to raid frontier homes. It had become such a problem that General Washington authorized the building of a fort at Shokan, now under the waters of the Ashokan Reservoir. The property was owned and operated by SUNY New Paltz's College Auxiliary Service as the Ashokan Field Campus from 1967 until 2008. The land was sold in 2008 to the Open Space Conservancy, part of the Open Space Institute. The property was divided with a portion sold to the New York City Department of Environmental Protection and the rest to the non- profit Ashokan Foundation. The Ashokan Foundation continues to support and develop environmental education programs for schools in partnership with non- profit partner the Ashokan Center. Additionally Ashokan's Music & Dance Camps for adults and families have remained in continuous operation since 1980 and additional new arts programs are currently in the works.  Geology  The story of Ashokan begins over 400 million years ago during the Devonian Period. The vastly swollen Esopus Creek struggled to find its present path through Ashokan which was well-blocked by glacial moraine. Winchell's Falls and Cathedral Gorge are relatively recent (past ten-thousand years) features. The newly uncovered till (glacial soil) was rocky and sterile, and much like northern Canada today. It was covered by tundra where feeding mammoths and other ice age mammals migrated along the un-crossable Esopus. As the climate continued to warm, the open landscape gave way to spruce and fir of the boreal forest. Mastodons and woodland caribou took over the trail blazing begun by earlier mammals. At some point during this time, the first people entered the area hunting the ice-age \\"mega-fauna\\". Evidence of these first people is scant in this area, but they undoubtedly followed the game trails along the Esopus.

The band was composed of Till, pianist Richard Bell, bassist Brad Campbell, drummer Clark Pierson, and organist Ken Pearson.\\"Full Title Boogie Band,\\" Canadian Classic Rock Page, retrieved June 22, 2008. In its original late 1960s incarnation, the Full Tillt Boogie Band (the two \\"Ls\\" being a play on the spelling of Till's last name), Till fronted the group as a side project from his usual gigs as a New York City studio musician. Like Till, the other members of Full Tillt were Canadians, mostly hailing from Stratford and Woodstock, Ontario, Canada. Richard Bell was recruited by Michael Friedman back stage at a Ronnie Hawkins gig at the Filmore East in 1969. Friedman was Albert Grossman's assistant at the time. He went backstage after the gig and approached Bell. Ronnie Hawkins got wind of it and almost got into a fight with Friedman. When Joplin's management convinced her to discard Big Brother and the Holding Company as her backing band, her record label put together a new group of musicians for her. This group, dubbed the Kozmic Blues Band, consisted of Till and several other Full Tillt Boogie Band members ‚Äî all studio musicians whom her label was familiar with and felt were reliable ‚Äî plus a horn section. Joplin was not happy touring with some of the group members, however, feeling them to be too \\"square\\", and the disappointing reviews of their 1969 album I Got Dem Ol' Kozmic Blues Again Mama! led her to scrap everyone in the group except Till. Till soon convinced Joplin to hire his Full Tillt Boogie band in its entirety, and he agreed to drop one of the \\"L's\\" from its name, thus creating Joplin's Full Tilt Boogie backing band. Joplin took a more active role in putting together the Full Tilt Boogie Band than she had with the Kozmic Blues Band, and she believed that hiring the remainder of Till's band would provide her with the powerhouse boogie outfit she needed to back her. Joplin was quoted as saying, \\"Full Tilt Boogie Band is my band. Finally, it's my band!\\" Full Tilt played their first session with Joplin on April 4, 1970, at the Fillmore West studios in San Francisco and began touring in May 1970. From June 28 to July 4, 1970, Joplin and Full Tilt joined the all-star Festival Express tour through Canada, performing alongside the Grateful Dead, Delaney and Bonnie, Rick Danko and The Band, Eric Andersen, and Ian & Sylvia. They played concerts in Toronto, Winnipeg, and Calgary. The Full Tilt Boogie Band's last public performance took place on August 12, 1970, at Harvard Stadium in Boston, Massachusetts. A positive review appeared on the front page of the Harvard Crimson newspaper despite the fact that the band performed with makeshift sound amplifiers after their regular equipment was stolen in Boston. During September 1970, Full Tilt and Joplin began recording a new album in Los Angeles with producer Paul A. Rothchild, who had produced recordings for The Doors. Although Joplin died before all the tracks were fully completed, there was still enough usable material to compile an LP, which became Pearl.

The heroes battle an immensely powerful being shrouded in darkness, ultimately revealed to be the ancient ruler of Apokolips, Darkseid. Plot In the 30th century, Legion of Super-Heroes co-founder Cosmic Boy leads a group of Legionnaires to investigate attacks on the Museum of the Mystic Arts and the Tower of London, both located on Earth. Included in the squad is 20th-century member Superboy (the legendary Superman as a teenager) and the latest addition to the team‚ÄîJacques Foccart, the new Invisible Kid.The original Invisible Kid, Lyle Norg, was killed by Validus in Superboy #203 (July/August 1974).Jacques Foccart acquired the power of invisibility and joined the Legion in Legion of Super-Heroes vol. 2, Annual #1 (1982). At each site they are attacked by beings of great power, both of whom are shrouded in darkness and mention that they are servants of their \\"Master\\" who controls the \\"Great Darkness\\". Through the use of a teleportation warp, the beings escape with two stolen items: a mystical wand from the museum and the sword Excalibur from the Tower of London.

Shortly thereafter on the prison planet Takron-Galtos, the Legionnaires discover that the Time Trapper ‚Äî another powerful Legion foe ‚Äî has been drained of his cosmic time-manipulation abilities by the Master as well.The Time Trapper depicted in this story is actually an imposter, as later revealed in Legionnaires 3 #1 (February 1986). Dream Girl's precognitive abilities allow her to foresee the Servants attacking her sister, the sorceress known as the White Witch, on their homeworld Naltor. She and a squad of Legionnaires travel there and prevent one of the Servants from kidnapping the White Witch. During the attack, Invisible Kid seizes the opportunity to journey into one of the beings' teleportation warps and take the battle directly to the Master. He confronts the Master, who is amused by the notion that the young hero is presumptuous enough to confront him. The Master blasts him with energy beams from his eyes, and warps him back to Naltor. Having seen the Master's real face, Invisible Kid is frightened on such a fundamental level that a large stripe of his jet black hair turns white permanently. In the midst of the crisis, the Legion holds its long-delayed election, choosing Dream Girl as its new leader. She leads a squad of Legionnaires to the Sorcerers' World, where they repel an attack by the Master and several of his Servants. Mon-El confronts the Master directly and immediately recognizes him, but is easily defeated. The Master then reads his mind, learning that Mon-El recognized him because of all that the Legionnaire witnessed during his many centuries in the Phantom Zone.The Phantom Zone, a dimension used by the planet Krypton as a prison, was introduced in Adventure Comics #283 (April 1961). Phantom Zone inmates do not age, do not require sustenance to survive, and are able to observe events occurring anywhere in the regular universe.Mon-El spent a thousand years in the Phantom Zone to avoid dying after being exposed to lead, which is fatal to natives of the planet Daxam. ‚Äì Superboy #89 (June 1961); Adventure Comics #305 (February 1963). Additionally, the Master learns of Mon-El's homeworld, Daxam. The sorcerers cast a spell intended to defend them against the Master, and they surprisingly conjure a humanoid baby. Meanwhile, on Earth, the three Legion founders (Cosmic Boy, Saturn Girl and Lightning Lad) determine that two of the Servants are reverse-DNA clones of Superman and one of the Guardians of the Universe. Shocked that the Master is able to clone and harness the power of two of the mightiest beings in history, the founders send out a general alarm, calling all active and reserve Legionnaires to duty. The Legionnaires manage to locate what turns out to be the Master's homeworld. Engaging the Servants in battle, Wildfire destroys the Guardian clone, while Element Lad exposes the Superman clone to gold kryptonite,The first in-continuity appearance of gold kryptonite occurs in Superman #157 (November 1962). In pre-Crisis continuity, it robs Kryptonians of their powers permanently. Following the Infinite Crisis limited series, the effect is only temporary, wearing off after fifteen seconds. ‚Äì Action Comics Annual #11 (2007); Supergirl vol. 5, #37 (March 2009) allowing Timber Wolf to destroy him. Afterward, Brainiac 5 recognizes the Master‚Äôs homeworld, and is able to deduce his true identity. Meanwhile, the Master has travelled to Daxam. Having added the powers of Mordru, the Time Trapper and others to his own abilities, he transposes Daxam with his own homeworld. Consequently, Daxam's three billion natives each gain powers equal to those of Superman or Mon-El, and all of them fall under the thrall of the Master, who is determined to conquer the entire universe. At the villain's command, the Daxamites use their powers to physically reshape the planet until it has been sculpted in the image of the Master himself: the ancient New Gods tyrant, Darkseid. Brainiac 5 is the only Legionnaire (other than Mon-El) with any knowledge of Darkseid or his homeworld, Apokolips. Once he briefs Dream Girl, she sends out a second general alarm to all of the Legion's super- powered allies, including Supergirl (who resides in the 20th century) and the Legion of Substitute Heroes. Throughout United Planets territory, the Kryptonian intelligence agent Dev-Em, the Heroes of Lallor, the Wanderers, the Substitute Heroes and the Legionnaires all struggle to hold back the onslaught of attacking Daxamites. On Takron-Galtos, a de-powered Chameleon Boy fends off an attack from a Daxamite child by using judo to toss him into a cell with Validus, the mysterious childlike creature who is the most powerful member of the Fatal Five.Chameleon Boy was convicted of treason after leading an unauthorized Espionage Squad mission to Khundia which results in war. ‚Äì Legion of Super-Heroes vol. 2, #286‚Äì289 (April‚ÄìJuly 1982).The Daxamite child, Ol-Vir, would subsequently join the Legion of Super-Villains. ‚Äì Legion of Super-Heroes vol. 3, #1 (August 1984). As the humanoid child inexplicably ages at an accelerated rate, the White Witch casts a spell transporting the people on Daxam to Apokolips and vice versa. She is forcibly aided by a powerful unknown entity. When Darkseid tries to seize the child, the entity completes the aging process and reveals itself to be Darkseid's ancient enemy Izaya, Highfather of the New Gods from the planet New Genesis. Highfather transforms the last remaining Servant into a perfect clone of Darkseid‚Äôs son Orion, who is destined to someday destroy his father.The prophecy of Darkseid's death at the hands of Orion is first mentioned in Mister Miracle #9 (August 1972). Before fading into nothingness, Highfather summons Superboy and Supergirl to the battlefield above Apokolips, with his power allowing the Kryptonian cousins to maintain their abilities under a red sun. Darkseid destroys the Orion clone and sends Superboy back to the 20th century. He then becomes so preoccupied with battling Supergirl and the other Legionnaires that he loses mental control of the Daxamites, who begin to make their way toward the planet. Realizing that he cannot defeat three billion Daxamites, Darkseid concedes defeat and vanishes, taking Apokolips with him. As he departs, he declares that he has left the Legionnaires with the \\"curse of darkness\\" which will destroy them from within, promising \\"that which is purest of you shall be the first to go.\\" In the aftermath of the crisis, the White Witch is inducted into the Legion, while Light Lass decides to quit. =Epilogue= Months later, a pregnant Saturn Girl goes into labor on the hospital satellite Medicus One, preparing to give birth to the child she shares with her husband Lightning Lad. During the delivery, the satellite is mysteriously enshrouded in darkness, but Saturn Girl gives birth to a healthy baby boy. She is thrilled but slightly surprised, for during her pregnancy she occasionally thought that she was sensing two brain patterns. Unknown to anyone, there was a second child. During the delivery, Darkseid secretly kidnapped the infant and used his power to radically transform the child and send him years into the past, where he would encounter the Legion as Validus, unrecognized by his parents or anyone else.Validus first appears in Adventure Comics #352 (January 1967). Thus, Darkseid declares triumphantly that his curse is fulfilled.The birth of the twins and the second twin's abduction and transformation into Validus occurs in Legion of Super-Heroes vol. 2, Annual #3 (1984), by Paul Levitz (co- plotter/writer), Keith Giffen (co-plotter/artist), Curt Swan and Romeo Tanghal (artists).Some time later, Saturn Girl and Lightning Lad discover Validus' true identity, and Darkseid restores him to normal. ‚Äì Legion of Super-Heroes vol. 3, Annual #2 (1986). Continuity Following the events of the Zero Hour mini-series, this storyline and all other Legion stories predating October 1994 were removed from continuity. However, a new incarnation of the original Legion was introduced in 2007, in \\"The Lightning Saga\\" storyline in the Justice League of America and Justice Society of America titles. DC writer Geoff Johns later stated that this incarnation of the Legion shares the same history as the original Legion up to the events of Crisis on Infinite Earths, including the events of \\"The Great Darkness Saga\\".Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds #3 (April 2009) Moreover, when DC released its post-Infinite Crisis version of Darkseid's origin in 2008, \\"The Great Darkness Saga\\" was listed as one of the character's \\"essential storylines\\",Countdown to Final Crisis #2 (April 16, 2008). strongly suggesting that the events of this tale were included in post-Infinite Crisis continuity. Additionally, a subsequent Legion tale explicitly referred to \\"The Great Darkness Saga\\" in general, and Darkseid's victory over Mordru (on the planet Avalon) in particular.Legion of Super-Heroes vol. 6, #4 (October 2010). Validus and the other Fatal Five members were among the villains in Superboy-Prime's incarnation of the Legion of Super-Villains, as seen in the Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds mini- series. However, Garridan Ranzz (the infant who was abducted by Darkseid in the original continuity) was recently depicted as a young child living with his parents Saturn Girl and Lightning Lad, and his twin brother Graym.Legion of Super-Heroes vol. 6, #1 (July 2010). Thus, it appears that Validus and Garridan are not the same being in current continuity. During one of his missions to protect the timeline, Booster Gold arrived on Daxam at the beginning of the Great Darkness Saga‚Äîhe was meant to arrive there three days before the war began, but misread his instructions‚Äîin order to recover the helmet of Doctor Fate to prevent Darkseid acquiring it. He departed Daxam along with Rani, an orphan girl who became his adopted daughter.Booster Gold vol. 2, #32 (July 2010). In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, there appears to have been little (if any) effect on this story arc, and the tale is still firmly within current continuity. In a New 52 Legion story, a Daxamite official remarked that the people of his world \\"still mourn how Darkseid used us for violence\\",Legion of Super-Heroes vol. 7, #3 (January 2012). an apparent reference to the events of \\"The Great Darkness Saga\\". In a subsequent tale, the Legion was confronted with a massive interplanetary crisis. Cosmic Boy described it by exclaiming that \\"[t]he Legion hasn't faced anything this awful on so many worlds since the Great Darkness!\\" In her response to his statement, Shadow Lass similarly mentions Darkseid, the Servants and the rampage of the enthralled Daxamites.Legion of Super-Heroes vol. 7, #18 (May 2013). Collected editions The story is collected in the trade paperback Legion of Super- Heroes: The Great Darkness Saga (). First printed in 1989, it includes a 7-page prologue from issue #287 and the epilogue from Annual #3, and a replica of a team poster from the same period. A second printing was released in August 2002. A hardcover \\"Deluxe Edition\\" was published in November 2010 (), including issues before and after the main \\"Saga\\" (#284‚Äì296 and Annual #1), but excluding the epilogue story and poster. The hardcover also includes the script for the first part and character designs by Giffen. DC has announced a trade paperback edition shipping February 2013. Reception The story has been called by Medium as \\"the franchise‚Äôs most significant story\\". It also hailed the saga as helping with the development of how Darkseid was view by showing that he was \\"capable of anchoring a massive, complex plot as the uber- antagonist.\\" Gizmodo has stated that the story \\"made the Legion of Super- Heroes one of the best-selling franchises of the early '80s.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Category:Comics by Keith Giffen Category:Comics by Paul Levitz ","title":"The Great Darkness Saga"},{"id":"17992351","text":"WREA-LP (104.9 FM, \\"Radio Redentor\\") is a radio station licensed to serve Holyoke, Massachusetts.

The regiment was part of Thomas Cobb's brigade at the Battle of Fredericksburg.  Organization  The 24th Infantry Regiment, organized during the summer of 1861, recruited its members in Franklin, White, Banks, Towns, Rabun, Gwinnett, Elbert, Hall, and Habersham counties. The field officers were Colonels Robert McMillan and C. C. Sanders, Lieutenant Colonels Joseph N. Chandler and Thomas E. Winn, and Majors Robert E. McMillan and Frederick C. Smith. After serving in the Department of North Carolina, the unit moved to Virginia where it was brigaded under Generals Howell Cobb, T. R. R. Cobb, Wofford, and DuBose.  Service record  The 24th Infantry Regiment fought in the difficult campaigns of the Army of Northern Virginia from the Seven Days Battles to Gettysburg, then moved to Georgia with Longstreet. The 24th was not engaged at Chickamauga, but did see action in the Knoxville Campaign. The regiment returned to Virginia and participated in the conflicts at The Wilderness, Spotsylvania, and Cold Harbor, was active in the Shenandoah Valley, and ended the war at Appomattox. Soon after being mustered into Confederate service the regiment was moved to Lynchburg, Virginia. Within a week of arriving there, however, it was ordered to Goldsborough, North Carolina. There it joined the Department of North Carolina. The unit remained there until early in 1862. Returning to Virginia, the unit was placed in the Army of Northern Virginia. It served in that army until the summer of 1863. At that time it was moved to Georgia where it served in the Army of Tennessee. It next saw service in the Department of East Tennessee. In the spring of 1864 the regiment returned to the Army of Northern Virginia, remaining in that army until mid-summer 1864. It then moved to the Shenandoah Valley where it served in the Army of the Valley District. Finally, in December 1864, the unit returned to the Army of Northern Virginia, serving in that army for the remainder of the war.

Its regulations are compiled in title 28 of the New York City Rules. The Department is headed by a Commissioner, who is appointed by and reports directly to the Mayor. The current Commissioner of HPD is Louise Carroll, who was appointed by Mayor Bill de Blasio in May 2019.https://www1.nyc.gov/office- of-the-mayor/news/232-19/mayor-de-blasio-appoints-louise-carroll-commissioner- the-department-housing-preservation Former Commissioners have included Maria Torres-Springer, Vicki Been, Jerilyn Perine, Richard Roberts and Shaun Donovan, among others. HPD is headquartered in Lower Manhattan, and includes smaller branch offices in each of the city's five boroughs. Overview Established in 1978 in the wake of Local Law 45 of 1976, the Department is the largest municipal developer of affordable housing in the United States. HPD is currently in the midst of New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio's Housing New York initiative to create and preserve 300,000 units of affordable housing by 2026. In Fiscal Year 2017, The City of New York financed more than 32,116 affordable homes, breaking the all-time record previously set by former Mayor Ed Koch in 1989. = Third Party Transfer program = The Third Party Transfer program (TPT) was started in 1996 under Giuliani's administration to let the Department of Housing and Preservation (DHP) transfer ‚Äúderelict, tax- delinquent buildings to nonprofits that could rehabilitate and manage them‚Äù, ostensibly for working-class people, freeing the city from ownership, or responsibility for tenants. The DHP followed a rule selecting ‚Äúevery other building in the same tax block with a lien‚Äîeven for a few hundred dollars‚Äù‚Äîif even one was picked for TPT. The TPT was characterized by Mayor Bill de Blasio's administration as ‚Äúa tool for taking over \\"distressed properties\\" in \\"blighted\\" areas‚Äù. The report, however, holds that characterization is held in tension with its findings which implicated malfeasance by both NYC's HPD and the Department of Finance (DOF), detailing how the agencies were ‚Äútargeting and taking of numerous Black and Brown owned properties, and thus stripping these communities of millions of dollars of generational wealth‚Äù. According to Ritchie Torres, ‚ÄúTPT is quite different from and far harsher than a typical foreclosure from the perspective of a property owner. If you are the target of a foreclosure, you get a share of the proceeds from the sale of your property. Under TPT, the city can completely strip you of all the equity in your property‚Äù. The TPT process strips the minority owner of: the property; its value; and mitigates the sweat equity, and resources invested; all with no compensation.

The house was commissioned by Margaret Stonborough-Wittgenstein, who asked the architect Paul Engelmann to design a townhouse for her. Stonborough- Wittgenstein invited her brother, the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein, to help with the design.  Commission  In November 1925 Stonborough-Wittgenstein commissioned Engelmann to design a large townhouse. She later invited her brother, Ludwig Wittgenstein, to help with the design, in part to distract him from the scandal surrounding the Haidbauer incident in April 1926: Wittgenstein, while working as a primary-school teacher, had hit a boy who had subsequently collapsed. Wittgenstein worked on Haus Wittgenstein between 1926 and 1929. The initial architect was Paul Engelmann, someone Wittgenstein had come to know while training to be an artillery officer in Olomouc. Engelmann designed a spare modernist house after the style of Adolf Loos: three rectangular blocks. Wittgenstein showed a great interest in the project and in Engelmann's plans and poured himself into the project for over two years, to such a degree that Engelmann himself considered Wittgenstein the author of the final product. He focused on the windows, doors, door knobs, and radiators, demanding that every detail be exactly as he specified, to the point where everyone involved in the project was exhausted. When the house was nearly finished, he had a ceiling raised 30 mm so that the room had the exact proportions he wanted.Jeffries, Stuart. \\"A dwelling for the gods\\", The Guardian, 5 January 2002. One of the architects, Jacques Groag, wrote in a letter: \\"I come home very depressed with a headache after a day of the worst quarrels, disputes, vexations, and this happens often. Mostly between me and Wittgenstein.\\" Waugh writes that Margaret eventually refused to pay for the changes Wittgenstein kept demanding, so he bought himself a lottery ticket in the hope of paying for things that way.Waugh, Alexander. The House of Wittgenstein: A Family at War. Random House of Canada, 2008. p. 163 ff. It took him a year to design the door handles, and another to design the radiators. Each window was covered by a metal screen that weighed 150 kg, moved by a pulley Wittgenstein designed. Bernhard Leitner, author of The Architecture of Ludwig Wittgenstein, said of it that there is barely anything comparable in the history of interior design: \\"It is as ingenious as it is expensive. A metal curtain that could be lowered into the floor.\\" Completion The house was finished by December 1928, and the family gathered there that Christmas to celebrate its completion. Describing the work, Ludwig's eldest sister, Hermine, wrote: \\"Even though I admired the house very much, I always knew that I neither wanted to, nor could, live in it myself. It seemed indeed to be much more a dwelling for the gods than for a small mortal like me\\". Paul Wittgenstein, Ludwig's brother, disliked it, and when Margaret's nephew came to sell it, he reportedly did so on the grounds that she had never liked it either.

It was owned by Thomas Stonborough, son of Margaret until 1968 when it was sold to a developer for demolition. For two years after this the house was under threat of demolition. The Vienna Landmark Commission saved it‚Äîafter a campaign by Bernhard Leitner‚Äîand made it a national monument in 1971. Since 1975 it has housed the cultural department of the Bulgarian Embassy.

It is the first legally licensed distillery in Utah since the end of the American Prohibition. Distillery, restaurant, and saloon The distillery operates, along with a saloon and restaurant, in an old livery stable dubbed \\"The National Garage\\", and in the adjacent historic Ellsworth J Beggs house, a two-story box house that was built in 1907. The house is on the National Register of Historic Places. Distillation High West makes its spirits in small batches in a 250-gallon copper pot still. High West uses a combination still, which allows for both use as either a continuous/reflux still or separately a pot still; this allows for a variety of unique distillates to be produced. In a July 28, 2014 article, it was revealed that many High West products, sold as \\"craft whiskeys\\" or \\"artisanal spirits\\", are actually modified from products purchased from MGP Distillery of Lawrenceburg, Indiana. Products Rendezvous Rye Whiskey was the first commercial offering from High West Distillery. Originally, Rendezvous Rye was not distilled in Utah, but instead a blend of a 6-year-old 95% rye whiskey and 16-year-old 80% rye whiskey sourced from MGP (Indiana) and Barton (Kentucky) respectively. The whiskey was blended in Utah by High West using water from local sources. Rendezvous Rye was a 2008 Winner of a Double Gold Medal at San Francisco Spirits competition. It received a Malt Advocate Rating of 95 in the September 2008 issue, Batch #10, and was one of Malt Advocate Magazine's \\"Top 10 New Whiskies of 2008.\\" High West does distill and age its own whiskey, and over time has blended it into their existing products. Today, the previously award winning Rendezvous Rye is no longer sourced and carries a much younger age statement (4-7 years). It does, however, use the same two high rye mash bills for the blend. High West has received some criticism for selling its own younger distillate under the same brand equity as the original sourced, much older, product. Other regularly released products include their American Prairie Bourbon, which is still sourced from MGP and other undisclosed distilleries, aged 2-13 years; Double Rye!, a blend of 2-7 year old rye whiskeys sourced from MGP and using High West's own distillate; and Campfire, a 4-8 year old blend of MGP and High West rye whiskeys, MGP bourbon, and an undisclosed source of blended Malt Scotch whiskey. Limited releases include BOURYE: Limited Sighting, which is a blend of a straight rye whiskey and two straight bourbon whiskeys - all sourced from MGP (non-age stated), and A Midwinter's Night Dram, a non-age stated blend of MGP and High West rye whiskeys. Both are released annually in limited amounts. Discontinued releases include Yippee Ki-Yay, a blend of 2 year old High West rye whiskey and 16 year old sourced rye whiskey finished in used vermouth and syrah French oak barrels. Launched in 2015, only less than 30,000 bottles were ever produced. High West announced its discontinuation in July 2020.

During the Hundred Days, Woodford commanded the 2nd battalion of the Coldstream Guards at the Battle of Quatre Bras, the Battle of Waterloo and the storming of Cambrai in June 1815. During the closing stages of the Battle of Waterloo, Woodford fought his way into the Ch√¢teau d'Hougoumont, one of the key landmarks on the battlefield, and then took command of it as the Duke of Wellington ordered a general advance on the French. Woodford was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath on 4 June 1815 and a Knight of the Austrian Military Order of Maria Theresa on 2 August 1815. He remained in command of his battalion when it formed part of the Army of Occupation of France. Promoted to major general on 27 May 1825, Woodford became lieutenant governor and brigade commander at Malta in 1825 and lieutenant governor and brigade commander at Corfu in 1827. Advanced to Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath on 13 September 1831 and appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George on 30 June 1832, he became commander of the British garrison on the Ionian Islands (where he also briefly served as acting Lord High Commissioner) in 1832. He went on to be Lieutenant-Governor of Gibraltar in February 1835 and Governor and Commander-in-Chief of Gibraltar in September 1836. Promoted to lieutenant general on 28 June 1838, Woodford retired from active military service in 1843. Advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath on 6 April 1852 and having been promoted to full general on 20 June 1854, he became Lieutenant-Governor of the Royal Hospital Chelsea in September 1856 and was appointed to a Royal Commission to inquire into the system of Promotion and Retirement in the higher ranks of the Army in May 1863. Promoted to field marshal on 1 January 1868, he was raised to the office of Governor of the Royal Hospital Chelsea in August 1868. He also served as colonel of the 40th Regiment of Foot and then as colonel of the Scots Fusilier Guards. He died at the governor's residence at the Royal Chelsea Hospital on 26 August 1870 and was buried at Kensal Green Cemetery. Family Woodford's father was descended maternally from Ralph Brideoake, a 17th-century clergyman who became Dean of Salisbury. In 1820 Woodford married Charlotte Mary Ann Fraser; they had two sons one of whom, Charles John Woodford, was killed at the Siege of Cawnpore during the Indian Mutiny and is commemorated by a memorial stone in the floor of the north transept of Westminster Abbey. The Ch√¢teau d'Hougoumont held by Woodford during the closing stages of the Battle of Waterloo The elder son, the Reverend Adolphus Frederick Alexander Woodford, left the Coldstream Guards for a career in the Anglican Church, later becoming a prominent historian of Freemasonry.John A. Seed, AFA Woodford, Ars Quatuor Coronatorum 93, 1980, pp 118‚Äì128 Woodford also had a younger brother, John George Woodford (1785-1879), who enjoyed a similarly respectable military career. During this career, he fought in numerous battles in the Napoleonic Wars, including Waterloo, where some sources (Medieval Dead with Tim Sutherland) state that he was the last living British officer to have served at the battle upon his death. He also contributed a large part to military reform in the nineteenth- century, particularly such acts as the abolishment of the purchase of commissions and certain punishment methods. He is also noted for the archaeological excavations that he carried out at the supposed battle-field site of Azincourt. His brother died at the age of ninety-four in Keswick in 1879.

The Immigration Department is responsible for the issuance of Passports. This Department falls under the Tanzanian Ministry of Home Affairs. This passport is issued only to citizens of Tanzania. There are mainly three types of Passports, which are Ordinary, Service and Diplomatic. As of January 2018, Tanzania began issuing the new East African format ePassport, in line with the East African Community integration plans. Features of the Tanzanian ePassport; * ‚ÄìElectronic chip holding the same information as the old model passport * ‚ÄìEnhanced Security features. * ‚ÄìBiometric identifier * ‚ÄìDigital photograph of the passport holder The new ePassport is issued under different colors for Ordinary (navy blue), Diplomatic (red) and Service (green). The new ePassport has been made available to all Tanzanians seeking passports for international travel from January 2018. The old ordinary passport will be in use until January 2020 when it will be officially retired. History Before issuing the new ePassports, the Passport Control Authority of Tanzania used to issue Machine-readable Passports. The previous model before the machine readable version, was designed in the 1970s, before computer technology became widely available, hence the holder's data was typewritten or even handwritten on it. The front cover of the old machine readable Tanzanian Passport In contrast to the current ePassports, the previous Ordinary Tanzanian passport was green in color, while the Diplomatic Passport was Black and Service Passport was blue. The new Tanzanian ePassport complies with the ICAO standards. When the passport was first issued, the holder's fingerprints, signature and photograph would be digitally acquired and stored in a database, but only the holder's digital picture was coded in the physical passport, in a two-dimensional barcode. The latter, as well as the holder's personal identification data and his or her picture are directly laser-printed on the passport. Validity The Tanzanian passport is usually valid for a period of ten years from the date of issuance. Once expired it must be renewed in order to continue travelling. However, it can be renewed a few months before expiring so as not to inconvenience frequent travellers. Languages Details inside the passport are provided in Swahili (the national language) and English, which are the two de facto official languages. There are captions in the data page that are translated in these two languages as well. Description The new ePassports are navy blue color for ordinary citizens.

The song was a bebop mainstay that became a jazz standard, one of Gillespie's best known hits, and, according to Bebop: The Music and Its Players author Thomas Owens, \\"the first famous bebop recording\\". The song is a complex musical arrangement based on the chord structure of the 1920 standard originally recorded by Paul Whiteman, \\"Whispering\\", with lyrics by John Schonberger and Richard Coburn (n√© Frank Reginald DeLong; 1886‚Äì1952) and music by Vincent Rose. The biography Dizzy characterizes the song as \\"a pleasant medium-tempo tune\\" that \\"demonstrates...[Gillespie's] skill in fashioning interesting textures using only six instruments\\". The song has been used to title many compilation albums and also the 2001 biography Groovin' High: The Life of Dizzy Gillespie. Impact First published on the 1945 album Shaw 'Nuff, the song is one of seven on that album that, according to jazz critic Scott Yanow, \\"shocked\\" Gillespie's contemporaries, contributing to that album's \\"permanently [changing]...jazz and (indirectly) the entire music world\\". In Jazz: A Regional Exploration, Yanow explained that at the time such songs \\"were unprecedented...displaying a radically different language\\" from contemporary swing. But though fans and fellow musicians found the material \\"very strange and difficult\\", The Sax & Brass Book notes, they were quickly adopted as classics. According to Yanow, \\"Parker and Gillespie's solos seemed to have little relation to the melody, but they were connected. It was a giant step forward for jazz\\". Thomas Owens highlights the innovative use of source material, pointing out that while it was not uncommon for jazz musicians to utilize existing chord structures in their compositions in 1945, Gillespie's \\"melodic contrafact was the most complex jazz melody superimposed on a pre- existing chordal scheme\\", \\"atypically elaborate\\". Performance history First performed on February 9, 1945, Gillespie reworked the arrangement for a February 28 performance to allow an improvisation by guitarist Remo Palmier,Maggin, 166-167, 169. and it is this reworking that became so well known. In the book Yardbird Suite, music historian Lawrence O. Koch sets forth in detail the structure of the song as performed on December 29, 1945 and preserved by Armed Forces Radio Service, from the two-bar unison figure by Gillespie and Charlie Parker that open the song to the Gillespie coda at the end. Not having to conform to 78 rpm technology, Gillespie and his band were able to add several minutes to the song during that performance.Maggin, 186. The author praises the \\"lovely, logical, melodic construction\\" of Parker's 16-bar solo as well as singling out performances by Gillespie (\\"excellent\\"), Slam Stewart (\\"inimitable\\") and Palmieri (\\"adequate\\"). Noting that the coda \\"has become a jazz clich√©, both in its melody and the chord pattern from which the melody was derived\\", they also draw attention to Gillespie's \\"prima donna breath control\\" on the final E-flat, with only a \\"slight loss in intonation\\" in spite of the difficulty of the phrase.Koch, 51. The book Charlie Parker: His Music and Life describes this performance, along with the three other songs played in that session, as capturing \\"much of the vitality of the early Gillespie-Parker partnership. Other notable performances of the song took place on September 29, 1947, when Parker and Gillespie reunited in concert at Carnegie Hall, and during a 1956 tour sponsored by the US State Department. Owens describes the 1947 recording as among the finest of Parker's career.Owens, 37. During the 1956 tour, Gillespie simultaneously performed \\"Groovin' High\\" and \\"Whispering\\" to demonstrate the way jazz musicians build on the bones of earlier compositions. Inspiration According to the book Visions of Jazz: The First Century by Gary Giddins, Gillespie once recounted that he believed the song had been inspired by a film serial he saw at a matin√©e when he was a child that used the song \\"Whispering\\" as its theme. Gillespie offered no details about the serial, except that he believed it might have starred stuntman and rodeo rider Yakima Canutt. Albums named for the song There are at least 11 different albums in the Gillespie discography alone named Groovin' High, compilations that include the song along with other notable tracks that Gillespie performed. In addition, several compilations have been released under this title in Parker's name. =Gillespie albums= * Groovin' High (Bandstand): \\"Although not essential, there are some very interesting performances on this boppish CD.\\" ‚Äì Scott Yanow. * Groovin' High (Collectables): \\"It all makes for a rather mixed bag and doesn't make a particularly good introduction to Gillespie, although it does jarringly show some of the extremes in the Diz legacy.\\" ‚Äì Steve Leggett. * Groovin' High (Drive) (1994): Re-issue of the Collectables releases. * Groovin' High (Drive) (1999) * Groovin' High (Eclipse): \\"As it's a discount album..., it's a wonderful addition to the collection of any Gillespie fan.\\" * Groovin' High (High Definition Classics) * Groovin' High (Indigo): \\"Fans of this style of jazz likely already have all of this classic material, but as a stocking stuffer or birthday present for a fledgling young jazz fan, this would work well.\\" ‚Äì Michael G.

The term may also be used if the subject is God, in which case it takes the meaning of \\"divine responsiveness\\". Definition According to Al-Raghib al-Isfahani, Shukr is to recognise a blessing and display it. It has been said that it was originally kashr, meaning ‚Äòto unveil and expose,‚Äô then the first two letters were swapped. Its opposite is kufr, which is ‚Äòto cover, conceal, and forget a blessing. In Islamic contexts God *When the subject of shukr is God, the concept signifies \\"requiting and commending [a person]\\", \\"forgiving\\" a person, or \\"regarding\\" the person \\"with content, satisfaction, good will\\"; and thus, necessarily, \\"recompensing\\". In fact, the Arabic saying shakara 'llƒÅhu sa øyahu mean \\"May God recompense, or reward, his work or labour\\". *One of the beautiful names of God is al-Shak≈´r,Mentioned in , , , meaning \\"He who approves, or rewards, or forgives, much; He in whose estimation small, or few, works performed by His servants increase, and who multiplies His rewards to them\\". The Qur'an refers to Him by al-ShƒÅkirThis is mentioned in II, 158; IV, 147 too. *God is considered al-Shak≈´r in the sense that He widely extends His favors. God's shukr is not to be considered thankfulness in a literal sense. Rather God's shukr is a recompense to man for doing good, (just as man is recomposed for committing offenses). According to al-Ghazali, God is absolutely grateful, because of His unlimited multiplication of the reward of the pious, as they shall receive eternal bliss in Paradise. Al-Maksad writes that God's praise for man's good deeds is praise for His own work, since the good of man is His creation.\\"Shukr\\", Encyclopaedia of Islam Prophets: the Qur'an provides narratives of the prophets of God as individuals of gratitude. Their thanksgiving is exemplified by their obedience and faithfulness to God:\\"Gratitude and Ingratitude,\\" Encyclopaedia of Qur'an * Abraham‚Äôs obedience and faithfulness were tokens of his gratitude to God; * Noah is described as a man of gratitude; * the Qur'an reasons that the endowment of Solomon with supernatural gifts to accomplish the ends for which God appointed him, was so that he would be grateful. Shukr in Sunnah *It had been narrated that when a pleasing event happened to the Messenger of God, he would say, ‚ÄúPraise be to God for this blessing,‚Äù and when a distressing event happened to him, he would say, ‚ÄúPraise be to God at all times.‚Äù * It was reported that: One night that the Messenger of Allah was with ‚ÄòA‚Äôishah, she said to him, ‚ÄúO Messenger of Allah, why do you exhaust yourself when God has forgiven you your former and latter sins?‚Äù The Prophet replied, ‚ÄúO ‚ÄòA‚Äôishah, shouldn‚Äôt I be a grateful servant?‚Äù *The hadith collections include various reports of Muhammad expressing gratitude to God. He fell down prostrate to God three times during the Hijra from Mecca to Medina. He is also reported to have done this after Gabriel informed him a favor God had bestowed upon him. Muhammad also used to do this to thank God for his good health, especially when he met those afflicted with illness. Other instances on which Muhammad prostrated in thanks: military success, conversion of notable people to Islam. Conditions for proper Shukr * There are three conditions to a proper and complete praise of God: 1) To know God as the Giver of bounties, 2) To be pleased and satisfied with what He has given you, and 3) Not to use His bounty in the way of His disobedience. Reality of Shukr In a Sufi context, shukr is an internal state and its external expression. It is considered a station (ma·∏≥ƒÅm) of the wayfarer (sƒÅlik). Expression The expression of shukr takes various forms in the Islamic tradition. The maxim \\"he who does not thank his fellow men shows ingratitude towards God\\" highlights the importance of such expression. On the other hand, those who are thanked are expected to say \\"don't thank me, be grateful to God.\\" It is common practice to kiss one's hands and to say \\"I praise Him and thank Him for His bounty.\\" Another expression is \\"we are thankful to God, and we kiss the ground thousand fold that you are pleased.\\" When asked about health, one may answer \\"thank God\\", gratitude to God is also commonly expressed for someone's recovery. In times of calamity, gratitude is expressed by saying \\"thank God it is not more grave\\".Rist, 1982, p. 20 Shukr is also expressed by prostration (sujud). Although most notable for being a fundamental part of the Islamic prayer, Islamic traditions also mentions the sujud al-shukr, literally meaning \\"the thanksgiving prostration.\\"Tottoli, 1998, p. 309-313 Examples of practical Shukr according to Islam *\\"Prayer, is the best form of gratitude to Allah. *Taking Fasting *Serving People *Contentment *Taking care of Orphans. *Assisting the deprived and the Needy. *Being gratitude to others. \\" Significants of Shukr according to Quran *Shukr leads to the enhancement of blessings *Shukr benefits,he who perform it. *Shukr is a sign of Worshipping Allah. *Shukr gives us rest of mind. *Shukr is a way of remembring Allah. *Shukr is a way of disobedience to the commandment of Shaitan(devil) and obedience to Allah. *Shukr is a sign of accepting Allah as the provider of favor. *Shakr gains the pleasure of Allah. . How to achieve Shukr *\\"We must first identify and know the bounties and blessings bestowed upon us (both physical and spiritual). *We must realised the fact that the blessings of Allah upon us are countless(, thus, we can not thank Him as He deserved. *In addition to these, We must realised that it is Allah who protected Us from all possible evils and misfortune that could have struck us.\\" \\" See also * Sabr * Tawwakul NotesReferences * * Category:Islamic terminology Category:Gratitude Category:Arabic words and phrases ","title":"Shukr"},{"id":"17992926","text":"Achentoul (Scottish Gaelic: Achadh an t-Sabhail; translation: \\"field of the barn\\") is a hamlet in the Kinbrace area of Sutherland, in the Scottish council area of Highland. Consisting of a few farmhouses and barns, Achentoul lies around north of Kinbrace along the A897 road and south of Loch An Ruathair. Although the Achentoul Forest is located in this area, the landscape is said to be dominated by moist Atlantic heather moor. Moor around Loch An Ruathair Geography The Achentoul Estate boasts several lochs, including Loch Ascaig, Loch Arachlinie, Loch Badanloch, Loch Ruthair, Loch Drum, Loch Lucy, Loch Cullidh, Loch Dubh, Loch Sletill and Loch Badanloch. Loch fishing is available on a number of the estate's lochs. Flora and fauna The rugged and remote Achentoul Forest lies to the north of Achentoul Lodge. A deer forest, it has been a noted sporting estate for deer shooting for centuries. The area is frequented by deer year round, as well as birds of prey. Culture Achentoul Lodge was built c. 1900. It is situated southeast of Loch An Ruathair, overlooking the moorland to the north of Kinbrace. The lodge organizes hind stalking during the winter months (October‚ÄìFebruary) to kill deer, which are considered pests to the forest. For the sport the farm charges up to ¬£130 for a session if the shooter hires a keeper, although a stalker is only permitted to kill two deer in a session. However, the farm claims that the hind stalking is for woodland conservation purposes primarily, given that the Achentoul estate by 1970 had dedicated for afforestation and sold to the Forestry Commission. Rabbit shooting on the farm is also available. A notable family on the farm are the Nutting family, who hired the late Donald Mackay to manage the farm in 1958. He worked in Achentoul for a long time with the Henderson brothers; he died in 2010, aged 76. The Ca na Catanach is a medieval road and drovers' road with a footpath between Dorrery Lodge and the north end of Achentoul. Kinbrace Hill (also known as Kinbrace Farm or Achentoul Forest) is noted by the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland for a long, chambered cairn.

In 1822, she moved back to Skultuna and was married the same year to Anders Wilhelm Nyberg (1793 ‚Äì 1851). Nyberg is most famous for her songs written for the Walpurgis Night holiday, many of which are still sung and recorded today, including V√•rvindar friska and Fruktm√•nglerskan med tapperhetsmedalj.

It exists as a yellow hygroscopic solid, which can form tetra-, hexa-, and decahydrates. It is an intermediate in the extraction of chromium from its ores. Production and reactivity It is obtained on a vast scale by roasting chromium ores in air in the presence of sodium carbonate: :2Cr2O3 \\\\+ 4 Na2CO3 \\\\+ 3 O2 ‚Üí 4 Na2CrO4 \\\\+ 4 CO2 This process converts the chromium into a water- extractable form, leaving behind iron oxides. Typically calcium carbonate is included in the mixture to improve oxygen access and to keep silicon and aluminium impurities in an insoluble form. The process temperature is typically around 1100 ¬∞C. For lab and small scale preparations a mixture of chromite ore, sodium hydroxide and sodium nitrate reacting at lower temperatures may be used (even 350 C in the corresponding potassium chromate system). Subsequent to its formation, the chromate salt is converted to sodium dichromate, the precursor to most chromium compounds and materials.

It was founded in 1855 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. History In 1854 when Hancock Cemetery in the center of the town had been filled to near capacity, a committee was formed at a town meeting to determine the site of a new burial ground. The committee chose a plot of land in the town farm, which had been donated by William Coddington and was located just west of the site of Quincy's founding spot, Mount Wollaston. Through the year the cemetery committee surveyed several cemeteries in the surrounding area for landscaping and architecture ideas, including Forest Hills Cemetery in Jamaica Plain and Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge. After consulting with Superintendent Brims of Forest Hills, Luther Briggs of Dorchester was hired to design and build the cemetery. Briggs chose a gothic revival style for the architecture, and used the plot dimensions adopted by Mount Auburn as a template for Mount Wollaston. The first two plots were ceremoniously purchased on May 5, 1856 by Charles Francis Adams, Sr., prominent attorney and son of the late former President of the United States, John Quincy Adams. Monuments An area known as the Veterans Section, located at the main Sea Street entrance to the cemetery, features several monuments honoring members of the military. The Civil War Monument, dedicated June 25, 1868, features a large granite monument surrounded by four period cannons.

The house and attached estate was bought by Walter Irvine, a Scot who owned sugar estates in Tobago and Luddington House in Surrey. It then passed to Irvine's daughter, Elizabeth, and her husband, Lord William Robert Keith Douglas, the fourth son of Sir William Douglas, 4th Baronet of Kelhead, and younger brother of both Charles Douglas, 6th Marquess of Queensberry and John Douglas, 7th Marquess of Queensberry. Grangemuir House is located just north of Pittenweem in Fife, Scotland and is now sitting within Grangemuir Woodland Chalet Park. The house was of French design and was constructed as a hunting lodge for the family in the 18th century. The building was clad in the 1970s with pebbledashed concrete as a cheap way of excluding damp. Members of this branch of the Douglas family usually matriculated their arms with the mottos Jamais Arri√®re or Forward. However, in 1979, the previous head of the family, Walter Francis Edward Douglas (1917‚Äì2013), who reportedly converted to Roman Catholicism, was granted permission by the Lord Lyon to matriculate his arms with the motto Tendir and Trewe, as taken from the 15th century poem The Buke of the Howlat, by Sir Richard Holland, chaplain to Archibald Douglas, Earl of Moray:Lord William Robert Keith Douglas > O Douglas, O Douglas! > Tendir and trewe History Grangemuir House was given to Lord William Robert Keith Douglas (born 1783 ‚Äì died 1859) along with of land surrounding it. On 24 November 1824, he married Elizabeth Irvine (died 1864); the couple had three children, William (1824‚Äì1868), Walter (1825‚Äì1901), and Charles (1837‚Äì1918). The children founded the Douglas Cottage Hospital in St Andrews in 1866 as a memorial to their mother, Lady William Douglas of Grangemuir - this memorial is still reflected in the contemporary St Andrews Memorial Hospital, one of whose wards is still called the Douglas Ward. The heir, Walter Douglas Irvine married Anne Frances Lloyd, the daughter of an Anglo-Irish doctor from County Roscommon in 1870. They had six children, a number of whom were profoundly deaf. Some of these were known by the surname \\"Irvine\\", others \\"Douglas\\", rather than \\"Douglas-Irvine\\": # William Keith Douglas-Irvine (1876‚Äì1957) # Capt.

Edward Percy Douglas (1886‚Äì?) # Lucy Christina Douglas-Irvine (1874?‚Äì19??), artist # Elizabeth Douglas-Irvine (?‚Äì?) The 1905 Valuation Rolls show that after Walter died in 1901, almost all of the 64 listed properties were put under tenancy, including Grangemuir House, Farm and surrounding buildings which was rented by a Col. Erskine from May 1902 onwards (he eventually purchased the property in 1920). In 1912, 1913, 1914, 1915 and 1916 a Mrs Douglas Irvine rented five different properties in the nearby village of Pittenweem, changing house each year. This is presumed to be Anne, who died in 1917. The heir, Rev. Henry Archibald Douglas-Irvine, a parson, married Beatrice Alice Mabel Gratix (died 1976) in 1913, producing a son and heir, Walter Francis Edward Douglas who was born in 1917. In May 1920, fifteen lots of the Grangemuir and Dunino farms were put up for saleThe Scotsman 28 April 1920 and Dundee Evening Telegraph 7 May 1920.. Just four were sold due to auction bids exceeding their \\"upset\\" price. A further seven lots were sold by 1924 at values below their original valuationDundee Courier 12 April 1922; 1 March 1923 Dundee Courier; Dundee Courier 28 June 1924; 25 March 1925 Dundee Courier; Dundee Courier 7 July 1925. The house continued in use until the 1970s whereupon it fell into ruin and was subsequently converted to a caravan park. Reportedly it has recently been demolished as it had become unsafe. Henry's son, Walter Francis Edward Douglas (born 1917 ‚Äì died 2013), moved to Lincolnshire where he became an art teacher in Stamford School. He married a Belgian. The oldest surviving member of the family is the eldest child of Walter Francis, Francis Gustave Douglas (born 1946), BSc, MA, PhD. Grad. Cert Ed., Professor Emeritus of University College Cork who has lived in Cork, Ireland since 1980. His own heir apparent is his son Niall Edward Douglas, BSc, MA, MBS, PGCert Ed, Cert HE Maths (born 1978). The family branch which built Dunino church and primary school still have exclusive right of burial in one half of the church graveyard, located just south of St Andrews and just north of Grangemuir. The family resumed its connection with the area in the 1990s and 2000s when two members attended the nearby St Andrews University. Records relating to the Grangemuir estates, along with a small number of other family papers, can be found in the Special Collections Archive of St Andrews University Library. They were rescued from an Edinburgh law firm in 1994 and subsequently donated to the University.Douglas of Grangemuir Papers, 16th-20th centuries, st- andrews.ac.uk; accessed 20 September 2016.  Economics  According to an article in the Dundee Courier26 August 1870 ‚Äì ‚ÄòMemorial Window‚Äô, in 1818 Grangemuir (house and estate) was valued at around ¬£40,000, which is equivalent to about ¬£38 million today. The land boundary of this reference is unknown, but would be assumed to be the widest possible extent. According to the Valuation Rolls, in 1855 Lord William Douglas owned 28 properties. A few years before he died in 1859, he built Dunino church and rebuilt the school into a much larger new building suitable for 90 children. In 1872 when Walter Douglas assumed title, 44 properties were listed, with further properties inherited but left untitled (it cost money to register title, and inherited land was yours anyway). In addition to purchasing Eastern Grangemuir in 1873, he built many more properties on his land and in the 1895 roll, some 64 properties were listed not including properties inherited but untitled, most of which were earning rents from tenants. Grangemuir reported annual revenues to the Treasury of ¬£5298 in 1880, which was equivalent to about ¬£3,917,000 in 2016. Financial problems appear to have begun to beset the family from around the Long Depression (1870s) onwards. Land area owned did not increase after 1873. Probate for Walter Douglas who died in 1901 valued his effects at ¬£3,709 and real estate at ¬£56,860Scottish register of wills and testaments, which is equivalent to about ¬£2,224,000 and ¬£34 million in 2016. However he had a loan secured against the property for ¬£32,013, so his total estate (in modern terms, in those days only rents from real estate counted towards probate) was ¬£28,556, which is equivalent to ¬£17 million in 2016. The May 1920 auction mentioned earlier had upset prices for the fifteen lots total to ¬£53,900 (around ¬£11.9m today), but as mentioned earlier most of the lots could not sell at their reserve price, so this is surely an overestimate of their value at that time. Other land owners nearby experienced significant loss of value according to the Land and Property registry, with probates showing up to a two thirds loss of value between 1924 and 1945. Reportedly, the eldest son and heir of Walter Douglas, William Keith Douglas-Irvine, required to have a trust set up to take care of him until the end of his life in 1957, and when his next eldest brother Henry Douglas took possession of that trust, only ¬£20,000 remained (equivalent to about ¬£1,303,000 in 2016).

Davenport retired from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the Summer of 2008. From 2008 to the present, she has managed the transition of Tidmarsh Farms, a former 610 acre cranberry farm in Plymouth Massachusetts, into conservation and wetland restoration. In 2011, Davenport founded Living Observatoryhttp://livingobservatory.org Living Observatory, a non-profit, learning collaborative that focuses on documenting and sharing the long term story of wetland restoration of former cranberry farms. In this work, Davenport returned as a visiting scientist at the MIT Media Lab where she works closely with the Responsive Environments Group. http://tidmarsh.media.mit.edu. Biography A graduate of Mount Holyoke College in 1966, Davenport made documentary films in New York and Maine before becoming a lecturer at M.I.T's Film Section directed by cinema verite pioneer Richard Leacock in 1977. In 1985, Davenport along with Richard Leacock facilitated the transition of M.I.T.s Film/Video Section into the Weisner Building as part of the new MIT Media Lab. With the retirement of Leacock in 1987, Davenport joined the faculty and founded the Interactive cinema group. At the time she wrote: \\"Interactive cinema reflects the longing of cinema to become something new, something more complex, something more intimate, as if in conversation with an audience.\\"Phillip Tiongson made this into a movie which can be seen here In these years before the web, the challenge was to envision a computational form that was scalable and that bound compelling content with human interaction. Davenport writes: \\"As cinema frees itself from the constraints of the inherently linear celluloid base, a new meta-cinema explodes the myth of the heroic by projecting itself into our everyday environments. The creation and sharing of cinema can happen anywhere, any time. As an improvisational learning partner, meta-cinema invites us to articulate new hypotheses, to sensorially augment our dialogs, to share multi- point of view stories, and to engage in sociable interchange between all people.\\" In 2008, Davenport retired from the MIT Media Lab in order to transition Tidmarsh Farms, a 610 acre cranberry farm into restoration and conservation. From 2010-2016, she collaborated with over 22 partners on the Tidmarsh Farms Restoration Project, the largest freshwater, wetland restoration in Massachusetts. https://www.ser-rrc.org/project/tidmarsh-farms- restoration-project-plymouth- massachusetts/https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/04/us/cranberry-bog-wetlands- restoration-climate-change.htmlIn 2011, she founded Living Observatory, a non- profit learning collaborative of scientists, engineers, artists and restoration specialists; the mission of Living Observatory is to tell the long term story of the wetland restoration of cranberry farmland, to advance science and the enhance public understanding of fresh water wetlands. http://LivingObservatory.org Projects In 1979-81, Davenport, working with cinematographer Richard Leacock, filmed and edited \\"Remembering Niels Bohr: 1885-1962\\". In 1982-1987, Davenport produced, co-filmed, edited and designed an interactive delivery system for her documentary \\"New Orleans in Transition: 1983-1986\\". Conceived of as an in-depth cinematic case study of urban change before during and after the 1984 Louisiana World Exposition, the interactive video disc version of the film as delivered on a Project Athena workstation in 1987 invited students to view the movie based on a particular story thread or character and allowed students to edit material from the film and place it into their written papers. As her thinking about the form developed, Davenport designed \\"Workshop in Elastic Movie Time\\", a collaborative workshop in which students were asked to film a meaningful corpus of material and to develop interactive computational structure to present the content. Davenport taught the workshop for 10 years at the MIT Media Laboratory as well as in several international venues. In 1989, the class created \\"The Elastic Charles,\\" an interactive portrait of the Charles River. The Elastic Charles combined historical, thematic, ecological and other perspectives on the Charles River. A time-lapse journey on the river provided one interactive structure. Using a hyper-link tool developed by Hans Peter Brondmo, viewers could define media segments and place them as video tags on the appropriate portion of time-lapse journey along the banks of the Charles.creating in effect a cinematic cut- away. One memorable video clip was an interview with Charlie, a worker at the Charles River Locks, who comments on the quality of the water at that time. The Elastic Charles was an early exploration of how video and computers together can create a new narrative and documentary medium. In Wheel of Life, Davenport collaborated with Stanford Professor Larry Friedlander on a large- scale computer-enhanced theater space and narrative piece, which has become a model for augmented interactive spaces. Most her most recent \\"Arc of Change\\" project, Davenport collaborates with scientists, engineers, artists and restoration practitioners, to bring the sights, sounds and environmental data from an evolving fresh water restoration to the public. http://tidmarsh.media.mit.edu Collaborators at the Responsive Environments Group include Brian Mayton, Gershon Dublon, Spencer Russell, Donald Haddad and Joe Paradiso.

It was constructed in strict accordance with the theories of Orson Squire Fowler, author of A Home for All. It is preserved intact, and is one of the few remaining octagon houses that was built exactly as Fowler advocated. On February 8, 1980, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. The house has been altered slightly, however. It was a pleasing feature of the house that the balustrade design, which appears on the roof of the house, had been repeated in different scales also on the roof of the porch and on the cupola.The recent photo shows balustrade at main roof level only. A photograph and specific note on the balustrade design repetition appears in A Field Guide to American Houses, Virginia and Lee McAlester, 1984, Alfred A. Knopf's Borzoi Books: New York (page 237). The balustrades were in place in 1979 when the NRHP application photos were taken. Building The house is on a two-acre (8,000 m¬≤) lot at the corner of River Street and the tracks laid down by the Boston and Maine Railroad. The neighborhood is residential, with most other houses dating to the 19th century as well. It is two stories high, faced in stucco over walls built of a mixture of grout and Rosendale cement. A small square porch projects from the east side. The facets have an alternating fenestration of one and two windows. The roofline is decorated with a dentiled bargeboard. Above it is an intricate wood crest, and behind it several small dormer windows with trim similar to the roofline. Two chimneys rise from the similarly trimmed cupola in the center of the hipped roof. The interior plan has four large rooms on each level with the staircase around the central post. The smaller rooms serve support functions, such as bathrooms and closets. History Ezra Estabrook was inspired to build the house by Orson Squire Fowler's A Home for All, or a Cheap, Convenient and Superior Mode of Building, which came out in a revised edition in 1853. Fowler, a phrenologist who dabbled in architecture, was intrigued by polygonal forms found in nature and adapted for use by man. In his book he advocated the octagonal form since it could be built by the homeowner at a low cost. Estabrook followed Fowler's advice and did most of the building work himself. He followed Fowler's plan exactly, including the cupola and alternating one-two fenestration. His only change was the material. Fowler had called for the wall to be made of a mixture of water, lime and an aggregate, since they were widely available around the country. The Estabrooks chose the Rosendale cement-grout mixture along with coarse local gravel since it was locally available and had proven more durable. Ezra Estabrook kept a diary during construction, in which he records pouring as much as one foot (25 cm) a day of the mixture between wooden forms. His descendants lived in the house for almost a century, until 1943. There have been very few alterations to the interior. It is one of the few surviving octagon houses built as Fowler had originally intended. Today the home has been converted from residential to the home of Marker's Octagon Reality, which caterers to the Hoosick Falls area.

Playing careerEarly days= Bowers was born in Low Santon, near Scunthorpe and, after playing for Scunthorpe works side Appleby Works, started his professional career with Scunthorpe & Lindsey United in December 1927. Five months later, he was transferred to Derby County, where he was to remain until 1936. =Derby County= He was signed for Derby County by manager George Jobey on 5 May 1928, on the same day as future England international Jack Barker. He made his debut in a 2‚Äì1 win over Bolton Wanderers at the Baseball Ground on 2 February 1929 and celebrated his first appearance by scoring.Derby County v Bolton Wanderers, 02 February 1929 It was not until the 1930‚Äì31 season that Bowers was to become a regular selection at centre forward after the transfer of Harry Bedford to Newcastle United. His first match in this season came against Arsenal, which launched Bowers on the way to breaking the club's goal-scoring record. Having sat out the first nine matches of the season, Bowers scored 37 goals in the remaining 33 matches, including four in one game against Chelsea when the Rams beat the Londoners 6‚Äì2. He scored 15 goals in a run of six consecutive matches in January and February 1931. This magnificent spell of goal-scoring was the main reason why Derby reached sixth place and, for most of the season, were sitting on the edge of the leading pack. Bowers holds Derby County's record for the number of League goals in a season (37), although this was equalled by Ray Straw in the Third Division North campaign of 1956‚Äì57. The following season, he was again Derby's top-scorer despite only scoring 25 goals, but improved on this in 1932‚Äì33 with 35 league goals, thus making him the top scorer in the Football League First Division as Derby finished in seventh place in the table. Bowers also contributed eight goals in the FA Cup as Derby reached the semi-finals where they lost to Manchester City. This was the only round in the cup run in which Bowers failed to score, as he finished the season with a total of 43 goals from 47 matches. This remains Derby's goal-scoring record.The History Of Derby CountyDerby County Club Records His form continued into the next season, when he was again top scorer in the top flight with 34 league goals, plus three in the cup, with Derby reaching fourth place in the table. In the first six games of the season, he became the only Derby player to twice score in six successive matches; this run included two hat-tricks. His form for Derby brought him to the notice of the England selectors and he was given his first international cap in the 1934 British Home Championship against Ireland played at Windsor Park, Belfast on 14 October 1933. Bowers scored England's third goal in the 60th minute in a 3‚Äì0 victory.Ireland 0 ‚Äì England 3; 14 October 1933 (Match summary) He retained his place for the next match against Wales on 15 November, but failed to score as England went down 2‚Äì1.England 1 ‚Äì Wales 2; 15 November 1933 (Match summary) As this victory enabled Wales to claim the British Home Championship title, Bowers' next match against Scotland was to have no bearing on the destiny of the title. Bowers scored in the 85th minute as England defeated the Scots 3‚Äì0.England 3 ‚Äì Scotland 0; 14 April 1934 (Match summary) Bower also made two appearances for the Football League representative team. In September 1934, a serious knee injury sustained in a match against Spurs curtailed his Derby career and he lost his place to Hughie Gallacher. His recovery was slow, although in 1935‚Äì36 his 30 goals for the Reserves helped Derby to the Central League championship. He returned to the side for the start of the 1936‚Äì37 season; on 5 September 1936, Derby were losing 4‚Äì1 at home to Manchester United, when Bowers struck with four goals in an amazing 15-minute spell (between the 64th and 79th minute) to give his side a spectacular 5‚Äì4 victory. By now he was no longer first choice and in November 1936 he moved to Leicester City for a fee of ¬£6,000. In his eight years with Derby, he made 220 appearances, scoring 183 goals. Only Steve Bloomer and Kevin Hector have scored more goals for Derby. =Leicester City= Bowers joined Leicester City in November 1936, who had been relegated to the Football League Second Division in 1935. His arrival at Filbert Street galvanised Leicester's push for promotion and his 33 league goals from only 27 games helped them claim the Second Division title, just ahead of Blackpool, and also made him top scorer in the division. Back in the First Division, Bowers was now finding goal-scoring more difficult and he was sharing the goal-scoring responsibilities with Danny Liddle and George Dewis. The advent of World War II interrupted his career and he retired in August 1943. In his three League seasons, he scored 52 goals in 79 appearances, plus four goals in five FA Cup appearances. Later career In August 1943, Bowers was appointed coach to Notts County, working with the youth team. After two years, he returned to Derby County as assistant trainer, a position he held for over twenty years. He and his wife lived on Pear Tree Road (No. 59), not far from the Baseball Ground, where they kept a shop. He died on 4 July 1970 in Lichfield, Staffordshire. Family His son John Bowers, Jr. played for Derby County between 1957 and 1966, making 65 League appearances in that time. Bowers is the first cousin twice removed of Keith Lindsey and Barry Lindsey, two other Scunthorpe players. The Lindseys are connected through their maternal grandmother's line.

As a result, it reflects two different architectural styles: Italianate and Second Empire. Unlike most other American octagon houses of the period, its interior follows a sidehall plan, rather than the radial center plan advocated by Orson Squire Fowler. and Accompanying seven photos, exterior and interior, undated Building The two-story house sits on a stone foundation. It is sided in asphalt, with overhanging bracketed eaves and a decorated frieze at the roofline. Above it is amansard roof, covered in fish- scale slate shingles. The main entry is located at the southeast facet of the house. Unusually for an octagon house, it is recessed to create a porch, extending outside of the house, overlooking the Hudson River roughly a mile to the east. A two-story rectangular kitchen wing projects from the west facet, with a sympathetic contemporary octagonal hip-roofed porch wing attached to it. The remains of an earlier porch project from the east facet. Inside, the house follows a sidehall plan not seen in most octagon houses. Instead of being located in the center, the stairs are off to the side, allowing the eastern side of the first floor to be used as a large parlor with a fireplace on the west wall. This is echoed upstairs, with the master bedroom occupying the large eastern space and the other bedrooms to the west. Most finishings and trim are original, many representing the Greek Revival era in American architecture, which was winding down around the time the house was built. There is also a garage on the property, but it is of modern construction and not considered a contributing resource. History The Dubois family bought the property where the house now sits in the mid-19th century. Shortly afterwards they began building the house. The original had no projections, and was a pure octagon in keeping with Fowler's theories, save for the sidehall interior and recessed entrance. In 1872 they sold it to the Sarleses, who renovated the house extensively, adding a mansard roof then popular from the Second Empire style, and the kitchen wing. It remained in their descendants' ownership until the late 20th century. At some point during that time, the original small eastern porch was removed and a bay window put into the wall on that facet. A Colonial Revival porch was then built out from the entrance recess. Other than that, there have been no major changes to the house.

Biography Haim Sabato was born to a family of Aleppan-Syrian descent in Cairo. In the 1950s, his family immigrated to Israel and lived in a \\"ma'abara\\" (transit camp) in Kiryat HaYovel, Jerusalem. He studied at a Talmud Torah in Bayit Vegan, in the vicinity, and after it attended the \\"Netiv Meir\\" yeshiva-high school, also in Bayit Vegan. Rabbi Aryeh Bina, Rosh Yeshiva of \\"Netiv Meir\\", was one of his key influences. After graduation, he joined the \\"Hesder\\" program at Yeshivat Hakotel, in the old city of Jerusalem, which combines yeshiva studies with military service. His experiences during the Yom Kippur war, at the age of 21, led him to write Adjusting Sights. After the war, Sabato spent the next few years at Yeshivat Mercaz Harav, the spiritual home of religious Zionism. After receiving rabbinical ordination, Sabato co-founded Yeshivat Birkat Moshe in Ma'aleh Adumim, near Jerusalem, in 1977. Literary style Sabato's lyrical writing, with sentences studded with phrases drawn from, and referring to, passages in the Bible and Talmud has won him numerous fans and made him a symbol of the \\"pitfalls\\" of translating literary works form one language to another.Lost in translation?, BENJAMIN ROSENDAHL, April 7, 2009, Jerusalem Post He has published four novels in addition to Rabbinical works.

Published works Sabato's first book, Emet Mi Eretz Titzmach, (published in English as Aleppo Tales), is a collection of short stories relating to his family's ancestral home and community of Aleppo, Syria. Sabato was awarded the Sapir Prize for Literature in its inaugural year, as well as the Yitzhak Sadeh Prize, for his second work, Teum Kavanot (Adjusting Sights in the English translation), a moving account of the experiences of a soldier in the Yom Kippur war. The book has also been made into a film. His third publication, Ke-Afapey Shachar (published in English as Dawning of the Day: A Jerusalem Tale), tells the story of Ezra Siman Tov, a religious Jerusalemite coming to terms with a changing world. Sabato's next work, Boyi Ha-Ruach (published in English as From the Four Winds), describes his experiences as an \\"oleh chadash\\" (a new immigrant) in the Israeli \\"ma'abarot\\" (typical transit camps of the 1950s).From the four winds In his most recent book, Be-Shafrir Chevyon, Sabato returns again to his childhood in \\"Beit Mazmil\\", Jerusalem, as a newcomer, with memories from Cairo intermingling with adventures in the monastery of Ein-Karem, and the annual Independence Day exhibition in Jerusalem.

It was here that the United States first performed test launches of German V-2 rockets captured toward the end of World War II. These tests were the first step in both military advances in rocketry, and in the development of the United States space exploration programs. The site was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1985. History The Nazi German V-2 rocket was one of the most advanced weapons produced in World War II, and hundreds of them were launched at Allied targets in the last two years of the war. In the aftermath of the war, the United States launched Operation Paperclip, a secret program that successfully recruited German scientists and engineers (most prominently Wernher von Braun) to work for the American military, and transported 100 captured V-2 rockets to the recently established White Sands Missile Range. Between 1946 and 1951, the Army fired 67 V-2 sounding rockets from this site. These launches, and the training of a class of scientists and engineers, led directly to the further development of new rocket launch programs, including ultimately the launch of humans into space. Site description Launch Complex 33 is located near the far southern end of the White Sands Missile Range, east of Las Cruces, New Mexico. On the range grounds, it is located on east of the White Sands Range Museum. There are two principal surviving elements of the launch complex. One is the steel gantry, a steel structure in height and wide, from which the V-2s and later classes of rockets were launched. It has four platforms at different heights, which can be swung into position to accommodate rockets of different sizes, and a network of block- and-tackle systems to assist in rocket placement. The other structure is a concrete observation tower with walls thick, and a pyramidal roof cap that consists of of solid concrete. It has observation portals with specialized glass windows allowing for close observation of the launches.

Early years Carter was born in Montreal, Quebec and grew up in a working-class neighborhood. With little education, he dropped out of school to perform car stunts with a team of traveling daredevils. Subsequently, he began performing as a solo act, and he jumped at racetracks all over North America.

The preparations for the jump were the subject of a documentary called The Devil at Your Heels, directed by Robert Fortier and produced by the National Film Board of Canada.IMDB: The Devil at Your Heels (October 1981) For months, Carter prepared his car and looked for sponsors. Eventually, U.S. broadcaster ABC gave him $250,000 to air the stunt on the episode of Wide World of Sports scheduled for September 25, 1976. Carter anticipated a live audience of 100,000. Construction of a 1,400-foot takeoff ramp began on fifty acres of farmland near Morrisburg, Ontario. Evel Knievel visited the site as a special correspondent for ABC and concluded that there was little chance of success. Delays in finishing the car and completing the ramp caused Carter to miss the broadcast date and ABC withdrew its support. Carter resumed preparations the following year and again in 1978, but the jump was cancelled both times. On September 26, 1979, Carter got to within five seconds of takeoff before aborting the jump following a mechanical failure. The planned jump had been sponsored by a film producer in exchange for exclusive film rights. Believing that Carter had lost his nerve, the film crew secretly arranged for another stunt driver, American Kenny Powers, to perform the jump while Carter was in his hotel room in Ottawa, Ontario. The Powers jump was a failure,(13 October 1979).

According to The Devil at Your Heels, Powers was chosen to do the jump at the last minute due to health concerns about Carter. Powers and Donna Boyle Powers Ray also verified this story to Beverly Plumley Powers. Carter still wanted to do the jump.

Zingerle became a world champion in the downhill in 1935.  Biography  He comes from a poor farmers family as the oldest son from a total of eight kids. Already during his childhood he developed a love for skiing. As a teenager, he first worked as a laborer until he learned to be a bricklayer. At the age of 17, he bought skis for the first time and joined the Axams, ski club which held the first ski races on the Birgitzer Alm. Shortly after he joined the club, he became the club's first club champion in 1926. Moreover, 1926 is considered as the beginning year of his successful career. At the age of 21, he came to the Tyrol Ski Club, where he was able to participate regularly in ski races in the winter of 1929/30. The following season, he was downhill and slalom winner in Seefeld. In winter 1932 he won the downhill and the combination competition at the Austrian championships in Zell am See. He then took part in Cortina d‚ÄôAmpezzo, with his best result of sixth place in the slalom. With second place in downhill and slalom, he also took the victory in the combination at Feldberg in the Black Forest in the same year. In addition, he ended the season with a slalom win at the Arlberg-Kandahar races in St. Anton. In the winter of 1933, he won the Tyrolean downhill skiing championship and the cross-country skiing competition at the Vorarlberg championships.

Civic center The civic center is coextensive with what is known as the Capitol District in downtown Honolulu. The official seat of governance for the Honolulu County is located within the district at Honolulu Hale, established in the 1920s as a city hall structure and houses the chambers of the mayor of Honolulu and the Honolulu City Council. In the 1960s and 1970s, Mayor Frank Fasi developed the modern civic center as it is known today. He took controversial and aggressive measures to reclaim property, demolish massive concrete structures in the area, construct underground parking facilities and open a green campus above ground with manicured lawns and specially commissioned sculpted artwork. He also oversaw the construction of new government buildings, to house the departments that fell within mayoral jurisdiction. The most prominent of those new buildings were the Honolulu Municipal Building and Hale Makai, the headquarters of the Honolulu Police Department. Civic centers were also constructed off the Capitol District campus, including the Kapiolani Bandstand, Neal S. Blaisdell Center, and the Waikƒ´kƒ´ Shell.

Fasi, Honolulu's public transit system has been twice honored by the American Public Transportation Association bestowing the title of \\"America's Best Transit System\\" for 1994-1995 and 2000-2001\\\\. Oahu Transit Services' \\"TheBus\\" operates 107 routes with a fleet of 525 buses. In 2004, construction had started on a bus rapid transit (BRT) system using dedicated rights-of-way for buses. The system, proposed by then Mayor Jeremy Harris, was expected to link the Iwilei neighborhood with Waikiki. However, former Mayor Mufi Hannemann largely dismantled the BRT system and deployed its buses along other express bus routes. Most buses in TheBus roster were manufactured by Gillig Corporation of Hayward, California, with the exception of articulated buses made by New Flyer, the latter also providing standard buses, likewise from Nova Bus. Rail Currently, there is no urban rail transit system in Honolulu, although electric street railways were used during the early days of Honolulu's history. The last major attempt was called the Honolulu Area Rail Rapid Transit project, popularly known as HART. Proposed in 1968 by Mayor Neal S. Blaisdell and supported by his successor, Frank Fasi, HART was originally envisioned as a line from Pearl City to Hawaii Kai. By 1980, however, the project's length was cut to an segment between the University of Hawaii at Manoa and Honolulu International Airport. In the wake of proposed budget cuts by President Ronald Reagan, including the elimination of all funding for transit projects by 1985, newly elected Mayor Eileen Anderson cancelled the project in 1981 and returned grants and funding to their sources, arguing the project would break her vow of fiscal responsibility. Several attempts had been made since Anderson's cancellation of HART to construct a fixed rail mass transit system. All attempts stalled in Honolulu City Council hearings until in 2004, the city, county and state approved development of an action plan for a system to be built in several phases. The initial line proposed linking Kapolei in West Oahu to the University of Hawaii at Manoa. However, on December 22, 2006 the city council approved a fixed-guideway system meant to accommodate either rail or buses, running from Kapolei in West Oahu to Ala Moana, with spurs into Waikiki and Manoa. On November 4, 2008 50.6% (156,151) of Honolulu County voted to approve a new $4.5 billion rail project that would connect West Oahu with downtown, Waikiki and University of Hawaii. The trains are planned to be approximately long, electric, steel wheel to steel rail technology and will capable of carrying more than 300 passengers each. The rail project is currently projected to cost $5.27B.Rail costs low-balled, consultant says Hawaii News, Honolulu, Honolulu News, Sports, Editorial, Features, Travel and Business - Honolulu Star-Advertiser - Hawaii Newspaper. Staradvertiser.com. Retrieved September 6, 2013. After early delays and postponed dates from not receiving a final approval from then-Governor Linda Lingle to issues involving burial sites, a ground-breaking ceremony to signal the beginning of construction was held on February 22, 2011. Despite the go-ahead, there were still other legal hurdles as the argument over burial sites continued to be a major issue that lead to court order in 2012 to have construction temporary halted. The project itself was once again a political issue in the 2012 mayoral race with former governor Ben Cayetano entering the race in the hopes of killing the project altogether, while then-mayor Carlisle and his predecessor Caldwell both wanted the project to continue. This would result in Carlisle coming in third in the August 2012 primary and leading to a run-off between Cayetano and Caldwell in the November 2012 general election, with Caldwell defeating Cayetano with the support of groups and the public who wanted the rail project to continue. In December 2012, a court order allowed the rail project to resume in all but the one of the two phases so more burial sites could be uncovered.

History  Gudum Priory was one of three in the isolated sand hills near Lemvig in northwest Jutland under the jurisdiction of the Bishop of Ribe. The original Gudum Priory was built in the valley less than a kilometer southwest of modern Gudum church near what is called the Klosterm√∏lle River as early as 1260 and not later than 1268. The papal recognition letter which permits the Benedictines to establish Gudum Priory was recently discovered, though as yet no particulars are available. The original priory was built on the site of Our Lady Spring (Danish: Vorfrue Kilde) in the valley near the village of Gudum, Denmark which had been inhabited since Viking times. Recent excavations by the University of Holstebro found remnants of four Viking houses at Gudum church which date back to between 800 and 900. An early (1100s) church existed at Gudum, but by 1350 it had become a ruin. A new church was constructed in 1350 in Gothic style with the new and reused materials from the older Romanesque church. Gudum is located in the old administrative district of Hardsyssel which means 'region of the forest dwellers'. Gudum means 'God's dwelling' (Danish:gudhjem) and the name certainly dates back to Viking times. Gudum was the site of the Skodborg District Assembly (Danish:tingsted) until 1608. This made it the 'capital' of the district and brought people together for assembly and markets several times a year. The town sat atride the main road between Lemvig and Viborg, Jutland's capital at the time. The remains of old roads crisscross the region many of them focusing on Gudum. The priory was run by the prioress who organized and administered the day-to-day life of the nuns. A prior was appointed by the bishop to take care of priestly functions required by the nuns. The position was often overlooked or remained vacant. Since the prior lived at the priory, the bishop often appointed an elderly canon or other priest from another house in the area to say mass and hear confession. The post must not have been sought after because it was so often left vacant and the nuns complained to the bishop about the lack of a prior. In 1484 the nuns received permission from Bishop of Ribe Hartvig of Ribe to move the priory next to Gudum Church ostensibly because a flood had destroyed the chapel and 'other buildings' which had fallen into the river. No evidence remains of the original priory site. The consecration of the new priory to St. Thomas Vigilie took place in 1492. The priory was built onto the north side of the church. While no trace of the priory remain, it may be supposed that it was built in Gothic style with pointed arches and constructed out of red bricks, the most common building material of the time. It was a small house, perhaps no more than 20 nuns, if that many, at any given time. Stubber Priory, a close neighbor, often had only ten or twelve, which may be more accurate for Gudum as well. Excavations have shown that the priory had four buildings, three connected to the north of the church and a separate building across a courtyard. The entire priory was walled to separate the nuns from the rest of the town. The church served the local town as well, so the nuns had their own entrance and partitioned section of the nave. The priory archive, mostly letter of gifts to Gudum, was preserved and even registered in 1592, but since that time all but one of the letters was lost or destroyed. Residents recounted that the letters were tossed out on the ground were gathered by local farmers and used to wipe off farm tools. The single remaining letter is a 1496 gift of property for the saying of prayers for a deceased parish resident. Gudum Priory owned much of what is now the parish of Gudum as well as other scattered income properties in the area. A 1520 court case involving the priory and nobleman Christian M√∏rk over the boundary between Koksholm and √òsterg√•rd farms was resolved. The priory owned the River Mill Danish:√Ö M√∏lle) after which the local river is named. It was built in 1495 by the diocese for the benefit of the priory. =Reformation= The Reformation brought about the end of Gudum Priory when Denmark became Lutheran in 1536. Christen Ovesen Skram, was named as \\"Superintendent\\" of Gudum Priory in 1534, which indicates that the parish had become Lutheran. The priory remained open until 1573, when the nuns were moved to Mariager Abbey in Djursland. A few of the nuns were too old or ill to move, so the district governor (Danish:lensmand) was required to pay for their upkeep until they died. The priory buildings and estate were broken up into several farms. The priory itself became Gudum Kloster Farm (Danish:Gudum Klosterg√•rd). The priory and church tower burned down in 1631 leaving no evidence it had existed. The church survived and the old entrances for the nuns and original low windows can still be seen. A bell tower was added to the medieval church after the 1631 fire. A flood on the river in 1838 resulted in the relocation of the mill to its present location just outside Humlum on the Lemvig Road.

Bancroft Ranch House is a historic house museum at 9050 Memory Lane in Spring Valley, California. Built in 1856, it is the oldest Anglo- American building in the town. From 1885 until his death in 1918, it was home to Hubert Howe Bancroft, a pioneering historian of the western United States, Mexico, and Central America. Now managed by the local historical society as a museum, it was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1962 for its association with Bancroft, and was registered as a California Historical Landmark in 1958. Description and history The Bancroft Ranch House is located in western Spring Valley, just northwest of Bancroft County Park. It is accessed via Memory Lane, a short lane off Bancroft Drive. The house is a single-story adobe structure, to which a frame addition has been made. Each of these sections is covered by a gabled roof with wooden shingles. The roof of the adobe section extends over an open veranda area, where it is supported by square posts. The oldest portion of the adobe has embedded in it curved timbers, which were salvaged from the Clarissa Andrews, a coal freighter and packet ship wrecked in San Diego Bay. With The property also contains a natural spring, named El aguaje de San Jorge (St. George's Spring) by the Spanish, after which the community of Spring Valley is named.Ken Kramer's About San Diego, KPBS-TV, 2010 The house was built in 1856 by Augustus Ensworth. Upon Enworth's death, the property was sold in 1865 to Rufus King Porter, son of the founder of Scientific American. Porter added a kitchen, a dining room, and two bedrooms. He later sold the property to historian Hubert Howe Bancroft in 1885. Bancroft expanded the property, eventually owning more than , which he operated as a gentleman's farm. After Bancroft's death in 1918, his heirs divided the estate. The portion including the house was acquired in 1940 by the Spring Valley Chamber of Commerce. The house was rehabilitated in 1962, and was opened as a museum the following year. Now located in the adjacent park is a rock structure which Bancroft built in the 1880s as a schoolhouse and fireproof storage house for his historical materials. Bancroft is best known for a massive 39-volume history, published between 1882 and 1890. The history covers the entire area of western North America, from coastal Alaska to Mexico and Central America. The library Bancroft amassed in pursuit of his research contains more than 60,000 volumes, and is now located at the University of California, Berkeley.

We can not discuss this club without recalling its group of the first half of the '70s that coach Hmid Dhib had patiently built around Mohieddine Habita ‚Äì nicknamed the \\"Arabic Pele\\" by the Libyans, on the occasion of the Arab nation's Cup (called Palestine Cup) disputed in Tripoli in August 1973, where Habita scored six goals and was named the \\"Tunisian Pel√©\\" by President Habib Bourguiba while receiving the victorious Tunisian team. Also Ali Kaabi, Farouk Ben Sliman and Houcine Ayari or the team shaped by Bernard Blaut, who won the Cup in Tunisia in 1988 and lost the championship in special conditions. In all COT spends 27 seasons in the first division (professional level). But, like all districts clubs, the club installed in Mellassine, a popular district of Tunis, was unable to resist the deman and has plummeted in three years to end up in the fourth division in 2007‚Äì2008 before rising again to CLP-3, and reaching the quarter-finals of the President Cup this year. It's hard for COT to keep their fans because the crisis and especially because the club is located in the Capital Tunis, where the most popular Tunisian team Club Africain and the most successful Tunisian team Esp√©rance Tunis are also located. History It was in July 1945 that the ancestor of the COT, En-Najah Sports was created through a group formed around Mustapha Achour and include the cyclist Jilani Ben Othman and sports director Belhassen Chaar. The club merged with El Hilal Sports du Den-Den (EHSDD) to form the \\"Club Olympique Tunisien\\" (Tunisian Olympic Club) in 1960, and then with the \\"Association sportive des traminots\\" (Sports Association of traminots) on 29 June 1966, forming Club Olympique des Transports. =Colours and badges= CO Transports supporters help is needed to develop this section.

The report also said there was no deferred maintenance funding for the 2012-2013 school year.\\"Simi Elementary School Accountability Report Card\\" Simi Valley Unified School District 2012-13 school activity published in January 2014'  Random Drug Testing  The board voted in 2014 to offer random drug testing of high school students whose parents or legal guardians voluntarily sign them up. In 2002, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of mandatory drug testing by public schools of students participating in extracurricular activities.  Declining enrollment: School closures  Beginning in 1995, the district flirted with closing schools due to what was then early on-set declining enrollment. Simi Elementary School, in the 1990s, was already considered first for school closure due to high maintenance costs and its small size. Other schools considered at the time were Sycamore, Mountain View, and Justin Elementary schools - all due to declining enrollment. Ultimately, the district voted to not close any school due to backlash from the community, as they had previously closed four schools prior in the 1980s. Since the 2003-2004 school year, the school district has experienced a decline in enrollment (along with the rest of the state of California). Enrollment peaked at nearly 22,000 in 2003 and was down to about 18,000 in 2013. After reviewing the enrollment figures, a committee consisting of administrators, teachers, parents and community members recommended closing three schools. After hearing public testimony, the committee came to the decision January 14, 2014 to not close any schools and disbanded. On January 31, 2014, Simi Elementary School was notified of possible relocation of the school due to the overall condition and safety of the campus. Simi Elementary was built in 1926 as the first school in the city. Ventura County has named it a Historical Landmark.Cultural Heritage Board. \\"Ventura County Landmark Map\\" County of Ventura Planning Division Accessed 5 February 2014Simi Elementary School & Bungalows was designed by architect Arthur G. Lindley and was designated County Landmark # 139 in August 1990. The school was built in 1926 by Lutz Construction Company as a part of Community Center and has been in continuous use. The bungalows were built from lumber from the original Simi School (1890). The issues at hand regarding the facility and infrastructure are: * Broken water mains * Possible broken sewer line under a classroom which has caused the floor to sink * Gas lines underground which are old and brittle causing periodic gas leaks * Deteriorating roofs * A septic tank which is in danger of collapsing * Potential asbestos * Potential rust in water lines * Potential mold * Potential lead The Inspection was contracted through LI & Associates, Inc.LI & Associates, Inc.

In the latest report dated January 7, 2014, the company, regarding the administrative building, stated, \\"During process of our seismic retrofit design on this building, we learned that this building does not have a valid DSA permit. Therefore, this building cannot be used by student per California State regulations.\\" Due to the cost of needed repairs to the Simi Elementary campus, SVUSD decided to close Simi Elementary. On February 4, 2014, the board voted 4-1 to relocate Simi Elementary to Mountain View Elementary as of February 18, 2014. The school continued to function as a separate school until the end of the 2013-2014 school year. In the fall of the 2014-2015 school year, SVUSD made a recommendation to close Abraham Lincoln and Justin Elementary school due to a decline in enrollment and approved the closure in January 2015.

It is sometimes also known as cumulative gain or (confusingly) elevation gain, or often in the context of mountain travel, simply gain. Another commonly used phrase is total ascent. Elevation losses are not counted in this measure. Cumulative elevation gain, along with round-trip distance, is arguably the most important value used in quantifying the strenuousness of a trip. This is because hiking on flat land (zero elevation gain) is significantly easier than hiking up and down a large mountain with the same round-trip distance. Computation No matter the shape of the hills, as long as they are each 100 vertical feet tall, then if one were to hike up each hill, the cumulative elevation gain would be 5 √ó () = . The downhill sections are not counted. In the simplest case of a trip where hikers only travel up on their way to a single summit, the cumulative elevation gain is simply given by the difference in the summit elevation and the starting elevation. For example, if one starts hiking at a trailhead with elevation , and continues up to a summit of , the cumulative elevation gain is only 5000 ft ‚àí 1000 ft = The loss of elevation on the descent is not relevant, because only increases in elevation are considered in this measure. However, when climbing a mountain with some \\"ups-and-downs\\", or traversing several mountains, one must take into account every \\"up\\" along the whole route. This even means that the (usually small) uphills on the descent must be counted. For example, consider a mountain whose summit is in elevation, but somewhere on the way up, the trail goes back down . If starting at an elevation of , one gains on the ascent (not 4000 feet, because 250 feet is lost and then has to be \\"regained\\"). Additionally, this section of the trail on the overall ascent that goes down 250 feet subsequently goes up on the descent, so it is counted as another gain in elevation. Therefore, the cumulative elevation gain for the trip both up and down the mountain along the same path is . If one hikes over five hills of 100 vertical feet each, the cumulative elevation gain is 5 √ó () = . Only the uphill sections are counted, not the downhills. This concept explains why travel on terrain which has more frequent and sharp \\"ups-and-downs\\", or is generally more rugged, is usually significantly more strenuous even if the highest absolute elevation reached on any peak is not very great. Technology Cumulative elevation gain can be recorded using GPS services such as Garmin or Strava.

Designed by Louis Naidorf of Welton Becket Associates, it is one of the city's landmarks. Construction began soon after British company EMI acquired Capitol Records in 1955, and was completed in April 1956. Located just north of the Hollywood and Vine intersection, the Capitol Records Tower houses the consolidation of Capitol Records' West Coast operations and is home to the recording studios and echo chambers of Capitol Studios. The building is a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument and sits in the Hollywood Boulevard Commercial and Entertainment District. It has been described as the \\"world's first circular office building.\\" The building is known as \\"The House That Nat Built\\" due to the vast numbers of records and amounts of merchandise Nat King Cole sold for the company. Design The building's design is on the graduate school drawings of Lou Naidorf who, as the primary architect, designed the first circular office building when he was 24 years old. The wide curved awnings over windows on each story and the tall spike emerging from the top of the building resembles a stack of records on a turntable with the spindle pointing skyward. The rectangular ground floor is a separate structure, joined to the tower after completion. The 13-story conforms to the zoning height limit in place at the time of its construction. Height restrictions were lifted in 1956. The thirteenth floor of the tower is the \\"Executive Level\\" and is represented by an \\"E\\" in the building's two elevators. =Notable features= The blinking light atop the tower spells out the word \\"Hollywood\\" in Morse code. This was an idea of Capitol's then-president, Alan Livingston, who wanted to advertise Capitol's status as the first record label with a base on the west coast. It was switched on by Leila Morse, granddaughter of Samuel Morse. During 1992, the light blinked \\"Capitol 50,\\" in honor of the label's fiftieth anniversary. A black-and-white graphic of the building appeared on the albums of many Capitol recording artists, with the phrase, \\"From the Sound Capitol of the World\\". In April 2011, Capitol Records and artist Richard Wyatt Jr. restored his Hollywood Jazz Mural on the south wall of the Capitol Records building. Restored in hand-glazed ceramic tile, the mural spans Entitled \\"Hollywood Jazz: 1945-1972\\", this masterpiece presents \\"larger than life\\" images of a number of notable jazz musicians. =Capitol Studios= The building houses the Capitol Studios, a recording facility which includes eight echo chambers engineered by guitarist Les Paul and three main studios, A, B, and C. Frank Sinatra had a close association with the studios, and the Georg Neumann U 47 microphone he carried around with him is there, often used and maintained for studio sessions. The first album recorded in the tower was Frank Sinatra Conducts Tone Poems of Color. In 2012, Studio A received a new AMS Neve 88R mixing console, designed and built for Al Schmitt and Paul McCartney. Recent history In September 2006, EMI sold the tower and adjacent properties for US$50 million to New York developer Argent Ventures. The studio claimed that noise from construction of a condominium threatened it, as well as an underground parking lot by building firm Second Street Ventures would have heavy equipment working within of its renowned underground echo chambers, which are themselves over below ground level. In November 2012, Steve Barnett was announced as the new Chairman and CEO of the Capitol Music Group and the company stated his office would be in the building. This coincided with Capitol Music Group becoming part of Universal Music Group, assuring its new parent company two Los Angeles headquarters. In popular culture * In the 1979 film The Muppet Movie the Muppet gang in their Hippie bus drives past the building on their way to a film studio. * In Earthquake, starring Charlton Heston, an earthquake destroys the building. A clip of this scene is in the pilot episode of Galactica 1980, as Cylon spacecraft fire at the building. * In the 1990 film The Adventures of Ford Fairlane, the protagonists climb down the outside structure of the building while fleeing the antagonist's henchman. * In the music video \\"Closer Than You Know\\" and \\"Touch The Sky\\", Hillsong United performed at the top of the tower. * In the 1994 arcade game Primal Rage, the building appears in ruins. * In the 1996 film Independence Day, the building is destroyed by an alien ship hovering directly above it. * In the 2004 film The Day After Tomorrow, a tornado damages the building. * In the 2004 video game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, the building appears in the city of Los Santos as the Blastin' Fools Records Building.

His name was sometimes given as simply \\"Jo√£o C√¢ndido\\" or \\"Jean Candido\\" in foreign articles.  Early life  Jo√£o C√¢ndido Felisberto was born in Encruzilhada do Sul, Rio Grande do Sul, to a poor Afro-Brazilian family in 1880. His father and mother were former slaves. He entered the Brazilian Navy in 1894 at the age of 13. left The conditions for Brazilian sailors at the time were harsh, and being black, Felisberto suffered prejudice from the white officers in the Brazilian Navy. Several Brazilian sailors had been sent to Newcastle-Upon-Tyne in England during the two year period taken for the construction of the dreadnought . Jo√£o C√¢ndido arrived there in September 1909 and left in January 1910 as part of the crew of the newly commissioned Minas Geraes. It was while experiencing the living conditions and increased freedoms of Newcastle that Jo√£o C√¢ndido realised how unacceptable conditions in the Brazilian Navy were.The Whip Rebellion - Jose Luiz Pereira Da Costa - page 2Jornal Gazeta de Not√≠cias, December 31 1912 The sailors had many secret meetings in Rio de Janeiro, planning a strategy to stop the corporal punishment still imposed in the new Navy, which had received two new modern battleships in 1910.Newspaper headlines from Gazeta de Not√≠cias, 31 December 1912.In November 1910, the flogging of a sailor, against Navy regulations (250 strokes instead of the allowed 25 strokes), was a contributing factor to the revolt, known in Brazil as \\"Revolta da Chibata\\" (\\"Revolt of the Lash\\"). Sailors took control of two Brazilian battleships, Minas Geraes and S√£o Paulo, both built in England, as well as two other major warships. Their demands included the abolition of torture as a form of punishment and improved living conditions in the Brazilian Navy. Jo√£o C√¢ndido was the leader of the movement. The new Brazilian president, Hermes da Fonseca, promised the end of \\"Chibata\\" and approved an amnesty, but the government later went back on this promise. In the revolt's aftermath Felisberto and many of his fellow mutineers were either arrested, tortured or murdered in prison. Felisberto himself was tortured, and also contracted tuberculosis, but he recovered after some months and was eventually released. The Brazilian press nicknamed him \\"Almirante Negro\\", or the \\"Black Admiral\\", for his actions. Later life After his release, he sank into poverty and experienced discrimination, working in a harbor on a very low salary. He was arrested again in 1930 but was soon released. In 1933 he joined the integralist movement. In 1938 an integralist uprising was easily crushed by the Brazilian military, with fewer than twenty deaths, and the group was outlawed.Jo√£o C√¢ndido, 1963. With Brazil at war with the fascist Axis powers from 1942 onwards, integralism became a small and powerless movement. Germany's defeat in 1945 reduced integralism to very little importance. Jo√£o C√¢ndido Felisberto said in 1968 that he was proud to be an integralist. After living in ostracism in the Brazilian city of S√£o Jo√£o de Meriti and being persecuted by the Brazilian Navy, he died of cancer in 1969 in Rio de Janeiro, at the age of 89. Legacy and statue The Lash Uprising, which was sparked by the Brazilian Navy's use of torture, ended with Felisberto and many of his followers imprisoned and tortured. The revolt was cited later by labor organizers as an \\"heroic example of worker struggle\\".Andrews, George Reid. Afro-Latin America, 1800-2000 A statue of Jo√£o C√¢ndido Felisberto was erected in Rio de Janeiro. His life was portrayed in a movie, Mem√≥rias da Chibata (Chibata Memories), in 2006, retelling his fight against the Lash with actors, and a documentary called Cem Anos Sem Chibata (Cem Anos Sem Chibata), a coproduction with EBC, in 2010.

Most of the prostitutes are foreign nationals. Law enforcement usually deports prostitutes or makes them sign a \\"good conduct pledge\\" before release. Those running prostitution rings normally receive jail sentences. There are allegations that some police received bribes from brothels and warn them of upcoming raids. Different nationalities of prostitutes and their controlling pimps tend to be found in different areas. Filipinos in Ahmadi Governorate, Ethiopians in Hawalli Governorate, and Indians, Sri Lankans and Bangladeshis in Farwaniya Governorate and part of Salmiya. Indians and Chinese work the malls in Salmiya. There are also Arab and European prostitutes in the country. Brothels are known to exist in Al Jahra, Hawalli, Jleeb Al-Shuyoukh, Salmiya, Fahaheel, Fintas and Jabriya. Sex trafficking Kuwait is a destination country for men and women subjected to forced prostitution. Kuwait's sponsorship law‚Äîwhich ties a migrant worker's legal residence and valid immigration status to an employer, restricts workers‚Äô movements and penalises them for leaving abusive workplaces. Sources report runaway domestic workers are sometimes exploited in forced prostitution by agents or criminals, who manipulate their illegal status. In 2016, the government investigated six potential sex trafficking cases and prosecuted 15 suspects, compared to six cases investigated and 20 suspects prosecuted during the previous reporting period. Seven prosecutions from 2015 remained pending at the close of the reporting year. The government achieved nine convictions, including one Kuwaiti citizen‚Äîunder the anti- trafficking law, on par with eight convictions the previous year; five accused traffickers were acquitted. The United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks Kuwait as a 'Tier 2 Watch List' country.

Early years Though he is naturally right handed, Searcy was born with osteomyelitis in his right shoulder. Thus, he does some tasks with his left hand, including throwing a baseball. Hailing from Knoxville, Tennessee, Searcy attended the University of Tennessee. With a team leading 2.45 earned run average (ERA) and 95.1 innings pitched, he led the Tennessee Volunteers baseball team to a second-place finish in the 1984 Southeastern Conference Baseball Tournament. Following one more season playing college ball, he was drafted by the Detroit Tigers in the third round of the 1985 Major League Baseball Draft. In , Searcy went 11-6 with a 3.30 ERA and 139 strikeouts over 27 starts for the Glens Falls Tigers in their inaugural season. A knee injury limited Searcy to just 53.1 innings in . Injuries aside, however, the Tigers were reluctant to part with their young pitcher at the 1987 trade deadline when they were in need of a veteran arm for the major league club's playoff drive. Instead, they opted to ship fellow minor league pitcher John Smoltz to the Atlanta Braves for Doyle Alexander. He returned healthy in to go 13-7 with a 2.59 ERA and 176 strikeouts for the Toledo Mud Hens to earn International League Pitcher of the Year honors and a call up to the majors in late August. Detroit Tigers Searcy made his major league debut on August 29, against the Chicago White Sox at old Comiskey Park. Starting, he pitched seven plus strong innings, but was tagged with the loss. In his second and final start of the season, Searcy faced six Milwaukee Brewers batters, and gave up three runs (2 earned) while only retiring one batter before being lifted. Arthroscopic surgery on his left shoulder kept Searcy off the mound til June of . After eighteen rehab starts for the Lakeland Tigers and Toledo, Searcy made his first major league appearance of the season on August 20, starting against the New York Yankees. After four relief appearances, Searcy made a second start against the Minnesota Twins on September 17 to earn his first major league win. He split the season between Toledo and Detroit. After winning his first start with the Tigers, his record fell to 1-5 with a 5.43 ERA before he would earn a second win. Searcy won a spot in Detroit's starting rotation out of Spring training . After failing to get out of the third inning in three of his five starts, Searcy was demoted to the bullpen. Searcy was still unable to find his groove as a reliever, and was demoted to the minors. With this being his seventh minor league season, he was granted free agency. Philadelphia Phillies After initially talking with the Los Angeles Dodgers, Searcy signed with the Philadelphia Phillies on July 15, 1991. Coincidentally, his first appearance for the Phillies came against the Dodgers at Veterans Stadium. He entered the game in the fifth inning with the Phillies trailing 6-3, and allowed one earned run in two innings. The Phillies, meanwhile, scored four runs in the bottom of the fifth and another in the sixth to earn Searcy the win in his first National League appearance. His 2-1 record and 4.15 ERA with the Phillies was good enough to earn him a one-year contract for . After ten appearances with no wins or losses and a 6.10 ERA, he was traded to the Dodgers for outfielder Stan Javier on July 2. Searcy spent the rest of the season assigned to the Dodgers' triple A Pacific Coast League affiliate, the Albuquerque Dukes. After the season, he signed a minor league deal with the Baltimore Orioles with a non-roster invitation to Spring training for the open fifth starter and long reliever spots for season.

Portland, Oregon, has been home to many baseball teams, dating back to the 19th century. Early Portland baseball: 1866‚Äì1883 The first organized baseball team on record in the Pacific Northwest was founded in Portland, when on May 28, 1866, the Pioneer Baseball Club of East Portland was created. Known as a gentleman's group at the time, it composed merchants, doctors, lawyers and farmers from rural Portland.Portland Baseball. pdxhistory.com. Retrieved May 4, 2008. Professional players were not allowed to be part of the club. In fact, members had to pay dues in order to be a part of the club. Over the next year many clubs were created throughout the Portland area. The Pioneers of East Portland invited clubs from throughout the region to a meeting in February 1868 to form what became The Oregon, Washington and Idaho Territories Association of Base Ball Players. The association consisted of five founding clubs‚Äîthey were the Pioneers, the Portland Spartans, the Highland Baseball Club, the Clackamas Club of Oregon City and the Occidentals of Vancouver, Washington. The teams adopted rules that were slightly modified from those approved by the National Association of Base Ball Players in 1863. Professional baseball in Portland: 1883‚Äì1901 In 1884 Joe Buchtel, a player-manager for the Pioneers who is regarded as being largely responsible for making baseball popular in Oregon during the 20th century, started a new team in Portland, the Willamettes of East Portland. In 1890 this team became the Portland Webfeet. It helped organize the first professional league in the region, the Pacific Northwest League. This league consisted of teams from Portland, Seattle, Tacoma and Spokane, and began attracting players from around the nation.Oregon Stadium Campaign. Oregon & Portland's Baseball History. Retrieved May 6, 2008. In 1891 the Webfeet won the league championship, playing teams from as far as the California League, which included Sacramento, San Francisco, and San Jose. This version of the Pacific Northwest League folded in the second half of the 1892 season due to the onset of a nationwide economic depression known as the Panic of 1893. An attempt was made in 1896 to restart the Pacific Northwest League, which was alternately known as the New Pacific League. Portland fielded a team in again in the league, this time going by the name of the Portland Gladiators. The season only lasted through June, but the Gladiators did end up winning the league championship with a 19‚Äì9 record. Another new team gained notoriety in Portland in 1886, the Portland Monograms. Consisting largely of neighborhood kids from Central and North Central High Schools, this team was very successful. After defeating teams from Oregon, they went on to win against the Washington State Championship team from Tacoma, earning them the right to go to San Francisco to play the California Champions in a game called the Pacific Tournament. The Monograms played two games against the California Champions, tying the first 12‚Äì12 and losing the second 16‚Äì14. A new era in Portland baseball: 1901‚Äì1902 Joe Tinker played for the Webfooters before a career in the major leagues. In the spring of 1901 a new baseball park was constructed at NW Vaughn Street and NW 24th Avenue that would become known as Vaughn Street Park. This year also saw the second resurrection of the Pacific Northwest League. A group of area businessmen, spearheaded by William H. Lucas, also created the Portland Baseball Club and put together a team to play in the Pacific Northwest League, calling them the Webfooters. This team included Joe Tinker and won the League Championship in their first season. Following the creation of the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues in 1901 (renamed Minor League Baseball in 1999), the PNL, and thus the Portland Webfoots, became a Class B league beginning in the 1902 season. In 1902 the team finished fourth in the league. On December 10, 1902, Henry Harris, the owner of the California League's San Francisco team announced that the Pacific Northwest League team from Portland and a new team from Seattle were joining with the California League to create the Pacific Coast League. Pacific Coast League: 1903-1917 The Portland Baseball Club began play in the PCL in 1903, being known as the Portland Browns. Portland finished fifth in the league at the end of the 1903 season. In 1904 the Portland team, finished the season with a 74‚Äì136 record, setting a PCL record for the most losses in a season. The Pacific Northwest League attempted to compete against the new Pacific Coast League in their inaugural year. Replacing the team they lost in Portland, as well as placing teams in Los Angeles and San Francisco, they renamed themselves the Pacific National League. The new team in Portland that year, the Green Gages, only played until July 1 when they moved to Salt Lake City, and changed their name to the Elders. Four other teams from the league stopped playing altogether before the end of the season, leaving only four teams in the league. By the end of the 1905, the old Pacific Northwest/National League was gone for good. The PCL continued on though, as did the Portland Baseball Club. After the 1904 season, the PCL joined the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues, thus making Portland a Class A league team (now called AAA Baseball). Also after the 1904 season, Portland outfielder Walter McCredie and his uncle Judge William McCredie purchased the team. The new owners changed the name of the team the Giants for the 1905 season, and Walter became the team's manager while continuing to play. As a result of a newspaper contest, the team was renamed the Beavers (Oregon is the \\"Beaver State\\") in time for the 1906 season. The newly named Portland Beavers won their first PCL pennant in 1906, finishing 19¬Ω games over runner-up Seattle. Also in 1906 Beavers player Mike Mitchell led the league in home runs, setting a league record for the least home runs hit by a league leader, hitting it out only six times. Vean Gregg played for the Portland Beavers before an MLB career that lasted until 1925. The Beavers finished last in 1907 and second in 1908 and 1909. In 1910 Portland won another pennant being led by the pitching of Vean Gregg and Gene Krapp. Gregg finished the season with a 32‚Äì18 record and 14 shutouts while Krapp had a 29‚Äì16 record for the season. Portland repeated at PCL champs in 1911 fielding four 20-game- winning pitchers. In 1912, Judge McCredie helped get a new 12,000-seat grandstand built at Vaughn Street Park. His obituary later read that the ballpark was \\"the sensation of baseball, because it inaugurated a minor league precedent of providing individual grandstand seats, which fellow magnates called an extravagance and a dangerous innovation.\\" The year 1912 also saw a small change in the classification of leagues from the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues, as they made the top-tier league AA, which the PCL and the Portland Beavers moved into from the previous top tier Class A league. During the 1910s the Beavers developed some working relationships with other teams. From 1911 to 1914 the Portland Beavers had their own farm team who played in the Northwest League (renamed the Pacific Coast International League in 1918). The Class B team shared the use of Vaughn Street Park and was known as the Portland Pippins in 1911, but changed their name to the Portland Colts in 1912. During the 1914 season the Colts moved to the Seattle area and finished their last season as the Ballard Pippins before folding. Portland also had an informal relationship with the Cleveland Indians through much of the 1910s that saw many future major league stars come through Portland to fine tune their skills. In 1913 and 1914 Portland played well, winning the pennant in both seasons. Though the 1915 Beavers featured Stan Coveleski, the team didn't fare too well, and started into a tailspin that would last for over a decade. The year also marked the end of their relationship with the Cleveland Indians. With America's entry into World War I, restrictions were placed on travel, such that the Beavers withdrew from the PCL for the 1918 season, playing instead in the Class B Pacific Coast International League. The team was known as the Portland Buckaroos and finished their shortened season (play was stopped on July 7 due to the war) in second place 1¬Ω games back of Seattle. Ironically, the PCL ceased play just a week later as they too were unable to continue play due to the travel restrictions. Due to the Beaver's withdrawal from the PCL, the league offered Sacramento, California, a franchise to replace the Portland team, while the McCredie's continued to own the baseball club in Portland. The new team in Sacramento was known as the Sacramento Senators, and could be considered a continuation of the original Portland Baseball Club. Return to the Pacific Coast League: 1919-1972 While a member of the Cleveland Indians in 1920, Elmer Smith became the first player to hit a grand slam in the World Series. He later moved down to play two seasons for the Beavers. With the McCredies still at the helm, Portland was offered the opportunity to become an expansion franchise and re-entered the PCL in 1919. The team finished in seventh place, only ahead of last place Seattle who was also an expansion team that year. Portland finished in last place in 1920 and again in 1921. After the 1921 season, the McCredies sold the team to Walter Klepper who had been president of the Seattle team. Klepper brought in Jim Thorpe who played with the Beavers for the 1922 season, paying him an unheard of minor league salary of $1000 per month. It wasn't long, though, before Klepper was in the middle of a dispute with Baseball Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis. Klepper had brought Seattle player- manager Bill Kenworthy down to manage the Beavers, but Seattle claimed Kenworthy was still under contract and that Klepper had tampered in the matter. Landis suspended Klepper until January 1, 1925, and declared Kenworthy ineligible to play or manage Portland until the 1924 season.Minor League Baseball History: Top 100 Teams According to the book \\"The Portland Beavers\\" by Kip Carlson and Paul Andresen, \\"The feisty Klepper went to court and had the decision overturned, supposedly the only time that Landis ever had a ruling reversed.\\" Kenworthy did manage the Beavers in 1924, replacing popular player-manager Jim Middleton. However, he was fired mid-season, as he was not able to generate support from the players. The 1924 season was also noteworthy in that Mickey Cochrane played on the team. After the 1924 season, the Beavers officially became a farm team for a major league team when Philadelphia Athletics owners John and Tom Shibe purchased the Beavers as well as Vaughn Street Park. Despite having Duffy Lewis on the team in 1925 (winning the PCL batting title), Elmer Smith in 1926 and 1927 (leading the PCL in home runs in 1926 and all of minor league baseball in home runs in 1927) and Ike Boone in 1928, the Beavers continued to finish in the bottom half of the league. Longtime head groundskeeper Rocky Benevento started working for the Beavers in 1927. Benevento was so popular with the fans that they took up a collection for him in 1956 to send him to the World Series. Benevento retired at the end of the 1966 season and was given a new car. When Benevento died in 1969, Portland newspaper The Oregonian stated, \\"He adored kids...he loved baseball...and most of all he loved people.\\" His funeral had an overflowing crowd that included Oregon Governor Tom McCall. Benevento's stayed with the team 40 years, spanning 30 managerial changes and five ownership changes. While the former location of Vaughn Street Park is now a parking lot, there is a plaque honoring Benevento for his efforts in furthering baseball in Portland. In 1929 the Beavers changed their name to the Portland Ducks, bearing a duck on their uniform, and were also occasionally known as the Portland Rosebuds. The name change didn't change the team's luck, as they finished with a 90‚Äì112 record. Long time radio broadcaster Rollie Truitt also joined the team's staff, and worked for the team for 35 years, spanning 28 managerial changes and five ownership changes. Truitt would later be known as the \\"Dean of Pacific Coast League broadcasters.\\" In 1930 the team reverted to the Beavers name, but would occasionally be referred to as the Ducks for over decade. The highlight of the Beavers last-place 1930 season was William Rhiel's unassisted triple play, the last recorded in PCL history. Philadelphia Athletics In 1931 team President Tom Turner bought the team from the Shibe brothers and the team took a turn for the positive. Ed Coleman led the PCL in hits and runs batted in, and the team finished in third winning 100 games. The team continued to improve in 1932, winning Portland its first pennant since 1914. The team finished second in 1933. Turner brought Walter McCredie back to manager the team in 1934, but he died early in the season and the team fell to the bottom half of the league. Following the 1934 season, E. J. Shefter bought the team from Turner. The team improved in 1935 finishing one game over .500, and then won the pennant in 1936, finishing but 1¬Ω games over runner-up Oakland, then winning the postseason series to capture the crown. In 1937 the Beavers finished in fourth place, but made it to the playoffs defeating San Francisco in the first round before losing to the San Diego team featuring a young Ted Williams. The team finished sixth in 1938 before finishing in last place from 1939‚Äì1942. The 1940 team was so bad, finishing 56-122, that they were still 25 games behind the seventh place team (the league had eight teams at that time). In 1943 William Klepper, with partner George Norgan buying a minority share, purchased the Beavers. The team came back that season with their first winning record since 1937. The management of the team began referring to the team as the \\"Lucky Beavers\\" and Vaugh Street Park was known as \\"Lucky Beaver Stadium.\\" With the United States firmly involved in World War II, local radio station KXL sold over $300,000 in war bonds in 1943 to fund the building of a bomber for the war that would be dubbed \\"The Lucky Beaver\\". At the time, the available pool of baseball players in the nation was ravaged. Somehow though, the Beavers still moved up in the league, finishing second in 1944. In 1945 the Beavers brought another pennant to Portland being skippered by player-manager Marv Owen. Despite winning the pennant, the team lost to San Francisco in the first round of the playoffs. To commemorate Portland's 1945 pennant win, Portland held a banquet at the Multnomah Hotel (now the downtown Portland Embassy Suites). Oregon Governor Earl Snell presented a commemorative watch and gold and diamond ring to each player at the banquet. The watches were given to the players because L.H. Gregory of The Oregonian requested that fans donate money to a fund for the purpose. Gregory did this because he felt it was not right that no memento was given to the players from the 1936 championship team. Following the 1945 season, Norgan purchased Klepper's share of the team, becoming the team's new owner. In 1946 the Beavers fell to the bottom half of the league, finishing in seventh place, 41 games out of first. In 1947 Eddie Basinski joined the Beavers, and they finished third, losing to the Los Angeles Angels in the first round of the playoffs. The team drew a record of 421,000 fans that season. This record would stand for the Beavers until the 2001 season when AAA Baseball returned to Portland. In 1948 the team finish fifth, followed by a sixth-place finish in 1949. The 1949 season began the integration of the Pacific Coast League as Frankie Austin and Luis Marques became Beavers. Beginning with the 1950 season the Beavers finished fourth for four straight years. Clay Hopper, who had been Jackie Robinson's manager when he played for the Montreal Royals in 1946, was named the team's manager in 1952. This year also marked the first year the Pacific Coast League, and the Portland Beavers, were classified by the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues as an \\"Open League.\\" The open league was a step above AAA, and was an attempted by the Pacific Coast League to be considered the third major league. Plans for a new ballpark were announced by the team in 1953. Originally the team planned to build a new stadium at 82nd & Holgate in Southeast Portland. Due to the Korean War, among other issues, the stadium never came to fruition. In 1954 the team dropped again to the bottom of the league. After the 1954 season the team went up for sale via public stock, which resulted in 2,400 new owners for the 1955 season. With the change the Beavers rose to fifth place, only nine games back of first. In 1956, the Beavers left Vaughn Street Park to move into 25,000-seat Multnomah Stadium, eventually renamed Civic Stadium. Throughout most of the 1960s, the Beavers were the AAA affiliate of the American League Cleveland Indians, nurturing such future stars as \\"Sudden\\" Sam McDowell, Lou \\"Mad Dog\\" Piniella, and Luis \\"El Gigante\\" Tiant. Later major league affiliations included Minnesota and Philadelphia. Independent baseball in Portland: 1973‚Äì1977 After 1972, in which the Beavers drew fewer than 92,000 fans for the entire season, the team left Portland for Spokane. The Class A Portland Mavericks filled the void left by the departure of the Beavers. The Mavericks played in the short-season Northwest League, with a schedule running from mid-June through August. They won four division titles in their five-year history (second place in 1974), but never won the league championship. AAA returns to Portland: 1978-1993 The PCL expanded in 1978 and added a new team in Portland, calling themselves the Beavers. The new Beavers played in Civic Stadium through 1992. In 1983, the Beavers won the PCL pennant, the first for Portland in 47 years. Though finishing fourth overall that year, the Beavers defeated the Edmonton Trappers to win the Northern Division title, then bested the Albuquerque Dukes in the finals to capture the flag. After the 1993 season, Beavers owner Joe Buzas moved the team to Salt Lake City, where they became the Salt Lake Buzz, and later the Stingers. Their current nickname is the Bees. Northwest League baseball: 1994‚Äì2000 For the first time since 1899, Portland was without a baseball team for the 1994 season. The departure of the PCL did eventually bring about the return of the short-season Northwest League. Following their inaugural season in 1994, the Class A Bend Rockies relocated to the now available market of Portland in 1995. The Portland Rockies played in the Rose City for the next six seasons and served an important role for the city, whose demand for a major league team was growing. Portland's support for the Rockies paved the way for the return of AAA baseball in 2001. The Beavers return: 2000-2010 Following the 2000 season, the Los Angeles Dodgers and San Diego Padres swapped AAA teams. The Albuquerque Dukes (a charter franchise of the PCL under the name Los Angeles Angels) moved to Portland, becoming the Beavers, as the San Diego Padres affiliate. As part of the relocation agreement, Civic Stadium was renovated in 2000 and renamed PGE Park. The Dodgers took control of the Padres' Las Vegas Stars, who would be renamed the 51's. The Portland Rockies would move up the Columbia River to Pasco and become the Tri-City Dust Devils in 2001.

In 2009, the city of Portland was awarded a Major League Soccer (MLS) expansion franchise for 2011, to be named the Portland Timbers. The Portland City Council approved a $31 million agreement to renovate PGE Park to a soccer- and football-only stadium, with the condition that a new ballpark be built in Portland for the Beavers by 2011. Memorial Coliseum in the Rose Quarter was an original site for the ballpark; however, it met public opposition. Initial plans called for the new ballpark to be built at the site currently occupied by the Memorial Coliseum, which would have been torn down, but public outcry about demolishing a Portland landmark led Portland mayor Sam Adams to propose a second site in the Rose Quarter area north of Memorial Coliseum. The site, however, proved to be too small. Another location in the Lents neighborhood in southeast Portland was also rejected due to objections from neighbors. In June 2009, the Portland City Council voted to separate the soccer and baseball projects, allowing renovation of PGE Park to proceed without completed plans for a baseball stadium in place. Other locations in the Portland area were considered for the ballpark, including a vacant terminal at the Port of Portland, Delta Park, the Portland Expo Center, Portland Meadows, the Westwood Corporation Heliport site, a building owned by Portland Public Schools near the Rose Quarter, and suburban locations in Beaverton, Clackamas, and Vancouver, Washington. None of these sites progressed past initial discussions. With no suitable Portland location available, in July 2010, Paulson announced that he was putting the team up for sale and relocation, and the Beavers played their last game in Portland on September 6, 2010, beating the Las Vegas 51s 6‚Äì5 before a sellout crowd. Padres owner Jeff Moorad formed a group to buy the team and talked of moving its home games to the Lake Elsinore Diamond in Lake Elsinore, California, until a new stadium in Escondido could be built. Eventually, the group decided to move the team temporarily to Tucson, rename them the Tucson Padres, and then move again to Escondido when the new ballpark is built. Attempts to bring baseball back to Portland: 2011‚Äì2012 On August 2, 2011, the Milwaukie city council unanimously encouraged city staff to continue its efforts to bring professional baseball back to the Portland-Metro area.Learn more about Council's idea to bring baseball to Milwaukie .

It had previously been reported in The Oregonian that the city's economic development director had been working with other individuals and groups to place a 4,000-seat ballpark on a state owned maintenance facility within the city near their border with Portland. A MAX Light Rail line that is under construction will go by the proposed site, which would facilitate access to proposed ballpark, and the two projects are spurring interest in the area by developers. At the October 4, 2011, council meeting, the council directed city staff to engage the community in discussions about the project and authorized them to hire a consultant to further research the project. The Northwest League returns: 2013‚Äìpresent In 2012, it was announced that Portland suburb Hillsboro had reached a deal to relocate the Yakima Bears. Construction of a new 4,500-seat stadium in Hillsboro began later that year and was completed in June 2013, as the home of the renamed Hillsboro Hops. The Hops replaced the Beavers as Portland's minor league baseball team. The team's first game was a 3‚Äì2 road loss to the Salem- Keizer Volcanoes; the team's home opener was notable for several firsts: the team's first sellout, drawing over 4,700 fans; the team's‚Äîand Hillsboro Ballpark's‚Äîfirst home run; and the team's first win.

The painting has imposing dimensions, as it is almost wide by a little over tall. The work is held in the Louvre in Paris.  History of the work  The work was commissioned by Napoleon orally in September 1804, and David started work on it on 21 December 1805 in the former chapel of the College of Cluny, near the Sorbonne, which served as a workshop. Assisted by his student Georges Rouget, he put the finishing touches in January 1808. From 7 February to 21 March 1808, the work was exhibited at the Salon annual painting display in 1808, and it was presented to the Salon decennial prize competition in 1810. The painting remained the property of David until 1819, when it was transferred to the Royal Museums, where it was stored in the reserves until 1837. Then, it was installed in the Chamber Sacre of the museum of the historical Palace of Versailles on the orders of King Louis-Philippe. In 1889, the painting was transferred to the Louvre from Versailles. David was commissioned by American entrepreneurs to paint a full size replica, in 1808, immediately after the release of the original. He began work that year, painting it from memory, but didn't finish until 1822, during his exile in Brussels. The replica was eventually returned to France in 1947, to the original's place in the Palace of Versailles. The painting is a subject of The Public Viewing David's 'Coronation' at the Louvre', a painting by Louis-L√©opold Boilly done in 1810, currently housed at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.  Composition  Sketch by David of Napoleon crowning himself The composition is organised around several axes, and incorporates the rules of neoclassicism. One axis is that which passes through the cross and has a vertical orientation. A diagonal line runs from the pope to the empress. All eyes are turned towards Napoleon, who is the center of the composition. Characters The Characters in the painting # Napoleon I (1769‚Äì1821), is standing, dressed in coronation robes similar to those of Roman emperors. Others are merely passive spectators. In the actual painting it is possible to see the outline of what was originally painted: Napoleon holding the crown above his own head, as if placing on himself. # Jos√©phine de Beauharnais (1763‚Äì1814), is kneeling in a submissive position, as called for in the French Civil Code. She received the crown from the hands of her husband, not the pope. Her robe is decorated with silk according to a contemporary cartoon by Jean-Francois Bony. # Maria Letizia Ramolino (1750‚Äì1836), mother of Napoleon, was placed in the stands by the painter. She occupies a place more important than the pope. Actually, she did not attend the ceremony to protest the friction of Napoleon with his brothers Lucien and Joseph. Napoleon's father, Carlo Buonaparte, died in 1785. Maria Letizia asked the painter to give it a place of honour. In 1808, when Napoleon discovered the canvas completed in the workshop of David, he was enthralled, and expressed his gratitude to the painter who had managed to convey to posterity the tribute paid to the affection he was carrying to a woman who shared with him the burden of his office. # Louis Bonaparte (1778‚Äì1846), who at the beginning of the empire received the title of grand constable, King of Holland, in 1806. He married Hortense de Beauharnais, the daughter of Josephine. # Joseph Bonaparte (1768‚Äì1844), who was not invited and did not attend because of an argument with Napoleon. This is why his mother did not attend either. After the coronation, he received the title of imperial prince. Then he was king of Naples in 1806 and Spain in 1808. # The young Napoleon Charles Bonaparte (1802‚Äì1807), son of Louis Bonaparte and Hortense de Beauharnais. # The sisters of Napoleon. In the replica, the dress of Napoleon's favorite sister will be pink. This is the only change in the replica despite being painted from memory. # Charles-Francois Lebrun (1739‚Äì1824), the third consul alongside Napoleon and Cambac√©r√®s. Under the First Empire, he took the place of prince-architr√©sorier. He holds the sceptre.Turbaned Ottoman ambassador Halet Efendi in The Coronation of Napoleon (detail). # Jean Jacques R√©gis de Cambac√©r√®s (1753‚Äì1824), arch-chancellor prince of the empire. He takes the hand of justice. # Louis-Alexandre Berthier (1753‚Äì1815), minister of war under the Consulate. Marshal Empire in 1805. He keeps the globe surmounted by a cross. # Talleyrand (1754‚Äì1836), grand chamberlain since July 11, 1804. # Joachim Murat (1767‚Äì1815), marshal of empire, king of Naples after 1808, brother-in-law of Napoleon and husband of Caroline Bonaparte. # Pope Pius VII (1742‚Äì1823), was content to bless the coronation. He is surrounded by dignitaries clerics, appointed by Napoleon since the Concordat. In order not to jeopardize the new balance between Church and State, the pope accepted to attend the coronation. The original sketches (as was typical in those days) showed the (key) subjects - including the Pope - minus their clothing, which was added in the actual painting. The pope was originally pictured with hands crossed on his lap, but Napoleon, supposedly claiming that the Pope was not present to do nothing, instructed that the painting depict him anointing the proceedings. # The painter Jacques-Louis David is depicted in the stands as well. # Halet Efendi, an Ottoman ambassador, was also present. He is shown below in the detailed picture. # Dom Rapha√´l de Monachis, Greek-Egyptian monk and member of the Institut d'√âgypte is depicted among the clergy men, standing to the right of the Bishop, with a beard and a red hood. # The lady robe bearer in front, right behind Josephine, on the right side from the picture-viewer's point, is Elisabeth-H√©l√®ne-Pierre de Montmorency-Laval, mother of politician Sosth√®nes II de La Rochefoucauld. She was a court lady of Josephine.

Designated as a National Historic Landmark, it is the only known surviving home of James Beauchamp Clark (1851‚Äì1921), a leading US Congressman of the early 20th century. and Note: A National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination document should be available upon request from the National Park Service for this site, but it appears not to be available on-line from the NPS Focus search site. It is regularly open for tours in the summer, and otherwise by appointment. Description and history The Clark House is located in a residential area on Bowling Green's east side, on the north side of East Champ Clark Drive between Charles and Penn streets. It is a two-story wood frame structure, built in 1888 by Ezra Kirkland, with ells projecting north off the northeast and northwest corners. A porch wraps around the front and sides, its flat roof supported by turned columns and jigsawn brackets, with a spindled valance between the posts. The interior has been restored to an appearance consistent with the time of Clark's occupancy. The house was purchased in 1898 by James Beauchamp Clark, several years after he had been elected to the United States Congress. Rising in the Democratic Party, Clark became first the minority leader of the House of Representatives (1908), and Speaker of the House in 1911, when the Democrats gained control of the body. He was a leading contender for the Democratic Party nomination for President in 1912 but did not get it. Clark served as Speaker of the House until 1919. The next year, he was voted out of office in a Republican landslide in 1920. After Clark's ownership, the house was converted into multiple residences. In the late 20th century, it was acquired by a local non-profit and restored as a museum.

It was released in Japan on July 4, 2008, and for English-speaking markets on June 29, 2011. Gameplay As a visual novel, Kara no Sh≈çjos gameplay primarily revolves around reading dialogue with other characters and making choices that affect the outcome of the game. At certain points in the game, the player character, Reiji, is tasked with investigating crime scenes. During these investigation sequences, the player must examine these scenes to uncover evidence. Later, the player must put the evidence together during inference sequences, in which Reiji must find the best answer from the clues obtained during the game. However, it's possible to fail an inference sequence by failing to obtain a given piece of evidence during a prior investigation; this in turn affects the outcome of the game. The game also features a travel system, through which the player can traverse between different locations in Tokyo. The player can only use this a limited number of times per day, and only on certain days. Plot Set in a post-World War II Japan during 1956, Kara no Sh≈çjo's story revolves around , a private investigator who is investigating a series of grotesque murders on the request of his former colleague/best friend, of the Tokyo metropolitan police force. The murders are reminiscent of another string of serial murders that occurred six years ago prior to the game where Reiji lost his fianc√©e, which drives him with a strong desire to solve this case. Later at a park, Reiji also meets a high school girl from Ouba Girls Academy named , who asks him to find her real self. Reiji is initially unsure of what she means, but later finds out that Toko has an unusually complicated past that may have more to do with the current string of serial killings than Reiji initially expects. While working to solve the growing number of murder cases in Tokyo, Reiji takes some time out to get to know Toko and her friends as well as other students from her school while working behind-the-scenes to unravel the mysteries of her dark past. Characters ; : :The series main protagonist and a private detective that specializes in particularly brutal murder cases. Before the series events, Reiji worked in the police force but then he was forced to quit after the death of his beloved fianc√©e Yukiko; he lives with his younger sister Yukari-(a student at Ouba Academy) who he cares for dearly and wants to make sure that nothing bad happens to her. He doesn't spend too much of his time at home due to his work unless he's off duty; he enjoys reading history books during his free time, even when he's in his office. He also becomes a substitute teacher teaching history at the same school that his sister attends. ; : :Reiji's younger sister and a high school student at the all- girls Ouba Academy. An old-fashioned, reliable type of girl, she's very close to her older brother and often takes care of him even when he tends to be helpless when it comes to doing household chores and will usually become concerned and worried when her brother has to go out and solve certain cases-(even if they're ones that could put his life at risk). Like Reiji she's very academic, but she has strong interests in entomology-(much to the dismay of some people including her brother) and has a huge collection of certain insects in her bedroom; on some occasions, her pet bugs end up appearing out of nowhere in certain parts of the house. She's a member of her school's art club. ; : :A mysterious teenage girl who meets Reiji with a request that he help her find her \\"true self\\". Like Yukari, she attends Ouba Girls Academy along with being one of her classmates and also a member of the art club at her school; despite being one of the most popular students at school, she actually hides some secrets that no one else knows. She's shown to be a regular customer at Cafe Moon World, a restaurant/bar owned by Kyoko-(a widow whose husband died long before the series events). ; : : Kuchiki's best friend and classmate from school. Sharing the same name as each other-(but spelled differently), the two girls are often shown spending time and hanging out together. Due to her poor background and having to live in a broken home, she is shown to have a severe inferiority complex, because of this she hates her parents, herself, as well as other people around her, revealing that she's also victim of bullying and torment by some of her peers. Like most of the people from her school, she practically worships Kuchiki especially since she's been one of the few people that ignores her troubled background. Since her first encounter with Reiji during a school field trip, she holds a strong grudge against him fearing that he's trying to take her friend away. ; : :Tsuzuriko is an aspiring writer and one of Yukari's classmates/best friend from school who serves as a comic relief in both the OVA and visual novel. She possesses a bright and hyperactive personality and has published multiple stories in many well known literary magazines while keeping her writing career a secret from her school. She's often referred to as \\"Tojiko\\" by Reiji claiming that her real name is hard to pronounce, much to her dismay. ; : : The president of the student council at Ouba Academy. A talented honor student, she comes from a wealthy, loving and influential family; her charisma makes her an idol of many of her classmates. ; : : Reiji's best friend and former colleague from the police. He and Reiji have known each other since they were students at the police academy where they both join the force and worked under the same supervisor. Even after his friend resigned from the police force, he still relies on Reiji's help in solving cases. Like Kuchiki, he's also a regular customer at Cafe Moon World. ; : :The widowed owner of Cafe Moon World and a close acquaintance of Reiji-(one of her regular customers) along with being one of the few people who remembers his dark tragic past; she was also an old friend of his deceased fianc√©e. Since they‚Äôve both lost someone important and special to them, they‚Äôre able to connect on a more different level. ; : :A waitress working at Cafe Moon World who used to help out at a brothel entitled Yukishiro, but after the establishment was shut down, Madam Ujaku took Hatsune under her wing and gave her the name Amemiya. She learned how to write from Shugo when they both lived at the Yukishiro brothel, so she gets mad whenever people say bad things about him. ; : :Also known by his pen name, Shin Katsuragi (ËëõÂüé „Ç∑„É≥, Katsuragi Shin) or Katsuragi- sensei for short is a famous well-known novelist and author of Shell of Sheol, one of his most popular published books.

He built a toll bridge over the Snake River at Black Rock Canyon. Idaho Falls was eventually established at the site of this bridge. The original bridge no longer stands, but a replica (erected by the Rotary Club) was dedicated in 1996. Matt Taylor served in the Territorial Legislature in 1868. He left the area for Missouri in 1886. The Taylor Toll Bridge Taylor's Bridge circa 1870 Matt Taylor, a freighter by trade, frequently camped along Black Rock Canyon on his way to the Eagle Rock Ferry. The gorge was narrow, which made the river flow faster, which in turn meant this campsite had fewer mosquitos. One evening he measured the canyon by throwing a stone tied to a string, and learned that the canyon was wide. He later found suitably straight timber in Beaver Canyon, away. These timbers, along with scrap iron from old wagons and a Missouri River steamboat, became the raw materials needed to build the bridge. In 1864 he found two business partners and formed the Oneida Road, Bridge and Ferry Company, the first corporation formed in what would become Bonneville County. This corporation bought out the ferry, and in the fall of that year built a stage station. This included a blacksmith shop, employee housing, a barn, and a store. Construction of the bridge went on during the winter, because it was easier to build the bridge when the river was frozen. It was operational by May 1865.Otteson, Connie B. \\"Unsung Heroes and Settlers of Bonneville County, Idaho\\". Harris Publishing Company, Inc. 2005.

History  Military aviation production facilities and an airfield were established in the district in the early 30s. Luftwaffensportverein P√ºtnitz was established in 1936 as a military sports club for German air force personnel. The formation of military-based sports and football clubs was common under the Third Reich and they took part in the country's established football competition alongside traditional civilian clubs. German football was re- organized under the Reich's politically motivated sports policies in 1933 into sixteen top-flight regional divisions. LSV first won its way into the Gauliga Pommern to play the 1937‚Äì38 season. They were forced to withdraw for reasons related to military service after just a single season, but returned to the Gauliga Pommern-West in 1941. The following year they captured the West division and overall Gauliga Pommern titles and then appeared in the qualification round of the national playoffs where they were put out by Blau- Wei√ü 90 Berlin (1:3). P√ºtnitz repeated as overall division champions the following year and this time went out of the national playoffs to SV 92 Berlin (2:2, 0:2). After capturing a third Pommern-West title in 1944, the team was defeated by another military side, HSV Gro√ü Born (1:1, 0:3) for the overall Pommern championship.Gr√ºne, Hardy (2001). Vereinslexikon. Kassel: AGON Sportverlag Their divisional success earned P√ºtnitz a place in play for the Tschammerpokal, predecessor to today's DFB-Pokal (German Cup), in 1942 and 1943, where they would go out on both occasions in the preliminary rounds. As the tide of World War II turned against Germany and Allied forces invaded in the country, most military football sides were disbanded; LSV P√ºtnitz was lost in September 1944.

Born in Wellington, he was educated in England. Joining the British Army, he served with the Prince of Wales‚Äôs North Staffordshire Regiment in the Sudan and later in the Second Boer War in South Africa. In New Zealand on secondment to the New Zealand Military Forces when the First World War began, he was posted to the NZEF as commander of the New Zealand Infantry Brigade. He led the brigade through most of the Gallipoli Campaign. Later, on the Western Front, he commanded the 1st Infantry Brigade and, for a brief period, the New Zealand Rifle Brigade. He died as a result of sniper fire on 7 August 1917, one of three New Zealand brigadier generals killed during the war. Early life Johnston was born at Wellington in New Zealand on 1 October 1871, the eldest son of merchant Charles John Johnston, who later became the Speaker of the Legislative Council. Sent to England for his education, he attended Stonyhurst College in Lancashire and the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, where he was awarded the Sword of Honour as the best of his intake. Military career Johnston was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Prince of Wales‚Äôs North Staffordshire Regiment on 5 December 1891, and promoted to lieutenant on 30 November 1895. He saw service in the Sudan with the Dongola Expedition in 1896. Promoted to captain on 13 May 1900, he served from 1900 to 1902 in the Transvaal during the Second Boer War, for which he was mentioned in despatches for good service during the Battle of Boschbult on 31 March 1902. In 1914, prior to the outbreak of the First World War, Johnston, now with the rank of major, was in New Zealand on leave from his regiment, which was then serving in India. He had been seconded to the New Zealand Military Forces as a temporary lieutenant colonel, and was appointed commander of the Wellington Military District. First World War When the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF) was raised in response to the declaration of war by the New Zealand government, Major General Alexander Godley, the commandant of the New Zealand Military Forces, promoted Johnston to the rank of colonel and put him in command of the New Zealand Infantry Brigade. =Egypt= Shipped to Egypt in October along with the rest of the NZEF, Johnston's brigade underwent intensive training. During this time, he clashed with some of his officers, notably Lieutenant Colonel William Malone, commander of the Wellington Infantry Battalion. Johnston was critical of Malone's training methods, for which Malone had already obtained approval from Godley. The brigade deployed along the Suez Canal late in January 1915 to support Indian troops defending from a rumoured Turkish attack. The brigade assisted the Indian defenders in dealing with a Turkish attack during early February, and suffered its first combat casualties. The attack was repulsed with 3,000 Turkish soldiers killed, wounded or captured, and three weeks of sentry duty ensued before the brigade returned to Cairo, where it had been previously based. =Gallipoli= By this time, the New Zealand and Australian Division, under the command of Godley, was being formed for operations in the Dardanelles, and the brigade formed one of the two infantry brigades (the other was the Australian 4th Brigade). In April, the division embarked for Gallipoli. Landed on the beaches on 25 April, the brigade was under the temporary command of Brigadier General Harold Walker, the chief of staff of the division. Johnston had taken ill on 23 April and missed the landing, returning to his command in early May. Johnston and the staff of the New Zealand Infantry Brigade prior to their attack at Krithia, 8 May 1915 On 2 May, shortly after his return to the brigade, Johnston led it in operations to capture Baby 700, a hill on the slopes overlooking ANZAC Cove. Johnston did not conduct a reconnaissance of the difficult terrain which needed to be traversed by his men prior to the commencement of the attack. As a result, many units had not reached their assigned starting positions by the designated start time of the offensive. The attack, planned by Godley and with ambitious objectives, was beaten off with heavy losses. In Godley's subsequent report on the battle, Johnston was not criticised for his handling of the brigade. Johnston led the brigade in the Second Battle of Krithia on 8 May, and then the Battle of Chunuk Bair in August. During the latter battle, he displayed poor judgement in coordinating the battalions of the brigade following the initial capture of Chunuk Bair by Malone's Wellington Battalion. Chunuk Bair was lost two days later to the Turks. Johnston, still in poor health, had spells in hospital in September, before leaving Gallipoli altogether in November for Cairo to be with his wife, who later died on 15 December. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath and mentioned twice in despatches for his conduct during the Gallipoli campaign. =Western Front= The coffin of Brigadier General Francis Earl Johnston, carried by fellow brigadier-generals, leads the funeral procession Following the withdrawal of Allied forces from Gallipoli to Egypt, the NZEF, now reinforced, had sufficient men to form a stand-alone divisional size formation, the New Zealand Division. Johnston's brigade, now designated the 1st Infantry Brigade, would be one of three infantry brigades in the division. The division was sent to France, where it was involved in operations on the Western Front, and Johnston was again mentioned in despatches for his leadership during the Battle of the Somme. Still in poor health, in December 1916, Johnston went to England for medical treatment and was diagnosed with neurasthenia. He later took command of the 4th New Zealand Infantry Brigade Reserve Camp, better known as Sling Camp. He returned to the Western Front in late July 1917, this time as commander of the New Zealand Rifle Brigade. Visiting the front lines, he was killed on 7 August 1917 by sniper fire. Johnston is buried on the edge of Bailleul, in the Bailleul Communal Cemetery Extension. His grave is close to that of Brigadier General Charles Henry Brown, Johnston's successor as commander of the 1st Infantry Brigade. Brown had been killed just a few weeks previously. He was survived by his second wife, Alice Seaton, who he had married several months before his death.

His passions were economic justice and art; he persistently campaigned for Land Value Taxation, and he was a painter.John Stewart; Standing for Justice: A Biography of Andrew MacLaren MP (2001, Shepheard- Walwyn, London . Note: Most information came from this source He represented Burslem for three separate terms during the 20th century. History Andrew MacLaren was born in a poor district of Glasgow. Early influences were Christianity, Mozart, Palestrina, and recent Irish history. An engineering apprentice from age 14 (working alongside John later Lord Reith), he attended art classes in the evening when able. From 17, when his father died, he had to provide for the family. With an innate sense of justice and freedom, he looked for the causes of the poverty and deprivation observed around him, hoping to find solutions. He studied Marx extensively, but failed to find answers. However, on discovering Glasgow‚Äôs single tax movement and reading Henry George‚Äôs \\"Progress and Poverty\\" (c 1905) he was set ablaze. From then on, his fine oratory was used to demand that everyone looked to the one issue that (as he believed) could solve the social and economic problems and hence men free: Land Value Taxation. Andrew MacLaren moved to London in 1914 and joined the Labour Party. He was MP for Burslem 1922-3, 1924-31, and 1935-45. In 1943 he resigned from the Labour Party and finally lost his seat when standing for Independent Labour. He died in 1975 after a short illness. He had 2 sons, Leon and John. Whilst an MP he often toured the most deprived parts of the country, raising the awareness of their plight in parliament. Whilst not an MP, he lectured extensively, encouraging and educating wherever he could to further the cause of land reform. Any remaining time was devoted to his art. Andrew MacLaren is the father of philosopher Leon MacLaren. Passions Andrew MacLaren‚Äôs political hero was Campbell-Bannerman, and he often repeated CB‚Äôs pledge \\" ‚Ä¶ to make the land less of a pleasure ground for the rich, and more of a treasure-house for the nation ‚Ä¶\\". He was a vocal supporter of Philip Snowden‚Äôs 1931 budget which included a measure of Land Value Taxation which reached the statute books in 1931. With the next election (1931) he lost his seat and then saw the act being repealed. He tried again with a private member's bill in 1937; it was rejected 141 to 118, and so he never saw his dream fulfilled. He founded the School of Economic Science, to teach courses on economics with a focus on the Land Value Taxation policies of Henry George He was firmly against the welfare state, believing it merely appeared to be necessary due to the prevailing inequities in the economic system. As he saw it, without reforming land tenure the welfare state would bankrupt the state. This set him in conflict with the Labour leadership. When not in parliament he poured his effort and talent into education, hoping to make people see how land value taxation could relieve society of many unhelpful economic tendencies, and provide economic freedom for the common people. Andrew MacLaren was also an artist and cartoonist. One painting (of Neville Chamberlain) is in the National Gallery.National Portrait Gallery (Image not available due to copyright) He was knowledgeable on renaissance art and in 1948 was commissioned by National Gallery to write a report on Leonardo da Vinci‚Äôs \\"Madonna of the Rocks\\". He corresponded with many well known people of that age; the letters with George Bernard Shaw (on Land Value Taxation) are at the British Library.British Library of Political and Economic Science NotesFurther reading One other biography exists: *Malcolm Hill; Enemy of Injustice (1999, Othila Press, London) External links *Henry George Foundation some notes on his time with the English League 1933 onwards * Category:Labour Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies Category:Independent Labour Party MPs Category:UK MPs 1922‚Äì1923 Category:UK MPs 1924‚Äì1929 Category:UK MPs 1929‚Äì1931 Category:1883 births Category:1975 deaths Category:Georgist politicians Category:People from Glasgow Category:Participants in the Norway Debate ","title":"Andrew MacLaren"},{"id":"17994602","text":"Robert Ellsworth (born May 3, 1959), best known as Bobby \\"Blitz\\" Ellsworth, is the lead vocalist of New Jersey thrash metal band Overkill.

The Information Warfare Aggressor role is similar to the \\"tiger teams\\" commercial firms hire (and the air force pioneered) to test the defenses of corporate networks. The two aggressor squadrons have increased the quality and quantity of attacks that can be launched against U.S. systems, to see how well the defenses hold up.

This module can be installed from the same web-based Elastix interface through a module loader. The call center module can handle incoming and outgoing campaigns. It can also optionally be made more powerful by adding common third party modules like QueueMetrics and WombatDialer.  History of the project  Elastix was created and maintained by PaloSanto Solutions, an Open Source support company based in Ecuador. Elastix was released to the public for the first time in March 2006. It was not a complete distribution but a Web interface for CDR (Call Detail Records) reporting. It was not until late December 2006 that Elastix was released as a GNU/Linux distribution with Asterisk, Zaptel and a number of other packages which were easily administrated via a user friendly Web interface that caught the community's attention. The Elastix 2.5 Linux distribution is based on CentOS, which has binary compatibility with Red Hat Enterprise Linux. From its initial release until now the Elastix distro has grown in popularity.

He was the creator of a method of teaching the Spanish language.  Childhood and studies  Chamorro was born in the village of Caaguaz√∫. His parents, both guaire√±os, were Don Jose de la Cruz Chamorro, fighter of the war and Juana Ines Martinez. These were confined in that location, shortly before the beginning of the War of the Seventy. He studied in primary Villarrica. The population exhausted by the hardships of war, like the rest of the country, is struggling to overcome their woes with stoicism and courage of the survivors. Leaving school, to complete the cycle, he joined the National College of Asuncion, to attend high school, which by economic constraints and family for some sentimental disappointment - says one of his biographers - was unable to complete it by interrupting with his study in the fourth year of high school. He was forced to work for the sustenance of the house. He was a passionate reader and curious observer, thus self-taught, gained a wealth of knowledge. He liked to write very romantic poems appropriate to his youth, which despite his opposition were rescued by the Paraguayan promoters of the letters. Chamorro is a classic of the letters. His poems have a soft Virgilian accent. He referred to his friend Daniel Codas an epistle with a tender elegy to which the beloved Villa Rica, inspired, it is considered a literary gem. From classical inspiration were his teachers Fray Luis de Leon and Andres Bello. He was a passionate reader the theorists of free humanism Tolstoy Kropotkin and others. Vocation  His true vocation was teaching. He began as a public school teacher in San Juan Bautista de las Misiones, in 1887, at the request of his fellow citizens \\"guaire√±os\\" he was back to Villarrica to continue his career in a \\"school of the motherland\\", title which then gave the first public educational institutions. With an iron will and strong educational structure - without holding any academic title - was fortunate to receive the support of dedicated teacher Ramon Indalecio Cardozo, who had the vision of a glimpse into his prot√©g√© virtues sufficient for the exercise of the magisterium . So, 1892, Chamorro took over the chairs of Castilian Rhetoric and Poetics at the Colegio Nacional Villarica. Forty years after his exemplary life devoted to the study and teaching of Spanish grammar. He is considered the first grammarian in Paraguay. He left unfinished a \\"Grammar Castellana\\", whose first volume was published after his death. Disciple Andres Bello, in many ways perfected the lessons of the wise Venezuelan. Among the honorable suite of grammarians and teachers trained in his classrooms, it is worth to distinguish Inocencio Lezcano, his brilliant continuation. Master  Teacher Chamorro was privileged to be learned from contemporary letters guaire√±as. They include his friend Ramon Indalecio Cardozo, Simeon Car√≠simo, Atanasio Riera, Nicholas E. Sardi, Carlos Ventura and Virgilio De Permian Barrios among others, names that left a trail of wisdom in the cultured city. Cardozo wrote: Chamorro was a teacher, reformer and a real character. He taught by example in his chair and replaced the ancient method of illogical grammar for the rational and logical. He persisted throughout his life in implementing his reform, a personal method known as \\"Chamorro Method.\\" Delfin Chamorro himself explained that \\"The analysis is to explain the grammatical structure of language decomposing reasoning in units called sentences, and they in their constituent members, to the simplest and less complex way. As the reasoning is almost always extremely complicated, should be taken at the beginning the most simple and explain the parts that comprise and the role that each plays in all. \\" He felt an irrepressible attraction to journalism. In 1902, accompanied by maestro Ramon I. Cardozo founded in Villa Rica newspaper \\"El Libre\\" in which he published his grammar lessons. In 1903, he created another called \\"The Guair√°\\" of short existence.  Recent years  The president Manuel Gondra, knowing the qualities of the guaire√±o teacher, whose fame had transpired, appointed him professor at the National College of Asuncion. He was nominated times after honorary professor and benefited with a fair retirement. Natalicio Gonzalez believes that in 1905, after the defeat of the government of Colonel Escurra, Chamorro joined the Colorado Party. He felt a profound abhorrence towards liberal ideology prevalent in the direction of \\"coloradismo\\" and took advantage of his nomination as candidate for senator to resign from his party and refuse the post that he offered his friends. He was president of the Paraguayan delegation that attended the Second International Congress of the American Magisterium, held in Montevideo in 1930.  Death and legacy  Chamorro died in Asuncion. Carlos Zubizarreta wrote about it: His former student Jose Patricio Guggiari, then president of the nation funded his funeral. The work of teaching of Delfin Chamorro was never published in a systematized book. The thick notebooks in summarizing his lessons, so familiar to several generations of disciples, disappeared with his death. \\" References  * \\"History of the letters Paraguayan.\\" Carlos R.

Biography  Born in Tokyo, Japan, he grew up in the Ikebukuro district. In 1997 he graduated first in his class at the Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music, then went on to gain a master's degree in fine art in 2004 from Chelsea College of Art and Design in London, England. Since then he has lived and worked in London. His art blends the delicate and the grotesque, juxtaposing photographic fragments, line art and painting to produce complex abstract works. His work is inspired by the uneasy lack of harmony between tradition and modernity in the fast-paced, constantly changing urban world. He sees parallels between his work and the way in which his home city, Tokyo, has absorbed western conventions into Japanese culture without any proper synthesis or reconciliation. He builds his organic-looking images from bizarre collections of carefully cut out photographic elements - including machinery, fish, road signs, leaves, weapons, furniture - the everyday alongside the unusual - the threatening with the benign - but skillfully intertwined so that the original forms are almost indiscernible. Inagawa's work has been on display in numerous exhibitions throughout the world. He was shortlisted for the Celeste Art Prize in both 2006 and 2007.

Prior to the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, prostitution in Albania was virtually unknown. Migration from rural areas to cities, and the economic problems following the Soviet collapse, caused some women to turn to prostitution. Street prostitution occurs near the centre of the capital, Tirana, mainly by Roma men and women. Some students work as prostitutes from hotels or motels in Tirana and other large cities, where brothels are also found. The NGO Aksion Plus provides sex workers with advocacy, education and support. Legislation Three articles of the Criminal Code of the Republic of Albania outlaw prostitution and related activities: * Article 113, Prostitution (buying and selling of sex) * Article 114, Exploitation of prostitution (\\"encouragement, mediation, or receipt of compensation for exercising prostitution\\") * Article 115, Use of premises for prostitution (\\"managing, utilizing, financing, or renting premises for purposes of prostitution\\") *Articles 110(a) and 128(b) prohibit sex and labour trafficking and prescribe penalties of eight to 15 year's imprisonment. Sex trafficking Human traffickers exploit domestic and foreign victims in Albania, and traffickers exploit victims from Albania abroad. Albanian women and children are subject to sex trafficking and forced labor within the country, especially during tourist season. Traffickers use false promises such as marriage or employment offers to force victims into sex trafficking. Albanian victims are subject to sex trafficking in countries across Europe, particularly Kosovo, Greece, Italy, Belgium, Germany, Switzerland, North Macedonia, Norway, the Netherlands, and the UK. Foreign victims from European countries and the Philippines were subjected to sex trafficking and forced labour in Albania.

Twenty-two of his short poems or epigrams survive in the Greek Anthology, from some of which his date may be fixed at around the late 3rd/early 2nd century BC. Some of his poems are on literary themes, but most are political. Alcaeus was contemporary with Philip V, king of Macedon and son of Demetrius II of Macedon, against whom several of his poems are pointed, apparently from patriotic feelings. One of these, however, gave more offense to the Roman general Flamininus than to Philip, as Alcaeus ascribed the victory of the battle of Cynoscephalae to the Aetolians as much as to the Romans. Philip contented himself with writing an epigram in reply to that of Alcaeus, in which he gave the Messenian a very broad hint of the fate he might expect if he fell into his hands.Plutarch, Flamininus 9 This reply was enough to lead French classical scholar Claudius Salmasius to suppose that Alcaeus was actually crucified by Philip.Claudius Salmasius, De Cruce, p. 449, ap. Fabric. Biblioth. Graec. ii. p. 88 In another epigram, in praise of Flamininus, the mention of the Roman general's name, Titus, led John Tzetzes into the error of imagining the existence of an epigrammatist named Alcaeus under the emperor Titus.John Tzetzes, Proleg. in Lycophron Those epigrams of Alcaeus which bear internal evidence of their date were written between the years 219 and 196. Of the 22 epigrams in the Greek Anthology which bear the name of Alcaeus, two are written \\"Alcaeus of Mytilene\\"; but most scholars take this to be the addition of some ignorant copyist. Others bear the name of \\"Alcaeus of Messene,\\" and some of Alcaeus alone. But in the last class there are several which must, from internal evidence, have been written by Alcaeus of Messene, and there seems no reason to doubt his being the author of all twenty-two.

Their mission was to create civic and service minded youth by developing leadership skills, inspiring purpose, and developing engagement in their communities. As of October 28, 2009, Leader's Challenge was shut down due to financial difficulties. Leader's Challenge operated three programs, serving around 750 high school students annually.  History  Leader's Challenge was founded in 2000 by American author Tommy Spaulding, who serves as President/CEO of Up with People. The organization initially offered one program serving 60 eleventh grade students at 10 high schools in metro Denver and Boulder. In 2006, the organization expanded, with the introduction of a program aimed at high school seniors, and the absorption of the long- established Colorado Close Up program.  Programs  IGNITE = The flagship program, IGNITE is a year-long experience for high school juniors focusing on leadership development, service learning and civic engagement. Beginning with a four-day Summer Academy, students develop knowledge, skills and behaviors related to leadership and active citizenship, including self- confidence, team building, conflict management, critical thinking and problem solving skills. Throughout the year, teams of students at 35+ schools along Colorado's Front Range participate in monthly Challenges and service projects designed to involve them in their local communities while exploring topics such as community building, the role of media in society, leadership in the workplace, and state and local government. IGNITE culminates with each school team identifying a need in their community and partnering with an outside organization to implement a project that helps that need. = Global Challenge = Global Challenge is a yearlong experience for high school seniors designed to expand students‚Äô worldview and explore leadership in a global context, beginning with a 3-day Summer Academy. Throughout their senior year, students participate in monthly seminars centered on issues related to global leadership, including intercultural communication, diplomacy, economics and development. In addition, they examine topics such as indigenous cultures, historic and current conflict, the role of women, human rights, and policies concerning the environment, health, and service. The cornerstone of Global Challenge is an international trip over Spring Break, in which students live and work with citizens of either Costa Rica or Slovakia, and have the opportunity to experience their culture and customs firsthand while making a difference in the community. = Colorado Close Up = Colorado Close Up has been the state's largest civic education initiative since 1979, bringing students from across Colorado to the state Capitol for three days. While visiting Denver, students have the opportunity to observe the state legislature and courts, meet with elected officials from each branch of government, and work with lobbyists and business leaders to discuss how they can impact their communities. Participants return home from Colorado Close Up with the knowledge and skills to identify problems and draw on local resources to create change in their communities. Colorado Close Up was absorbed by Leader's Challenge in 2006.  Fees  Each Leader's Challenge program requires a fee which covers all costs associated with participation, including materials, staffing, facilities, accommodations, meals, and honorariums. The program fee for each program is as follows: IGNITE: $875 Global Challenge: $475/$2000 (the program fee and trip fee respectively) Colorado Close Up: $250 Leader's Challenge is able to provide financial assistance to families in need for all three programs.

This result of algebraic automata theory is due to Marcel-Paul Sch√ºtzenberger. In particular, the minimum automaton of a star-free language is always counter-free (however, a star-free language may also be recognized by other automata which are not aperiodic). A counter-free language is a regular language for which there is an integer n such that for all words x, y, z and integers m ‚â• n we have xymz in L if and only if xynz in L. Another way to state Sch√ºtzenberger's theorem is that star-free languages and counter-free languages are the same thing. An aperiodic automaton satisfies the ƒåern√Ω conjecture.

Miller. In the book, Miller examines the battle between evolution and intelligent design (ID), and explores the implications of science in America. The title of the book comes from a misconception of what \\"theory\\" means in the context of science and evolution.  Reception  Glenn C. Altschuler reviewed the book saying \\"Though I.D. trumpets its connections to information theory, biochemistry and molecular biology, Miller concludes, as did Judge John Jones in Kitzmiller v. Dover, it rests, ultimately, on ignorance. Extending an olive branch to religious Americans, Miller suggests that evolution and faith aren't really in conflict because all of nature is part of God's providential plan.\\" Biologist PZ Myers wrote \\"Miller is a fine writer who sharply addresses the details of the arguments about intelligent design creationism. When tackling old chestnuts such as the 'only a theory' complaint, or Michael Behe's argument for a maximum limit for the number of genetic mutations, or William Dembski's rehash of William Paley's watchmaker argument for complexity, Miller discusses the contemporary biological explanations while refuting the errors.\\" John Woodmorappe was critical of the book, and stated \\"On the outer jacket of this book, Miller is praised as a brilliant and original thinker. To the contrary: Miller is simply dusting off and repackaging the same old straw-man arguments against creationists of decades ago and reusing them against ID‚Ä¶In conclusion, Miller‚Äôs book is nothing new. It tells us more about his rationalistic preconceptions than about ID.\\" A number of reviewers had pointed out a factual inaccuracy in the book: on page 149, Miller referred to the Dingo as a marsupial, when in fact Dingos are feral dogs. In his list of errata, published online, Miller gave a correct reading of the passage: \\"It produced hunter-predator marsupials like the dingo and the Tasmanian tiger,\\" should read \\"It produced hunter-predator marsupials like the tiger quoll and the Tasmanian wolf.\\" On June 16, 2008 Miller was interviewed on The Colbert Report discussing the book.

During the 1970s, the Israeli military was becoming increasingly interested in battlefield UAVs, and in response IAI management finally decided that they were interested in the concept as well. The Scout had a similar configuration as the Mastiff, with a pusher propeller and a twin-boom tail.  Use  In 1981, the Israeli IAI Scout drone, was first operated in combat missions by the South African Defence Force against Angola during Operation Protea.Unmanned Aerial Vehicles: Robotic Air Warfare 1917-2007, By Steven Zaloga, Osprey Publishing, 19 July 2011, page 22 During the 1982 Lebanon War, the Israelis were confronted by Syrian surface-to-air missiles (SAMs), which were heavily sited in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley. All 28 SAM sites in the Bekaa were destroyed, however, partly through the use of Sampson decoys to get them to reveal their presence, and partly through reconnaissance information obtained by the Mastiff and Scout UAVs. Israeli battlefield UAVs had proven a great success, and soon came to the attention of the US military, particularly after the American intervention in Lebanon in 1983. This led to the US Navy's request for a battlefield UAV in 1984, and Tadiran and IAI decided, or were told to, join forces to submit a proposal for the American requirement. The result was an IAI division named \\"Mazlat\\" (the Hebrew acronym for Miniature UAV), now \\"Malat\\" (Hebrew acronym of UAV). The US military is reluctant to buy from foreign sources, so foreign companies always team up with an American company to invite sales. AAI had already worked with Tadiran to sell the Mastiff in the US, so AAI was a logical choice, and Mazlat and AAI developed the Pioneer, which won the competition. Since then, Malat has developed more advanced battlefield UAVs, and has collaborated on battlefield UAV developments with partners such as AAI. After consolidating production of the Mastiff and Scout, the Malat company continued to sell them in slightly refined versions for over a decade. Both aircraft have fixed landing gear and are generally operated from runways, performing short landings using an arresting-wire hook, though they may be launched using a hydraulic catapult off the back of a truck, and recovered by a net. They both carry imaging sensors in a turret underneath the fuselage. The Mastiff and Scout remained in service with the Israeli Army until the early 1990s, when they were replaced by the IAI Searcher.

Initially, the group played 1950s style R&B; and early rock and roll with guitars, piano, sax, bass guitar, drums, and a vocalist, but by the middle of the 1970s was operating as a big band revival group, in the style of the bands of Jimmie Lunceford, Count Basie, Duke Ellington, and Lionel Hampton. The unit moved to New York City in 1978 under the leadership of Jon Holtzman, when it recorded the first of several full-length albums. In 1980 five of its members also played on their own as a bebop group. Holtzman - better known as The Bronx Nightingale, left the group around 1982 to start his own band and recorded his first solo album - \\"Let's Do It\\". John Hammond Sr., a big fan of Jon's, graciously volunteered to write the liner notes. After Holtzman left Michael Hashim, the group's alto saxophonist, was named leader, and the musicians broadened their repertory to include swing and bop, featuring original arrangements by band members. Manager Michael Caplin renamed the group the Widespread Jazz Orchestra.

Both nations are members of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, Cairns Group, Organization of American States and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. History In 1818, Chile declared its independence from Spain and their independence was recognized in 1844. In 1892, Chile opened a consulate in the Canadian city of Vancouver due to the presence of Chilean sailors in the city.Relations between Chile and Canada during the Second World War Chile would continue to open consulates in other Canadian cities such as in Quebec City (1885), Brantford (1907) and in Montreal (1923). At the time, Canada did not have a diplomatic presence in Chile as it was still part of the British Empire and all of its international affairs were conducted via London. Canada assumed full control of it diplomatic relations after the passing of the Statute of Westminster in 1931. During World War II, Canada began to establish diplomatic relations with Latin American nations. In 1941, a Canadian commercial mission headed to Chile and signed a commercial treaty. Chile, a member of the ABC countries (which also included Argentina and Brazil) was seen as an important member nation within the region and Canada established diplomatic relations with Chile in 1941. In July 1942, Chile opened a diplomatic legation office in Ottawa. That same year, Canada also opened a legation office in Santiago. In June 1944, both nations upgraded their legation offices to embassies, respectively. On 11 September 1973, democratically elected Chilean President Salvador Allende was removed from power in a coup d'√©tat by General Augusto Pinochet. Soon after the coup, several Chilean nationals fled to the Canadian embassy in Santiago for asylum. Canadian first secretary Marc Dolgin and David Adam allowed entry to the Chilean asylees and housed them at the embassy and at the Canadian ambassador's residence (at the time, the ambassador was in Argentina). Some 16 people were admitted to the embassy. After a month of hosting the Chileans, Canada (and the Chilean government) allowed for all 16 people to be sent to Canada for resettlement.How the Chilean coup forever changed Canada‚Äôs refugee policies From 1973 to 1990, Canada would receive approximately 7,000 Chilean nationals as refugees. In 2016, both nations celebrated 75 years of diplomatic relations.Canada - Chile Relations Air Canada operates direct flights between Toronto and Santiago.

S. A. Agulhas retired from Antarctic service in April 2012 when the replacement vessel, S. A. Agulhas II, was commissioned.

Based in Cotati, California, the F.E.P. opened an additional chapter in Seattle, Washington in 2016. Organization and mission The organization is composed of a team of activists from various animal rights, environmental and social justice organizations. They work on encouraging healthy food choices that reflect a more compassionate society by spotlighting the abuse of animals on farms, the depletion of natural resources, unfair working conditions for produce workers, and the lack of access to healthy foods in low-income areas. In January 2011, the organization began researching companies that make vegan products containing chocolate to find out if they source their cocoa beans from countries where child labor and slavery can still be found. The frequently updated list of companies is available on the F.E.P. web site. Reports In April 2008, the Food Empowerment Project supported California Senate Bill 1443 which would require that a written contract between a retail food facility and a purchaser include an option that allows the purchaser to direct the facility to donate leftover food to a non-profit food bank or provide it to the purchaser. In March 2009 the F.E.P. began surveying supermarkets, convenience stores and other retail businesses that sell food in Santa Clara County. The resulting 2010 report, \\"Shining a Light on the Valley of Heart's Delight\\",Shining a Light on the Valley of Heart's Delight found that higher- income areas had more than twice as many large supermarkets per capita than lower-income areas, while lower-income communities have nearly twice as many liquor stores and 50 percent more markets that sell an abundance of meat products. Neither of these latter store types offers a variety of healthy food options, like fresh fruits and vegetables. Campaigns F.E.P.'s first corporate campaign targeted Clif Bar, maker of energy bars and drinks, for not disclosing the source of their chocolate.Letter to Clif Bar, May 31, 2011, FoodIsPower.org. This worried F.E.P. because two West African countries, Ghana and the Ivory Coast, which supply 75 percent of the world's cocoa market were documented by a handful of organizations and journalists to employ child labor and in some cases, slavery on cocoa farms. On December 2, 2014, F.E.P. declared victory with Clif Bar & Company publicly disclosing that its cocoa sources included both suspect countries.

The movement was active in English- speaking nations from the late 1860s to about 1910, exerting an important influence on the contemporaneous feminist, eugenics, and birth control movements. The roots of the social purity movement lay in early 19th-century moral reform movements, such as radical utopianism, abolitionism, and the temperance movement. In the late 19th century, \\"social\\" was a euphemism for \\"sexual\\"; the movement first formed in opposition to the legalization and regulation of prostitution, and quickly spread to other sex-related issues such as raising the age of consent, sexually segregating prisons, opposing contraception, preventing \\"white slavery\\", and censoring pornography.  Influences  The rapid changing in American society was evident in temperance, women's rights, evangelical revivalists, and workers rights movements. Born out of a few debatable movements was the ‚ÄúSocial Purity Movement‚Äù that has left a lasting legacy on sexual ethics and female bodily autonomy in the United States. Although this movement was mainly focused on the specific task of eliminating prostitution, its advocates had varying agendas and the results of this movement were skewed from the original task. Evangelism and a general moral panic around venereal diseases fueled the movement into gaining widespread support across the American public, including the support of some feminists and conservatives alike. Leading up to the social purity movement, the prevalence of prostitution was growing and conversations were being had around legalizing prostitution and regulating its commerce. With the focus being on white women, even more specifically newly immigrated Eastern European white women, it was crucial that the popularity of prostitution be diminished to preserve the purity of white women (hence social purity). Prostitution was never legalized, yet the social purity movement had already begun and was breaking ground in other avenues to dampen prostitution and other products of lust. Social purity as a movement took roots in the mid 1800s in England and was prominently lead by an evangelical woman Jane Ellice Hopkins. She spent her early childhood and early adulthood on the east coast of America, however her transformative social work began in the United Kingdom. Hopkins was responsible for a multitude of organised support groups for the movement and became successful in her appeal to male involvement in ways that other social puritists were not. Her deep dedication to the church not only gave her helpful connections in the spreading of this movement in Europe, but also gave her a characteristic drive and passion for this work. She was able to make changes in very practical ways, such as raising the legal age of consent for women to 16, and in individual moral ways, such as asking good Christian men to pledge themselves to respecting women and dismantling hypocrisy in sexual standards. Her work set a precedence for what was to be done in the United States. There was a gray area in this movement where feminists, eugenicists, and social purists could agree. Feminists were concerned about the sexual exploitation of women as an act of violence against them and eugenicists were concerned with the preservation of the ‚Äòfittest‚Äô citizens, needing white female chastity to achieve these aspirations. There was some intersection of goals with the social purists in this sense, and they inevitably influenced one another. Religion, feminism, and eugenicists found common ground in the control and/or protection of women's bodies as something sacred and necessary, but only white women's bodies were included in this protection.  The Mann Act (White Slave Traffic Act)  The Social Purity Movement came to fruition under the White Slave Traffic Act passed in 1910, otherwise known as the Mann Act, named after politician James Mann. This Act originally intended to restrict the transportation of women by men across state lines for the purpose of ‚Äòprostitution or debauchery‚Äô but was later amended to include ‚Äòany other immoral purpose‚Äô, which was interpreted in wildly different ways. The Mann Act was made possible through the use of regulating foreign commerce which could have its own philosophical discussion regarding the agency of women in the early 1900s. Under the revised Act under Section 3, it was stated that any man transporting a woman across state borders ‚Äúwith the intent and purpose of such person that such woman or girl shall engage in the practice of prostitution or debauchery, or any other immoral practice, whether with or without her consent...shall be deemed guilty of a felony‚Äù. The calling to action of the public came in the form of newspaper articles featuring ‚Äúwhite slave narratives‚Äù that revealed the tragic, and ‚Äúcommon‚Äù, situation that women who left home found themselves in. Historians have referred to this as a part of a ‚Äòmoral panic‚Äô that was sweeping across the United States during the Progressive Era, as activists and organizations were popping up in all different sections of American life demanding the government intervention on spreading corruption. These white slave narratives re-enforced assumptions that male sexuality was virtually uncontrollable, to the point of coercing and kidnapping them into prostitution, and yet women were also helpless to this coercion. The level to which some women were choosing prostitution versus those who were forced into it is unclear, but the numbers that were estimated are overestimated enough to lead scholars to believe much of this panic was ill-informed. It also cannot be ignored that ‚Äòwhite slavery‚Äô makes a direct link to the previous system of ‚Äòchattel slavery‚Äô, and the similarities or differences between these systems should be considered relevant to the movement.

The southern terminus of Ranch to Market Road 2627 in Heath Canyon, it connects Brewster County with the village of La Linda in Acu√±a Municipality, Coahuila.  History  The one-lane international bridge was constructed in 1964 by Dow Chemical to transport fluorspar from mines in Coahuila to the United States. The unmonitored international bridge was shut down in 1997 by U.S. and Mexican authorities because of suspected smuggling. According to other reports, the killing of a Mexican customs inspector at the bridge resulted in its closure. The bridge's closure created the longest stretch of the U.S.-Mexico border without a border-crossing station: nearly between the Presidio-Ojinaga and Del Rio-Acu√±a crossing stations. A number of individuals have advocated reopening the bridge, citing increased revenue for the area from ecotourism, improved access for those conducting business in both countries, and a need for a crossing based on cultural and familial ties on either side of the border. In 1998 the National Parks and Conservation Association and the Andrew Kurie and Kurie Family (the owners) were granted a three-year suspension of the US Coast Guard removal order, affirmed by an exchange of diplomatic notes. After the April 2002 U.S.-Mexico Binational Bridges and Border Crossings Group Meeting, a diplomatic note was exchanged between the U.S. and Mexican governments extending the moratorium on the bridge's removal by the U.S. Coast Guard through June 2003. Subsequent notes and negotiations allowed discussion by the U.S. and Mexico to continue. Support for the bridge's re-opening from the State of Texas was asserted in HCR 164, enacted and signed by Governor Rick Perry in January 2008.Sources: S.C.T., December 1998, TxDOT International Relations Office, March 2006; U.S. Department of State, March 1999.

Because of the quality of silk fibre, most Chinese fine embroideries are made in silk. Some ancient vestiges of silk production have been found in various Neolithic sites dating back 5,000‚Äì6,000 years in China. Currently the earliest real sample of silk embroidery discovered in China is from a tomb in Mashan in Hubei province identified with the Zhanguo period (5th‚Äì3rd centuries BC). After the opening of Silk Route in the Han dynasty, the silk production and trade flourished. In the 14th century, the Chinese silk embroidery production reached its high peak. Several major silk embroidery styles had been developed, like Song Jin (ÂÆãÈî¶ Song embroidery) in Suzhou, Yun Jin (‰∫ëÈî¶ Cloud embroidery) in Nanjing and Shu Jin (ËúÄÈî¶ Shu embroidery) in Sichuan. Today, most handwork has been replaced by machinery, but some very sophisticated production is still hand-made. Modern Chinese silk embroidery by hand is still common in southern China.  Genres  Major styles = Screen with Suzhou embroidery. * Su Xiu (ËãèÁª£) ‚Äì Suzhou embroidery is crafted in areas around Suzhou, Jiangsu Province, having a history dating back 2,000 years. It is famous for its beautiful patterns, elegant colours, variety of stitches, and consummate craftsmanship. Its stitching is meticulously skillful, coloration subtle and refined. Suzhou artists are able to use more than 40 needlework and a 1,000 different types of threads to make embroidery, typically with nature and environment themes such as flowers, birds, animals and even gardens on a piece of cloth. **A rare subset is Su double-sided embroidery which requires ultimate skill and artistry. The front and back of the piece may have different designs, but the ends are not knotted but woven in so the back can't be distinguished. * Xiang Xiu (ÊπòÁª£) ‚Äì Hunan embroidery comes from areas around Changsha, Hunan Province. It is distinct for its starkly elegant black, white and gray colouration. Its emphasis is on contrasts of light and shade that highlight the pattern texture to give a three-dimensional effect. Xiang embroidery composition combines void and solid imagery, utilizing empty space in the same way as Chinese ink and wash paintings. * Yue Xiu/Guang Xiu (Á≤§Áª£/ÂπøÁª£) ‚Äì Guangdong embroidery is crafted in Chaozhou, Guangdong Province. It is composed of intricate but symmetrical patterns, vibrant colours, varied stitches and a defined weave. Its use of primary colors, light and shade are reminiscent of western paintings. * Shu Xiu (ËúÄÁª£) ‚Äì Sichuan embroidery comes from areas around Chengdu, Sichuan Province. It is among the oldest known embroidery styles in Chinese embroidery history. Its raw materials are satin and colored silk, its craftsmanship painstaking and refined.

MacLaren was inspired by Henry George, Socrates, Dr Francis Roles, Pyotr Ouspensky, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, and finally the philosophy of Advaita VedƒÅnta through the Shankaracharyas of Jyoti Math. pp. 2, 34, 48 and 59 Early life MacLaren was born in Glasgow on 24 September 1910, but from the age of four grew up in the London suburb of Wimbledon. He was the son of Andrew MacLaren, a Labour Member of Parliament who was a staunch advocate of Henry George.MacLaren Foundation web site Schooled at Rutlish School in Wimbledon, MacLaren later became attracted to the law and trained as a barrister. Maclaren said he was grateful to have inherited from his father three things: no religion, no education, and a strong desire to distrust experts. At the age of sixteen, MacLaren contemplated how his life could best be put to the service of mankind, a one-word answer came to his mind, the word was \\"School\\". Describing the experience when he was siting by a lake in Wimbledon Park when he says: > It became very clear to me that there was such a thing as truth, and there > was such a thing as justice, and that they could be found and, being found, > could be taught. It seemed to me that that was the most valuable thing that > one could pursue. So I resolved to pursue this when I was twenty-one. Years later, in 1936, aided by his father Andrew MacLaren, he began an economic study group based on the Socratic method of inquiry that became The School of Economic Science. MacLaren believed that the practical problems of the world could best be solved by transforming the nature of human beings. Career MacLaren's influences include his father Andrew MacLaren, Shantanand Saraswati, Henry George, Georges Ivanovich Gurdjieff, P. D. Ouspensky, Francis Roles and Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. According to the Henry George Foundation, MacLaren joined the Henry George movement in London in 1931, serving on the executive committee from 1933 until 1937. At the 1936 International Conference of Georgist Organisations held in London, a contingent from the US presented a question-based method of teaching Henry George's ideas. MacLaren created a similar method and taught the course in London.Land and Liberty, Henry George Foundation of Great Britain, 1933 p 231; 1935 p89; 1936 p94. In 1937 MacLaren left the Henry George movement and founded the School of Economic Science (SES) with the support of his father.Land and Liberty, Henry George Foundation of Great Britain, 1937 p97 p.65 In 1938 he was called to the bar and practised in Chambers at 2 Paper Buildings in the Inner Temple.Henry George Foundation web site In 1939 he was nominated to stand for Parliament against Winston Churchill, when war was declared the election was cancelled. Some sources say MacLaren's father founded the school,George D. Chryssides, Exploring New Religions, Continuum International Publishing (1999), page 374. while others state it was Leon.George D. Chryssides, Exploring New Religions, Continuum International Publishing (1999), p.293. According to the SES web site, MacLaren introduced and developed philosophy courses to complement his economics courses. Over time the philosophy courses became SES's principal area of teaching. According to the group's literature, from the mid-1960s onwards, MacLaren presented, in addition to some of the ideas of P. D. Ouspensky, the philosophy of Advaita Vedanta, a philosophical theology of absolute non-duality as taught by the eighth-century Indian philosopher-theologian ≈öa·πÖkara.SES website He later stood as the Liberal candidate for Yeovil at the 1950 election and then at Hendon South in 1951 without any success.British parliamentary election results, 1950-1973 by FWS Craig According to the SES web site, MacLaren studied Advaita Vedanta philosophy in 1965 with Shantanand Saraswati the Shankaracharya of Jyotir Math. MacLaren attended a lecture by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi at the Albert Hall in London in 1959 and became a student of the Maharishi. On commentator states that in the 1950s, MacLaren met and was deeply inspired by an Indian guru, Sri Shantanand Saraswati, and henceforth the School of Economic Sciences curriculum combined Platonic and Neoplatonic mysticism with Eastern Vedic philosophy. Meditation classes were taught alongside Socratic group dialogues. According to Practical Philosophy's (founded by MacLaren) web site MacLaren spent three months in the early 1970s traveling around the world visiting the SES affiliated schools. MacLaren's illness came during his final world tour. He was brought back to England from South Africa and died in a London hospital on 24 June 1994.Unknown author Practical Philosophy web site accessed 4 February 2013 According to his foundation web site, MacLaren wrote a book called The Nature of Society. In 2009 MacLaren's former personal assistant, Dorine Tolley, published a biography of MacLaren's life called The Power Within: Leon MacLaren, A Memoir of His Life and Work. In conjunction with Frances Roles, MacLaren founded the School of Meditation in London. MacLaren was an enthusiast of the Sanskrit language, stating \\"The grammatical rules of Sanskrit are also the rules of creation\\". He began Sanskrit courses at School of Economic Science. Today SES represents the largest body of Sanskrit students in the UK. MacLaren said on teamwork \\"The first quality of a leader of people ‚Äì always the first quality ‚Äì is a devotion to truth.\\" and on praise \\"From praise comes joy, from joy ‚Äì strength, from strength ‚Äì virtue, from virtue ‚Äì purity and from purity comes realization of one‚Äôs full potential.\\" Leon MacLaren is described as one of three men responsible for meditation being practised so widely in the west due to his early adoption of the practice and propagation of it globally via the School of Economic Science, the other two men being Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and Dr Francis C. Roles of The Study Society . He taught until the last week of his life. In 1994, though ill, he flew from London to South Africa to lead a study week with the School‚Äôs senior students. His visit was cut short when his health failed. He was flown back to London, where he died. Personal life According to MacLaren's foundation web site he married twice, had two daughters and lived in Hammersmith and later Hampstead and Oxfordshire. MacLaren had two unsuccessful marriages, both with Study Society members. Neither woman ever joined the School of Economic Science, preferring to stay with Roles, even after MacLaren officially split from Roles and his group.Petsche, Johanna J. M.

It was the first American independent film invited to compete for the Palme d'Or at the 1982 Cannes Film Festival. Smithereens is a precursor to Seidelman's next film, Desperately Seeking Susan; both films share similar themes of female identity and self- reinvention. Plot Wren (Susan Berman) is a runaway from New Jersey who has come to New York City in the hopes of becoming a figure in the punk rock scene, only to find that the movement is now centered in Los Angeles. Wren finds herself relegated to sneaking into the city's remaining punk hot spot, the Peppermint Lounge, to try to ingratiate herself with the bands that play there, in the hopes that one of them will take her on as a groupie. She also engages in a campaign to litter the city with photocopied pictures of herself bearing the legend \\"WHO IS THIS?\\" in an attempt to generate mystique. Though she works part-time at a Xerox shop by day, Wren nominally uses her position there to surreptitiously print out her fliers, and supplements her lifestyle by mugging women in the subway. Wren runs across Paul (Brad Rijn), a young man from Montana in the middle of a road trip who has briefly taken up residence in the city before heading on to New Hampshire. Though he sleeps in the back of his dilapidated van, Paul has saved enough money to otherwise live comfortably. When Paul expresses interest in Wren, she agrees to date him, though she‚Äôs emotionally abusive and makes it clear to Paul that she‚Äôs more interested in the stability he can offer her. Out on a date, the couple meet Eric (Richard Hell), former member of Smithereens, a one-hit-wonder punk group from one decade earlier. Though he's now unemployed and living in the apartment of another punk named Billy (Roger Jett), Eric professes to be putting together a new group that will soon be headed to Los Angeles. Wren leaves Paul to move in with Eric, though she‚Äôs forced out after a confrontation with a nameless blonde woman (Kitty Summerall) who also lives in the apartment. Returning to her own apartment, Wren discovers that her roommates have fled in her absence and that her landlady has locked her out. Wren visits her brother and sister-in-law in an attempt to get a loan, but they decline on the grounds that Wren has cheated them in the past. With nowhere else to go, Wren goes back to Paul and guilts him into helping her break into her old apartment to retrieve her things. The two resume an uneasy relationship, with Paul allowing Wren to sleep in the back of his van at night. Eric finds Wren and tells her that they are set to go to Los Angeles, but that they need money to afford transportation and food en route. With Wren‚Äôs help, Eric robs a wealthy man at gunpoint after trapping him in a taxi. Finding that they've made enough money to go to LA, Eric sends Wren to collect her things from Paul's van. Returning to Eric's apartment, Wren learns from Billy that Eric has taken all of their money and gone to LA by himself. Confronting the nameless blonde woman in the stairwell, Wren learns that she is Eric's wife and that he has a history of picking up vulnerable women to exploit for his own financial gain. Attempting to reunite with Paul, Wren learns that he sold his van to a local pimp and used the money to continue his road trip. Looking inside the van, Wren discovers that Paul left behind a watercolor portrait he'd done of her. Now homeless, Wren wanders the city until she's propositioned by a man in a convertible. Though she initially brushes off the man's advances, his admonishment that she has nowhere else to go causes her to stop and turn back towards his car.

It refers to both the actus reus and the mental state of the defendant. The basic principle is that a defendant should be able to contemplate the harm that his actions may cause, and therefore should aim to avoid such actions. Different forms of liability employ different notions of fault, in some there is no need to prove fault, but the absence of it. In criminal law, the mens rea is used to decide if the defendant has criminal intent when he commits the act and, if so, he is therefore liable for the crime. However, this is not necessary for strict liability offences, where no particular state of mind is required to satisfy the burden of proof.  Actus reus element  Most requirements for a successful actus reus require a voluntary act, or omission, for evidence of fault. There is also a requirement for a clear causation, there is no liability or fault if the defendant was not actually the sole cause of the act, this is so if there was an intervention of a third party, an unexpected natural event, or the victims own act. Either of these can remove the legal blame from the defendant and remove the fault. =Automatism= If the criminal act is caused by an act of automatism, it means the act was caused by an involuntary movement of the limbs, and not controlled by neuron stimulation, removing the blameworthiness from the defendant. This was seen in the case of Hill V. Baxter (1958) http://sixthformlaw.info/02_cases/mod3a/cases_60_gen_def_automatism.htm where the defendant injured a person by crashing his car into them. He argued that his action was not voluntary because he was unaware of what happened. However, he was found guilty because the judge held that sleepiness or drowsiness when driving does not amount to automatism. =Duress= In the case of duress, the defendant has committed the act in response to a threat of death or serious personal injury to himself or a loved one, or someone towards whom he feels responsible. Therefore he is removed of fault as his actions were done to prevent such harm being done. It would be considered unfair to place the defendant at fault of a criminal action which he committed under duress. =Liability= In such cases of a \\"state-of-affairs\\" crimes, the defendant may be found liable even if he or she did not purposefully or voluntarily commit a criminal act. This is seen in R v Larsonneur (1933),http://www.peterjepson.com/law/strict_liability_issues.htm where the defendant was French and entered the UK. She then tried to marry a British citizen, after which she would have gained British citizenship, which she could never be subsequently deprived of. However, the marriage was refused and she was ordered to leave the UK that day (March 22). Instead, she went to the Irish Free State seeking a priest there to marry her and the man, George Drayton. No priest could be found and the Irish police ordered her to leave by April 17 under the Irish Constitution. Larsonneur still did not leave and on April 20 was taken into custody by Irish police where they were forced to deport her back from whence she had come, the UK. On arrival in the UK, she was arrested for being an 'illegal alien'. The defendant was not at fault as she did not intentionally re-enter the UK under the Alien Act; however she was still liable for the crime under Alien Act, as there was no need to prove the act was voluntary. This was also seen in the case of Winzar v Chief Constable of Kent (1983) http://www.peterjepson.com/law/strict_liability_issues.htm where the defendant was admitted to hospital by a friend who was worried for his health. However when the hospital realized he was merely drunk to the point of being semi ‚Äì unconscious, they discharged him from the hospital. The defendant, because of his intoxicated state, could not get home, and was liable for drunk and disorderly conduct. Even though he did not have intention for the crime, nor was he at fault, because the crime been one of state of affairs he was liable and charged as such. =Causation= There is also an issue of causation, in this the courts look at both factual causation and legal causation. Factual causation uses the 'but for' test, asking: 'but for the defendant's act, would the result still have occurred?' If it would have occurred regardless of the defendant's acts, there is no factual causation and the defendant is not guilty. Factual causation was effectively established in the legal case of Pagett [1983]. However, in the case of White [1910] the result would still have occurred 'but for' the defendant's actions, so there was no criminal liability. Legal causation uses the 'operative and substantial' test. The defendant's acts must be the 'operative and substantial' cause of the result, as seen in the case of Smith [1959].  Mens rea element  The mens rea involves the different states of mind which demonstrate the relationship between degree of fault and liability. Depending on the different state of mind of the defendant at the time of committing the unlawful act, different sentences will be given. =Murder= A specific intent offence, such as murder, seen in the case of R v Vickers (1957),http://sixthformlaw.info/02_cases/mod3a/cases_32_murder_mens.htm requires intention to cause a specific result. The mens rea of murder is intention to kill or to cause grievous bodily harm. Intention is the most serious of states of mind the defendant can have, and this high level of fault is reflected in strict and long sentencing. Murder carries a mandatory life sentence, though the judge can impose a recommended minimum number of years as to which the defendant must serve before being eligible for release. However if a murder is done with specific intent in the name of a religion, ideology etc., or to particularly vulnerable groups of people such as children, or is done so continuously (such as terrorism or serial killing) then it may be that the defendant is given a whole life tariff (never sees daylight again) to reflect his level of fault. =Recklessness= There is also subjective recklessness, such as in the case of R v Cunningham (1957),http://www.kevinboone.com/lawglos_RVCunningham1957.html where the defendant is not required to intend the consequence to come from his actions, but the defendant realised the risk that this consequence would occur and took the risk anyway. Such state of mind is required in most non ‚Äì fatal offences, such as *common assault (see section 39 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988) *the assault element of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, contrary to section 47 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861 *inflicting grievous bodily harm, contrary to section 20 of that Act. In all of these offences the defendant is liable of the offence and at fault if he commits the offence intending for the damage to be done, or being subjectively reckless as to whether the damage occurs. For these recklessness is sufficient to prove fault in the defendant. =Gross negligence= The defendant can also be grossly negligent, which is the mens rea required by involuntary manslaughter offences, such as seen in the case of R v Adomako (1994), where the defendant was held to be negligent as he had \\"breached a duty of care\\".  Defences  Some defences work by showing lack of fault through the involuntary nature of the defendant's conduct. Others, such as insanity and intoxication, work by establishing a lack of mental control or awareness on the part of the defendant. Still others, such as Duress and self‚Äìdefence, operate by establishing that the defendant's conduct was justified or should be excused. Finally the partial defences to murder, such as loss of self-control (previously provocation), diminished responsibility and suicide pact demonstrate a lesser degree of fault, resulting in conviction for the lesser offence of manslaughter. =Intoxication= The use of intoxication as a defence is based on whether the offence is one of basic intent or specific intent, and also whether the intoxication was voluntary or involuntary. For example, getting voluntarily intoxicated and committing actual bodily harm (a crime of basic intent) will result in the defence of intoxication failing, as getting voluntarily intoxicated is viewed as reckless by the courts, which is sufficient for basic intent offences. Specific intent crimes demand proof of intention, and if the defendant did not form that mens rea, he cannot be guilty of the specific intent offence. However, often there is a basic intent offence as a fall-back in such cases, e.g. if the defendant is charged with grievous bodily harm or wounding under s18 Offences against the Person Act 1861 but did not form the specific intent, he can be charged under s20 of that act, which has the same actus reus, but requires only intention or recklessness as to 'some harm' (making it a basic intent offence). However, there are some crimes that do not have this fall-back position (e.g. theft). =Consent= The defence of consent is often only available to smaller offences, such as Common Assault and, possibly, Actual bodily harm (S.47). The Attorney General's Reference [No. 6 of 1980] set s47 as a watershed, above which consent is unlikely to function as a defence as it is not reasonable to foresee that a person would consent to having serious harm done to them. However, cases are decided on an individual basis, and case law shows that a victim may effectively consent to even grievous bodily harm (e.g. in sport, in the case of Barnes [2004]). Sentencing Both the type of sentence imposed, and its severity, is in large part determined by the degree of fault shown by the defendant. This can also be seen in the impact of both aggravating and mitigating factors. This is why some people are opposed to the use of minimum and mandatory sentences, as they break the relationship between the degree of fault present in the offence committed and the sentence imposed. A guilty plea can have an effect on the sentence, depending on when it is made. Making a guilty plea before the start of the trial can reduce the sentence imposed by up to one third but changing the plea to guilty once the trial has started can only reduce it by one tenth. This is because admitting fault after the trial has begun has wasted court time and money (for jury and judge etc.), so this is reflected in the sentence. Tariffs and minimum sentences also illustrate that fault is relevant to the sentencing process, whether the defendant pleads guilty or is found guilty in court. =Types of sentences= Types of sentences will also reflect level of blameworthiness: * Custodial sentence * Suspended sentence * Curfew * Extended sentence * Community sentence * Fine * Conditional discharge or Absolute discharge Strict liability There is a role for strict liability in criminal law, in relation to both regulatory offences and offences of social danger. It can be argued that the interests of society as a whole can sometimes justify the imposition of liability without fault. Nevertheless, it should be pointed out that the degree of fault still plays an important part in determining the sentence following a conviction ;Conditions for strict liability: * Only actus reus needs to be established * No blameworthiness is required on the part of the defendant * It normally applies to regulatory offences (health and safety, minor traffic offences etc.) * The advantages and disadvantages must be considered ;Cases include * Sweet v Parsley (1969) http://www.peterjepson.com/law/strict_liability_issues.htm ‚Äì where the defendant was found guilty of allowing her property to be used for cannabis smoking. Even though she had no knowledge of the offence, it was on her property so she was liable without fault. This conviction was later quashed by the House of Lords on the grounds that knowledge of the use of the premises was essential to the offence. Since she had no such knowledge, she did not commit the offence. * Harrow London Borough Council v Shah and another (1999) https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/law-report-case- summaries-1094146.html \\\\- relating to the sale of a lottery ticket to a person who had not attained the age of 16 years. = Advantages of strict liability = * Many strict liability offences concern the running of a business, and if the business runs properly the actus reus will never occur. This means that many strict liability offences keep many businesses in line * A person or company taking a risk in order to make a profit ought to be liable if the risk causes problems to others * Certain activities must be prohibited for the public good and, so long as the penalty is not too severe, the public interest in, for example, preventing pollution outweighs the public interest in not convicting those who are without special fault * For some offences, it would be impossible to secure a conviction if guilty knowledge had to be proved, particularly where the defendant was a company rather than an individual.

He wants to be master of his house, but finds his wife and his children ignoring him, until they start making demands for him to change his own life. The story draws largely on the insistence by his wife that Clarence be baptized and Clarence's stubborn, sometimes ill-tempered nature.

His wife Vinnie is the real head of the household. In keeping with the Day's actual family, all the children (all boys) are redheads. The anecdotal story encompasses such details as Clarence's attempts to find a new maid, a romance between his oldest son Clarence Jr. and pretty out-of-towner Mary Skinner, a plan by Clarence Jr. and his younger brother John to make easy money selling patent medicines, Clarence's general contempt for the era's political corruption and the trappings of organized religion, and Vinnie's push to get him baptized so he can enter the kingdom of God.Erikson, Hal.

She is best known for directing the series of Far til Fire (Father of Four) comedies and the series of family dramas based on Morten Korch novels. Having written 38 produced screenplays and directed 72 feature films, O'Fredericks was one of the most prolific directors in Danish cinema. O'Fredericks also directed the first Danish films which highlighted women's rights. The Alice Award, presented annually to the Best Female Director at the Copenhagen International Film Festival, is named in her honor. Early life Alice O'Fredericks was born Mitzi Otha Alice Fredericksen on 8 September 1899 in Gothenburg, Sweden, the daughter of Danish parents. Her parents divorced when she was a young girl, after which she moved with her mother to Copenhagen. She was educated at a secretarial school then landed a job in 1918 as a script girl for Danish director, Benjamin Christensen. At this time she adopted the stage name of Alice O'Fredericks. In 1920, O'Fredericks stepped in front of the camera, making her film debut as a nun in Christensen's controversial silent film H√§xan (The Witches). Through the 1920s, she performed in several films including Gudmundur Kamban's drama Hadda Padda, and the comedy Pas Paa Pigerne for the popular Danish duo of Ole & Axel (Carl Schenstr√∏m and Harold Madsen). She created the Tumling Film production company with actor Johannes Meyer, played the starring role in two movies for Nordisk Film, and finished her acting career in George Schn√©evoigt's 1929 Norwegian production of Laila. Filmmaking career O'Fredericks debuted as a screenwriter in 1928 after winning a contest sponsored by the B.T. newspaper. Her manuscript became the Ole & Axel film Filmens Helte (The Heroes of the Movies). Thereafter she was employed with Palladium Film as a screenwriter and became a director's assistant to Lau Lauritzen Sr. Through Lauritzen's mentoring, O'Fredericks learned the craft of filmmaking which laid the groundwork for her long and successful career as a director. She began directing films in 1934 in partnership with Lauritzen's son, Lau Lauritzen Jr.. Their first effort was the farce Ud i den kolde sne (Out in the Cold Snow). The O'Fredericks-Lauritzen partnership flourished and they made 27 films together during the 1930s and 1940s. In 1950, she took a solo turn in the director's chair at ASA Film with the filmatization of the Morten Korch novel De r√∏de heste (The Red Horse). Korch's novels about rural life were very popular in Denmark but until then had never been transferred to the screen. The Red Horses was a huge success, and with 2.3 million viewers, became the most watched film in Danish history. O'Fredericks went on to film six more Korch novels. She also made several films in partnership with Jon Iversen and Robert Saaskin. During the same period, O'Fredericks created her popular series of Far til Fire (Father to Four) family comedies. Between 1953-61, she wrote and directed eight of them. During her later years O'Fredericks suffered from rheumatism that confined her to a wheelchair. Nonetheless, she continued to write and direct, and she often employed two men to carry her around the set. In the mid-1960s she wrote and directed a series of three rural dramas, the N√¶sbygaard films. These became her final films. O'Fredericks died of rheumatism on 18 February 1968 in Hellerup, Denmark. With a total of 72 films directed and 38 produced screenplays, O'Fredericks is one of Denmark's most productive filmmakers ever. Although film critics of her day gave her folk comedies only faint praise, her films were some of the most popular in Danish cinema. O'Fredericks is noted as a pioneer for women filmmakers. She wrote and directed some of the first Danish films which focused on women and women's rights. These include her 1946 drama S√• m√∏des vi hos Tove (We Meet at Tove's) about eight women who meet ten years after their graduation to discuss their lives; and 1943's Det Br√¶ndende sp√∏rgsm√•l (The Burning Question) about abortion and its consequences. In 2003, the Copenhagen International Film Festival created the Alice Award, named in her honor, to be given annually to the Best Female Director. Personal life O'Fredericks was married to Danish businessman and wholesaler Oskar Klintholm from 1927 until his death in 1959.

It was a part of the Crimean War. Background Constructed during the Swedish rule of Finland in the 18th century, the fortress of Viapori (:sv:Sveaborg, renamed in Finnish in 1918 as :fi:Suomenlinna) was the main defensive installation in the Grand Duchy of Finland. After the capital of the Grand Duchy of Finland was moved from Turku to Helsinki in 1812 the value of Viapori only increased. However, by the Crimean War the artillery of the fortress had already become obsolete. After the engagements of 1854 Russians (and Finns) expected an attack on Viapori in 1855. The small skirmishes that had been fought along the coast between Russian and British/French forces in the early summer of 1855 only worsened the fear while bulk of the Russian fleet had become isolated and surrounded in the port and fortress of Kronstadt off Saint Petersburg. Battle A map of the positions of the attacking ships British and French naval forces consisting of 77 ships arrayed for the long-expected battle on 6 August 1855. They formed into a battle line more than 3 km off shore beyond the range of the defenders' obsolete artillery. Three days later the bombardment commenced. It continued for 47‚Äì48 hours all the while the attacker sat beyond the range of the defenders' guns. The British and French bombarded only the fortress of Viapori and avoided firing at the town of Helsinki directly. While the bombardment caused damage to the structures above ground, including to several gunpowder magazines which exploded, the bulk of the defending forces survived unscathed with their weaponry intact leading to a stalemate with the attackers guns being unable to defeat the defender and defenders guns being unable to reach the attacker. Once the guns had become silenced the ships remained in the same offshore position leading to growing fears of a landing. However British and French forces landed troops neither at Viapori nor Helsinki, and eventually withdrew.

The village consists of a grade school, a soccer field, two churches, several pulperias (micro stores), and scores of residences. Chapagua is one of the most communities where no violence occurs, at the municipal level it is a very quiet community where there is no danger to its inhabitants, it is currently a community where it is stamped by the river Aguan that currently passes through the river Chapagua , besides the government of the republic of Honduras has forgotten to help this community, where the river year after year is eating it. History Chapagua was a Nahuatl settlement during the pre-Columbian period and was home to a community of English-speaking Blacks in the nineteenth century. Hurricane Mitch devastated the community in 1998, washing away the adobe and thatch houses and killing virtually all the livestock. The houses have since been rebuilt with concrete. Dozens of Chapaguenses migrated to the United States in the aftermath of Mitch. Many of the remaining residents are cattle ranchers and farmers.

Early life and education  Ricotti was born on 31 January 1949, in London, England, into a musical family and took up percussion, following his father who was a drummer. He came to the attention of teacher Bill Ashton who encouraged him to extend his studies. Ashton would embark on a project that eventually became the National Youth Jazz Orchestra. Ricotti concentrated on the vibraphone and developed his talents as a composer and arranger, playing in the NYJO while a teenager and then attending Trinity College of Music between 1967 and 1970.https://www.allmusic.com/artist/frank- ricotti-mn0000791561  Career  Ricotti worked with Neil Ardley (1968‚Äì71), Dave Gelly, Graham Collier, Mike Gibbs (1969‚Äì72), Stan Tracey (1970), Harry Beckett (1970‚Äì72), Norma Winstone (1971), Gordon Beck (1973‚Äì74), Hans Zimmer. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Ricotti led his own jazz quartet. A line-up of the band featuring the guitarist Chris Spedding, bassist Chris Laurence and drummer Bryan Spring recorded the album Our Point of View, released in July 1969. In 1971, in partnership with bassist Mike de Albuquerque, he released the album First Wind (as 'Ricotti and Albuquerque'). In the 1980s he played with Chris Laurence and John Taylor in the group Paragonne, and played with Beck again in 1984. After this he worked primarily as a studio musician. Ricotti has recorded with artists such as Status Quo, Freddie Mercury, Pet Shop Boys, Swing Out Sister, Art of Noise, The Style Council, Belle and Sebastian, Clannad, Barclay James Harvest, Meat Loaf, Elkie Brooks, Rick Wakeman, Oasis, Tina Turner, Aztec Camera, Thomas Anders, Alphaville and Mark Knopfler.

An infielder, Ruiz played in Major League Baseball for the Cincinnati Reds and California Angels from 1964 through 1971. He was the only major-league player ever to pinch-hit for Johnny Bench. He is, however, best remembered for a play he made his rookie season. His steal of home on September 21, 1964 has entered baseball folklore. Viewed by most over the years as \\"mad\\" or \\"zany,\\" the play received a revisionist defense that put it in perspective as a daring and worthwhile gamble. Ruiz is most well known for his steal home against the Philadelphia Phillies, often viewed as the turning point of the Phillies late season standings collapse in 1964. Early years Ruiz was born in Santo Domingo, Cuba, on December 5, 1938. His father, who owned a cigar factory, wanted Giraldo to succeed him in running the business. However, Chico attended college, where he studied architecture. His brother, Julio, later headed the labor force of Cubatabaco, which absorbed the Sabl√≥n business and various other private-sector tobacco enterprises. Ruiz signed with the Cincinnati Redlegs in at age 19. He was among the last of the Cuban players to make it out of Cuba before the borders were sealed. He batted .275 with 28 home runs over six seasons in their farm system before making the renamed Cincinnati Reds out of spring training in . Though he was a shortstop by trade, he made all 79 of his appearances on the field at either second or third base. Ruiz married Isabel Su√°rez Navarro on October 4, 1961. They later had two daughters, Isis and B√°rbara Isa. \\"The Curse of Chico Ruiz\\" On September 21, 1964, facing Art Mahaffey and the Philadelphia Phillies, Ruiz singled with one out in the sixth and the score 0‚Äì0. He advanced to third base on a single by Vada Pinson; however, Pinson made the second out of the inning trying to stretch it into a double. With two outs, Frank Robinson stepped to the plate. Though in later years Mahaffey recalled he had gotten two strikes on Robinson, newspaper accounts at the time showed, in actuality, the count was 0‚Äì1. Ruiz, noting Mahaffey had used a long windup on the first pitch, broke for home on the next delivery. Seeing the runner, a rattled Mahaffey rushed and uncorked a pitch which Phillies catcher Clay Dalrymple could not handle. Ruiz stole home, accounting for the only run of the game. Then and later, Ruiz's decision was viewed as a bad one, considering that Robinson‚ÄîCincinnati's best hitter‚Äîwas up. Sabermetric analysis, however, shows that it was not a bad percentage play. At the start of that game, the Phillies had a 6¬Ω-game hold on first place with 12 games to play. The Phillies then lost ten straight games to finish tied for second place. Phillies third baseman Dick Allen is quoted in Crash, The Life and Times of Dick Allen by Tim Whitaker as saying that the play \\"broke our humps\\". Chico Ruiz's steal of home has evolved into a popular culture legend. Some Philadelphia sports fans still refer to the \\"Curse of Chico Ruiz\\" as the reason for many of the misfortunes of the team over time. A novel by Gregory T. Glading entitled 64 Intruder centers on what might have happened had Ruiz been called out on the play. Ruiz with the Cincinnati Reds \\"Bench me or trade me\\" With Pete Rose at second, Deron Johnson at third and Leo C√°rdenas at short, Ruiz was squeezed out of a very solid infield, and saw very little playing time over the next two seasons. He took it in stride, bringing a cushion to sit on the bench, a pair of special soft, comfortable alligator spiked shoes and a battery-driven fan the people in St. Louis gave him at their games to keep himself cool and comfortable on the bench. His chance finally arrived in when C√°rdenas broke his finger. He performed admirably in C√°rdenas' absence, batting .283 with five runs scored and four runs batted in while providing solid defense at short. This was followed with a two-week stint at second while second baseman Tommy Helms shifted over to short. During the hot summer stretch, Ruiz said playing every day was killing him and jokingly demanded to Reds manager Dave Bristol, \\"Bench me or trade me.\\" Regardless of his \\"demand\\", Ruiz remained with the Reds for two more seasons. Following the season, he and outfielder Alex Johnson were traded to the California Angels for pitchers Pedro Borb√≥n, Jim McGlothlin and Vern Geishert. Angels and Alex Johnson Despite Johnson having a reputation as a malcontent, he and Ruiz were good friends. In fact, Ruiz was the godfather of Johnson's adopted daughter. Johnson won the American League batting crown in , their first season together with the Angels. However, during spring training in several bouts of \\"indifferent play\\" landed him in the middle of Angels manager Lefty Phillips' crosshairs. The trend continued into the regular season as Johnson was benched three times in May for indifferent play. Meanwhile, the relationship between Ruiz and Johnson also began to sour. Johnson would scream obscenities at Ruiz whenever they were near each other, and Ruiz had reportedly challenged Johnson to a fight on more than one occasion, regardless of the fact that Ruiz was much smaller. Tensions hit a climax when Johnson claimed that Ruiz pointed a gun at him while the two were in the clubhouse following a June 13 loss to the Washington Senators. Ruiz denied the claim but Angels GM Dick Walsh later admitted during Johnson's arbitration case over his suspension that the incident had indeed occurred. Shortly after the alleged incident, Ruiz was demoted to the Triple-A Salt Lake City Angels. The Angels would clean house after the season. Phillips and Walsh were both fired, Johnson was traded to the Cleveland Indians, and Ruiz was released. Shortly afterwards, Ruiz signed with the Kansas City Royals. Death Ruiz became a United States citizen on January 7, 1972, something which made him very proud. Early in the morning of February 9, just before he was to join his new team, the Royals, in spring training, Ruiz was killed when he drove his car into a sign pole while driving alone outside of San Diego. Alex Johnson attended the funeral. His remarried widow, Isabel Sabl√≥n D√≠az, died in late September 2019. She was the stepmother of Major League Baseball umpire Laz Diaz.

It spontaneously formed from the Texian Militia in October 1835 following the Battle of Gonzales. Along with the Texian Navy, it helped the Republic of Texas win independence from the Centralist Republic of Mexico on May 14, 1836 at the Treaties of Velasco. Although the Texas Army was officially established by the Consultation of the Republic of Texas on November 13, 1835, it did not replace the Texian Army until after the Battle of San Jacinto. Organization When Mexico gained its independence from Spain in 1821, the former Spanish province of Texas became part of the Mexican state Coahuila y Tejas.Manchaca (2001), p. 161. Many of the people who lived in Texas, which had included the land north of the Medina and the Nueces Rivers, northeast of the Rio Grande,Edmondson (2000), p. 6. west of San Antonio de Bexar, and east of the Sabine River,Edmondson (2000), p. 6.Edmondson (2000), p. 10.Manchaca (2001), p. 162. wished to be a separate state again. For the first time, the government of Texas encouraged immigrants from the United States to settle its lands.Manchaca (2001), p. 164. By 1834, an estimated 30,000 English speakers lived in Texas,Manchaca (2001), p. 201. compared to only 7,800 of Spanish heritage.Manchaca (2001), p. 172. The bankrupt Mexican government was unable to offer Texas much military support.Edmondson (2000), p. 75. Many of the settlements had created small militias to protect themselves against raids by Indian tribes. Texian Army volunteers elected Stephen F. Austin their first commander-in-chief. General and President of Mexico Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna issued orders to the Mexican Army to show no quarter to the Texian Army rebels Under President Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna the government of Mexico began to drift towards a more centralist form.Barr (1990), p. 2. In 1835 Santa Anna revoked the Constitution of 1824 and began reigning as a dictator. In various parts of the country federalists revolted.Hardin (1994), p. 6. In September 1835, Colonel Domingo Ugartechea, the military commander of the Mexican forces at San Antonio de Bexar set troops to recover a small cannon that had been given to the Texian Militia of Gonzales for protection. When the Mexican troops, under Lieutenant Francisco de Casta√±eda, reached Gonzales, Texian commander Captain Albert Martin convinced the troops to wait for several days.Hardin (1994), p. 7. Martin then sent messengers to other English-speaking settlements, asking for reinforcements to help protect the cannon.Hardin (1994), p. 8. Within several days, militias from Fayette County and Columbus arrived. In Gonzales, the Texian Militias combined to form the Texian Army and chose John Henry Moore as their captain, Joseph Washington Elliot Wallace as a lieutenant colonel, and Edward Burleson as major. The first military action taken by the new army was the Battle of Gonzales on October 2, 1835. After a skirmish, the Mexican troops withdrew to San Antonio, leaving the cannon with the Texians.Todish et al. (1998), p. 8. After the battle ended, disgruntled colonists continued to assemble in Gonzales, eager to put a decisive end to Mexican control over the area. The Committee of Safety at San Felipe named the gathering \\"The Army of the People.\\"Lack (1992), p. 111. Sam Houston's call for the Army of Texas recruitment proclamation on December 12, 1835 Within a week, the men had taken the Mexican post at Goliad. On October 11, the disorganized volunteers elected Stephen F. Austin, who had settled Texas's first English- speaking colonists in 1821, as their commander-in-chief.Barr (1990), p. 6. Austin had only two months of military experience in the Missouri First Regiment of Mounted Militia under Colonel Alexander McNair, where he earned the rank of quartermaster sergeant, but he saw no combat. Demographics In 1836, Texas had a population of 40,000 people. Approximately 2,000 of the citizens, around 5% of the population, served in the army at some point between October 1835 and April 1846. Still, Historian Paul Lack argues that \\"for a people of such fabled militance, the Texians turned out for army duty in the period of crisis at a low rate of participation\\". The army was augmented with volunteers from the United States. Overall, 3,685 men served in the Army of the People between October 1, 1835 and April 21, 1836. Forty percent of them had emigrated after October 1. Of the Texians, 57.8% were residents of the Department of the Brazos, 10.4% of the Department of Bexar, and 31.7% from the Department of Nacogdoches.Lack (1992), p. 133. Of the men who arrived in Texas after October 1, 1835, not all of these additions were American citizens; many were recent immigrants from Europe who were seeking adventure and potential riches in Texas. Through the course of the Texas Revolution, one in seven of the English-speaking settlers in Texas joined the army. One in three adult male Tejanos, that is, Spanish-speaking settlers in Texas, joined the army.Todish et al. (1998), p. 13. The composition of the army changed dramatically over time, with four distinct waves: *the army of OctoberDecember 1835, which participated in the battles of Gonzales, Goliad and the Siege of Bexar *the army from January through March 1836 *the army of mid-March through April, 1836, which participated in the Battle of San Jacinto *the army of MaySeptember 1836 The early army was composed predominantly of Texas residents, with every municipality represented. Over 1,300 men volunteered for the army in October and November 1835. Of these, approximately 1,1001,500 were residents of Texas, with an average date of emigration of 1830.Lack (1992), pp. 114-5.If the recent arrivals from the United States are considered, the average date of emigration rises to 1832. Lack (1992), pp. 114-5. Half of the men were married. Roughly 51% of them came from the Department of the Brazos, an area in central Texas which consisted of the colonies established by Stephen F. Austin and Green DeWitt, as well as some of the area granted to Sterling C. Robertson. An additional 15% of the volunteers were from the Department of Bexar, where most citizens were Tejano, and which was partially occupied by Mexican troops. Thirty-four percent of the volunteers came from the Nacogdoches district of far East Texas, an area where homes and families were not under threat. After the Texas victory in Bexar in early December, men began leaving the army and returning home. By the end of February 1836, fewer than 600 men remained in the army.Lack (1992), p. 121. A total of 917 men served in the army for varying lengths of time in JanuaryMarch 1836. In a sharp contrast from the army of a few months prior, these men were predominantly newcomers to Texas. The overwhelming majority‚Äî78%‚Äîhad arrived from the United States since the outbreak of hostilities in October. They had an average age of 27, and almost two-thirds were single. Of the Texians who continued to participate, 57% were from the areas most at risk of Mexican attempts to reassert control over its national territory‚ÄîBexar, Gonzales, Matagorda and Jackson‚Äîdespite the small population of these areas. When examined in the context of the political districts, 59% of the Texians were from the Brazos department and 23% from Bexar.Lack (1992), pp. 122-3. The army suffered significant losses at the battles of the Alamo and Coleto. The provisional government passed conscription laws,Lack (1992), p. 124. which should have resulted in about 4,000 men joining the army.Lack (1992), p. 125. The laws were impossible to enforce due to the fact that most citizens had fled as part of the Runaway Scrape. By the Battle of San Jacinto on April 21, new commander Sam Houston had a total of 1,282 recruits in the army. Of these, about 250 were ill, at camp, or on scouting missions at the time of the battle. The average date of emigration was 1835; 21% of the men had arrived in Texas after October 1, 1835, and almost 18% had arrived between January 1 and October 1, 1835.Lack (1992), pp. 128-9. Approximately 60% of the soldiers were single, and their average age was 28. In many families, the younger sons joined the army while the fathers escorted the women and younger children east, away from the advancing Mexican army.Lack (1992), pp. 126-7. 67% of the Texians who volunteered were from the Brazos Department, an impressive number considering the heavy losses many of these areas had sustained in the March fighting. 25% were from the Nacogdoches district, fewer than had served in 1835. Only 5% of the Texians were from the Bexar District. This number was low both because many of the volunteers had perished at the Alamo or Coleto and because the area was now occupied by the Mexican army. It was not only difficult for men to leave the area, but it was unwise to leave their families. The majority of the men from Bexar who served in April were cavalry officers under the command of Colonel Juan Seguin. An additional 623 men served in April outside of Houston's army. Less is known about these men, who had no central command or location. It is estimated that 31% were recent arrivals from the United States. They were older, with an average age of 34, and over 41% of them came from the Nacogdoches district. Historian Paul Lack described these men as a home guard, a \\"last line of defense\\" for the Texians. 398 men served in both 1835 and April 1836. Of these, 58% were single, with an average age of 30, and 26% had arrived in Texas after the war began. Of the Texians, 63% were from the Brazos district, 11% from Bexar, and 26% from Nacogdoches.Lack (1992), p. 130. Lack posits that many of those who chose not to re-enlist in April 1836 believed that they had done their duty. For the most part, they were older and, as they had been in Texas longer, they had more to protect.Lack (1992), p. 132. Believing the hostilities were over, by the end of May, most of the Texas residents had left the army, which shrank to 400 men. With fears of a Mexican counterattack spreading, more volunteers arrived from the United States. By June, the ranks had increased to 1300‚Äì1700 men, and by September to 2,500 men, spread across 53 companies. Of those in the army in September, 1,800 had come to Texas after the Battle of San Jacinto.Lack (1992), p. 134. Formation and structure The structure of the Texian Army was relatively fluid. Originally, it was composed entirely Texian Militia who came and went at will. To become an officer, a man must simply have had enough money or charisma to convince others to serve under him. In the first half of the Texas Revolution, many of the units and individual volunteers came from the United States. The United States volunteer units in the Army represented ten states; from New Orleans, Louisiana the New Orleans Greys, from Alabama the Red Rovers, Huntsville Rovers, and Mobile Greys, from Mississippi the Mississippi Guards and Natchez Mustangs, from New York the 1st New York Battalion and 2nd New York Battalion and from other states the Georgia Volunteers, Kentucky Mustangs, Missouri Invincibles, North Carolina Volunteers, and Tennessee Mounted Volunteers, and Union Guards By the end of the war, the army had grown to include three distinct divisions. Members of the regular army enlisted for two years and were subject to army discipline and the army's chain of command. A squad of permanent volunteers enlisted for the duration of the war. This group was permitted to elect its own officers, outside the oversight of the army commander-in-chief. Most of the men who joined the permanent volunteers had settled in Texas before the war had begun, both Tejano and Texians. The last unit was the volunteer auxiliary corps, comprising primarily recent arrivals from the United States who officially enlisted for a six-month term. On November 24, 1835, the Texas provisional government authorized the creation of ranging companies of rifleman.

Uniforms, weapons, and equipment Neither the regular nor volunteer components of the Texian Army were issued specific uniforms. Several of the companies that formed in the United States, including the New Orleans Greys, purchased U.S. Army surplus uniforms before they arrived.Hardin (1994), p. 60.

History The campaigns of the Texian Army during the Texas Revolution =Offensive maneuvers (October ‚Äì December 1835)= Several days after Austin took command, the army marched towards Bexar to confront General Martin Perfecto de Cos, who had recently arrived to command the remaining Mexican troops in Texas. Texian soldiers fighting in the Battle of Gonzales, the first battle of the Texas Revolution Texian soldiers in the victory at the Battle of Goliad which was followed by the Goliad Massacre Davy Crockett leading Texian defenders in the Battle of the Alamo which depicted him wielding his rifle as a club against Mexican troops who have breached the walls of the old Spanish mission =Restructuring (December 1835 ‚Äì February 1836)= The regular division of the Army was officially established on December 12. Any man who enlisted in the regular division would receive $24 in cash, the rights to of land, and instant Texas citizenship. Those who joined the volunteer auxiliary corps would receive of land if they served two years, while those who served 1 year would receive .Todish et al. (1998), p. 28. A month later the establishment of a Legion of Cavalry would be authorized.Thomas W. Cutrer, \\"ARMY OF THE REPUBLIC OF TEXAS,\\" Handbook of Texas Online , accessed April 23, 2011. Published by the Texas State Historical Association. The commander of the regular forces, Sam Houston, called for 5,000 men to enlist in the regular army but had difficulty convincing men to join. Many of the arrivals from the United States did not want to be under a more strict military control, and instead informally joined the volunteer units that had gathered in other parts of Texas. These volunteer soldiers were in many cases more impassioned than the Texas settlers. Although the provisional Texas government was still debating whether the troops were fighting for independence or for separate statehood, on December 20, 1835, the Texian garrison at Goliad voted unanimously to issue a proclamation of independence, stating \\"that the former province and department of Texas is, and of right ought to be, a free, sovereign and independent state\\". The provisional government had originally placed Houston in charge of the regular forces, but in December the council gave secret orders to James Fannin, Frank W. Johnson, and Dr. James Grant to prepare forces to invade Mexico. Houston was then ordered to travel to East Texas to broker a treaty that would allow the Cherokee to remain neutral in the conflict. Johnson and Grant gathered 300 of the 400 men garrisoned in Bexar and left to prepare for the invasion.Todish et al. (1998), p. 29. The government was woefully short of funds. On January 6, 1836, Colonel James C. Neill, commander of the remaining 100 troops in Bexar, wrote to the council: \\" there has ever been a dollar here I have no knowledge of it. The clothing sent here by the aid and patriotic exertions of the honorable Council, was taken from us by arbitrary measures of Johnson and Grant, taken from men who endured all the hardships of winter and who were not even sufficiently clad for summer, many of them having but one blanket and one shirt, and what was intended for them given away to men some of whom had not been in the army more than four days, and many not exceeding two weeks.\\" For the next several months it was unclear who was in charge of the Texian army‚ÄîFannin, Johnson, Grant, or Houston.Todish et al. (1998), p. 30. On January 10, Johnson issued a call to form a Federal Volunteer Army of Texas which would march on Matamoros during the Matamoros Expedition. The Texian Army of Sam Houston soundly defeats Mexican forces at the Battle of San Jacinto ending the hostilities of the Texas Revolution. =Defensive maneuvers (March ‚Äì April 1836)= The Mexican army returned to Texas in February and initiated a siege of the garrison in San Antonio on February 23.Todish et al. (1998), p. 40. The commander at the Alamo, William B. Travis, sent numerous letters to the Texas settlements, begging for reinforcements.Edmondson (2000), pp. 302, 312, 345. Men began to gather in Gonzales to prepare to reinforce the garrison.Edmondson (2000), p. 375. Before they left, the Mexican army launched the Battle of the Alamo, and all of the Texian soldiers who had been stationed in Bexar were killed.Nofi (1992), p. 133. This left two branches of the Texian Army: Fannin's 400 men at GoliadEdmondson (2000), p. 377. and Neill's 400 men at Gonzales,Lindley (2003), p. 310. who soon reported to Houston. On hearing the news of the massacre at the Alamo, Houston ordered his army to retreat and burned the town of Gonzales as they left. He ordered Fannin to bring his men and join the rest of the army.Todish et al. (1998), p. 67. Fannin's force was defeated at the Battle of Coleto Creek, and on March 27 Fannin and his men were executed at the Goliad Massacre. A few soldiers escaped, and 80 soldiers who had just arrived from the United States and had no weapons were spared.Todish et al. (1998), p. 68. As news spread of the defeats at the Alamo and Goliad, men flocked to the Texian army. By early April, Houston commanded about 800 men.Todish et al. (1998), p. 69. The Texas Revolution essentially ended on April 21, when the Texian Army routed a Mexican force and captured Santa Anna at the Battle of San Jacinto. For six months David G. Burnet, ad interim President of the Republic, had diligently maintained the army laws set forth by the Consultation in December 1835. The 1835‚Äì36 Regular Army of Texas would never consist of more than 100 soldiers and would never approach the Consultation's number goal of 560 infantry, 560 artillery and 384 cavalry, in the permanent \\"Regular Army\\" of Texas. However, the goal of independence was achieved, nonetheless.

Authors of fictional works have found his life a compelling source of raw material. Such works have included novels, plays, operas, and films. Fiction * The first major works of literature inspired by Mozart were by the German writers E. T. A. Hoffmann and Eduard M√∂rike. Hoffmann published his Don Juan in 1812, M√∂rike his Mozart's Journey to Prague in 1856. * Mozart appears in Hermann Hesse's novels Der Steppenwolf and Die Morgenlandfahrt. * In 1968, David Weiss published Sacred and profane: a novel of the life and times of Mozart, a narrative account on the composer's life drawing heavily on the documented historical record, but with invented conversations and other details. * In modern fiction, the mystery surrounding the composer's death is explored within a popular thriller context in the 2008 novel The Mozart Conspiracy by British writer Scott Mariani, who departs from the established Salieri-poisoning theory to suggest a deeper political motive behind his death. * Mozart has also featured as a sleuth in detective fiction, in Dead, Mister Mozart and Too many notes, Mr. Mozart, both by Bernard Bastable (who also writes as Robert Barnard). Bastable's stories involve the conceit of an alternate history scenario in which the young Mozart remained on in London at the time of his childhood visit to England, where he has lived a long ‚Äì though not very prosperous ‚Äì life as a hack musician, rather than returning to his native Salzburg or Vienna to die young and celebrated. The stories are set in the 1820s and have Mozart interacting with King George IV and his immediate family including the young Victoria. * Charles Neider's Mozart and the Archbooby is an epistolary novel in which the young Mozart writes to his father about his new life in Vienna and his new problem, the Archbishop of Salzburg. Stephanie Cowell's Marrying Mozart: A Novel provides a fictionalised account of Mozart's relationship with Aloysia Weber before his marriage to her sister, Constanze. * Mirrorshades: The Cyberpunk Anthology (1986) is a defining cyberpunk short story collection, edited by Bruce Sterling. It contains a story, the \\"Mozart in Mirrorshades\\" by Bruce Sterling and Lewis Shiner, in which Mozart appears as a DJ wannabe instead of being the real Mozart after he met the people and culture of his future. *In The Amadeus Net, by Mark A. Rayner, Mozart is an immortal living in the world's first sentient city, Ipolis, where he supports himself by selling \\"lost\\" compositions and playing jazz piano in bars. * The alternate history novel Time for Patriots has a trio of time travelers cure Mozart's wife of an abscess on her ankle (historically documented), which allows them to treat him when he falls ill. In consequence he does an opera based on Benjamin Franklin and composes other works until his death in 1805. * \\"Naththai kuudennum Galaxy\\" ‚Äì A Tamil short story of Konangi fictionalizes Mozart's funeral in the Tamil landscape. Drama * Alexander Pushkin's play Mozart and Salieri is based on the supposed rivalry between Mozart and Antonio Salieri, particularly the idea that it was poison received from the latter that caused Mozart's death. This idea is not supported by modern scholarship. * Peter Shaffer's play Amadeus focuses on the difference between true and sublime genius (Mozart) and mere high-quality craftsmanship (Salieri). Shaffer seems to have been especially taken by the contrast between Mozart's enjoyment of vulgarity (for which historical evidence exists, in the form of his letters to his cousin) and the sublime character of his music. * In 2007, he was portrayed by John Sessions in the Doctor Who audio adventure 100 in a story that explored the ramifications of Mozart being granted immortality. Film * Stephen Haggard portrays Mozart in the 1936 film Whom the Gods Love. * Oskar Werner portrays Mozart in 1958's Mozart. * Shaffer's play was subsequently made into a 1984 film, Amadeus. * In 2010 Mozart's Sister, a biopic of his older sister Nannerl, a young Mozart is played by French child actor David Moreau. * Aneurin Barnard portrays Mozart in the 2017 film Interlude in Prague. * Daniel Dorr portrays Mozart in the 2020 film Bill & Ted Face the Music. * Mentioned during the \\"I've got a dream\\" song in the 2010 film Tangled. Mozart's music has been used extensively in films since the silent era. In 1930, Bu√±uel used his Ave Verum Corpus in L'Age d'Or, Papageno's \\"Ein M√§dchen oder Weibchen\\" from The Magic Flute features in The Blue Angel (1930), the \\"Rondo alla Turca\\" in the 1939 film Wuthering Heights, \\"L√† ci darem la mano\\" in The Picture of Dorian Gray (1945), \\"Il mio tesoro\\" in Kind Hearts and Coronets, the Symphony No. 34 in Vertigo (1958), Eine kleine Nachtmusik in The Ipcress File (1965) and in Picnic at Hanging Rock (1975), the Piano Concerto No. 21 in Elvira Madigan, and in The Spy Who Loved Me (1977), the march from Idomeneo in Barry Lyndon (1975), the Jupiter Symphony in Annie Hall (1977), and many others. Opera * Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov's opera Mozart and Salieri, based on Pushkin's play, treats the Salieri poisoning legend. * In Reynaldo Hahn's \\"com√©die musicale\\" Mozart with words by Guitry, Mozart has amorous adventures in Paris in 1778. * Michael Kunze's and Sylvester Levay's musical, Mozart!, premiered in 1999 to portray an older, more sensually inclined Mozart as he struggles with the spectre of his chaste and productive \\"porcelain\\" boyhood. The musical was composed in German but is currently performed in Hungarian. * The 2009 French musical Mozart, l'op√©ra rock premiered 2009 in Paris. Popular music * \\"Rock Me Amadeus\\" is a 1985 song by Austrian musician Falco from his album Falco 3; it was inspired by the movie Amadeus. * The song \\"Travel\\" by The Gathering (on their album How to Measure a Planet?) was written for and about Mozart. * The Wombles' second album Remember You're a Womble features Minuetto Allegretto, based on the 3rd movement of the Jupiter Symphony.

Per the traditional aphorism, \\"Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence\\", positive evidence of this kind is distinct from a lack of evidence or ignorance of that which should have been found already, had it existed. Overview The difference between evidence that something is absent (e.g., an observation that suggests there were no dragons here today) and simple absence of evidence (e.g., no careful research has been done) can be nuanced. Indeed, scientists will often debate whether an experiment's result should be considered evidence of absence, or if it remains absence of evidence. The debate is whether the experiment would have detected the phenomenon of interest if it were there. The argument from ignorance for \\"absence of evidence\\" is not necessarily fallacious, for example, that a potentially life saving new drug poses no long term health risk unless proved otherwise. On the other hand, were such an argument to rely imprudently on the lack of research to promote its conclusion, it would be considered an informal fallacy whereas the former can be a persuasive way to shift the burden of proof in an argument or debate. Carl Sagan criticized such \\"impatience with ambiguity\\" with cosmologist Martin Rees' maxim, \\"Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence\\". exhaustive inspection of the attic for vermin can provide evidence of absence, but any sign of mice will always suffice to the contrary. In carefully designed scientific experiments, even null results can be evidence of absence. For instance, a hypothesis may be falsified if a vital predicted observation is not found empirically. (At this point, the underlying hypothesis may be rejected or revised and sometimes, additional ad hoc explanations may even be warranted.) Whether the scientific community will accept a null result as evidence of absence depends on many factors, including the detection power of the applied methods, the confidence of the inference, as well as confirmation bias within the community. =Proof and evidence= The Pyrrhonian skeptic, Sextus Empiricus, questioned the apodicticity of inductive reasoning because a universal rule cannot be established from an incomplete set of particular instances: \\"When they propose to establish the universal from the particulars by means of induction, they will effect this by a review of either all or some of the particulars. But if they review some, the induction will be insecure, since some of the particulars omitted in the induction may contravene the universal; while if they are to review all, they will be toiling at the impossible, since the particulars are infinite and indefinite\\".Sextus Empiricus. Outlines of Pyrrhonism trans. R.G. Bury (Loeb edition) (London: W. Heinemann, 1933), p. 283. Proving a negative A negative claim is a colloquialism for an affirmative claim that asserts the non-existence or exclusion of something. Claiming that it is impossible to prove a negative is a pseudologic, because there are many proofs that substantiate negative claims in mathematics, science, and economics, including Euclid's theorem, which proves that that there is no largest prime number, and Arrow's impossibility theorem. There can be multiple claims within a debate. Nevertheless, whoever makes a claim carries the burden of proof regardless of positive or negative content in the claim. A negative claim may or may not exist as a counterpoint to a previous claim. A proof of impossibility or an evidence of absence argument are typical methods to fulfill the burden of proof for a negative claim. Philosopher Steven Hales argues that typically one can logically be as confident with the negation of an affirmation. Hales says that if one's standards of certainty leads them to say \\"there is never 'proof' of non-existence\\", then they must also say that \\"there is never 'proof' of existence either\\". Hales argues that there are many cases where we may be able to prove something does not exist with as much certainty as proving something does exist.

Preparation and serving  Beef pyeonyuk mainly uses brisket, plate, foreshank, tongue, testicle, mammary, head, liver, spleen, and trotters, while pork pyeonyuk uses belly, head, and trotters. The meat is always soaked in cold water to remove blood, and it is boiled as a whole chunk until tender. The broth for cooking the meat is flavored with salt and other seasonings that may vary from household to household, and can include doenjang (soybean paste), soju, cheongju (rice wine), black peppercorns, or coffee powder. Scallions and whole garlic cloves are a common addition in the broth when beef is used, and sliced ginger for pork. After the meat is tender, it is wrapped in cloth and pressed with a weight. Then it is sliced thin and served with a dipping sauce: cho-ganjang (soy sauce‚Äìvinegar mixture) or gyeoja-chojang (soy sauce, vinegar, and mustard mixture) for the beef pyeonyuk, and saeu-jeot (salted shrimps) for the pork pyeonyuk. Pork pyeonyuk may also be eaten wrapped with baechu-kimchi (cabbage kimchi), or in lettuce or perilla leaves as ssam (wrap). Common side dishes for pyeonyuk include geotjeori (fresh kimchi), mu-mallaengi-muchim (spicy dried radish salad), and saengchae-muchim (spicy vegetable salad). Pyeonyuk may also be used as a topping for other dishes such as naengmyeon (cold noodles), and seolleongtang (ox bone soup).

In an extensive career devoted to creative pursuit Treloar has addressed himself to the problems of relationship found at the intersection of notated music-composition and improvisation. In 1987 Treloar coined the term, Collective Autonomy, to signify his endeavor in this field of work. Fundamental in this has been composition- and performance- development projects, with these at times involving electronic media. Collaborations have, and continue to be, crucial. Biography Phil Treloar was born in Sydney on 7 December 1946. He commenced his musical career in the late 1960s, playing drums with various groups at local Sydney venues and in the early 1970s was very active in the Australian jazz scene, playing with musicians such as Alan Lee, with Roger Frampton and Barry Guy, Erroll Buddle, Judy Bailey, and Bernie McGann, then worked with Frampton again in the Intersection group in 1984, which toured Asia. During the first half of the 1970s he was also a member of the Jazz Co-Op, along with Roger Frampton (piano and saxes), Howie Smith (saxes), and Jack Thorncraft (bass). The Jazz Co-op was one of the most influential jazz units in Sydney during the 70s, and worked at major venues such as The Sydney Opera House, Sydney Town Hall and played to packed houses at over 30 engagements at Sydney's premier jazz club at that time, The Basement. In 1980 Treloar performed with the Bruce Cale Quartet with Bruce Cale (bass) Roger Frampton (piano and saxes) and Dale Barlow (saxes). Two live concerts by this group have been recorded, The Bruce Cale Quartet Live (Adelaide concert) and On Fire ‚Äì The Sydney Concert. Under the guidance of Dr. Graham Hair he received the B.Mus. degree, composition major, from the Sydney Conservatorium of Music, 1988. He has also studied in New York, USA, with renowned jazz drummer, Billy Hart, 1980; in Delhi, India, at Gandharva Mahavidyalaya with the Khayal vocalist, Madhup Mudgalaya, 1984; and in Colombo, Sri Lanka, at the Institute of Aesthetic Studies, with Piasara Silpadipathi, 1984. Treloar held a lecturer's position at La Trobe University teaching composition, performance, and music theory, 1989‚Äì90. He has fulfilled composer residencies and guest lectureships at NSW State Conservatory of Music, Victoria College of the Arts (VCA), Perth Conservatory, Conservatorium of Tasmania, and Hobart College of the Arts. In the areas of jazz and improvised music Treloar has shared in creative partnerships with musicians such as: Roger Frampton, Mark Simmonds, Steve Elphick, Jack Thorncraft, David Ades, Bruce Cale, Carl Dewhurst, Bernie McGann, Simone De Haan, Daryl Pratt, Hamish Stuart, Peter boothman, Chuck Yates, Bobbie Gebert, Mike Nock, Dale Barlow, Michele Morgan, Scott Tinkler, Errol Buddle, Judy Bailey, John Clare. International artists include Barry Guy, David Baker, Chico Freeman, Howie Smith, David Friesen, Ricky Ford, Chip Jackson, and The World Drum Ensemble. He led his own groups in the 1980s, including Expansions (1981‚Äì82) and Feeling to Thought (1987‚Äì89). Among composer commissions and premiere performances are: the late Gabor Reeves, Ron Reaves, Steve Reaves, Ros Dunlop, David Miller, Julia Ryder, Simone DeHaan, Christian Wojtowicz, Michael Kieran Harvey, Geoff Dodd, Mardi McSullea, Mike Nock, Hamish Stuart, Graeme Leak, Daryl Pratt, Tom O'Kelly, Pipeline Contemporary Music Project, The Astra Choir, Synergy Percussion, Victorian College of the Arts, Australian Broadcasting Corporation, the University of Tasmania Conservatorium, Miki KIDO, Shunsuke Omura, Takashi Yamane, Hisae Kido, Junko Kamishima, Sotoko Hiramatsu, Eri Yoshimura, Kimiko Sunakawa. In the 1988 Australian Bicentennial New Directions concert series a complete program was devoted to Treloar's work. Many of his compositions have been recorded and broadcast, particularly by the ABC. In addition to vinyl records and CDs his work has been featured in radio and film documentaries, the 4 x 1hr. Intersections (ABC radio) and Beyond El Rocco (film) are representative. In more recent years Treloar's work has been performed in the Sydney Opera House and at the international Wangaratta Festival of Jazz. Throughout his career Treloar's thoughts and concepts regarding creative musical expression have been accounted for in various publications: Nation Review, The Sydney Morning Herald, East West Arts, Jazz, Sounds Australian, The Mercury, 24 Hours, etc. He moved to Kanazawa, Japan in 1992 where his two-hour work, Zen's Way: Through the Eye of Gogo-an ‚Äì homage to Ryokan, received its world premiere performance in Kanazawa, 2004. Phil also presents solo percussion recitals and to date two of these have been published as CDs. On occasions he has been invited by the Japan Poets' Association to perform improvised music together with poetry readings. A major event inspired by the poetry of Matsuo Bash≈ç, October 2005, and for which Treloar provided the music, is indicative of the creative interaction he shares with the Japanese tradition. Facing East, a performance initiative inaugurated by Phil in 2005 and based in Kanazawa, presents occasional concerts. These have premiered several new works written by Treloar and for which Australian, together with Japanese artists, have been invited to participate. Stemming from this initiative, Converging Paths, a collaboration with the Australian percussionist, Hamish Stuart, has, to date, generated a three-CD series. Phil's lifelong project, Collective Autonomy, continues to engage him with research. In a nutshell, Collective Autonomy explores the intersection between improvised and composed/notated music-making. It provides a space wherein individuals' concerns and abilities to enter into creative discourse might be enabled, and specifically, where the notion of interdependence is wholeheartedly embraced.

The primary, UScoCTIO 108A, with mass around 0.06 solar masses, is a brown dwarf or low-mass red dwarf. The secondary, UScoCTIO 108B, with a mass around the deuterium burning limit of 13 Jupiter masses, would be classified as either a brown dwarf or an extrasolar planet. The primary component of the system was discovered in 2000 as a possible member of the Upper Scorpius association, based on its position in a HR diagram, in a search for new member of the association by the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO), where it received the designation UScoCTIO 108. Later, spectroscopic and photometric observations confirmed that the object is a real member of the association, showing signs of low gravity and youth, and estimated a mass of 60 times the mass of Jupiter (MJ), an effective temperature of 2,800 K and a spectral type of M7. The low mass indicates that the object is not able to sustain hydrogen fusion, making it a brown dwarf. The secondary member of the system was found in 2008 as an object located at a separation of 4.6 arcseconds, which corresponds to a physical separation of more than 670 AU, and is also a confirmed member of the Upper Scorpius association. Its spectrum shows it is also a cold substellar object, with an effective temperature of 2,300 K and a spectral type of M9.5. Its mass was originally estimated at 14 MJ, very close to the nominal boundary between planets and brown dwarf, but a recent revision of the age of the Upper Scorpius association to 11 million years increased this value to 16 MJ, indicating that the object is likely a low mass brown dwarf. The physical association between the two brown dwarfs has not been confirmed by observation of common proper motion, but is considered very likely given the proximity between them. The minimum separation between the two brown dwarfs, 670 AU, is much larger than the mean of other similar mass systems, and indicates that the pair (if they really form a binary system) is very weakly bound, with an escape velocity for the secondary component of only 0.4 km/s. Considering the average stellar density in an association like Upper Scorpius, it is estimated that perturbations by passing stars will cause the rupture of the system in a few million years. Observations by the infrared telescope WISE revealed excess emission at 12 and 22 Œºm, indicating the presence of a debris disk around the brown dwarf.

Some words of Latin origin no longer present in modern Welsh may be seen in certain place names - for example the second element in Caerllion (Englished as Caerleon) from Latin legio, legion- (= body of soldiers, legion), which in turn is from the verb legere (= to gather; to read).

In a long political and activist life, Acharya was at various times associated with India House in London and the Hindu-German Conspiracy during World War I when, as a key functionary of the Berlin Committee, he along with Har Dayal sought to establish the Indian Volunteer Corps with Indian prisoners of war from the battlefields of Mesopotamia and Europe. Acharya subsequently moved in 1919 after the end of the war to the Soviet Union, where he was one of the founding members of the Communist Party of India at Tashkent. However, disappointed with the Communist International, Acharya returned to Europe in the 1920s where he was involved with the League against Imperialism and subsequently was involved with the international anarchist movement. Early life M.P.T. Acharya was born in 1887 in Madras to a family of Aiyangar brahmins. His father, M.P. Narasimha Aiyangar, was an employee in the Madras Public Works Department whose family had originally migrated from the state of Mysore. Young M.P.T. was exposed to nationalism from childhood, with his family playing a prominent role in the rise of Indian nationalism in South India. His close relatives included M.C. Alasinga Perumal, one of the co-founders of the Brahmavadin journal, as well as Prof. Rangachari of Madras Presidency College. Acharya himself was an admirer of Swami Vivekananda in his childhood. By 1900, a young Acharya, along with Subramanya Bharathi, had begun publication of the weekly journal called India, and worked hard to popularise the publication within a short time. However, the journal's nationalist editorials and critical and satirical cartoons quickly drew the attention of The Raj, forcing the young editors to quietly shift to the French enclave of Pondicherry, following the trail of notable numbers who migrated to the enclave as refugees. The publication also acquired popularity in Pondicherry. Work of the press continued unabated for M.P.T. Acharya, and was expanded to publications of revolutionary literature. The British Government began to seek French assistance to ban the publications which were deemed \\"seditious literature\\". Under pressure from British Indian authorities, the French authority in Pondicherry relented, allowing British Indian police to establish surveillance centres to monitor the activities of the revolutionaries. Attempts were also made at this time to extradite the Indians to British Indian custody. Subramania Bharaty, along with S.N.T. Acharya (owner of the India magazine) and the latter's cousin, were forced to flee to Europe. Although some French officials did indeed harbour sympathies for the Indian revolutionaries, the latter also faced some resistance among the local Francophile and Europeanised Indians who saw the \\"new immigrants\\" somewhat contemptuously. The refugee cause was, however, taken up by a number of sympathetic French lawyers. Acharya found assistance from this group to help fight against his expulsion from Pondicherry. England Faced with the threat of persecution, M.P.T. Acharya made up his mind to leave India. In 1907, he left for Britain. He visited his ailing father at Shiyali and, although an orthodox Brahmin, shaved off his long hair (Juttoo). At this time, Acharya was still unable to decide whether he wished to move to somewhere in Asia or to Europe, finally deciding to head for Colombo, a city he had visited earlier. His savings was a sum of three hundred Rupees, which allowed him money for travel but not any luggage. From Colombo, Acharya proceeded to Marseilles, for which he was able to acquire a third class ticket for eleven pounds, nearly half his savings. It is said that during the voyage to Marseilles, as an orthodox Brahmin he was unable to bring himself to eat non- Indian food ‚Äì he was forbidden from taking even coffee or bread by his orthodox beliefs ‚Äì and decided to observe a fast for the twenty-two days the voyage lasted. From Marseilles, short of money, Acharya proceeded to Paris where he hoped to find Indian expatriates who might have been able to help him both financially and with jobs. He had, while editing Anglo-Tamil newspaper and journals in India, been in touch with Indians living in France and in Paris. In Paris, he established contact with Professor Moniers Vinson and a few Indian expatriates. He was able to support himself with help from this circle for some time. In his reminiscences, Acharya mentions an unnamed Parisian Indian acquaintance who, having invited him home one afternoon and being told by a penniless Acharya that he would have to walk to his house, handed him the money for his train fare. =India House= While in Paris, urged by his friends, Acharya wrote to V.V.S. Iyer, an Indian barrister originally from Truchi who practiced in London. Iyer was actively involved with the India House, which was established in London in 1905 ostensibly to support Indian students and offer scholarships. India House was also a fertile ground for the exchange of nationalist opinions among students. It promoted nationalistic work and had the support of notable Indian nationalists such as Dadabhai Naoroji, Lala Lajpat Rai and Madame Bhikaji Cama. Iyer responded promptly, inviting Acharya to London. It was here in London that Acharya was introduced to the nationalism of India House. In London, the India House settled Acharya's short-term worries of food and shelter. With financial support from the organisation, Acharya was able to enroll to learn photoengraving at the trade school of the London County Council. However, India House, by this time, was considered \\"The most dangerous organisation outside India\\" and had attracted enough attention for its nationalist opinions to be discussed in the British Parliament. Prominent London newspapers including The Times demanded that Shyamji Krishna Varma, the founder of India House, be prosecuted for preaching \\"disloyal sentiments\\" to Indian students. By September 1907, The Indian Sociologist, published by the India House, was deemed \\"seditious literature\\" and was banned in India. It was at India House that Acharya was introduced to V.D. Savarkar. Acharya was quick to realise that the residents of India House were shadowed by detectives from Scotland Yard. A fear of repercussions due to an association with India House built an invisible barrier that prevented other Indian students from visiting or receiving residents of the house. This careerist and self-critical attitude of his fellow Indians, compared to the polite and helpful nature of Englishmen, is believed to have disappointed Acharya deeply. At one point, Acharya described Indian students treating the India House as a \\"Leper's Home\\". =With Savarkar= Through his prolonged stay in India House, however, Acharya gradually became deeply involved in its activities. Scotland Yard had at one point been able to infiltrate the organisation with an Indian student by the name of Kritikar, who had arrived at the organisation with a story similar to that of Acharya, and had for some time been able to report to Scotland Yard about its activities before he was uncovered and forced by Savarkar to confess at gunpoint. After this, Kirtikar's reports are believed to have been regularly screened by Savarkar before they were passed on to Scotland Yard. For some time, Acharya himself had been under suspicion of being a Scotland Yard mole before he was able to convince his fellow residents of his integrity and commitment to the nationalist cause. It is believed that Acharya was instructed by V.V.S. Iyer and V.D. Savarkar to set himself up as an informer to Scotland Yard, which they reasoned would allow them to carefully feed information to the police and also help them provide a corroboration to the version of reports that were being sent by Kritikar. For his reports, Acharya took five pounds (later doubled) which also eased from his fellow house-mates the financial strain of supporting him. V.D. Savarkar had by this time developed a reputation of an avid orator and a staunch nationalist. In London, Savarkar researched through the India Office library and archives. Even those who did not dare attend the Sunday night meetings at the India House were of the opinion that he was an erudite orator and a learned scholar. Acharya became deeply involved in the activities of the house, working with Savarkar and others in the house to produce nationalist pamphlets and publications including The Indian Sociologist, Bande Mataram and Talvar, which called for India's freedom and voiced what at the time were seen as \\"inflammatory and seditious\\" nationalist sentiments. The celebrations in Britain marking the 50th anniversary of the Indian uprising were met by India House with the publication of a nationalist history of the revolt, The Indian War of Independence, penned by Savarkar with records from India office archives. The project received support from Indian nationalists in Britain including the likes of Madame Cama, Iyer, as well as Indian students who had dare not show their support or sympathy for India House openly. Publishers in Britain refused to publish the book, which was ultimately published from the Netherlands. The book was rejected for publication from publishers. Acharya was, with a number of other residents of the India House, involved in raising funds, organising and in other ways helped with the project. Clandestinely, the residents also trained for organising revolutions in India. Acharya, along with Madan Lal Dhingra, V.V.S. Iyer and others, practiced shooting at a range in Tottenham Court Road and acquired considerable skills with the revolver. =End of India House= By 1909, India House was under strong surveillance from Scotland Yard. Savarkar's elder brother Ganesh Savarkar was arrested in India in June that year, and was subsequently tried and transported for life for publication of seditious literature. Savarkar's speeches grew increasingly virulent and called for revolution, widespread violence, and murder of all Englishmen in India. The culmination of these events was the assassination of William Hutt Curzon Wyllie, the political ADC to the Secretary of State for India, by Madanlal Dhingra on the evening of 1 July 1909 at a meeting of Indian students in the Imperial Institute in London. Dhingra was arrested and later tried and executed. In the aftermath of the assassination, the India House was rapidly liquidated. The investigations in the aftermath of the assassination were expanded to look for broader conspiracies originating from the India house, and Scotland Yard brought pressure on the inmates to leave England. While some of its leaders, like Krishna Varma, fled to Europe, others like Chattopadhyaya, moved to Germany and many others moved to Paris. It was suggested to Acharya at this time by one Syed Hyder Reza, probably on instructions from Scotland Yard, that Acharya move to the United States. However, Acharya remained in London for sometime, lodging at Bipin Pal's boarding house. He attended along with Savarkar, Iyer and other ex-residents of the house a meeting of Indians called by the Aga Khan to demonstrate their loyalty to the empire and offer condolences to the Wyllie family, where they opposed the unanimous acceptance of a resolution of condemnation against Dhingra. In a scuffle that ensued between Savarkar and a London barrister by the name of Palmer, Acharya is known to have come to Savarkar's aid, hitting Palmer with a stick and apparently not shooting Palmer with his revolver only under indications from Savarkar not to do so. Interviewed repeatedly in the investigations following the Wyillie murder, it became clear to Acharya that staying in Britain was not safe for him. Neither could he return to India, for he was sure to be picked up by Indian police. He did not wish to waste the experiences he had gained studying and training for revolution at the India House. He also wanted first-hand experiences of the battlefield. Indian revolutionaries in Europe at this time used to send recruits to work with Irish, Egyptian and Turkish groups for training and experience. Acharya's attention was turned towards the Spanish-Moroccan war, where he believed the Coloured Riff people fighting the White imperialist Spain would welcome him and allow exposure to guerrilla warfare. After consulting with V.V.S. Iyer, Acharya and another Indian revolutionary by the name of Sukhsagar Dutt were selected to be sent to train with the Riffs. Guns, uniforms and funds were obtained by the remnants of the India House, and the two were given a hearty farewell from Savarkar and Iyer. The Moroccan mission was, however, a dismal failure. Neither the Riffs nor the Spanish troops were willing to recruit the two Indians for suspicion of being spies from the opposing camp. Penniless and emaciated, Dutt and Acharya were left with no option but to leave the country. Writing to London, Acharya asked for help to be moved to a different country, and if possible, to India. The two were sent enough money to reach Portugal, where they were instructed to meet an Indian contact. Dutt returned to London, later joining the Paris Indian Society. Acharya, meanwhile, proceeded to Lisbon. He had wished to settle in Portugal, but the terms of residency offered by Portuguese Interior affairs minister instructed him to place himself under police supervision, not change residences without police permission and a number of other conditions which to Acharya meant he could not live as a free man. Broke and depressed, Acharya returned to London. The whole affair had cost nearly three hundred pounds. Europe A large number of Indian nationalists had (as explained above) moved to Europe in the aftermath of Curzon Wyllie's assassination. Among them were Shyamji Krishna Varma, Virendranath Chattopadhyaya, Har Dayal, Bhikhaji Cama. Madame Cama founded the Bande Mataram in Paris in September 1909. From Paris, Madame Cama arranged for Indian students to be supported in Russia, Germany, Japan and other countries where they could train in explosives, military tactics, arrange for arms shipments to India and also facilitate continental connections. After Savarkar's arrest in 1910 Acharya and V.V.S. Iyer took the prudent decision of leaving for Paris, where Acharya worked for Madame Cama's publication. He continued to maintain contacts with revolutionaries in India, including Subramanya Bharathi with whom he had worked in Pondicherry, and with M.S. Acharya. Significantly, at this time, in addition to his works in promoting and clandestine distribution of the Bande Mataram, Acharya, in a train of thought that arose among Indian revolutionaries at this time, began efforts to spread nationalist sentiments amongst the British Indian Army. The influx of seditious literature from Europe was quickly noted by the British Indian authorities. A report by the Director of Criminal intelligence bureau described the effects and sentiments that these literature were promoting amongst the \\"ignorant peasantry\\", urging the ban on such publications emanating in Europe from entering India. The result was the Indian Press Act, 1910 which restricted publication of sedtious material in India and the entry of such literature from outside. A number of newspaper proprietors, journalists and editors within India were imported or transported under the act. The publication found their way in nonetheless. Among Acharya's ploys was to send these literature from different countries and use different secret code numbers to prevent Indian postal authorities from deciphering or tracing them. =Socialism= It was also in Paris that Acharya's thoughts were first turned towards socialism. This was similar to the lines of thought that appeared in the Indian revolutionary circles in Europe, especially in France, at this time. He was introduced to the Socialist circle in Paris in 1910, and enjoyed the congenial atmosphere and the thoughts and ideas that he shared. It was also with the help of the Paris Socialist circle, notably Jean Longuet, that the Paris Indian Society- which included Acharya, Har Dayal, Madam Cama and other notable names- brought pressure on the French Government when Savarkar was rearrested at Marseilles after escaping from a ship that was deporting him to India. Acharya made the most of the available press freedom and the socialist platform to press for the re-extradition of his erstwhile leader to France and build French public opinion in support of such moves. Under public pressure at home, the French Government conceded to make such a request to Britain. The matter was ultimately settled in the Permanent Court of Arbitration at the Hague, which ruled in favour of Britain. Acharya became extensively involved in the socialist movement. The Paris Indian Society at this time grew to be one of the most powerful Indian organisations outside India at the time, and grew to initiate contacts with not only French Socialists, but also those in continental Europe. It sent delegates at this time to the International Socialist Congress in August 1910, where Shyamji Krishna Varma and V.V.S. Iyer succeeded in having a resolution passed demanding Savarkar's release and his extradition to France. It also succeeded in bringing to the attention of the organisation the state of affairs in India. In Paris, the Indian Society also held regular meetings and sought to train its members in skills necessary for revolution, which included training in firearms, learning military tactics, as well as organising the publication of revolutionary literature. It also sent recruits other countries and, after training, some were sent back to India to carry on propaganda work Acharya himself at this time learnt printing and engraving, and after sometime, was sent to Berlin along with V.V.S Iyer, where they were met by Champakaraman Pillai, who headed and Indian revolutionary group there. Observing Pillai's work, Acharya and Iyer suggested to the Paris Indian Society that their work by expanded beyond the work of the Paris publication. Accordingly, with funds from Madam Cama, Virendranath Chattopadhyaya was sent to Berlin to begin publication of the Talvar. The National fund scheme was initiated of which Madam Cama was the biggest contributor with (then) 5,000 Francs. The funds were strictly regulated to fund revolutionary activities in India, as well as fund Savarkar's trial. =First World War= In the meantime, work on Bande Mataram and other publications continued unabated. These were shipped by Acharya to India through contacts in Pondicherry, and at times under false covers including those of The Pickwick Papers. V.V.S. Iyer later returned to India, where he began training the Indian underground movement on explosives and bombs. On 17 June 1911, a young Indian revolutionary by the name of Vanchi Iyer fatally shot Robert D'escourt Ashe at Tirunelveli. Ashe had been a district collector who had earned notoriety for himself for his role in suppression of nationalist agitation and Swadeshi movement in 1908. Vanchi himself had learnt to shoot from Iyer in Pondicherry. The 1918 sedition committee report blamed Acharya for instigating, organising and planning the assassination. In 1911, Acharya arrived in Istanbul on the Paris Indian society's directions to seek Turkish help for Indian movement. Turkey and Persia had already been a centre for revolutionary activities by groups led by Sardar Ajit Singh and Sufi Amba Prasad who had worked there since 1909. The recruits to these groups included young nationalists of the likes of Rhishikesh Letha, Zia-ul-Haq, and Thakur Das. By 1910, the activities of these groups and their publication, the Hayat, had been noticed by British intelligence. Reports as early as 1910 indicated German efforts to unite Turkey and Persia and proceed to Afghanistan to threaten British India. However, Ajit Singh's departure in 1911 brought the Indian revolutionary activities to a grinding halt, while British representations to Persia successfully curbed whatever activity that remained in the country. In this situation, Acharya's mission was without much success. A similar effort by Barkatullah a year later also would suffer a similar fate. With the beginning of the war, the Indian efforts began in earnest to subverting the Sepoy of the British Indian Army and to fund and arm a revolution in India in a massive conspiracy that spanned the globe. The German intelligence agency for the East was formed at this time and actively sought to destabilize British possessions in India, Persia and the middle east. In this, they allied with the Indian revolutionaries and also sought Har Dayal's aid. At the time that the First World War broke out, Acharya had reached Berlin and was one of the founding members of the Berlin Committee that reorganised the liaison's and terms of German help for revolution in India, which had initially faltered on account of differences between Har Dayal and German Foreign office. Following Har Dayal's work United States promoting nationalist sentiments in Indian groups in North America before his deportation to Switzerland in 1913, as well as from the links of the committee members with other revolutionary groups around the globe, the Berlin committee had strong links with Indian revolutionary groups in India, Europe, Far-east as well as nationalist groups in the US and Canada, most notably the Ghadar Party. It sent members including Herambalal Gupta and Chandra Kanta Chakraverty to the United States to begin arrangements for arms shipment (which culminated in the Annie Larsen fiasco). Acharya himself sought to focus on organising recruits for the intended revolution. A prime target was Turkey, which had a substantial Indian presence, both Hajj pilgrims and as Indian residents. With the efforts of the Berlin Committee and the Paris Indian Society, Har Dayal reached Istanbul following another Indian revolutionary by the name of P.N. Dutta. In Istanbul, Har Dayal was joined by Pandurang Khankoje. However, Har Dayal's efforts were short-lived due to his apprehensions of Turkish Pan-Islamic ambitions and interference from the German Foreign office. In 1915, Acharya had reached Istanbul on the committee's initiative. Here, Har Dayal had begun work earlier but left due to apprehensions on the issues of conflict of Hindu and Muslim interests, Turkey's pan-Islamic ambitions and interference from the German foreign office. The Berlin committee reorganised and negotiated the terms of their liaison, and after assurances from the Germans, rededicated itself to the same task. Acharya's efforts were directed at forming the Indian National Volunteer Corps with the help of Indian civilians in Turkey, in addition to recruiting Indian Prisoners of War. He is known to have worked in Bushire amongst Indian troops with Wilhelm Wassmuss, while one story describes Acharya and a fellow revolutionary by the name of Birendranth Dasgupta as having swum across the Suez Canal at one point to contact troops of the British Indian Army. Communism Acharya later returned to Berlin and over the course of the war, was in Stockholm briefly along with Virendranath Chattopadhyaya. In Stockholm in May 1917, Acharya and Chattopadhyaya formed a Propaganda Bureau and later joined by Har Dayal. This bureau worked independently of the Berlin Committee and the German foreign office. The duo are known to have met with the Bolshevik ideologist Konstantin Troyonovsky at this time and explained the Indian situation, winning approval from the latter for the Indian cause. The Paris Indian society had been in touch with Russian communists before the Russian revolution. Nicholas Safransky, a Russian bomb expert, is known to have been involved in training the Indian revolutionaries in bomb manufacture and explosives. and Acharya was greatly impressed by the revolution itself, hailed at the time as a watershed in the struggle of colonial people against imperialism. The publication of a manifesto by the Soviet Union declaring support for colonies against imperialism was attractive to the Indian nationalists, who saw Soviet Russia as a future centre for coordinating activities, and also intended Russia to be a channel for Indian nationalists in any peace negotiations. This was also the time that the Swedish government under diplomatic pressure from Britain, gradually was leaning on the Indian propaganda bureau, while relationship of the Berlin committee with the German foreign office was also strained on apprehensions of German imperial designs and over allocation of funds. Chatto and Acharya arranged for Troionovsky to be provided with a large amount of the committee's literature to acquaint the Soviets with the Indian situation when the latter left Stockholm for Petrograd. However, Acharya was ultimately disappointed with the Socialist conference in Stockholm, which in his opinion entirely skirted the issue of the colonies. Towards the end of 1918, Acharya returned to Berlin along with Chatto. =Russia= At Berlin at the time was also Mahendra Pratap, who had in 1915 travelled to Kabul at the head of a Turco-German-Indian expedition through Persia with the aim to try and rally the Afghan Emir into the war on the Entente side. Although mostly unsuccessful in their aim, the Indian nationalists established in Kabul the Provisional Government of India, as the head of which Pratap attempted to garner support from Soviet Russia through Trotsky and Joffe. In 1918, Pratap was in Berlin, where he was reunited with Acharya and Chatto and the rest of the Berlin committee. In December 1918, Chatto, Acharya and Pratap left for Petrograd, where they worked with Russian Propaganda centre with Troionovsky. Other Indians at this centre at the time included Hussein Shahid Suhrawardy, Abdul Jabbar, Abdul Sattar, Dalip Singh Gill as well as a number of others. In 1918 Acharya moved to Kabul to join Mahendra Pratap's mission to the Emir to declare war against British India. Acharya was a member of Mahendra Pratap's delegation when they met Lenin in Moscow in May 1919. =Communist Party of India= The time of Acharya's meeting with Lenin in 1919 was also when the war in Europe was coming to an end. The Berlin committee was dissolved and a large number of the Indian revolutionaries were turning towards communism and the Soviet Union. Acharya was one of the key functionaries of the group that included Abdur Rab, Virendranath, Agnes Smedley, C.R. Pillai, Bhupendranath Dutta, Shafiq Ahmad, Amin Faruqui, Nalini Gupta, M.N. Roy. These members were the amongst the first active members and founding fathers of the Indian communism. Abdul Rab and Acharya worked avidly in Soviet Turkestan, founding the Indian revolutionary association. Acharya was constantly on the move between Kabul and Tashkent, and attended the second congress of the Communist International. In October 1920 in Tashkent, Acharya was one of the founding members and a member of the executive of the Communist Party of India (Tashkent group) However, Acharya differed from M.N. Roy, and differences emerged between the two from quite early on. In 1921 a split in the CPI emerged, between factions siding with M.N. Roy, and those who favoured the approaches of Chatto. Acharya was in the latter group. This was the beginning of the end of Acharya's associations with the international Communist movement. In 1922 Acharya returned to Berlin, working with the Indian independence committee and subsequently with the League against Imperialism. He remained deeply critical of the Communist International, and some have described his political views at the time as anarcho-syndicalist. He remained in Berlin till the early days of Hitler's rise to power, and leaders of the Indian movement who visited Europe at various times, Including Nehru and Subhas Bose, are believed to have met with him. By the early 1920s, Acharya had begun exploring Anarchism. He took an active role in promoting Anarchist works in and was contributed at this time to the Russian Anarchist publication Rabotchi Put. In 1931, he lived in Amsterdam working with the school of Anarcho-syndicalism. Acharya came to be acquainted in early 1930s acquainted with Marxist-leaning Indian industrialist from Bombay, Ranchoddas Bhavan Lotvala. Lotvala had financed The Socialist, one of the first Marxist periodicals in India. Lotvala also financed the translation and publication of many leftist literature including the Communist manifesto. Return to India The British-Indian ban on Acharya was lifted in 1935 and he returned to Bombay that same year, where he managed a living as a journalist. During this time, Acharya wrote eight articles which would later be collated to be published as a book called Reminiscences of an Indian revolutionary. From Bombay, Acharya established correspondence with Japanese anarchist Taiji Yamaga and Chinese anarchist Lu Jinbao. The result of the correspondences led to the three establishing contacts with Commission de Relations de l‚ÄôInternationale Anarchiste (Liaison Commission of the Anarchist International). In the following years, Acharya contributed to anarchist publications such as Freedom in London, Tierra y Libertad in Mexico and an anarchist publication called Contre Courant in Paris. He also remained in correspondence with Albert Meltzer for more than fifteen years. In the following years Acharya was appointed secretary of the Indian Institute of Sociology, established under Lotvala's patronage in the 1930s. In later years, Acharya's influence on the institute saw it adopt a number of statutes in 1947 and subsequently the institute adopted the name of Libertarian Socialist Institute. His views on economic matters were profound and in 1951, Free Society Group of Chicago published his work How Long Can Capitalism Survive? in 1951. Acharya also contributed essays and critiques on capitalism, colonialism, communism as well as nationalism to the journal Harijan, commissioned by its editor K.G. Mashruwala, and later M.P. Desai. His contributions to Harijan, accumulating to nearly thirty essays, were his primary source of income before his death in March 1954. Personal life Acharya's first marriage was an arranged one early in his life in India, before going into exile in Europe. During his time in Bolshevik Russia between 1919‚Äì1921, Acharya met Magda Nachman, a German-born artist of Jewish descent. The two married in 1921. Returning to Germany after his sorjourn with Communism, Acharya and his wife witnessed Hitler's rise to power, the couple found themselves in a tenuous position in Nazi Germany. Returning to India in 1935, the couple lived in Bombay were Magda found work as an artist. Acharya's last days were marked by abject poverty, and unlike Savarkar, the Indian government completely ignored Acharya's role in the independence of India. Magda died in 1951. Acharya had arranged for an exhibition of her works in London through Albert Meltzer, but he too died before her paintings could be shipped.Libcom Political thoughts Acharya's early works were marked by nationalism against British-rule in India, and he worked with Indian nationalists during the first world war to produce anti-British propaganda. However, working with German and Turkish war-efforts proved disappointing for the erstwhile nationalist groups and Acharya, like many of his contemporary Indian revolutionaries of the time, turned towards Socialism for help with the Indian cause. =Communism= Acharya is known to have identified himself as a Communist in 1921 and helped found the Communist Party of India (Tashkent group), but differences with M.N. Roy led to divisions which ultimately saw him leave the party. Bolshevik support for Roy further deepened differences between Acharya on the one hand and Communist International and the soviet Regime on the other, leading to Acharya to remark Acharya may later have been in touch with Trotsky's Fourth International, and is known to have urged the Komintern to set up a commission composed of both Communist and nationalist elements. However, he increasingly came to see Communism as no different to Capitalism.https://olebirklaursen.wordpress.com/2017/08/15/m-p-t-acharya- international-anarchism-and-indian-independence/ After his divisions with the communist project, Acharya's works delved into critiques of state capitalism as well as communism. His work often denounced Bolshevism, warning of the dangers of the movement in India. His work further attacked the Comintern as well as Indian communists such as MN Roy, Saklatvala, Sapurji and others. =Anarchism and Pacifism= The divisions with communism saw Acharya move away to later identify himself as an anarcho-syndicalist. He is known to have been in touch with French anarchists, along with Chatto, in the early 1920s, and insisted including anarcho-syndicalists at the Congresses of the Communist International. In 1923, he began including Anarchist works in the mails sent to those in India who were in the cominterns mailing list. He was contributing at this time to the Russian Anarchist publication Rabochii Put, and the Indian activist Indulal Yagnik notes having met Acharya in Amsterdam in 1931 working with the school of Anarchist-Syndicalism. His writings focused on developing Anarchism within India, and his work delved into analysing anarchism from Indian point of view. Acharya's thoughts, published in his essays, also reflected on the Indian independence movement, focusing on Gandhi and the Indian National Congress. Contrasted to the revolutionary nationalism of his days in London, his political and personal thoughts through this time led to him being considered a \\"Anarchist pacifist\\", and he considered himself a \\"logical pacifist\\". Acharya criticised the methods of Gandhi, despite holding a lot of respect for. Acharya found it difficult to reconcile Gandhi's opposition to mass violence, when contrasted to Gandhi's lack of criticism of violence perpetrated by those in government or positions of authority. Gandhi's political tactics, embodied in civil disobedience movements like the Dandi march, was seen by Acharya as embodiment of anarchist tactics, though Acharya refused to consider himself a follower of Gandhi. Academic and historian Ole Birk Lausen consider Acharya's work and published thoughts through this time to reflect not only on Indian independence, but also on improving the life of common people in India. His writings in post- independence India criticized senior politicians in Nehru government for occupying the role of recently departed colonial authorities, and argued for a strong anarchist movement as a force to balance the social and political structure of India against what he described as the \\"country going to the Fascists and the dogs\\". In post-independence India, Acharya supported a society of free socialist labor, and criticized Nehru and his government for allowing foreign capitalist investment.

He is primarily remembered for his work on the daily comic strips Sparky, Angel, Mixed Singles/Boomer and Redeye, plus numerous magazine cartoons.http://www.westportnow.com/index.php?/v2/comments/20384/ Born in Boston, Massachusetts, Casson was encouraged by his father to pursue a career in art. He received a scholarship to the Art Students League of New York. Casson signed a cartooning contract with The Saturday Evening Post at age 17, and his artwork began to appear regularly in The Saturday Evening Post, Esquire, The New York Times, Ladies' Home Journal and other major magazines. WWII He enlisted in the infantry for World War II service and made the Normandy Landing on D-Day. His commander was killed instantly upon reaching Omaha Beach, leaving Casson to lead the attack. He successfully led his men through the assault without further casualties and went on to participate in other battles, earning the rank of captain and decorated with five battle stars: two Bronze Stars, the Croix de guerre and two Purple Hearts. Comic strips After World War II, he returned to cartooning, drawing the comic strip Jeff Crockett from 1948 to 1952 for the New York Herald Tribune Syndicate. He was recalled to active military duty in 1952 for service in the Korean War. After a 1953 honorable discharge, he was back at the drawing board for the Publisher/Chicago Sun-Times Syndicate (1953‚Äì66) with the children‚Äôs strips Sparky and Angel. He co-created It‚Äôs Me, Dilly with Alfred James (pseudonym for Alfred Andriola of Kerry Drake) and worked on the strip from 1958 to 1962. In the 1970s, Casson collaborated with William F. Brown on the comic strip Mixed Singles, later renamed Boomer. It was marketed by United Feature Syndicate until 1981. In 1988, when cartoonist Gordon Bess found himself unable to continue his internationally known Redeye daily comic for King Features Syndicate, he handed it over to a collaboration of Casson as illustrator and Bill Yates as writer. When Yates himself became ill in 1999, Casson took over both writing and art for the strip, a role he continued until his death in 2008. Casson was married to Mary Lee Culver Casson, an opera singer and actress, from 1965 to his death. He had one daughter, Culver. He lived in Westport, Connecticut nearly all of his married life. Books Casson had five cartoon books published, including the anthology Ever Since Adam and Eve for McGraw-Hill, the Whole Kids Catalogue and the Guinness Record Keeper. He did occasional television work, notably writing and producing the shows Draw Me a Laugh and You Be the Judge. Exhibitions Casson‚Äôs work was twice exhibited at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. His drawings are in the collection of the Evansville, Indiana, Fine Arts Museum and the Albert T. Reid collection (University of Kansas). His personal papers and original drawings are in the collection of the Billy Ireland Cartoon Library & Museum. Awards Casson served on the Board of Governors of the Newspaper Comics Council, where he was chairman of the 1964-65 World‚Äôs Fair Committee. He was also on the board of the National Cartoonists Society, whose Connecticut chapter honored him with its Legend Award in November 2003.

It is native to Russia and China. There are several popular cultivars in several colours which are grown as ornamental plants, including 'Blue Butterfly', 'Summer Morning', 'Blue Mirror', and 'Summer Stars'. Like many other larkspurs, this plant is poisonous. It is much shorter and more compact than the more familiar tall D. elatum, with dispersed flowers, rather than single spikes. It is a short-lived perennial that is suggested to be treated like an annual in many cases due to its unpredictability in terms of returning the next season. It readily provides seed pods for reseeding, although allowing it to go to seed hastens the end of its flowering. This species is commonly considered to have the most intense blue flowers of all species in its genus, although that depends on the particular variety, the particular plant, the freshness of the blossom, and the growing conditions. In sunlight the flowers can appear to glow or look fluorescent due to the intensity of the blue pigment. Plants are available with the following colors: deep blue, medium blue, pale blue, white, and light pale pink. There are no lavender varieties, unlike with rocket larkspur (D. ajacis or consolida) and elatum plants. Unlike those two species, this one is typically purchased by gardeners from nurseries rather than grown from seed, unless the gardener already has plants and collects seed or lets the plant reseed. Rocket larkspur seed is much less expensive and spike-type delphinium seed is more widespread for purchase. Nursery-grown grandiflorum plants are readily available in the United States and can be found at stores such as Walmart and Lowe's. Dwarf and normal height varieties are available but even the normal height plants are short when compared to the cultivated spike-type delphiniums.

It launched in 2005, took in $81 million in investment, and in 2013 was sold to Renewable Energy Group for $40 million in cash and stock, and an additional $21.5 million if technology and production milestones were met.  Process  Life Sustain 9-Billion uses a one step consolidated method to engineer biofuels, using microbial metabolism. Their technology allows the selection of carbon chain length, branching, saturation, and chemical functionality of each product. LS9 microbial catalysts carryout all chemical conversions in a single step fermentation and produce an immiscible product that is naturally secreted from the cell. Centrifugation or simple settling recovers the final product from the fermentation medium. No distillation is required, making the process very cost and energy efficient. This process is what distinguishes them from competitors. Their platform is to be able to design a microbial catalyst to produce a purified desired compound in a single step conversion, then using the same equipment to make a different product with a different catalyst.  Feedstocks  LS9 utilizes sugar cane, corn syrup, sweet sorghum syrup, molasses, glycerin and biomass hydrolysate as potential feedstocks for their fuel production. They obtain these feedstocks through numerous partnerships in various countries including the US, Brazil, Australia, and India. Their catalysts enable them to assimilate both pentose and hexose sugars. The ability to leverage multiple feedstocks provides strategic advantages including the option to change feedstock based on economics and availability, the option to scale in diverse geographies local raw materials, and an ability to avoid competition with food.  Products  LS9 has a wide array of products that all stem from their specialty ester product family, which pairs a fatty acid (C8-C18) with a series of alcohols (C1-C14). These currently are added to the fermentation vessel, but ultimately will be made in situ. The modifications to their bacteria fermenters will allow the alteration of chain length, branch points and saturation/unsaturation. Their products currently include LS Diesel (Made from fatty acid methyl or ethyl esters (FAME/FAEE) or alkanes), LS Kerosene (made from low chain length FAME) and LS jet fuel. In the future they plan on engineering long chain molecules for personal care markets, as well as amines/amides for agricultural chemicals and adhesives. Overall, their goal is to create a family of fuel products targeted at the very large diesel market. One particular product towards this endeavour is their UltraClean Diesel LS9 Biofuels: Products Retrieved March 14, 2013  LS9 UltraClean Diesel  One of LS9‚Äôs premier products is its UltraClean diesel. This diesel product offers numerous benefits in comparison to both regular diesel fuel, as well as traditional biodiesel. LS9 diesel is above the competition in many varying facets including cetane number, sulphur content, aromatic compound content, cloud point and oxidative stability. In 2010, LS9 UltraClean Diesel was awarded status as an officially registered fuel by the United States Environment Protection Agency (EPA). This fuel contributes to a reduction in carbon footprint by 85% in comparison to other fuels. As a registered fuel, LS9's UltraClean Diesel can be sold commercially in the United States.LS9 Biofuels: EPA Registered Fuel Retrieved Mar 2, 201} = Cetane Number (CN) = A fuel‚Äôs cetane number is measurement of the combustion quality of diesel fuel during compression ignition. Fuels with higher cetane number have shorter ignition delays, providing more time for the fuel combustion process to be completed. Generally, diesel engines operate well with a CN from 40 to 55, whereas LS9 UltraClean has a CN of 70. In North America, most states adopt ASTM D975 as their diesel fuel standard and the minimum cetane number is set at 40, with typical values in the 42-45 range. In Europe, with a minimum cetane index of 46 and a minimum cetane number of 51. Premium diesel fuel can have a cetane number as high as 60 = Sulfur = Sulfur is a major contributor to the greenhouse gas sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), a potent greenhouse gas that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, has evaluated, with a global warming potential of 22,800 times that of carbon dioxide when compared over a 100-year periodDirect Global Warming Potentials\\". Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. 2007. Retrieved 22 February 2013. Sulfur hexafluoride is also extremely long-lived due to being inert in the troposphere and stratosphere, and has an estimated atmospheric lifetime of 800‚Äì3200 years. Due to these facts, it is very beneficial to contain low sulfur levels in fuel. LS9 diesel contains just over half (8 vs 15) of the sulfur = Aromatic Compounds = Aromatic compounds in fuel contribute to soot production. Therefore, they have been under investigation and restrictions. The California Air Resources Board (CARB) and the EU will have limits at 10%The California Diesel Fuel Regulations, in Title 13, California Code of Regulations. 2003. and 14%EU, Quality of petrol and diesel fuels. 2003, European Union: Brussels respectively, while the U.S. federal specifications limit aromatics to 35%Control of Air Pollution From New Motor Vehicles: Heavy-Duty Engine and Vehicle Standards and Highway Diesel Fuel Sulfur Control Requirements: Final Rule, in 40 CFR Parts 69, 80, and 86. 2001. Soot production plays a major role in smog and environmental concerns, causing for these restrictions to be put in place. LS9 UltraClean diesel has been shown to have no aromatic compounds, whereas fossil fuel diesel contains approximately 10% by volume aromatics. = Cloud Point = The cloud point of a fuel is the temperature at which solids dissolved within form precipitates, giving the fuel a cloudy appearance. When a fuel is below its cloud point waxes or biowaxes form within the fuel, clogging fuel filters and injectors. The lower the cloud point, the colder temperatures the fuel can be exposed to without fear of waxy build up. Of the biodiesel alternatives pictured, LS9 biodiesel offers the lowest cloud point, increasing its uses within cold climates. = Oxidative Stability = One of the major technical issue facing biodiesel is its susceptibility to oxidation upon exposure to oxygen in ambient air. This becomes a major issue when stored for extended periods of time. This susceptibility is due to its content of unsaturated fatty acid chains. Besides the presence of air, various other factors influence the oxidation process of biodiesel including presence of light, elevated temperature. Where most commercial biofuels only are stable for 3‚Äì5 hours, LS9 biodiesel is stable for greater than 6 hours when exposed to oxygen. = LS9 Inc. Patents = To date, LS9 has published 29 patents related to the biofuel industry. These patents range from processes detailing the generation of aldehydes, carbodylic acids, esters, alkenes, alkynes, and fatty acid derivatives. It is critical to note that many of the patents published are built upon previous patents and shows a continued commitment by LS9 in the biofuel industry. Of particular importance to LS9‚Äôs potential for success may lie in its diversity in patent publications. This concept is illustrated below through the systematic review of LS9‚Äôs most pivotal patent as they relate to the main components of biofuel generation. In line with LS9's main initiatives of using synthetic microorganisms for the production of biofuel components, LS9 has been, for a period of years (2008‚Äì2013) been pushing patents for specific enzymes involved in fatty acid synthesis and metabolism. This is of particular importance since enzymes are key regulators in metabolic pathways and the opportunity to successfully patent such an enzyme may prove of extreme value to a company vested in economic interests being generated in that area of research.  PPTase  One particular component, which LS9 has been successful in patenting is a key regulator in the initiation of fatty acid biosynthesis known as phosphopantetheinyl transferase (PPTase). This enzyme is responsible for transferring 4\`-phosphopantetheine (4\`-PP) from coenzyme A to a conserved serine residue on acyl carrier protein (ACP), which is responsible for shuttling around 4\`-PP. This pathway is essential for the functioning of the Fatty Acid Synthase (FAS) enzyme and allows LS9 a certain degree of monopoly in fatty acid generation from microorganisms since it has patented such an integral component. = Legal Implications = Another intriguing aspect of this patent is that for LS9 to employ it, they cannot continue using FAS proteins which have been patented by other companies. Therefore, LS9 must be careful in how they implement this patent. Thus far, no conflict-of- interest claims have been filed against this patent. = Overview of Patent Specifications = The initial patent application contained 43 components which LS9 endeavoured to have covered under this patent. Of these 43 components, 5 are protected under this patent. These include the use of a protein with 80% homology to PPTase for the purposes of generation of fatty acids or aldehydes, culturing a cell expressing such a PPTase under conditions permissive for production of fatty acids or aldehydes, overexpressing PPTase in growth medium selective for fatty acid production, and also delineates a means of overcoming iron-induced inhibition of PPTase. These specifications address pretreatment conditions detailing decreasing iron-inhibition present in the microbes used for this research (See Above). = Submission = Submitted in 2011, this patent was published under the USPA, under application number 20130035513 on February 7, 2013 under the title of Methods and Compositions for Enhanced Production of Fatty Aldehydes and Fatty Alcohols.  Gene Cassette and Culture Medium for Commercial Purposes  This patent builds upon several other patents filed by LS9 and forms a gene cassette plasmid which has the potential to be taken up by target microorganism and used to generate fatty acids. One of the main components of this patent is that the target microorganism will use the fermentation of carbohydrates for a direct route for the production of fatty esters without producing undesired side- products like glycerin characteristic of conventional fatty ester production. To achieve this, the pathway and enzymes have been engineered from pCLTFW.atfA1, pLoxPcat2, pCLTFWcat. placZ R6K1, and POpAm. These were not the intellectual property of the LS9 before this point. However, after acceptance of this patent, the combination of these plasmids, the final product has achieved a distinction significant enough to warrant the allowance of a patent to this process. = Legal Implications = There does not exist any legal implications implicit in the application. The assortment of genes encoded on the cassette appear to be a unique cluster engineered from several organisms. At this time, there exists no conflict-of-interest claims filed against this patent. = Submission = Submitted on April 11, 2010, this patent was published under the USPA, under application number 20100257777 on October 14, 2010 under the title of Production of Commercial Biodiesel from Genetically Modified Organisms. = Investment = LS9 has been a company very sought after by investors, both at the corporate and governmental level. Numerous firms have invested into their company, realizing the potential of their one- step process. BlackRock, an investment firm, donated 30 million dollars, much of which was used as capital start-up. In 2011, they were recognized by the US Department of Energy and given 9 million dollars in order for them to improve their integrated process to convert biomass feedstocks into fermentable sugars and then into diesel and other fuel and chemical products. In 2012, with the opening of the Florida product testing plant, LS9 was given 4.5 million dollars from the Florida Opportunity fund. This fund invests millions of dollars each year into clean, renewable energy in the state of Florida.LS9 Newlines: 2011-2013. http://www.ls9.com/newsroom/press-releases/2013. Retrieved March 14, 2013 = Economic Feasibility = There exist many biofuel companies which face the harsh challenge of reducing capital investment while trying to increase energy yield generated from their products. To overcome this challenge, LS9 uses microbial fatty acid metabolism pathways in many of its reaction chambers to increase hydrocarbon yields. The rationale behind LS9's commitment to the use of microbial species lies in their resilient nature to have undergone many selective pressures thus having the potential to be used in conditions necessary for biofuel generation. It is these attributes of microbes and leading technologies in genome sequencing and synthetic biology which LS9 has harnessed to yield biofuels which do not suffer from many of the economical pressures that conventional reaction chamber biofuel generation methods suffer from. These are discussed below.  Separation of Compounds  In many current biofuel generation endeavours, the processes of differentiating and separating desired components from undesired ones leads to losses in both net energy yield and capital loss. Due to this, LS9 has developed a process where in their reaction chambers, shown above, utilize the natural properties of their desired components. Using both solvent composition and the realization that most desired components in biofuel generation possess a certain degree of hydrophobicity, LS9 has engineered their microbes to carry out their reactions in the aqueous-like phase, which is of lower hydrophobic character, and their desired components are secreted and float to the top forming a hydrophobic phase. This phase is easily accessible to collection apparatuses and requires little energy to collect.  Lack of Heat Generation  Due to the isolated nature of the microbial metabolism in cell culture, wherein the biofuel components are produced there is no need to increase temperatures to make reactions run at appreciable rates. Rather substrate availability and growth conditions govern the reaction rate of the desired component. This is of critical importance when this principle is juxtaposed with the energy-intensive processes of most biofuel companies.

Consumption refers not only to individuals and households, but also to governments, business, and other institutions. Sustainable consumption is closely related to sustainable production and sustainable lifestyles. \\"A sustainable lifestyle minimizes ecological impacts while enabling a flourishing life for individuals, households, communities, and beyond. It is the product of individual and collective decisions about aspirations and about satisfying needs and adopting practices, which are in turn conditioned, facilitated, and constrained by societal norms, political institutions, public policies, infrastructures, markets, and culture.\\" Vergragt, P.J. et al (2016) Fostering and Communicating Sustainable Lifestyles: Principles and Emerging Practices, UNEP‚Äì Sustainable Lifestyles, Cities and Industry Branch, http://www.oneearthweb.org/communicating-sustainable-lifestyles-report.html , page 6. The United Nations includes analyses of efficiency, infrastructure, and waste, as well as access to basic services, green and decent jobs and a better quality of life for all within the concept of sustainable consumption. It shares a number of common features with and is closely linked to the terms sustainable production and sustainable development. Sustainable consumption, as part of sustainable development, is a prerequisite in the worldwide struggle against sustainability challenges such as climate change, resource depletion, famines or environmental pollution. Sustainable development as well as sustainable consumption rely on certain premises such as: * Effective use of resources, and minimisation of waste and pollution * Use of renewable resources within their capacity for renewal * Fuller product life-cycles * Intergenerational and intragenerational equity Goal 12 of the Sustainable Development Goals seeks to \\"ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns\\". The Oslo definition The definition proposed by the Oslo Symposium on Sustainable Consumption in 1994 refers to sustainable consumption as \\"the use of services and related products which respond to basic needs and bring a better quality of life while minimizing the use of natural resources and toxic materials as well as emissions of waste and pollutants over the life cycle of the service or product so as not to jeopardize the needs of future generations.\\"Source: Norwegian Ministry of the Environment (1994) Oslo Roundtable on Sustainable Production and Consumption.  Strong and weak sustainable consumption  Some writers make a distinction between \\"strong\\" and \\"weak\\" sustainability.Ross, A., Modern Interpretations of Sustainable Development, Journal of Law and Society , Mar., 2009, Vol. 36, No. 1, Economic Globalization and Ecological Localization: Socio-legal Perspectives (Mar., 2009), pp. 32-54 In order to achieve sustainable consumption, two developments have to take place: it requires both an increase in the efficiency of consumption as well as a change in consumption patterns and reductions in consumption levels in industrialized countries as well as rich social classes in developing countries which have also a large ecological footprint and give examples for increasing middle classes in developing countries. The first prerequisite is not sufficient on its own and can be named weak sustainable consumption. Here, technological improvements and eco-efficiency support a necessary reduction in resource consumption. Once this aim has been met, the second prerequisite, the change in patterns and reduction of levels of consumption is indispensable. Strong sustainable consumption approaches also pay attention to the social dimension of well-being and assess the need for changes based on a risk-averse perspective. In order to achieve what can be termed strong sustainable consumption, changes in infrastructures as well as the choices customers have are required. In the political arena, weak sustainable consumption has been discussed whereas strong sustainable consumption is missing from all debates. The so-called attitude-behaviour or values-action gap describes a significant obstacle to changes in individual customer behavior. Many consumers are well aware of the importance of their consumption choices and care about environmental issues, however, most of them do not translate their concerns into their consumption patterns as the purchase-decision making process is highly complicated and relies on e.g. social, political and psychological factors. Young et al. identified a lack of time for research, high prices, a lack of information and the cognitive effort needed as the main barriers when it comes to green consumption choices.

These cells line the gastric mucosa (mucous neck cells are found in the necks of the gastric pits). The mucus-secreting cells of the stomach can be distinguished histologically from the intestinal goblet cells, another type of mucus-secreting cell. Structure The gastric mucosa that lines the inner wall of the stomach has a set of microscopic features called gastric glands which, depending on the location within the stomach, secrete different substances into the lumen of the organ. The openings of these glands into the stomach are called gastric pits which foveolar cells line in order to provide a protective alkaline secretion against the corrosive gastric acid. =Microanatomy= Foveolar cells in the antrum of stomach. A skewed cross- section of the columns gives a false impression of being stratified epithelium. Foveolar cells line the surface of the stomach, the gastric pits, and the top part of gastric glands: the neck. They constitute a simple columnar epithelium, as they form a single layer of cells and are taller than their width. Depending on their location, foveolar cells can be divided in two groups: surface mucous cells, which line the surface and the gastric pits; and mucous neck cells, which are a part of the neck of gastric glands along parietal cells. Surface mucous cells have large quantities of mucin granules in their apical (top) surface and project short microvilli into the lumen of the stomach. Mucins are large glycoproteins that give the mucus its gel-like properties. As mucins are lost during routine histology preparation, they stain pale, but if preserved correctly the cells stain strongly with special techniques like PAS or toluidine blue, the last representing the anionic nature of foveolar cell secretions. Below the mucin granules, surface mucous cells have a Golgi apparatus, the nucleus, and small amounts of rough endoplasmic reticulum. Mucous neck cells are located within gastric glands, interspersed between parietal cells. These are shorter than their surface counterpart and contain lesser quantities of mucin granules in their apical surface. Function Diagram showing bicarbonate secretion to the stomach lumen The mucus produced by these cells is extremely important, as it prevents the stomach from digesting itself. Parietal cells produce potent hydrochloric acid, which damages cells. Gastric chief cells produce pepsinogen, which is activated by the acid to form pepsin. Pepsin is a protease that can digest and damage stomach cells. To prevent these disastrous effects, mucus and bicarbonate ions (HCO3‚àí) are secreted by the foveolar cells. The mucus allows the acid at pH above 4 to penetrate lining, but below pH 4 (i.e. when acid is more concentrated) the acid cannot penetrate the mucus. This is called viscous fingering. Thus the foveolar cells can pump out a lot of acid, but acid once in the lumen of the stomach is prevented from returning.

He is best known for his management of the PBHG Growth Fund, one of the most popular growth-style mutual funds of the mid- to late-1990s. Investing Style Pilgrim is considered an innovator in growth stock investing. Early in his career, he developed an aggressive style which utilized an unusually systematic method of identifying small, rapidly growing companies with the potential to beat quarterly earnings expectations, which would result in sharp upward movement of their stock price. He also exhibited little concern over high P/E ratios, and very little tolerance for companies that missed earnings estimates, resulting in relatively high portfolio turnover. This style, sometimes referred to as \\"earnings momentum\\", is characterized by high volatility, with a tendency toward dramatic gains or losses. Pilgrim, Baxter & Associates Pilgrim started work as a loan officer at Philadelphia National Bank in 1967. He soon moved to the trust department, and over the next decade rose to the position of Senior Vice President. It was at PNB that he met Harold Baxter, Stephen Hoyt, and George Greig, with whom he left in 1982 to establish Pilgrim, Baxter, Hoyt & Greig. (With the departures of Hoyt and later Greig, the company was renamed Pilgrim Baxter & Associates.) PBH&G; was initially dedicated entirely to managing money for institutional pension funds, and as a result was virtually unknown to the general public. In 1985, they entered the mutual fund market with the PBHG Growth Fund. For its first eight years, the fund went largely undiscovered due to the fact that it was a load fund and was not marketed to the public. Its performance was impressive, however. The fund returned 46.6% in 1993, and rose 225% over the three years ending November 1993.John Waggoner. \\"Bottom-fishing for mutual funds\\", USA Today, January 6, 2000. This performance came to light in late 1993 when the fund went no-load and received a torrent of media attention, beginning with the August edition of Money Magazine which declared that \\"few people other than his clients recognize the name of today's hottest fund manager: Gary Pilgrim.\\"Junius Ellis. \\"THIS LITTLE-KNOWN HOTSHOT'S PICKS COULD GET YOU 45%\\", Money, August 1, 1993. At a time when public awareness of mutual funds was rapidly increasing, Pilgrim quickly became one of the industry's most famous names. The fund continued to deliver very strong performance over the next three years - in the beginning of 1996, it had a three year annualized return of nearly 30%. At the end of June 1996, it was the #1 performer among all equity funds over the previous 10 years, according to Lipper Analytical Services.Werner Renberg. \\"If Your Funds Are Underperforming, Investigate\\", Sun Sentinel, March 17, 1997. Meanwhile, the fund's assets under management had increased from about US$8 million in 1993 to US$5 billion in mid-1996. During Pilgrim's peak popularity in 1996, Sheldon Jacobs, the editor in chief of The No-Load Fund Investor, stated \\"I have never seen a group that has done so consistently well.\\"Reed Abelson. \\"MUTUAL FUNDS\\", The New York Times, June 23, 1996. The October 1996 Kiplinger's Personal Finance Magazine gave him the following review: \\"Forget Peter Lynch: Gary Pilgrim is the best stock picker of the past five years and the past ten.\\"Fred W. Frailey. \\"Gary Pilgrim: insider interview\\", Kiplinger's Personal Finance Magazine, October 1, 1996. Unfortunately for many investors who, in response to massive media attention, bought into the fund at this time, late-1996 to early-1999 was a difficult period for PBHG Growth as market trends turned against small growth stocks, even as the economy at large flourished. During this 10-quarter period, the fund struggled to break even, while the S&P; 500 returned 95%.Manuel Schiffres. \\"Big Mo Is Back\\", Kiplinger's Personal Finance Magazine, April 2000. As the internet technology boom took off, however, PBHG Growth's performance skyrocketed, returning 93% in 1999. But with the economic downturn which began in early 2000, the fund, true to its volatile nature, began to fall precipitously, losing 34% in 2001 and 30% in 2002. Gary Pilgrim appeared in the 1998 and 2004 editions of Jason Kelly's book The Neatest Little Guide to Stock Market Investing as a \\"master\\" investor whose strategy should be studied, though probably not strictly emulated, by individuals seeking success in stock market investing. Quotes \\"Anyone who sticks with a particular investment approach will be frustrated by the market occasionally. Our history suggests that we're usually in the top quartile or bottom quartile of returns and don't spend much time in the middle.\\" \\"I'm very confident that as long as I can put together a portfolio of companies growing 40% a year, these stocks can be leaders. In my mind, this is the natural state of affairs.\\" \\"As growth managers go, we're among the most aggressive because we always look for companies in the early to middle stages of maturity.\\"Nanette Burns. \\"FOUR GURUS AND A LOFTY MARKET\\", Business Week, December 25, 1995. \\"I focus on companies that are doing well, not ones that have stumbled, or missed by just a little bit. I like to be in a good mood, and every stinker I don't get rid of just irritates me. I like to like my portfolio.\\"\\"When to sell stocks depends on who you ask\\", USA Today, October 20, 2000. Market Timing On November 20, 2003, both the Securities and Exchange Commission and New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer filed charges against Gary L. Pilgrim, Harold J. Baxter, and PBA for civil securities fraud and breach of fiduciary duties.Leticia Williams; Jonathan Burton. \\"Pilgrim Baxter charged with fraud\\", MarketWatch, November 20, 2003.LITIGATION RELEASE NO.18474 . U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (November 20, 2003). Pilgrim was accused of allowing one of his friends, Michael Christiani, the manager of a hedge fund called Appalachian Trails L.P., to use a market timing strategy which rapidly traded shares of, among other funds, the PBHG Growth Fund. Though market timing is a legal and legitimate practice still in widespread use, it had begun to be considered potentially deleterious to buy- and-hold investors. In fact, at the time charges were brought in 2003, PBA had already expelled all market timers from its funds and had allowed no such activity since December 2001. There were no accusations or evidence of the illegal late trading which factored in other cases of the 2003 mutual fund scandal. On November 17, 2004, the S.E.C. announced a settlement which forbade Pilgrim and Baxter from publicly denying wrongdoing, and required each to personally pay US$80 million while PBA would pay US$90 million, for a total of US$250 million. In addition, both Pilgrim and Baxter were permanently forbidden from employment in an investment-advisory capacity. Despite attempts to recover, the PBHG Funds brand was too badly damaged by the incident to remain viable. In 2004, PBA was renamed Liberty Ridge Capital by parent company Old Mutual. The PBHG Funds were absorbed into the Old Mutual Funds group, and Liberty Ridge Capital ceased operating in 2009. Philanthropy In 1998, Gary Pilgrim established the Pilgrim Foundation, with the purpose of benefiting vulnerable women and children in Chester County, Pennsylvania. The foundation has since expanded its mission to support non-profit work nationally and internationally.

The Shelter was established by resident DJs Timmy Regisford, Merlin Bobb, and Freddy Sanon. The club is closely associated with record label 157 Shelter Records. History In 1991, The Shelter opened its doors following the closing of Paradise Garage. The Shelter became a sanctuary for people to express themselves in which race and sexual orientation did not matter. The Shelter's most active promoters and DJs were collectively known as \\"N.A.S.A.\\" (Nocturnal Audio + Sensory Awakening), who hosted parties at the club on Friday night. Promotional flyers claimed The Shelter was \\"New York City's only Non-prejudicial Progressive Underground Dance Club.\\" The dance floor had an incredibly loud 37,000 watt sound system designed by Dave Soto, a New York based audio specialist, in collaboration with Garage-era DJ legend Timmy Regisford. The speaker cabinets were larger than the dancers. N.A.S.A. was a non-alcoholic, after-hours dance party starting on Friday night and running into Saturday morning at The Shelter located in TriBeCa. N.A.S.A. events typically lasted until 8AM or 9AM. The admission charge of $9 before midnight or $14 after included ice water, snacks and breakfast. =New location= In 2004, real estate developer Peter Moore purchased the building for $18 million, and the property is now home to upscale residential lofts. Moore had previously forced the closing of two other nightclubs, including Wetlands at 161 Hudson, when he bought their buildings for restoration.

It is the third film based on one of Cohen's characters from Da Ali G Show; the first were Ali G Indahouse and Borat. The film was released on July 10, 2009 to mixed reviews from critics. Title An alternative title for the film is Br√ºno: Delicious Journeys Through America for the Purpose of Making Heterosexual Males Visibly Uncomfortable in the Presence of a Gay Foreigner in a Mesh T-Shirt. It was initially a mock title proposed by Hollywood news and gossip blog Defamer and mistakenly reported as genuine by a number of sources of film information, including MovieTome, where it was still being used in the search results as late as 2011, the Daily Star, The Irish Times, The Boston Globe, and (although no longer) the Internet Movie Database. Plot Gay Austrian fashion reporter Br√ºno Gehard is fired from his own television show, Funkyzeit mit Br√ºno (Funkytime with Br√ºno) after disrupting a Milan Fashion Week catwalk (whose audience included Paul McCartney), and his lover Diesel leaves him for another man. Accompanied by his assistant's assistant, Lutz Schulz, he travels to the United States to become \\"the biggest Austrian superstar since Hitler\\". Br√ºno unsuccessfully attempts an acting career as an extra on NBC's Medium. He then interviews Paula Abdul, using \\"Mexican chair-people\\" in place of furniture (Abdul goes along with everything, explaining how she aspires to help people, until a naked man, adorned with sushi, is wheeled into the room). He then produces a celebrity interview pilot, showing him dancing erotically, criticizing Jamie Lynn Spears' fetus with reality TV star Brittny Gastineau, unsuccessfully attempting to \\"interview\\" actor Harrison Ford, and closing with a close-up of his penis being swung around by pelvic gyrations. A focus group reviewing the pilot hate it, calling it \\"worse than cancer\\". Br√ºno then decides to make a sex tape, thus he then interviews Ron Paul, claiming to have mistaken him for drag queen RuPaul. While waiting in a hotel room with Paul, Br√ºno flirts with him before undressing, causing Paul to leave angrily and call him \\"queerer than the blazes\\". Br√ºno consults a spiritualist to contact the deceased Rob Pilatus of Milli Vanilli (a former lover) for advice, miming various sex acts on the invisible \\"Pilatus\\". He consults charity PR consultants Nicole and Suzanne DeFosset to select a world problem to maximize his fame, choosing the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict. He flies to Jerusalem to interview former Mossad agent Yossi Alpher and Palestinian politician Ghassan Khatib and confuses hummus and Hamas. In an interview with Israeli and Palestinian professors he sings his own \\"Dove of Peace\\" while cajoling the two to caress each other's hands. He also meets with Ayman Abu Aita, a \\"terrorist group leader, Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades\\" in a Palestinian refugee camp in Lebanon, where he hopes to be kidnapped.The actual location, according to Abu Aita, was a private section of a popular restaurant at the Everest Hotel in the town of Beit Jala, in a section of the West Bank opposite Bethlehem under Israeli control. Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades is a coalition of Palestinian militias in the West Bank. Abu Aita claims to be unaffiliated with Al-Aqsa and pursued legal action against Cohen. Br√ºno insults Abu Aita's hair then says that \\"King Osama\\" looks like a dirty wizard or a homeless Santa Claus. Abu Aita's translator orders Br√ºno to leave. He stops off in Nairobi for \\"a little bit of shopping\\". Br√ºno interviews parents of child models, asking if their toddlers would be ready to lose weight, undergo liposuction, operate \\"antiquated heavy machinery\\" or \\"amateur science\\", or dress in Nazi uniforms. On a talk show hosted by Richard Bey, he shows the African American audience a baby he named O.J., whom he acquired in Africa by \\"swapping him\\" for a U2 Product Red iPod. He shows photographs of the boy covered with bees, on a crucifix and in a Jacuzzi next to male adults in a 69 position. The audience is appalled and social services take the baby from Br√ºno, driving him to depression. He goes to a diner to gorge on high-carb junk food. Lutz carries him back to a hotel room. After a night of sex, they awake to find themselves trapped in a bondage mechanism, unable to find the key. They call a hotel engineer for help and are asked to leave. After accosting a group of anti-gay protesters from the Westboro Baptist Church while still in bondage gear and boarding a bus, Br√ºno and Lutz remove their equipment at Madison County Office of Alternative Sentencing and Release in Huntsville, Alabama. After being arrested, Lutz says he loves Br√ºno, but Br√ºno tells him he does not love him, having been influenced by \\"carb goggles\\". Lutz leaves Br√ºno. After realizing the biggest names in Hollywood are straight (citing Tom Cruise, Kevin Spacey, and John Travolta), Br√ºno consults two gay converters to help him become heterosexual. He attempts other \\"masculine\\" activities, such as learning karate, joining the National Guard, going hunting in Alabama, and attending a swingers party, during which he is whipped by a dominatrix. Eight months later, a now-heterosexual Br√ºno, under the alias \\"Straight Dave\\", hosts a cage-fight match in Arkansas, \\"Straight Dave's Man Slammin' Maxout\\". Lutz appears at the event and calls Br√ºno a \\"faggot\\". The two fight, only to rekindle their love, making out and stripping in front of shocked spectators who throw objects into the cage. The clip gets international press, and the now-famous Br√ºno attempts to marry Lutz, getting O.J. back in exchange for a MacBook Pro. At Abbey Road Studios Br√ºno records a charity song, \\"Dove of Peace\\", featuring Bono, Elton John (seated at a piano on a Mexican \\"chair- person\\"), Chris Martin, Snoop Dogg, Sting, and Slash.

The two interviewees (who had received a fee to appear on camera), convinced by the elaborate production, were confused by the questions but generally went along, even when asked by Baron Cohen to hold hands.Alpher, Yossi (11 July 2008), What Kind of Interviewer Confuses Hamas and Hummus? , The Forward On June 6, 2008, a riot ensued at a stunt orchestrated by Baron Cohen and the producers of the film as they staged a \\"Blue Collar Brawlin'\\" in Fort Smith, Arkansas. Patrons were lured to an event billed as cage fighting, held at a convention center, by print and Craigslist advertisements, promoting \\"hot girls\\", $1 beer, and $5 admission. Approximately 1,500 people attended the event and were greeted by signs that informed them that they were being filmed. No mobile phones, video, or cameras were allowed inside. The acts taking place became homosexual in nature, with Br√ºno inviting a man up to fight him, who turned out to be Lutz. Celine Dion's \\"My Heart Will Go On\\" started to play as both men began kissing and stripping. The audience reacted violently and threw chairs and beer at the performers. The performers were Br√ºno (Baron Cohen) under the ironic gimmick, \\"Straight Dave\\", and Gustaf Hammarsten portraying his opponent, Lutz. In July 2008, Tyler, Texas television station KETK-TV was approached by a \\"documentary filmmaker\\" who was allowed to bring a crew to interview a few members of the staff, including news director Neal Barton and sports director Danny Elzner. They signed releases and expected to be talking about small-town news in the United States. Instead, the interviews conducted by the flamboyant Br√ºno character drifted towards the topic of homosexuality.(11 July 2008), NewsBluesBr√ºno Dupes KETK (Subscription Required) On November 2, 2008, Baron Cohen, dressed as Br√ºno, and his film crew were spotted at a Los Angeles rally that was in support of California's Proposition 8. On November 7, 2008, while appearing as an extra in a scene for the NBC TV series Medium, Baron Cohen interrupted a scene in character and was removed from the set. Production on the episode was shut down temporarily,Ausiello, Michael (November 7, 2008). \\"Exclusive: Bruno (a.k.a.) Sacha Baron Cohen Disrupts 'Medium' \\", Entertainment Weekly, Retrieved on November 19, 2008. though actor Miguel Sandoval, who was told that a cousin of NBC executive Ben Silverman would appear as an extra in the jury, has stated that he recognized Baron Cohen and played along, commenting, \\"It's one thing for Borat to go into an antique store in Georgia or Alabama. For Br√ºno to go on a TV show, he's among insiders. Most people knew who he was.\\"\\"Is 'Br√ºno' Real or Fake?\\" TV Guide; July 27, 2009; p. 9 The production team also deceived presidential candidate Ron Paul into being interviewed by Br√ºno by posing as an Austrian television reporter looking to question the congressman about economic issues. As soon as Br√ºno drops his trousers, the congressman storms out of the room. A spokeswoman for Paul commented on the incident. She said Baron Cohen's people were very deceptive in their tactics. At the time, he thought they were \\"legitimate\\" but later confessed to some concern. \\"I'm familiar with his work, so you can imagine how I feel about it,\\" he said. Jesse Benton, senior vice-president of Ron Paul's Campaign for Liberty organization and former campaign spokesman for Paul, said Paul was not familiar with Baron Cohen's programme, Da Ali G Show. \\"If it's not on hard- core financial news, he doesn't follow it,\\" Benton said. But, he added, \\"It sounds like it's going to be pretty funny.\\" The scene filmed during a taping of The Richard Bey Show, however, was staged, and Bey was in on the joke, as his daytime show went off the air in 1996. The audience, however, was not made aware of the truth of the production. Similarly unaware of the true nature of the production was Paula Abdul, who, during her interview scene in the film, sat atop a Mexican landscaper and was presented with food adorned upon a man lying down on a cart wearing nothing but a \\"sock\\" over his penis. Abdul told a radio interviewer that she was \\"scarred\\" by the incident. Deleted scenes The trailers for the film shown in the U.S. included a scene in which Br√ºno shops for clothing at Sears, telling the sales clerk \\"You might find this very hard to believe, but I'm gay\\" to which the clerk responds \\"Okay\\", while maintaining an awkward posture. =Michael Jackson incident= Following the sudden death of Michael Jackson on June 25, 2009, a scene from Br√ºno was hastily removed from the US theatrical version of the film before its Hollywood premiere later that evening. The scene involved Br√ºno tricking La Toya Jackson into an interview in which he asked her to take a seat on hunched over Mexican workers substituting for chairs and invited her to eat sushi from the torso of an overweight and hairy naked man. In a ploy to get Michael's phone number, Br√ºno asked La Toya to let him look at her mobile phone, which she did. The latter part of this scene was later confirmed to be removed from the film permanently (about the phone number, but \\"the Mexicans as furniture scene\\" was included until the food is served on a naked man, at a SVT Swedish television broadcast of the film, February 2014), but is included in the DVD and Blu-ray release's special features.(June 26, 2009)Bruno: Michael Jackson- related scene permanently cut from film Coincidentally, the Br√ºno premiere's red carpet also temporarily covered Michael Jackson's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame; fans formed a vigil at the star for the radio commentator also named Michael Jackson instead.(June 25, 2009)Michael Jackson Talk Radio, blog dated June 25, 2009 Release Though the film was originally slated for a May 15, 2009 release,\\"Universal sets a date for 'Bruno'.\\" Variety.com.

The film was then released internationally on July 10. =Promotion= In a staged publicity stunt at the 2009 MTV Movie Awards, Baron Cohen appeared as Br√ºno to present the award for Best Male Performer. Dressed as a winged angel wearing a jockstrap and white go-go boots, he was suspended on wires and flew over the audience towards the stage, but fell and landed on rapper Eminem, with his head in Eminem's lap and his buttocks in front of Eminem's face. Eminem shouted, \\"Are you fucking serious?\\" and, \\"Get this motherfucker off me!\\", Eminem and his entourage then walked out of the show and did not return. It was later revealed that Eminem and Baron Cohen had staged the incident, rehearsing it beforehand to make sure it went off without a hitch, and leaving Eminem laughing to himself in his hotel room about how the crowd was easily fooled.(June 2009), Eminem vs. Bruno Staged , Hollywood Insider =Home media= The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray on November 17, 2009. Special features include deleted, alternative, and extended scenes and an audio commentary by Baron Cohen and Larry Charles. ReceptionBox office= Br√ºno opened with $30,619,130, ranking number one in its first weekend. At the end of its run on August 20, it had grossed $60,054,530 in the United States and Canada and $78,751,301 overseas for a worldwide total of $138,805,831. For its opening weekend, it narrowly beat Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs (in its second week of release) for the highest gross, in the lowest attended second-weekend-in-July in 18 years. =Critical response= On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 67% based on 224 reviews, and an average rating of 6.18/10. The website's critical consensus reads: \\"Crude and offensive, but with ample cultural insights and gut-busting laughs, Bruno is another outlandish and entertaining mockumentary from Sacha Baron Cohen.\\" Metacritic gives Br√ºno an average score of 54 out of 100 based on 34 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Nick Curtis of the Evening Standard wrote that Br√ºno is \\"funnier, more offensive, and more outrageous than Borat\\". The Telegraph gave the film four stars out of four, saying \\"impossible not to laugh and also praising Br√ºno's controversial style of comedy.\\" The BBC also gave the film a positive review, saying \\"Br√ºno pushes the boundaries further than Borat ever did.\\" However, they also said that \\"It's not going to be everyone's cup of tea\\" due to the offensive nature of the film. Roger Ebert awarded the film three and a half out of four stars, and said \\"Here is a film that is 82 minutes long and doesn't contain 30 boring seconds\\", although he noted that the film's R rating was \\"very, very hard\\". Andy Lowe from Total Film gave it a lower review, giving it three stars out of five and calling it \\"as phony and frustrating as it is funny... The clothes may be new and more fabulous, but the emperor seriously needs to go shopping.\\" Others felt it was not as good, feeling it would insult and offend the gay community: A. O. Scott of The New York Times wrote that the film shows \\"that lampooning homophobia has become an acceptable, almost unavoidable form of homophobic humor,\\" and called the film \\"a lazy piece of work that panders more than it provokes.\\" At the Movies critic Ben Mankiewicz criticized the film for being too demeaning and playing on homosexual stereotypes. He later named Br√ºno the worst film at the halfway point of 2009. =LGBT response= \\"Sacha Baron Cohen's well- meaning attempt at satire is problematic in many places and outright offensive in others,\\" Rashad Robinson, senior director of media programs for the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) told The New York Times. =Motion Picture Association of America= On October 11, 2010, it was revealed that the Motion Picture Association of America's Classification and Rating Administration would specifically note in the future which films contained \\"male nudity\\". A spokesman said this was in direct response to parental concerns about the content of Br√ºno. =Reception in Austria= While Borat was criticised in Kazakhstan, Austrians were generally positive about Br√ºno. Others regarded the humour as \\"pretty average\\" and \\"inoffensive to Austria\\". Within the Austrian press, reactions were generally mild and positive, although the film was also labelled \\"repetitive\\". Christian Fuchs, from the Austrian radio station FM4, wrote that \\"hidden beneath the hard-as-nails satirist Cohen, lies a humanist who enlightens.\\" However, the film also met some opposition in Austria, due to its portrayal of homosexuality, and basing the portrayal of Austria on motifs such as Josef Fritzl and Adolf Hitler,Bruno tells Austrians to 'get √ºber it' Yahoo!7 News even going as far as calling Mel Gibson \\"der F√ºhrer\\" as he pointed at the actor/director's photo in the film. =Ban in Ukraine= In Ukraine, the film was scheduled to premiere on July 23, but on July 14, the Minister of Culture and Tourism of Ukraine decided to ban the distribution and demonstration of the film in the country. The reason for the prohibition was that nine out of fourteen members of a commission of experts said the film contained \\"obscene language, homosexual scenes, and other scenes of offensive nature never shown in Ukraine.\\" The \\"Vinnytsia Human Rights Group\\" immediately expressed its anger with the ban.–í—ñ–Ω–Ω–∏—Ü—å–∫—ñ –ø—Ä–∞–≤–æ–∑–∞—Ö–∏—Å–Ω–∏–∫–∏ –∑–∞–∫–ª–∏–∫–∞—é—Ç—å –æ—Å–∫–∞—Ä–∂–∏—Ç–∏ —Ä—ñ—à–µ–Ω–Ω—è –ø—Ä–æ –∑–∞–±–æ—Ä–æ–Ω—É \\"–ë—Ä—É–Ω–æ\\" , TCH (July 16, 2009) An unofficial premiere of the film in Kiev on July 22, 2009 was disrupted by a smoke bomb.–£ –ö–∏—î–≤—ñ –∑—ñ—Ä–≤–∞–Ω–æ –ø—Ä–µ–º‚Äô—î—Ä—É \\"–ë—Ä—É–Ω–æ\\" , TCH (July 23, 2009) Events by themes: ¬´Bruno¬ª film unofficial premiere is wrecked in Kiev , UNIAN (22 July 2009) Lawsuit and death threats On 2 December 2009, it was reported that Ayman Abu Aita, who stated he was falsely portrayed as a terrorist in the film, was filing a lawsuit of $110 million in libel damages for defamation. Ayman Abu Aita was identified in the film as a member of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades. Abu Aita says that he was never a member of Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades and was tricked into appearing in the film. In an interview with Time, Abu Aita stated, \\"It is true that I was jailed in 2003...I was active in resisting the occupation, in non-violent ways.\\" Baron Cohen claims he set up a meeting with Aita in the West Bank with the help of a CIA agent. According to the lawsuit, however, the interview with Abu Aita took place at a hotel chosen by Baron Cohen and located in a part of the West Bank that was under Israeli military control. The filing of the lawsuit was confirmed at a press conference on 2 December 2009. Included in the lawsuit are David Letterman, NBC Universal, CBS, Worldwide Pants, Gannett Company, and Larry Charles.Lawsuit Camplaint.

In a statement to the media, Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades denied that Abu Aita was a member and threatened that they \\"reserve the right to respond in the way we find suitable against this man (Baron Cohen)\\" and that they feel the segment was \\"a dirty use of our brother Ayman\\".

From the outset PriceSCAN attempted to distinguish itself as serious instrument which consumers could use to achieve price transparency.

Opened March 1, 2004, the place was designed to recreate the bar made famous by Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman in the movie classic Casablanca. Set in an old courtyard-style mansion built against the walls of the Old Medina of Casablanca, the restaurant ‚Äì piano bar is filled with architectural and decorative details reminiscent of the film: curved arches, a sculpted bar, balconies, balustrades as well as beaded and stencilled brass lighting and plants that cast luminous shadows on white walls. There is an authentic 1930s Pleyel piano and As Time Goes By is a common request to the in-house pianist. Owned by The Usual Suspects company, this Casablanca landmark is usually described as the real Rick‚Äôs Caf√©, finally bringing the legendary ‚ÄúGin Joint‚Äù of cinema fame to life in today's Casablanca. Architecture and d√©cor Rick‚Äôs Caf√© Casablanca was developed by Kathy Kriger (1946‚Äì2018), a former American diplomat in Morocco. The restaurant is housed in a traditional Moroccan grand mansion with a central courtyard or a Riad, built in 1930. The land placement allows for three facades: a distinctive streetfront entrance with heavy wooden doors that depict that of the film; a port-oriented fa√ßade that looks to the Atlantic; and a narrow dead-end access which was the former main entrance but is now the service entrance. Because of the age of the structure and proximity to the sea, the mansion was totally restored and renovated. American architect/designer Bill Willis conceived the decorative and architectural details which enhanced the existing arches and balustrades to evoke the film ‚ÄúCasablanca.‚Äù Intricate antique brass floor and table lamps with metal shades strung with beads give off dramatic lighting effects, and on each table rests a specially designed brass lamp with beaded shade designed by Bill Willis. Carved and inlaid wooden screens, tables and chairs from Syria add decorative touches reminiscent of the furniture in the film. In addition to the faithful rendering of the decoration in Casablanca, Rick‚Äôs Caf√© today is full of tile and wood work representing Morocco‚Äôs craft industry. Fireplaces are of carved marble or painted tadelakt with intricate zellige tile patterns accenting the fireplaces and the risers of the central stairway. Tadelakt in muted colors cover walls throughout the restaurant, and the floors are set in hand made terra cotta tile. Food Food selections at Rick‚Äôs Caf√© takes advantage of Morocco‚Äôs abundance in seafood. The menu offers a wide selection of fish from the traditional Sole Meuniere to John Dory crusted with black pepper, white wine and thyme. Steaks, foie gras, goat cheese salad with fresh figs and an American Crab Louis are among the dinner selections. Rick‚Äôs Cheesecake and brownies figure on the dessert menu, along with more exotic presentations highlighting local fresh fruit. At lunch popular favorites such as Chili Con Carne and American Hamburgers are available along with ‚Äúthe catch of the day‚Äù and a Moroccan tagine. The rooftop terrace barbecue, ‚ÄúThe Pergola‚Äù offers a range of items from mixed grill to roasted game hen and swordfish steak. Music Issam Chabaa plays piano nightly Tuesday through Sunday, a repertoire of standards reminiscent of the 1940s and 1950s, including classic French, Spanish and Brazilian songs along with American favorites such as Summertime, The Lady is a Tramp, Blue Moon and the inevitable As Time Goes By (several times a night). Sunday night is programmed for a Jam session where musicians passing through town, and local amateurs join Issam for jazz improvisation. Between sets and at lunch a soundtrack of compiled standards and big band sounds provides background music. Reservations Reservations are recommended for dinner. The restaurant is open for lunch from 12:00 noon until 3 pm; for dinner from 6:30 pm until 1 am. Rick‚Äôs Caf√© is open 7 days a week including the month of Ramadan and holidays.

History  Prince Norodom Sihanouk with Mao Zedong in Beijing in 1956. Although the countries share no common border, China has had a historic cultural and commercial relationship with Cambodia. The 950,000 Chinese in Cambodia constitute 3-5% of Cambodia's population, and although they were discriminated against by the Khmer Rouge and the Vietnamese, they have re-emerged as a prominent business community. Cambodia first made contact with China as early as 1421 AD during the final years of the Khmer Empire when Ponhea Yat dispatched a minister to establish formal diplomatic ties. China has used Cambodia as a counterweight to the dominating influence of Vietnam. In the mid-20th century, Communist China supported the Maoist Khmer Rouge against Lon Nol's regime during the Cambodian Civil War and then its takeover of Cambodia in 1975. Also, Mao Zedong had fostered good relations with Prince Norodom Sihanouk, who also fought against Lon Nol and backed the Khmer Rouge. When Vietnamese military invaded Cambodia in 1978, China provided extensive political and military support for the Khmer Rouge. In 1979, the Chinese People's Liberation Army waged a brief border war against Vietnam, partly to threaten it into pulling out of Cambodia. The Paris Peace Conference on Cambodia, from July 1989 to October 1991, resolved Cambodia‚ÄìChina relations and contributed to reintegrating China into major power multilateral negotiations. After Vietnam's withdrawal from Cambodia and then the 1993 UN- sponsored elections recognized and supported the new democratic government. Modern depiction of a visit of Zheng He's fleet to Cambodia. A relief in Nanjing's Treasure Boat Shipyard Park Since 1997, China began developing closer relations with the regime of Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen, once a pro-Vietnamese leader and a defector from the Khmer Rouge during Vietnam's occupation of Cambodia. Although initially backing Hun Sen's political opponent Prince Norodom Ranariddh and his FUNCINPEC, China was disenchanted with Ranaridh's efforts to build a closer relationship with Taiwan, which is claimed by China. Facing international isolation after the 1997 coup that brought him to power, Hun Sen cultivated close ties with China, which opposed efforts by Western countries to impose economic sanctions on Cambodia. China's close ties with Cambodia have also served to gain leverage against Vietnamese influence in the region. Cambodia has severed all links with Taiwan and has strongly supported the reunification of Taiwan with China. In June 2020, Cambodia was one of 53 countries that backed the Hong Kong national security law at the United Nations. Chinese assistance During the visit of Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao between April 7-April 8, 2006 both nations signed several bilateral agreements and a treaty of \\"Comprehensive Partnership of Cooperation.\\" China diversified its aid and investments in Cambodia and promised to provide US$600 million in loans and grants. China has canceled much of Cambodia's debt and granted a fresh loan of US$12.4 million for the construction of the building housing the Cambodian government's council of ministers and the restoration of the Angkor Wat temple and heritage site. About $200 million has been earmarked as a low-interest loan for the construction of bridges spanning the Mekong and Tonle Sap rivers. China has cultivated strong ties with Cambodia, gaining access to its sea ports that can allow China to exploit oil reserves in the Gulf of Tonkin. During the visit, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen described China as Cambodia's \\"most trustworthy friend.\\" China has also cultivated military ties. In the aftermath of the 1997 coup, China provided US$2.8 million in military aid and has since supplied wide range of military equipment,Hoa K·ª≥ ng∆∞ng vi·ªán tr·ª£, Trung Qu·ªëc t·∫∑ng ngay Phnom Penh 257 qu√¢n xa training of military and police cadre and naval vessels to combat drug trafficking and piracy. China has also funded Chinese language schools in Cambodia. Immigration of Chinese workers to Cambodia has also stepped up in recent years and is estimated between 50,000 and 300,000.  Commerce  Trade between Cambodia and China totaled US$4.8 billion in 2016, compared to $732 million in 2006 and has increased by an average of 26% for the last 10 years. However, Cambodia has a significant trade deficit with China, importing over $3.9 billion (raw fabrics being the largest constituent) compared to its exports of $830 million. It was estimated that 60% of products in Cambodian markets are Chinese-made on 2006, and 24% of Cambodian imports were from China in 2015. There are multiple large-scale Chinese investment projects in Cambodia such as the 400 MW Lower Se San 2 Dam worth $781 million and a US$3.8 billion deepwater port project on a 90-km stretch of Cambodian coastline. According to the Cambodian Center for Human Rights, the Cambodian government gave over 4.6 million hectares in concessions to 107 Chinese-owned firms between 1994 and 2012. Concerns Embassy of Cambodia in China Portraits of President Xi Jinping and King Norodom Sihamoni being displayed during President Xi's state visit to Cambodia, October 2016. China's dominant participation in Cambodia's economy, its close cultivation of ties with the Cambodian government and the influx of Chinese immigrants has raised concerns about an anti-Chinese backlash from Cambodians, many of whom resent China for its support of the Khmer Rouge, which conducted a genocide that claimed the lives of more than 1.7 million Cambodians. The Cambodian government's suppression of the Falun gong, a cult group banned by China, and extradition of 2 Falungong activists to China was criticized by human rights activities and the U.N. commission for refugees. China's influence is suspected to be shielding the pro-China Khmer Rouge leaders from standing trial for crimes against humanity. Suspected preferential treatment for Cambodia-based Chinese firms and the National Assembly of Cambodia's guarantee of profits for the Chinese investors in the Kamchay power plant has also provoked widespread criticism of China's growing political clout in Cambodia. There has been a massive influx of Chinese investment in Cambodia, as the country begins to heal and stabilize from the decades of civil war and unrest during the Cold War. Cambodia also receives a formidable amount of aid from China; hence, Chinese influence over Cambodia should not be underestimated, despite Prime Minister Hun Sen‚Äôs insistence that ‚ÄúChina does not control his country of 15 million‚Äù. The Cambodian government still heavily rely on foreign aid. Strong Chinese influence in the country does, without a doubt, have its benefits along with its problems. It could be argued that the benefits and the problems are a matter of perspective, but this is not entirely the case. Cambodia's choice of alignment, is not strange if looked at from a practically stand point. Not only does the country have cultural ties with China; it is also in closer proximity compared to the United States. With Chinese aid, roads, bridges, and dams among other things are being built in Cambodia; this is undeniably positive for the country. From 1994 to 2012 ‚ÄúChina invested a total of US$9.17 billion‚Äù in Cambodia. However, Chinese firms that are developing and investing in Cambodia, also tend to have extractive tendencies which exploits the country's natural resources. Illegal logging and shady deals involving members of Cambodia's government and Chinese firms are on a steady rise. Mining projects and government land concessions to foreign and local firms, are increasing the number of people being displaced from their land. Strangio describes China's aid to Cambodia as ‚Äúhefty amounts of loans and investment dollars unconstrained by human rights or good governance concerns‚Äù. This means that firms and corrupt government officials that benefit from the investments, will act to maximize their profits with little concern for human rights or the rule of law. The international community maintains its leverage over the policy of Cambodia, concerning human rights, corruption, and good governance, through controlling the amount of aid given. The increase in Chinese aid with no strings attached; however, threatens to alleviate Cambodia of western pressures, and may lead to an increase in human rights violations by the government. Land evictions is becoming more and more common in Cambodia; in 2006 in Mondulkiri province, the Phong hill tribes ‚Äúclaim that the Chinese company has colluded with the Cambodian government to illegally force them from their ancestral homeland‚Äù. The very recent Boeung Kak and Borei Keila evictions in Phnom Penh were seen by many observers as the Cambodian Government's increasing drift away from the adherence to human rights. The Chinese funded Sesan Dam project in the northeastern part of Cambodia, threaten to lower the fish stocks, and affect the livelihood of many Khmer. ‚ÄúBy one estimate, the project will result in a 9 percent drop in fish stocks in the entire Mekong Basin‚Äù.

After the San Diego- Coronado Bridge was built, spanning her original route, she was sold to Washington State Ferries where she was christened the MV Kulshan and served in Puget Sound waters from 1970 to 1982.

After her stint with the Washington State Ferries system, the Kulshan was declared surplus to requirements and sold to the United States Coast Guard to provide service for their large Atlantic Area headquarters base on Governors Island in New York Harbor, an island community and workplace for 5000 people. The ferry was towed south and through the Panama Canal in making its way to the east coast. Once in New York City, the ferry was renamed Governor and as part of a fleet of two other ferries, the Samuel L. Coursen and the Minue, shuttled passengers and vehicles from the Battery Maritime Building in Lower Manhattan to Governors Island. The closure of the Governors Island Coast Guard base in 1996 made her surplus for a third time whereupon she was purchased by SSA in 1998.

The park is located near the town of Charleston in the southwest corner of the Heber Valley. Description Established as a state park in 1971, the Deer Creek State Park features the large Deer Creek Reservoir, which is popular for fishing and sun tanning, along with other surface water sports such as boating, sailing, swimming, and windsurfing. The park is at an elevation of . Park facilities include two concrete ramps for boat-launching, a summer-only 75-unit campground (58 sites for RVs and the remainder for tents), rest rooms, showers, and sewage-disposal, two group-use areas, picnic areas, and fish cleaning stations. There is also a restaurant and gas station, and boat rentals are available. The park recorded 338,865 visitors for the fiscal year 2017. Most of the multiple areas of the park are accessible directly from U.S. Route 189 (US-189), which runs near the eastern and southern shores of the reservoir. However, Utah State Route 314 provides additional access from US-189 to the facilities on the southern shore. History In the 1930s the Salt Lake City area and surrounding farmland were suffering from water shortages. Creation of a reservoir was approved by the United States Congress in 1935 to help alleviate this problem, and Deer Creek Reservoir became a significant part of the Provo River Project. The Bureau of Reclamation (BOR) began construction of the reservoir in the spring of 1938. Water was available for use in 1941, and the project was completed in 1955. The Provo River Water Users Association, under contract with the BOR, repaid construction costs, and operated and maintained the facilities until the area became a state park in 1971. During this time, fishing was the chief recreational activity, as other water sports were prohibited. The Division of Parks and Recreation became responsible for the administration, development, and operation of the park in January, 1971, and maintains it today.

His works form the inspiration for works by several major Swedish composers, including: Wilhelm Stenhammar, Ture Rangstr√∂m, and Karin Rehnqvist. Bergman was born and died in Stockholm, where he spent his entire working life as a postal official, retiring in 1933. He started writing poetry whilst working for the Swedish postal service, his first poetry anthology, Marionettema, was published in 1903. In addition to his postal duties, Bergman also worked as a literary critic for Ord och Bild from 1900 until 1904. He worked for the major newspaper, Dagens Nyheter, and he also served as a theatre critic from 1905 until 1939. Bergman was a close friend of the pre-eminent Swedish novelist of his day, Hjalmar S√∂derberg, with whom he maintained an extensive correspondence extending from 1891 until S√∂derberg's death in 1941. Like S√∂derberg, Bergman's writing was heavily influenced by the decadent movement, in particular the fl√¢neur writings of Charles Baudelaire. Bergman's early poetry is typically decadent and disillusioned, being informed by a determinist view of a changing world in which all value systems and all scientific and metaphysical processes of understanding the universe are meaningless. Marionetterna, which translates as The Marionettes, supposes that the destinies of men are in the hands of a bearded old man in control of their every move. Like S√∂derberg, Bergman's worldview gave way to a militant brand of humanism in his later works, a reaction against the growing threat of Nazism. Bergman is buried at the Norra begravningsplatsen.

Biography Hawkes was raised and lived his life in and around Geelong, Victoria. Educated at The Geelong College from 1909 to 1919, he showed enormous potential as a young sportsman, having won the Victorian School Boys U19 tennis title for 5 years in a row ‚Äì described by historian Graeme Kinross Smith as the \\"nursery for tennis talent\\". Hawkes had also been touted as a future test cricketer for Australia and was made a member of the MCC at the age of 13. He was captain of the first Cricket team for the last 4 years of his school life at The Geelong College and according to school website, \\"In a legendary day of bowling in 1916, Jack Hawkes was to claim 10 wickets in a match against Wesley College.\\" Tennis, however, was to create a more powerful pull than cricket. Taught on the lawn court at the family home \\"Llanberis\\", overlooking Corio Bay by family friend Russell Keays and influenced by tennis legend and family friend, Norman Brookes, Jack's career blossomed in the 1920s. The left-hander won a clean sweep at the Australasian Championships of 1926, winning the men's singles, men's doubles and mixed doubles in the same year. Hawkes had five championship points in a marathon singles final against his doubles partner Gerald Patterson in the Australian Championships in 1927, but went on to lose the match in five sets. Hawkes also won two US mixed doubles titles, won a total of three Australian doubles titles with Gerald Patterson and was runner-up with Gerald Patterson in Wimbledon doubles and US doubles of 1928. Hawkes also won a total of three mixed doubles Australian championships. Hawkes was a three-times Davis Cup representative in 1921, 1923, 1925 and was controversially omitted from the team in the year of his Australian Open crown in 1926 and successful overseas tour of 1928. After his retirement from tennis, Hawkes was actively involved in tennis administration and ran the family business Hawkes Brothers, in Geelong until his retirement in the early 1970s. Jack Hawkes retired to Ocean Grove (where he had holidayed as a child at the family's beachside home \\"Imbool\\"), and later to Barwon Heads before his death in Geelong, at the age of 90 after a short illness, on 31 March 1990.

His Guantanamo Internment Serial Number was 523. He worked as a farmer before he was recruited into being a guard for the Taliban. He served as a guard in Nahreen for the Taliban. After three months of working as a guard, the Northern Alliance took over the facility and he was sent to US forces. Eventually he was sent to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba on June 12, 2002, for his supposed knowledge of leadership of the Taliban in the area. He was recommended for release on September 27, 2002, by Michael Dunlavey, because he was not a threat to the United States nor could provide information of terrorist activity. McClatchy News Service interview On June 15, 2008, the McClatchy News Service published a series of articles based on interviews with 66 former Guantanamo captives. Ehsanullah was one of the former captives who had an article profiling him. mirror Ehsanullah acknowledged having once served as a Taliban foot-soldier, but stated he was an involuntary conscript. He said he abandoned his post as soon as he learned that the Taliban government had collapsed, and was trying to make his way home, when he was captured by Northern Alliance soldiers. He said he and other captives, taken at the same time, were sold to the Americans for a bounty. \\"The commander told the Americans that he had arrested high-ranking Taliban and got $5,000 for each of us.\\" According to Ehsanullah: \\"There was no training. They said, 'This is the trigger; pull it.'\\" Ehsanullah was interviewed by telephone because he feared local Taliban sympathizers learning he had met with a foreigner. The McClatchy reporters found that local security officials had never heard of him. Ehsanullah was held in both the Bagram Theater Internment Facility and the Kandahar detention facility, prior to being transferred to Guantanamo. He reported being physically abused in American custody in Afghanistan, and he reported witnessing an American GI throwing a Koran into a bucket of excrement. Ehsanullah said conditions were better in Guantanamo, no one beat him, he was interrogated infrequently, and when he was: \\"They kept asking me why I was arrested,\\" he said. \\"They told me that the (northern alliance) commander had sold me to them, and they were trying to figure out what the truth was.\\" Ehsanullah was held for less than a year. Height and weight records On March 16, 2007, the Department of Defense published limited height and weight records for the captives.

Like his father, he became a medical doctor but was also a successful amateur lawn tennis player in both doubles and singles. Gregory also played cricket, golf, rugby and squash. In the 1920s he played doubles with Ian Collins and they were runners up at the 1929 Wimbledon Championships. In 1929 he won the Australian singles championship. Following the Second World War, Gregory was captain of the British Davis Cup team. Due to an accident Geoffrey Paish was unable to play in a 1952 match against Yugoslavia and the 49-year-old Gregory stepped in to win the doubles match with Tony Mottram.

Metro Aviation sold the program to Mercy Air on December 4, 2001, effectively shutting down the Flight for Life service under that name, although the service was still provided. History The first helicopter was an Aerospatiale SA.316/319 Alouette III, decorated with the Star of Life. The helicopter was owned by RTS Helicopters and was used for 2 years. In 1982 RTS traded in the Alouette for a newer AS-355F2 (N57901) with a deep blue and sea green paint scheme. On December 7, 1983, N57901 was destroyed when it collided with Black Mountain. The hospital put a memorial plaque on the helipad. Valley Hospital signed a contract with Medical Aviation Inc. (a subsidiary of Metro Aviation), to sustain the service. With the new contract, Valley Hospital received a BO105 CBS4 (N10VH) named Lifeguard 1 based at the hospital, as well as loaner aircraft to use when the main helicopter was in heavy maintenance. Lifeguard 1 had an orange and black paint scheme, with a silver stripe. In 1998, Valley Hospital received a second BO105 CBS5 (N911VH), which they dubbed Lifeguard 1, renaming the older helicopter Lifeguard 2. Metro Aviation shipped Valley Hospital another upgraded helicopter, a BK117 B2 (N117VH). This again necessitated renaming the fleet, with the newest helicopter again being designated Lifeguard 1. Metro Aviation sold the program to Mercy Air on December 4, 2001, effectively shutting down the Flight for Life service under that name, although the service was still provided. Service area and bases Valley Hospital's Flight for Life program served southern Nevada, Mohave County/Strip District of Arizona, parts of Dixie (Utah), and parts of southern California. The program had bases located at Valley Hospital Medical Center, Mesquite Airport(N10VH), Pahrump, Nevada(N911VH), and Whiskey Pete's in Primm, Nevada(N10VH). The maintenance hangar for the fleet was located at Cheyenne Air Center at North Las Vegas Airport. The majority of maintenance was conducted on the helipad at Valley Hospital, which had a jet fuel tank buried in the parking lot, permitting on-site refueling. Dispatch Flight For Life used dedicated frequencies, 155.280 MHz and 158.980 MHz, to communicate with other aircraft in the fleet and base operations. Prior to 1992 dispatch was provided by a dedicated center at Valley Hospital. These individuals were trained in-house and also participated as hospital operators. Following 1992 dispatch services were contracted out to Mercy Ambulance, who communicated with other fire and law enforcement agencies. Mercy Ambulance dispatch provided flight following communications in addition. Incidents and accidents On December 7, 1983, N57901 was destroyed when it collided with Black Mountain. The pilot attempted an auto-rotation after the left engine cowling came apart mid flight.

A notary may only perform a notarial act upon receipt of satisfactory proof of identity (i.e. a driver's license or other form of identification card), or by the notary's own personal knowledge of the person appearing before them, or upon the sworn statement of two witnesses who personally know the person whose signature is to be authenticated. A notary may not notarize their own signature, or the signature of their spouse, parent, or child.  Authority of a Florida notary public  Notaries Public in Florida have the authority to take acknowledgments, administer oaths, solemnize marriage, certify the contents of a safe-deposit box, certify the Vehicle Identification Number of a motor vehicle, and certify copies of non- recordable documents. * Acknowledgments are usually taken in correlation with a real estate transaction, but are often used in cases where a mere \\"identity verification\\" is needed to ensure that the document is being executed by an authorized party. * Oaths are administered orally in depositions and court hearings in which a party is being sworn in over the telephone instead of being personally present before a judge. In this respect, notaries administer oaths in the same way as a judge. Many court reporters are also notaries, as this allows one person to both swear the party in for a deposition and to transcribe the deposition. Oaths are also administered in the form of affidavits and other sworn statements on paper. * Marriages may be legally solemnized by a notary public between parties who present the notary with a valid marriage license. The law has no requirements for the form of a marriage ceremony, therefore many notaries perform both civil and religious marriage ceremonies. * The contents of a safe-deposit box are certified by a notary public in cases where the owner has died or otherwise abandoned the safe- deposit box. In this case, the notary must be present while a bank official and other witness open the box. The notary then certifies the contents of the box and makes a certificate thereof for presentation to the court or to the personal representative of the Decedent's estate. * Notaries are authorized by Florida law to verify the Vehicle Identification Number of a motor vehicle and certify this fact to the Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles when that vehicle has not previously been registered with the state. * Notaries have the authority to make certified photocopies in cases where certified copies of a document can not be obtained from another public official. Therefore, notaries can not certify birth certificates, copies of court judgments, or public records maintained in government offices. They can, however, certify copies of passports, driver licenses, and any other document which is not eligible for public recordation. * The most rare of notarial duties in Florida is the drafting of protests, i.e. certificates of dishonor, which certify that payment on a negotiable instrument has been refused. This is an antiquated act that appears only one place in the Florida Statutes.  Commission requirements  Any individual at least 18 years of age who is a resident of Florida may apply for and obtain commission as a notary public, provided that they have obtained a $7,500.00 public bond from an insurance company, and taken a notary education course administered by an authorized course provider. Such commission is usually obtained by legal secretaries, paralegals, and attorneys for use in their place of work, where the notarization of client signatures is a requirement on many court pleadings and other documents. However, occupation in the legal profession is not a prerequisite to becoming a notary, and a person of any profession may apply for and obtain a commission. Many banks also have notaries on staff to notarize the signatures of their customers.  Seal requirements  Sample Florida notary stamp A notary seal of the rubber stamp type is required to be affixed to all notarized paper documents. The rubber stamp must include the commissioned name of the notary public, the words \\"Notary Public-State of Florida\\", the notary's commission number, and the date on which the notary's commission expires. Prior to the mid-1970s, the only statutory requirement regarding notarial seals was that one be used and that it include the words \\"Notary Public\\" and \\"State of Florida at Large\\"; the name of the notary was optional, and the law did not specify what types of seals were permissible. This law was later amended to state that the seal must be round in design and of either the rubber stamp or impression type. In the early 1990s, the statute was again changed to require a rubber stamp seal, with an impression type seal being optional and not acceptable unless used in conjunction with a rubber stamp. However, many notaries continue to use the impression seal with their rubber stamp to allow for easy detection when trying to determine which document is an original. This process is made more difficult for notaries who only use a rubber stamp seal, as the Florida statutes require that the seal be affixed in only photographically-reproducible black ink.

The Pierpont Inn & Spa Historic Hotels of America Retrieved 12 March 2015 History In 1908, Josephine Pierpont bought land on a bluff overlooking the ocean in Ventura, California for development as a site for an inn. She felt the inn could serve the increasing number of automobile enthusiasts who would travel along the Pacific Coast looking for a place to rest and enjoy a home-cooked meal. She hired Sumner P. Hunt to build a Craftsman Style bungalow inn on the site. It opened in September 1910, originally as \\"The Wayside Inn\\", later changed to \\"The Pierpont Inn\\" Josephine's son Austen Pierpont ran the Inn for the first many years, expanding it in 1925 by adding two English Tudor-style cottages surrounded by a lush, garden setting. He also developed the idea of turning the inn into a country club, but the idea never came to fruition. The inn changed hands several times and fell into disrepair until it was rescued by Mrs. Mattie Vickers Gleichmann in 1928.\\"Obituaries : Mattie Gleichmann; Pierpont Inn Matriarch\\" Los Angeles Times. 6 February 1996 After Mattie's husband, professional baseball player Gus Gleichmann, was forced to leave the sport after being injured, they decided to pursue a career in hospitality.

Rose Avenue, Saticoy, CA\\" San Buenaventura Research Associates, Santa Paula, California 18 July 2011 to purchase and renovate the inn. It reopened in 1929 as a family affair, as her husband, mother, sister, brother-in-law and children all worked on and around the property. In 1938, Gus Gleichmann was killed in an automobile accident and Mattie decided to continue operation of the Inn without him to fulfill the dream of being able to provide a future for their children. This dream became a reality when her son Ted returned from World War II and embraced the role of general manager. Ted Gleichmann brought modernization to the Inn and added an East Wing with 12 guestrooms including fireplaces in 1954. Later he added the Bluff House and West Wing to bring the total number of rooms to 72. In addition to his duties at the Inn, Ted was a championship-winning, amateur PGA golfer. Among his victories was the 1963 Bing Crosby Invitational Tournament (now known as the AT&T; Pebble Beach Pro-Am). Through his success in the golf world, he attracted many of his famous social contacts to the Inn.\\"Saticoy Country Club: Our History\\" Accessed 14 November 2013 In the 1950s, the Ventura Freeway was built below the bluff that the Inn sits on.Pols, Mary F. (February 11, 1996) \\"ON THE ROAD: Journeys Along Ventura County's Highways\\" Los Angeles Times In 1976, Spencer and Scott Garrett (grandchildren of Mattie Gleichmann's sister) leased the then-vacant parcel of land adjacent to the Inn to build one of the nation's first multi-purpose athletic facilities, \\"The Pierpont Racquet Club\\". After Mattie's death in 1996 at the age of 100, the Inn was eventually sold to the Garretts. In 2005 the Garretts sold the inn to Central Coast Management Inc. In 2009, Central Coast Management Inc. sold the inn to the Pierpont Group LLC, headed by investor Grace S. Ahn.Hoops, Stephanie (April 22, 2009) \\"Pierpont Inn is changing hands\\" Ventura County Star The property went into bankruptcy auction in late 2012 and the Inn transferred from the Ahn Family Trust to Brighton Management. Wyndham Garden Ventura Pierpont Inn was the new name selected when Brighton Management signed a franchise agreement with Wyndham's national reservation system in December 2013. Renovations to the rooms and grounds were needed after a period of neglect.Hoops, Stephanie (January 31, 2013) \\"Ventura's Pierpont Inn joins Wyndham chain\\" Ventura County Star In 2015, DKN Hotels acquired the property and stated that the renovations would continue along with remaining under the Wyndham franchise. Notable guests The Inn was a playground for elite society. Tinsel-town notables such as Cecil B. DeMille, Bette Davis, Edward G. Robinson and Charlie Chaplin all took breaks from filming in Hollywood by escaping to the charming location. The property was also a hideaway for scandalous lovers such as Clark Gable & Carole Lombard and Humphrey Bogart & Lauren Bacall, many of whom, because they were married to others, desired to have their privacy protected. The Inn's remote location provided the perfect venue to escape the limelight. Local attorney Erle Stanley Gardner authored his \\"Perry Mason\\" series in his law office down the road from the Inn and actually used it as a backdrop for many of his novels, particularly in \\"The Case of the Velvet Claws.\\" George H. W. Bush along with wife Barbara (with their son George W. Bush in tow) spent considerable time at the Inn between 1949-1950 while Bush senior was apprenticing in the oil business.

Its apparent magnitude is 6.277, so it can be seen by the naked eye under very favourable conditions. Based on parallax measured by Hipparcos, the system is located around away, and it's made of two different spectroscopic binary pairs. The first pair is made of a primary yellow giant star of spectral type G0III, and the secondary subgiant star of spectral type K2IV, so they have both left the main sequence evolutionary phase. They are also both more massive than the Sun. The secondary completes an orbit around the primary every 421 years. The second pair is a double-lined spectroscopic binary located 18 arcseconds away from the first pair, although with an apparent magnitude of 10.37 it is too faint to be seen without a telescope. It wasn't recognized as a separate pair in the old Bright Star Catalogue and Henry Draper Catalogue, thus it bears the designation HD 895C. They are both G-type main sequence stars slightly less massive than the Sun, with spectral types G7V and G8V respectively. They complete an orbit around their center of mass approximately every 6 days. Using Gaia parallax, instead, the pair formed by the primary and the secondary is much closer than previous measures, at an estimated distance of 175 light years. The two pairs, then, may be not gravitationally bound.

It is open daily except Monday; an admission fee is charged. The nearest Paris M√©tro stations are Raspail or Denfert-Rochereau on Line 4 and Line 6. History The Fondation Cartier was created in 1984 by the Cartier SA firm as a center for contemporary art that presents exhibits by established artists, offers young artists a chance to debut, and incorporates works into its collection. In 1994, it moved to its current location in a glass building designed by Pritzker Prize architect Jean Nouvel on the site of the former American Center for Students and Artists, surrounded by a modern woodland garden landscaped by Lothar Baumgarten. The ground floor of the building is eight meters (26 feet) high and glassed in on all sides. In 2011, the president and founder of the Fondation Cartier, Alain Dominique Perrin, asked Nouvel to draw up preliminary plans for a new base on √éle Seguin. By 2014, the foundation abandoned plans to relocate to the island and instead commissioned Nouvel to work on the expansion of its current premises. Collection The museum displays exhibits of contemporary and international artists, and currently contains over 1500 works by more than 350 artists. Its collections include monumental works such as The Monument to Language by James Lee Byars, Caterpillar by Wim Delvoye, Backyard by Liza Lou, La Voli√®re (The Aviary) by Jean-Pierre Raynaud, and Everything that Rises Must Converge by Sarah Sze; works by contemporary French artists including Vincent Beaurin, G√©rard Garouste, Raymond Hains, Jean-Michel Othoniel, Alain S√©chas, Pierrick Sorin, Jean Giraud; and works by foreign artists including James Coleman (Ireland), Thomas Demand (Germany), Alair Gomes (Brazil), William Kentridge (South Africa), Bodys Isek Kingelez (the Congo), Guillermo Kuitca (Argentina), Yukio Nakagawa (Japan), Huang Yong Ping (China), and Damian Pettigrew (Canada).

Founded in 1980, it is dedicated to presenting, preserving, and perpetuating the history of the Lenape and other Northeastern Woodland Indian cultures. The Museum of Indian Culture is located in the Lehigh Parkway at 2825 Fish Hatchery Road in Allentown, Lehigh County, Pennsylvania. The museum was founded by Dorothy Schiavone and her daughter, Carla Messinger. The building in which the museum is located is a historic Pennsylvania German stone farm house and two-story stone spring house built by the Bieber family around 1750.  History  The Museum of Indian Culture was originally founded as the Lenni Lenape Historical Society/Museum of Indian Culture in 1980, the oldest exclusively Native American museum in Pennsylvania, with a focus on educating Pennsylvanians on the state's indigenous people. In 2005 the museum was renamed. The museum has diversified by including exhibits from tribes across the western hemisphere. After a change in administration in 2003, the museum sought to improve community relations between local federal government and federally recognized Native American tribes. In 2007, under the management of Oklahoma Delawares, the museum altered its former mission, and announced an interest in pursuing what it saw as fraudulence by groups claiming to be indigenous Pennsylvanians. Today, the museum serves as a tool to help with Native American research and as way to educate people on Native American tribes. The museum hosts festivals, offers tours and community outreach programs for schools to educate and bring a presence of Native American Culture to the Lehigh valley.  Exhibits  The Museum of Indian Culture houses a diverse collection of Native American items, including stone tools, ceramics, carvings, photographs, weapons, beadwork, and basketry. Artifacts originate from across North America and include a Californian Hupa basket collection, a Mexican Aztec ceremonial clothing display, and a stone tool assortment from a Delaware Indian tribe in Pennsylvania. One focus of the collection is the set of artefacts discovered by amateur archeologists Frank Sterling, Paul Delgrego, and W. W. Venney, who stumbled across the Broomall Rock Shelters after finding a skeleton in one of them. More than 3,000 years ago, Lenape Indians had sought protection from the cold and rain in these shelters. An exhibit at the museum features artifacts from the shelters.

BiographyEarly life= Christiane Schmidtmer was born in Mannheim, Germany to Gertrud and Jakob Schmidtmer on Christmas Eve 1939. Her father disappeared in Russia during the war. The family later relocated from Mannheim to nearby Heidelberg after her mother remarried. At the age of seventeen her mother sent her to London where Christiane attended St Giles school to learn English. During her stay in England, she met a powerful man of British royalty who offered to send her to the Royal Academy of Arts if ‚Äì in return ‚Äì she would sleep with him. She packed her bags and left for Germany the same night. After returning to Heidelberg, she attended the local H√∂lderlin-Gymnasium (academic high school) from which she graduated during the late 1950s. In 1959 against strong family opposition ‚Äì her mother wanted her to follow a career in medicine ‚Äì Christiane Schmidtmer moved to Munich where she began taking acting lessons. During that time she performed in afternoon stage productions for children. =Career= Schmidtmer worked onstage in Germany from 1961‚Äì63, then turned to photographic modelling for German fashion and nude magazines and later, Playboy in the USA. She modelled for advertising companies, namely Max Factor Cosmetics, before she started her movie career. She was hired as their featured model and introduced at the New York World's Fair in 1964 followed by an American tour with visits to Los Angeles, Las Vegas and Chicago. After her return to Los Angeles, she met the polyglot language teacher and publisher Michel Thomas for the first time in August 1965 at the Chateau Marmont Hotel. The two began a long love relationship a short time later. She appeared in German TV and movie productions, such as Rolf H√§drich's Stop Train 349. During the filming in Berlin and England she befriended co-star Jos√© Ferrer. The friendship lasted until Ferrer's death in 1992. He later recommended her to Stanley Kramer for his production of Ship of Fools, her first US film in which she played Ferrer's beautiful mistress. She played the evil prison wardress in The Big Doll House (1971) as well as Lufthansa stewardess Lise Bruner in Boeing Boeing. Schmidtmer was one of just a few German actresses successful in 1960s Hollywood and was praised by critics as the most exciting German import since Marlene Dietrich. Schmidtmer - with her attractive and typically German appearance - was often reduced to playing the \\"attractive German\\". Her nickname which stuck throughout her career was \\"Liebesbombe\\"/\\"Love Bomb\\". Throughout the 1970s and towards the end of her career, Schmidtmer appeared in numerous US talk shows, television series, and B-Movie productions such as The Giant Spider Invasion (1975). In 1981 she appeared in Hot Bubblegum - Lemon Popsicle 3 - one of the sequels in the Israeli Eskimo Limon series. Most sources list this as her last film; in it she portrayed a nymphomaniac piano teacher. Schmidtmer continued to do commercials, and voiceover work in a number of productions. In 1980, shortly before ending her movie career, she published her autobiography My Wild Nights in Hollywood in German magazines which detailed her affairs with many actors, including a relationship with Glenn Ford. It was later translated into several languages. During that time she lived in Munich-Schwabing. =Later years and death= Following her movie career, Schmidtmer worked as a licensed real estate agent with numerous million-dollar sales in southern California. She lived both in the US and Heidelberg. In 1980 she published her autobiography, My Wild Nights in Hollywood, in German magazines.Profile, glamourgirlsofthesilverscreen.com; accessed February 19, 2016. In 1995 Schmidtmer permanently moved back to Germany. She led a quiet life during which her own health started to fail. Schmidtmer died in her sleep on 13 March 2003 at her home in Heidelberg, Germany from natural causes following an accident. Schmidtmer is interred at the family grave in Heidelberg-Handschuhsheim.

Upon completion of naval service in 1881 Arkas obtained a magistracy in Kherson. In his leisure time, he collected and recorded folk songs, also studying the history of Ukraine. His teacher, Petro Nishchynsky, who was a Ukrainian composer, conductor, and writer, had an influence upon Mykola; the latter tried to master musical knowledge independently, to develop his composer's skills and writing music. Mykola Arkas died on , in Mykolaiv, where he was buried in the family chapel in the town cemetery.  Compositions and other cultural activities  Arkas's artistic contributions include about 80 compositions for solo-singing, vocal ensembles and arrangements of folk songs.

The series was serialized in Hakusensha's semi-monthly sh≈çjo manga magazine, Hana to Yume from May 2004 to March 2005. The chapters were then compiled and two volumes were released. It is licensed in English for North American distribution by Tokyopop. Plot  Kiyo Katsuragi is a young girl still attending school, when she is about to inherit her grandmother's mansion given to her mother. When she enters, she finds out she is also living in the mansion with two vampires, Kuroboshi and his servant Alshu. Things get even crazier when Kuroboshi decides to make Kiyo his \\"bride\\". A vampire's \\"bride\\" is a female human who will become his only source of blood. Even though Kiyo seems to like Kuroboshi, she is embarrassed when he tries to suck her blood, which is a problem for Kuroboshi. Then, Kiyo's childhood friend tries to stop their growing affection, because he is afraid that Kiyo will be tainted by the vampire. Kiyo is then told that if she wants to be with Kuroboshi forever and be his bride, she will have to kiss him. There is one side effect‚Äîshe might turn into a vampire herself! List of characters ;Kiyo Katsuragi :A very beautiful girl who inherits her grandmother's old mansion. As soon as she moves in, she finds out that there are two vampires living there: Kuroboshi and Alshu. At first, Kiyo and Kuroboshi's relationship was a flirt-and-hit relationship, but later on in the manga, Kiyo slowly starts to have feelings for Kuroboshi. Kiyo is a very nice and trusting person, and she often helps out her friends. This confuses Kuroboshi, but it makes him admire her more. Later on, she decides to take on a part-time job to earn some money since both Alshu and Kuroboshi are unemployed. Her feelings for him flutter from admiration to annoyance and then to a bit of a crush. When Sou-kun returns, she feels that she must hide Kuroboshi's vampiric nature from him, especially since his sword can already detect evil auras. However, this causes Kuroboshi to grow jealous and eventually leads him to bite her. Sou-kun witnesses this and finds out that he is a vampire. She does not feel anything toward Sou but friendship, and when she is ready to accept the position of Kuroboshi's bride, Sou-kun warns her that there is a chance she will become a vampire if she does. This makes her very unsure and thus, Kuroboshi thinks she does not want to stay with him. He ignores her until the play, when he confesses his true feelings. Kiyo is touched and she kisses him right then, sealing their bride contract. They end up together, but Sou still promises to be her guard since Kuroboshi is so weak - only being hit by the back of his sword and then unable to walk afterward. ;Kuroboshi :A very handsome dhampir (half-human, half- vampire) who lived in the old mansion Kiyo inherited. As soon as he sees Kiyo he starts flirting with her and calling her his \\"bride\\". It is unknown at first if Kuroboshi really likes Kiyo for herself or for her sweet blood. Later though, he is very jealous if Kiyo is near any guy, and if anyone is being mean to her, he retaliates quite fast. He also likes to suck Kiyo's blood (although he does not succeed very often). As the series progresses, his feelings are declared to be serious. When Kiyo is unsure of how she feels about him, he becomes angry and doesn't talk to her till the play. Then, in front of the audience, while in the middle of a battle with Sou-kun, he wholeheartedly declares that with all his body and soul, he loves her. ;Alshu :A very handsome vampire who is serving Kuroboshi. He is very carefree and appears only moments before Kuroboshi and Kiyo are about to kiss or propose to each other. He also has a violent side, only provoked if someone attacks his master. ;Minako :Kiyo's deceased grandmother who took in Kuroboshi and Alshu when they were wandering and homeless. She is said to have given Kuroboshi the feeling of 'warmth' during his childhood. Kuroboshi was ostracized by the vampires because he was half vampire, half human. Minako-sama was hinted to look somewhat like Kiyo herself, and also have similar personality traits. ;Sou Mizukami :Kiyo's childhood friend who trains in the mountains. He came down from his training to see Kiyo again-this time to protect her. This is because in the past, he was a cowardly boy, always relying on Kiyo to repel evil spirits (exorcism). He admired her strength and vowed to be stronger in order to return the favor. His sword detects any evil aura-and sure enough, whenever Kuroboshi is around, his sword detects it. He proclaims himself Kiyo's bodyguard when he learns that Kuroboshi is a vampire. He fights Kuroboshi during the Romeo and Juliet play, and he still claims his position as bodyguard because he claims that Kuroboshi is weak. VolumesReception The series ranked 9th in About.com 2009 Readers Poll for Best New Sh≈çjo Manga. However, Carlo Santos of Anime News Network and Connie C. of Pop Culture Shock were not that positive on their reviews. Santos said \\"The main characters are generally appealing and the chemistry works, but the overall execution falls flat\\", citing the frequency of vampiric neck-biting as the main drawback‚Äîwhich led him to consider it \\"just mindless formulaic fanservice\\". Connie C. criticized the two main characters as stereotypical and its plot for using \\"a few terrible shojo plot devices\\". Nevertheless, she appreciated the development of their romantic relationship, which attracted her to read the second volume. Connie C. and Santos dubbed the art as \\"confusing\\" and \\"mess\\" respectively, although she said the panel layouts \\"tend to muddy up the flow of the page\\", while he affirmed that it \\"help to keep the story moving at a decent clip, and the elegant sense of character design guarantees some attractive visuals\\".

I was a little disappointed that such common plot devices were used in this volume ..., but I really didn't expect too much from the series otherwise. The main draw is the adorable (if shallow) romance between Kiyo and Kuroboshi.

Variants of this name include Van Oosterhout[nb] and Van Osterhout. According to the 2010 United States Census, it ranks as the 13,330th most common name out of 160,975 last names, occurring 2288 times in the sampled data.2010 United States Census Dutch history The Osterhouts were a noble Dutch family and were Dutch royalty. They are believed to have been knights. In the providence of North Brabant is a national park of of woods. In 1324, William Van Duivenvoorde built a fortified castle just east of the woods. He died in 1352 and was buried in a cloister in Brussels. His castle took on the name of East of the Woods, which in their tongue is Ooster-ter-hout, and there the name began. Around the castle grew up the city of Oosterhout. Southwest of it is the city of Breda, a manufacturing center. The two cities are now grown together, the city of Oosterhout being the high class residential part. The Dutch family name Osterhout is classified as being of habitation name origin. This term denotes names whose origin lies in the place of residence of the initial bearer of his family. Habitation names tell us whence hailed the progenitor of the family; they can give the location of the residence of the initial bearer, and some will even indicate a distinguishing sign which was associated with that residence. In the case of the family name Osterhout, the application can be traced to the community of Oosterhout, which lies in the vicinity of Breda in the Dutch providence of Noord-Branbant. The feudal domain of Oosterhout is mentioned in a document from the year 1199 wherein Beatrix van Strijen, who then controlled the property, made a grant of ten percent of its revenues to the chapter of the Knights Templar based in Brida. Serious damage was done to the church, council chamber, and private residences during the Dutch war for independence from Spain (1568 - 1648). While many Dutch family names have been in existence for hundreds of years, particularly among the nobility and merchant classes, the use of heredity surnames amongst the more isolated rural population has only been established within the last two hundred years. =Coat of arms= The Osterhout coat of arms is officially documented in Rietstap's Armorial General. The original description of the arms or shield is as follows: When translated, the blazon also describes the original colors of the Osterhout arms: \\"Silver, 3 black crescents; a narrow red band place diagonally over all.\\" Above the shield and helmet is the crest, which is described as: \\"A plume of black rooster feathers issuing from a silver pipe; above the crest is the war cry \\"Duivenvoorde\\". U.S. pilgrimage There are many branches of the Oosterhout family, with the first having started with Jan Jansen Van OosterhoutFlorence Prehn, Ulster County Genealogical Society (Ulster County, N.Y.) Descendants of Jan Jansen Van Oosterhout - Osterhoudt - Osterhout; Ulster County Genealogical Society, 1998 who immigrated to Kingston, New York in the 1650s. His descendants initially settled in the states of New England with later branches eventually appearing in most U. S. States and Canada. Another branch of the Osterhout family is believed to have immigrated to the United States in the early 20th century. A branch of the Oosterhout family from Joure, Haskerland, Friesland, Netherlands immigrated to Texas in 1922.

There is also a upper falls, a few hundred feet upstream, which is much lesser known. The falls, fed by Fall Creek (a tributary of Pescadero Creek) starts by cascading down a mossy, 8 foot (2.4m) upper tier into a small pool. The creek continues downstream between grassy banks, and before long, falls over the more well known, 6 foot (1.8 m) lower tier. The lower tier empties into a round pool approximately 6‚Äù deep, before the creek cascades over sticks and rocks and continues its way downstream. Description Tip Toe Falls is located in a redwood forest, on a short and steep tributary of Pescadero Creek. Its two tiers tumble over 8 and 6 feet (2.4 and 1.8 m) into shallow pools. The upper tier cascades out of dense undergrowth and forest, down a mossy cliff wall into a small and shallow pool. Near the bottom, the upper falls splits into two around a fallen log. Between the upper falls and the main falls, the creek winds through a small, fern- bounded meadow at the bottom of a steep ravine with mossy rock walls that rise over 50 feet (15m) above the canyon floor. The creek then drops over the main falls, which pours out of a small gully that resembles a hanging valley,Tiptoe Falls - Andey's Waterfall Photos while a small trickle of water splits off towards the right bank and drops along with the main cascade into a round, rock-bound clear pool. The creek exits the pool in a small congregation of rocks.Shaffer, Chris. The Definitive Guide to Waterfalls of Central and Southern California. Shafdog Publications, 2005. Access Tip Toe Falls is accessed by the Iverson Trail, which begins at the park visitor center. Iverson Trail begins on the north side of the Nature Center. The Sequoia Nature Trail begins on the south side of the Nature Center and eventually meets the Iverson Trail. The trail eventually comes to the mouth of Fall Creek, and a narrow side trail winds upstream. The side trail soon comes to the end of the canyon, where two rock walls slope down in a ‚ÄúV‚Äù shape and form the low cliff that Tip Toe Falls pours over. To access the upper falls, one must scramble up the right side of Tip Toe Falls. (The left side is more wet and mossy, and is thus more dangerous to climb.) After walking upstream along the bed of Fall Creek, the upper falls is found on the left of the canyon, obscured by several fallen trees. If trying to get there, one must be careful as mosquitos are commonly found there, especially around the month of April.

The station serves the town of Werris Creek and was built between 1877 and 1880. The station is also known as Werris Creek Railway Station, yard group and movable relics. The property was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. History The story of the railway line across Parry Shire began in the early 1870s when the construction of the Great Northern Line had stalled at the foot of the Liverpool Plains. From 1876 the line pressed on over the range and down onto the plains below. It was in 1877 that the parliament of Sydney decided to build a branch line from the major rail trunk in the direction of Gunnedah. The branch was to start in an open paddock owned by John Single near Werris Creek, and thus the town of Werris Creek had its beginning. It was the first railway town in New South Wales starting from a broad-acre site and developing exclusively to service the railways. It remained a railway town for the next century and a quarter, with railway work being the overwhelming form of employment. The original station at Werris Creek was about half a kilometer south of the current junction. However, with the opening of the line to Gunnedah and the splitting of the mail trains from Newcastle at Werris creek, it was necessary to have a station nearer to the actual branching line. The platform of the new station was finished in 1879. From the new platform was to rise a magnificent station complex. It was to be a remarkable building that could easily grace a city, a monument to railway confidence and bureaucratic power, yet, incongruously, a lonely citadel in the middle of the bush. The station consisted of a refreshment room and station building. On completion of these two buildings in 1885, a town began to develop on the eastern side of the railway line. In 1925, the office of the District Superintendent of Railways was moved from Murrurundi to Werris Creek and a second story was added to the station building to accommodate new staff. Werris Creek remained an important rail junction until the advent of diesel and electric trains in the 1960s. Together with the decline in rail travel and freight, and the economic rationalising of the 1980s and 1990s, the town of Werris Creek lost much of its importance as a railway hub.EJE, 2001 Werris Creek was a purpose- built rail centre and as such, claims to be Australia's first specific railway town. It dates to 1877 when the NSW Government decided that the Great Northern Line needed a depot and junction from where branches would run to the west and north-west, thus helping to open up and serve the rich pastoral areas further inland. Werris Creek became a major junction, with the Main Northern, Mungindi and Binnaway lines all intersecting in the region. It was the first, and remains the last, railway town in New South Wales. In 1913, a locomotive depot opened with a roundhouse built in 1920. An isolated bushland spot was chosen where the northern line at that time cut through George Single's paddock, halfway between Quirindi and Tamworth. This was called Werris Creek, a variation on the Aboriginal name for the district, Weia Weia, meaning \\"stop here, rest awhile\\". The town became the busiest rural freight base in the state as well as a key passenger junction as goods and people alike joined or left the main Sydney line destined to or coming from places like Gunnedah, Narrabri, Moree and many similar settlements that were emerging. By the early 1880s a magnificent railway station had appeared at Werris Creek. The NSW State Rail Authority Heritage Unit described it as \\"a remarkable building that could easily grace a city ...yet, incongruously, a lonely citadel in the middle of the bush\\". It boasted an impressive refreshment room in the Victorian Free Classical style built of rich, red bricks in tuck-pointed Flemish bond with crisp stucco embellishments, pronounced cornices with paired brackets and moulded, grouped windows. A grand (red) cedar staircase led to a floor of bedrooms for those travellers who had time to sleep between connections. It was \\"not unlike a city bank...until it was covered with its first of many layers of soot\\". The late 1880s heritage-listed station building was designed by John Whitton and is the third largest in New South Wales. In 1896 a locomotive shed formerly in use in Gunnedah was erected opposite the station. In 1917, a 10 stall roundhouse was erected one kilometre south of the station, with a further five stalls added in 1920. In November 1954, the turntable was replaced by a example to allow 60 class locomotives to be turned.\\"Locomotive Depot No 9: Werris Creek\\" Roundhouse July 1986 pages 4-28 Eventually a cross-country line was built from Binnaway near Coonabarabran to Werris Creek, thus linking the northern line to both the Main Western and Main Southern, lines. The population soared to 2,500 as workers flocked to staff and service the countless trains that came and went day and night and Werris Creek became known as the \\"town that never sleeps\\". For approximately 70 years Werris Creek was the largest railway centre in northern New South Wales, the depot alone employing 800 people. From the 1970s, the railway began to decline, but it still remains an important part of the network, with Pacific National still using the depot. The introduction of diesel locomotives and centralisation of the rail system led to the demise of the complex's importance. The jobs of tradesmen servicing steam trains disappeared. The population halved as rail jobs fell from 800 to 100. Town morale sank as its heart and soul began to disappear. Even though passenger and freight trains still passed through Werris Creek, as they still do, it seemed destined to become yet another country town fading into oblivion. =Monument and museum= In 1989 a committee led by Chris Holley - a former porter, shunter, guard and controller, strongly supported by a band of fellow retired railmen such as veteran yard master Les Brown - vowed that Werris Creek would not die. Their determination led to the acceptance of a plan envisaged by Dr Stuart Sharp, of the former NSW State Rail Authority Heritage Unit, involving creation of an Australian Railway Monument. The high stainless steel sculptures this comprises depict a fettler, shunter and firemen, a signalman, gatekeeper and flag lady. The sculptor is Dominique Sutton who also worked on Sydney Olympic Park. They look down on a specially landscaped amphitheatre beside the railway station. Memorial walls complement the amphitheatre and contain more than 2,400 names of all those railway people who had lost their lives either at work or from injuries received at work. While funding came principally from the NSW Government ($1.3m), some 40 townsfolk - mostly former railway men and women pledged themselves as volunteers to run the complex. It opened on 1 October 2005 as the Australian Railway Monument and the Rail Journeys Museum and since has averaged more than 10,000 visitors per annum. The museum contains a wide range of memorabilia depicting country railways' past and in the future aims to present a comprehensive account of Australia's railway history.Dunn, 2009, 98-9 An historic display depicts the history of Werris Creek as the first railway town in Australia from the age of steam through to the modern day diesel. Services Werris Creek is served by NSW TrainLink's daily Northern Tablelands Xplorer service. The service from Sydney divides south of the station before continuing to Armidale and Moree.

The original facades of the 1885 buildings remain largely intact. The facade expresses the load bearing-wall construction of painted stone and a rich red face brickwork. Brickwork is Flemish bond with white tuck pointing. All stone quoins and timber detailing are painted in a golden yellow. Most windows on both buildings are double hung with single panes of glass. Original doors remain and are generally four - panelled timber doors with fanlights, and stone architraves. A parapet conceals the roof of the original RRR building and features a decorative entablature, two urns and a projecting cornice with classical consoles. A timber verandah with simple timber detailing and timber balustrade is also located on the southern entry to the RRR building. A deep verandah roofed in corrugated sheet runs along the rail platforms and along the east and west elevation of the station building. The verandah was extended in 1892 along the east of the RRR building. The verandah features decorative timber rafters supported on slender round cast iron columns with cast iron brackets. The first floor storey extension of the kitchen in the 1911 building and the 1960 southern extension to the station building use a similar red brick. The roof is a simple half gabled (gabled hip) roof with exposed rafter. The first floor storey extensions of the station building in 1923 and 1939 are of a Georgian revival style and use a different light brown brick. The roof is concealed by a simple geometric parapet. A later fibro sheet bridge connects the two buildings. Interior fabric of both buildings have been largely altered. An original timber staircase, cast iron columns, and timber ceiling remain intact in the RRR building. SIGNAL BOX (1925) The signal box is a simple timber structure with rusticated weatherboards and a simple gable roof. The northern facade features a single timber panelled door. The other three facades feature three-paned timber sliding windows with a three-paned fanlight. Internally the signal box retains signal equipment and the manual switch for the railway tracks. PLATFORM (1880) STATION MASTER'S RESIDENCE (1913) The SM's residence was most likely built for the night Station Master in 1913. The building is a simple Federation gable-roofed weatherboard cottage that features simple detailing and a front verandah on the north side. The residence has double hung multi-pane windows, timber window awnings and decorative timber valances at the ends of the verandah. It also has modern pipe columns in the place of the original timber verandah posts. A later fibro sheet extension has been added to the western facade. Much of the original interior detail remains intact, such as timber doors, architraves, cornices and fireplaces. FOOTBRIDGE (1893) A simple girder structure made from old rails. Its main feature is the joining of the old rails head to head so the rail feet form flanges (I-beams). MOVEABLE ITEMS Wall clock, large, 0.5/2.4/0.3, (AC02) refreshment room Seat, 1.8/0.9/0.9, (LA03) refreshment room Rotating chair patterned seat, (CA05), platform store Rotating chair patterned seat, (CA06), platform store Office desk, 1.5/1.0/0.7, recessed handles, (DA07), refreshment room. LANDSCAPE The area to the north of the RRR today comprises the Australian Railway Monument, a bitumen-paved car park and an Australian native plant garden on the eastern (main platform) side. The plant types in the garden include a predominance of grevilleas. This new garden has been developed over the past decade with volunteer labour. = Condition = As at 19 August 2009, (Railway Monument & landscaping proposal) According to the Statement of Heritage Impact (2004) and the Archaeological Assessment (2004), the site has the potential to contain disturbed archaeological deposits of unknown, but potentially low-moderate significance. The potential for intact, undetected sub-surface deposits relating to indigenous occupation is considered to be low. The station buildings have a high level of integrity and retain a good level of intactness with some modifications in recent decades (including for example changes to the refreshment room for use as a museum). As a precinct, Werris Creek is an outstanding intact place. = Modifications and dates = *1877 the location of the original station was about half a kilometer south of the current junction.

Heritage listing  Werris Creek is a large Victorian station complex with a major freight and locomotive facility which developed because of its location at the junction of the main north line with the north west branch. The town developed to support the railway facility and the grandness of the facilities reflects the importance of the railway in the area. The present station building is the second on this site and was built in 1880, 2 years after the railway opened. It is architecturally significant as it comprises a collection of major non standard buildings laid out in the junction of the two lines giving an unusual and unique platform and building arrangement. It is also of high architectural interest for the quality of the design and detail and of townscape importance because of its dominance in the town and its incongruity in the location. The relationship of other facilities such as roundhouse and miscellaneous support facilities adds to the significance of the site. Some of the adjacent buildings to the station date from the opening of the railway and are interesting remnants of workshops and support facilities that have rarely survived on the system.Havenhand & Mather Pty Ltd, 2001 The Werris Creek Railway Station is significant to the community for social and cultural reasons. Its significance lies in its history and the role it played in the development of not only Werris Creek but also Parry Shire. It was the centre of the peripheral development of an entire city and also those surrounding rural communities that depended upon it for transport, communication and trade. Furthermore, It is an impressive structure in the Victorian Free Classical Style, with lavish design qualities that earn it high aesthetic significance. Lastly, it is representative of the importance railways played in the transport and communication for rural communities (Heritage Study). Significant for its dominant effect on the streetscape and character of the town, for its elaborate detail and for its architectural quality.RNE, 1978 Werris Creek railway station was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Werris Creek railway precinct is significant for its historical values as a tangible link to the development of the Great Northern Railway (GNR) line during the 19th century as well as the development of the NSW railways generally. The GNR was an important achievement in transport and engineering within NSW. As the third main trunk rail route in NSW stretching from Sydney to the Queensland border, the line linked townships to one another as well as to Sydney leading to significant economic and social impacts for those individual townships as well as for NSW more generally. Werris Creek Railway Precinct is significant as a major junction on the northern NSW railway system. From 1877 trains travelling north could follow the Great Northern Railway line to the Queensland border via Werris Creek or they could branch off to Gunnedah (and eventually Moree) at Werris Creek. The junction became highly significant as a place where passengers and goods were transhipped, where trains and crews changed and where passengers stopped for refreshments. The small town, which developed out of nothing to be a significant railway service centre, where many families were sustained by the income derived from railway related employment. The scale and grandeur of some of the buildings reflects the importance given to this location by railway authorities in the late 19th century. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. Werris Creek Railway Precinct is significant for its association with John Whitton, \\"father\\" of the NSW Railways, and his colleagues and successors. The place is a fine example of late nineteenth century railway architecture. It therefore stands as a monument to Whitton's elegant vision for a substantial railway building at Werris Creek. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Werris Creek Railway Precinct is significant as one of the largest and best examples of highly intact Victorian and Federation railway architecture in NSW. The precinct is significant for its high quality of design, detailing and its unique setting at the junction of two railway lines. It demonstrates refined taste and competent detailing, especially in the two- storey railway refreshment rooms. Recent works to the place have recovered aspects of significance such as the large refreshment room with its high ceilings and cast iron columns. The works have been researched in detail to enable the authentic values of the RRR to be conserved. The place makes an important contribution to the townscape of Werris Creek. It includes extant evidence of the passenger station, railway refreshment rooms, gas and power plants and other items including staff cottages and nearby sheds and a locomotive depot. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Werris Creek developed as a \\"railway town\\" and throughout much of its history most or all residents of the town were either directly employed by the railways or had close links to the railways. Many residents in the town are still involved in the rail industry, are retired railway employees, and/or are volunteers at the museum. Werris Creek is home to the Australian Railway Monument (a memorial for railway employees throughout Australia who were killed at work) and to the \\"Rail Journeys\\" museum which is located in the former refreshment room. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The place has some potential to reveal information about rail travel generally and about the design and operation of refreshments rooms and major country stations particularly with the ability to interpret this to the public in association with the present museum. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The arrangement and scale of the station buildings on the junction platform is unusual. Few locations have buildings of this scale (other examples include Junee and Moss Vale). The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Werris Creek Railway Precinct is significant as it demonstrates the principal characteristics of nineteenth-century railway places. It has intact evidence of the passenger station and railway refreshment rooms. The SM's residence has local significance as an example of the standard of housing provided to railway employees in the early part of the twentieth century.

Believing he is dying, and wanting to help out, John suggests that he and Mickey get married, planning on leaving her his fortune so that she can marry who she wants when he's gone. On their honeymoon, with Henry along as a chaperone, the couple fall in love for real, although, of course, they don't realize it right away. Eventually, John bests the Prince in a duel, Henry and Juno get engaged, and John and Mickey get to stay together.TCM Full synopsisBrennan, Sandra Plot synopsis (Allmovie) Cast * Martha Raye as Mickey Hawkins * Bob Hope as John Kidley * Andy Devine as Henry Munch * Alan Mowbray as Prince Smirnov * Gale Sondergaard as Juno Marko * Sig Ruman as Poppa Ingleborg * Ernest Cossart as Jeepers * Paul Harvey as Jasper Hawkins *Frances Arms as Momma Ingleborg *Ivan F.

Early years and education Thomas was born 3 May 1630 at Dunkerton, Somerset. He was the only son of Richard Rosewell (d. 1640) of Dunkerton, gentleman, and Grace Melborne (d. 1646). Thomas was raised by his uncle, James Rosewell, of Combe Hay, Somerset and attended King Edward's School, Bath. In 1645 he was sent to London to learn to be a silk-weaver. In 1646 a distant relation (father-in-law of first cousin), Humphrey Chambers, one of the Westminster Divines, and his first cousin, Reverend Walter Rosewell, persuaded James to educate him for the ministry. Thomas entered Pembroke College, Oxford in 1648 where he graduated B.A. in 1651. Relations The ancestors of Thomas Rosewell came from Bradford-on- Tone, Somerset. Richard Rowswell (d.1543) married Alice Ceelie (Seeley) of North Curry. They had one daughter and four sons: Joanne married Thomas Foreaker of Bradford; John Rowswell married Agnes Dyer of Wincanton, sister of Sir James Dyer; William Rosewell (1499-1568) purchased the manor of High Littleton and lived at Dunkerton; Rev. Adam Rosewell (d. 1567) was vicar of Orcheston St George, Clevedon and Shepton Mallet; and a fourth son, also named William Rosewell (d. 1570), held land at Loxton and Compton Bishop. William Rosewell of Loxton was the father of William Rosewell, Solicitor General to Queen Elizabeth I and they jointly purchased the manor of Yarlington, Somerset.

Thomas Rosewell (1630-1692) Marriages Thomas married (1) Susannah Strickland (d. 1661) daughter of John Strickland of Salisbury, Wiltshire on 29 May 1656 and (2) a widow, Anne Godsalve (n√©e Wanley) on 9 Jan 1677. He had three children by his first wife: Susannah; Elizabeth; and Margaret, who married the Nonconformist bookseller John Lawrence; and four by the second: Susannah; Rhoda; Samuel; and Eliezer. Career and ministries In 1652 he took the post of tutor to the nephew of John Dodridge at Weare Gifford, Devon. He was presented to the rectory of Rode, Somerset by the widow of Sir Edward Hungerford in May 1653 and was ordained at Salisbury in 1654 by the Presbyterians John Strickland rector of Salisbury, Wiltshire and Peter Ince rector of Donhead St Andrew, Wiltshire. He exchanged ministries for Sutton Mandeville, Wiltshire in 1657 in order for his wife to be nearer to her father in Salisbury. He was ejected by the uniformity act in 1662 and became, in 1663, chaplain and tutor in Lady Hungerford's family at Corsham, Wiltshire. He suffered a slight mental disturbance in 1671 and moved as tutor to the family of Thomas Grove of Ferne near Berwick St John, Wiltshire. He developed depression and went to live in the house of Luke Rugeley, M.D. from October 1673 to February 1674 when he was completely recovered. During his life, Thomas Rosewell published two books: An Answer unto Thirty Questions Propounded by the Quakers (1656) and The Causes and Cure of the Pestilence (1665). On 5 May 1674 he was elected as Nonconformist minister at Rotherhithe, Surrey. Tried for treason His fame rests on his sensational trial for high treason in 1684. In a sermon preached on 14 September that year Rosewell allegedly declared that 'we have had two wicked kings now together who have suffered popery to be introduced under their noses...'. He was arrested on 18 September and was tried in Westminster Hall by \\"Hanging\\" Judge Jeffries. The charge against him, that of treasonable preaching pointing to the king's death, was absurdly at variance with the whole of his previous character and known opinions. Thomas conducted his own defence and argued over the meaning of the charges written in Latin compared to the English words that he actually used. Evidence against him was tendered by three women of disreputable character, one of whom admitted that she had been paid to collect evidence. It is not clear from their sworn testimony whether they wilfully distorted his words or mistook his meaning. Despite clear counter-evidence presented by numerous witnesses, the jury, directed by Jeffreys, found him guilty of treason for which the penalty would have been death by beheading. However, he was not sentenced. When he came for sentence on 24 November, he argued his exception to the indictment as being deficient in the English interpretation of the original Latin. Jeffries acceded to Thomas's appeal for Counsel to argue a case about the sentence but would not agree to provide a copy of the indictment. Jeffries took Counsel's argument under consideration and released Thomas on bail. His arrest and conviction had shocked and enraged Presbyterians and Anglicans alike. On 28 January 1685 Charles II granted him a pardon, having been told by Sir John Talbot: \\"If your majesty suffers this man to die, we are none of us safe in our houses\\". The whole proceedings of this trial was reported and is referred to in more recent works on the proper conduct of trial by jury. Death He died at Bermondsey, Surrey on 14 Feb 1692 and was buried at Bunhill Fields, London. The funeral service was conducted by three Presbyterian and three Independent ministers. Mathew Mead, Independent minister of Stepney, preached his funeral sermon. Rosewell's grave in Bunhill Fields. The original headstone was inscribed in Latin. Some time later, a new headstone was erected at the rear of the original and it was inscribed with an English translation of the Latin text as follows: Here is buried THOMAS ROSEWELL a most distinguished divine. Born at Dunkerton in the county of Somerset: A graduate of Pembroke College, Oxford: Who administered the sacraments first at Rode in the aforesaid county: Then in the town of Sutton Mandeville in the county of Wiltshire until St Bartholomew's day in the year 1662: Finally he was appointed pastor of the church at Rotherhithe near London in the county of Surrey. A man no less esteemed for his piety and modesty than for his learning; a preacher outstanding in skill, eloquence and zeal; an assiduous and most expert interpreter of Holy Scripture.

It tells the story of Augustus, emperor of Rome, from his youth through old age.[1] The book is divided into two parts, the beginning chronicling his rise to power, the latter describing his rule thereafter, and the familial problems faced choosing a successor. Williams and Augustus shared the 1973 U.S. National Book Award for Fiction with John Barth and Chimera, the first time the award was split, and the only one of Williams's four novels to receive significant acclaim within his lifetime.  Plot  Born Gaius Octavius Thurinus, the young future-emperor was adopted by his great-uncle, Julius Caesar, after demonstrating promising wit and skill. After his great-uncle's assassination, Augustus (at this time known as Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus) took vengeance upon Caesar's murderers, and through tactical political moves, became one of Rome's three \\"Triumvirs\\" alongside Marc Antony and Marcus Aemilius Lepidus. After defeating the other two triumvirs, and obtaining sole power over the Roman State, Augustus (known as \\"Imperator\\" Caesar Divi Filius), began taking measures to secure and increase his power. As a result, Augustus gave orders to exterminate Cleopatra's teenaged son, allegedly commenting, \\"too many Caesars is no good thing.\\" (As it was the common belief that her son was of Julius Caesar's bloodline.) In light of such orders, Cleopatra and Marc Antony‚Äîlovers at the time‚Äîcommitted suicide. The later part of the novel focuses more on Augustus's rule. It details his official renaming by the Roman Senate (augustus: one to be revered), his contention with and banishment of his daughter, Julia, for her various extramarital affairs, and closes with a final note from (the fictional) Augustus himself.  Major themes  The major theme Augustus addresses is the ability of circumstances to change the personality and behavior of a person. The conditions that surrounded Augustus's rise to power plagued Ancient Rome with violence and contention, which led to Augustus working hard to implement a time of peace and cooperation in Rome, commonly referred to as the Pax Romana or the Pax Augusta. Other themes Williams writes on in his novel include coming of age and the difference between restraint and resignation. Background Augustus is the last work Williams published before his death in 1994. Though Augustus garnered little public recognition while Williams was alive, the critical reception of the work was generally positive. Augustus is different from Williams's other works in that it is his only piece in which the main character is not named William. In addition, it is his first novel that takes place outside of the United States.  Critical reception  Augustus was received with general positivity from critics across the country. Augustus garnered so much critical respect that it won the National Book Award in 1973. Williams and Augustus shared the 1973 U.S. National Book Award for Fiction with John Barth and Chimera, the first time the award was split. Critics such as Harold Augenbraum discuss the split award in their work, saying that this was the first time the fiction award was split and also discussing that the 1973 National Book Awards allowed many categories to split the awards. Both the Los Angeles Review of Books and the New York Review of Books offered positive criticism, particularly about the fusion of biography and fiction. Reviewer Daniel Mendelsohn of the New York Review of Books wrote that \\"the life of the first emperor is an ideal vehicle for a historical novel: Augustus is a figure about whom we know at once a great deal and very little, and hence invites both description and invention\\". Critics overwhelmingly praised the narrative of Augustus while critiquing the lack of speaking time Williams gives the title character. Overall, most critics praised Williams for forgoing his own personal voice to relay characters that are historical with personalities Williams imagines for himself and his audience.

Billy has a hard time adjusting to life in Vermont and has trouble making friends. While shopping at the mall after school one day, Billy stumbles upon a ramshackle petting zoo, where the animals are kept in poor conditions. After seeing a small pony with a horn taped to its head and finding out that it is about to be sold for slaughter, Billy instead makes a deal with the zoo keeper and buys the pony. Once Billy takes the pony home, he cleans her up and cares for her. The pony appears to be pregnant and eventually foals, under the watchful eye of Billy and his friend Carolyn. The pony's foal grows a horn and turns out to be a unicorn, who grows at a tremendous rate. Billy names the colt Nico from the letters found in the word \\"unicorn\\". One day, while Billy is at school, a mountain lion comes to attack the pony and the foal in the stable. The pony sacrifices herself for the well- being of her colt, and she is killed by the mountain lion. Billy and his mother later bury the pony on their land. That night, magic descends upon the stable, and in the morning, Billy discovers that Nico has become full grown. Carolyn visits later in the day and tells Billy that he could charge people to see Nico and help his mother, Julie, earn money for her to go to school. Billy is annoyed at this and he and Carolyn argue making Carolyn storm off back into town, where she meets Bruce and Mark who make fun of Billy for saying he has a unicorn. Carolyn, defends Billy by telling them she has seen Nico, before quickly denying it when Bruce becomes too interested. The group doesn't believe Carolyn, but decides to pull a hoax instead for the paper, and plan to take a picture of Nico with a fake horn. They make an offer with the local news reporter Cecil who is looking for a big story, that if they provide proof of a unicorn, Cecil will pay them a hundred thousand dollars. Cecil agrees thinking they are making it up. Meanwhile, Carolyn has cycled on ahead to warn Billy, who immediately packs his bag to take Nico to safety up on Big Rock at the top of a dangerous mountain. Bruce and friends arrive before he leaves, and ask Billy where Nico is, when Billy refuses to say Bruce pushes Billy down, and Nico comes out of the bushes and goes to attack Bruce. Bruce panics crying out for Billy to help which Billy does, before Bruce and Mark take pictures of Nico and run away. Billy decides now that he has to take Nico away before people take Nico away from him, and tells Carolyn to tell his mother where Billy has gone. Bruce manages to convince Cecil with the photos of Nico, who immediately calls 'his people', Cecil also tells the owner of the diner, Joe and it is also where Billy's mother works, Julie hears about the story and goes home where Carolyn tells her where Billy has gone, worried about Billy's leg and his safety Julie sets out after him on Carolyn's bike. By now the local police are involved too, led by Julie's boyfriend, Deputy Pete, who are more focused on rescuing Julie and Billy from the dangerous mountain. Having not gotten very far, Julie soon catches up to Billy, who is discarding his leg cast so he can ride Nico bareback, something that could confine him to a wheelchair if he has a bad fall. Billy pleads with his mother to give him a chance, and to lead the police away from him. Eventually Julie agrees and leaves back down the mountain where she meets with the police, who are prepared to search the mountain by horseback, Julie tells them she knows where Billy is and leads them in the wrong direction until Carolyn, who does not know that Billy asked Julie to lead them astray, says she has never been to Big Rock which is where Billy is going. Julie confesses to leading them the wrong way and the whole group turn around. With his mother leading the others away, Billy eventually reaches the top of Big Rock where he and Nico are stuck at the edge of a cliff, behind him a news helicopter lands to take pictures, and Billy and Nico flee but before they can escape, the police, Julie and Carolyn arrive on their horses. Nico turns and runs toward the cliff before jumping and flies over the gap and lands on the other side. On the other side is a desert like terrain where Nico takes Billy inside a cave, he dismounts Nico and finds cave drawings of unicorns on the walls, when there is a gold glowing light which takes Nico and Billy to a paradise like land, where Nico lives and Billy's leg is healed, enabling him to walk and run properly again. Whilst taking a drink from the water there, Billy sees his mother's sad face in the reflection and knows he has to go back, he says goodbye to Nico for the final time before he goes back through the cave, where his mother and everyone is waiting for him on the desert terrain, having flown over in the helicopter. Billy hugs his mother and Cecil, with a camera, interrogates him about the unicorn to which Billy looks straight into the camera and says, \\"What unicorn? Everyone knows unicorns don't exist.\\" Leaving Cecil storyless and returning home with his healed leg and mother.

Some of Shirley's earlier works were published by Kentucky Foundation for Women's literary journal The American Voice. Life Aleda Shirley received fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts, the Mississippi Arts Commission, and the Kentucky Arts Council. Her poems appeared in such places as The American Poetry Review, Kenyon Review, Poetry, and Virginia Quarterly Review. At her death in June 2008 she lived in Jackson, Mississippi. Her debut book of poems, Chinese Architecture, (University of Georgia Press), won the Poetry Society of America‚Äôs Norma Farber First Book Award in 1987. As Library Journal stated: ‚ÄúThe polished, controlled surfaces of the poems in this artful first collection belie what lies beyond: a passionate dialogue of antagonists‚Äîparents and child, lover and deceiver, silence and speech, light and dark. ... Shirley pays close attention to craft, and her language resonates with an honesty and openness to experience that is both seductive and refreshing.‚Äù Shirley‚Äôs second poetry collection, Long Distance, received the following starred review in the September 30, 1996, issue of Publishers Weekly: ‚ÄúThe idea that ‚ÄòAmerica may always be more a passage than a place‚Äô is explored with kaleidoscopic resonance and cut-glass clarity in this moving second collection by Mississippi poet Shirley. . . . Throughout, both time and space are evocatively shape-shifting dimensions, as when, on a drive through Oklahoma, ‚ÄòThat road seemed like the future: an emptiness / that could turn, at any moment, into beauty.‚Äô With a seemingly common first-person speaker throughout, these poems invoke love, its loss and an ever-shadowing solitude against an ever-shifting setting (from dusty Texas to the eerily romantic, poolside setting of ‚ÄòTropical Deco‚Äô). Shirley grounds the numinous in palpable detail (a poem about the Mexican Day of the Dead describes ‚Äò. . .the rooms rich with the smell of bread, pan de los muertos, / lemon-colored loaves shaped in the swelling oval / of a human soul‚Äô). Reminiscent of poems of the late Richard Hugo, Shirley‚Äôs measured lyric language and seamless craftsmanship reveal the offroad intimacies and profundities of the American landscape.‚Äù Miami University Press editor James Reiss described his reasons for publishing her second book, Long Distance: ‚ÄúWhat I love about Shirley‚Äôs poems are their accessibility, the way they bring in popular science, Spanish, French en passant, and especially their poignant down-home quality, as if they arise like smoke from hearths in Kentucky (or Mississippi) where single women endure and prevail. F. Scott Fitzgerald wasn‚Äôt entirely accurate when he famously said, ‚ÄòThere are no second acts in American lives.‚Äô Aleda Shirley has disproved him with her brilliant second book.‚Äù Works * Chinese Architecture, 1986 * Long Distance, 1996 * Dark Familiar, 2006  References Category:1955 births Category:2008 deaths Category:American women poets Category:20th-century American poets Category:20th-century American women writers ","title":"Aleda Shirley"},{"id":"17998464","title":"1964 NBA All-Star Game"},{"id":"17998467","title":"1965 NBA All-Star Game"},{"id":"17998470","title":"1966 NBA All-Star Game"},{"id":"17998518","text":"Prostitution in Azerbaijan is illegal but common. Prostitution is an administrative offence and punishable by a fine. Keeping a brothel is a criminal offence and punishable by up to 6 years' imprisonment. In 2017 a draft law proposing to add heavy fines to the punishment for keeping a brothel was before the National Assembly. It has been estimated that there are 25,054 prostitutes in Azerbaijan, some of which are aged 15 to 18. During the Soviet era prostitution was uncommon except for those under the control of the KGB, many of whom were informants. In the Badamdar district of the capital, Baku, there are many cafes where prostitutes solicit clients. In 2011, over 300 local residents held a protest against the situation. Prostitutes can also be found in cafes in Nizami Street (known locally as \\"Torgovaya\\" ‚Äì Trade Street) in downtown Baku. The country is a sex tourism destination, particularly with men from Iran, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait. Sex trafficking Human traffickers exploit domestic and foreign victims in Azerbaijan, and traffickers exploit victims from Azerbaijan abroad. Women and children from Azerbaijan are subjected to sex trafficking within the country and in Iran, Malaysia, Pakistan, Russia, Turkey, and the UAE. Azerbaijan is a destination country for sex trafficking victims from China, Russia, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan. In previous years, Azerbaijan has been used as a transit country for victims of sex trafficking from Central Asia to Iran, Turkey, and the UAE. The 2005 Law on the Fight against Trafficking in Persons and article 144 of the criminal code prohibit sex and lobar trafficking and prescribe penalties of five to ten years' imprisonment. The government investigated twenty-six cases of sexual exploitation in 2018, and convicted 21 sex traffickers, compared to 25 sex traffickers in 2017.

The movie was well received by critics and was a box office success. Plot Set in 1950s Ireland, the film relates the experiences of Bernadette \\"Benny\\" Hogan and her friends: Eve Malone and Nan Mahon. They are characterised during their First Communion: Benny is the beloved and well-fed only child of a tailor with a shop, Eve is the orphan reared by nuns and Nan is destined to be defined by her beauty. They grow up in the small town of Knockglen. Eight years later, Nan has moved to Dublin, and Benny and Eve have graduated from convent school and are heading to Dublin and university. Eve's education is financed by the local landowning Westward Protestant family, who employed her father before his death. She has also been granted one of their estate cottages. She boards at a Dublin convent, while Benny commutes between home and Dublin, her parents being loath to lose her. They wish her to marry the creepy Sean Walsh, her father's employee, to secure the business's future. In Dublin, the two girls reconnect with a mature, sophisticated Nan who is aware of her beauty. Benny falls for Jack Foley, a handsome rugby player and doctor's son studying medicine, though he is not convinced of this career. After the College Ball, they begin a relationship, Eve dates Aidan, a friend of Jack's, and Nan becomes involved with the older Simon Westward, heir to the estate. While Benny resists sex with Jack, Nan does not with Simon, believing he truly loves her. When Benny's father dies, she suspends studies to care for her devastated mother and run the family shop. Sean attempts to woo her. Benny notices funds are missing and suspects Sean is involved but lacks proof. Eve's cottage serves as a party location for the women. Nan and Simon visit it secretly. Nan becomes pregnant and tells Simon, sure he will marry her but Simon says he must marry for money to maintain the family estate. He offers her money for an abortion in England. A desperate Nan seeks Aidan, but runs into Jack, who has not seen Benny since her father's funeral. She convinces him to take her to a party and lures him into sex, later pretending that he got her pregnant. Jack is honourable and offers marriage. He tells Benny and she is devastated. Eve suspects someone is using the cottage after finding a half-burned newspaper. The convent nuns have told her they have seen lights and chimney smoke. Nan suggests the cottage is haunted to conceal her secret meetings. Eve throws another party, which a still devastated Benny attends. Nan, oblivious to the pain she has caused, convinces Jack they should attend, though he feels uneasy about it. Nan seeks out Eve, bringing her presents. An enraged Eve, having guessed Simon fathered Nan's baby, threatens to tell Jack the truth and comes towards Nan waving a bread knife. Nan falls into a glass door, severing an artery and so bleeding profusely. Jack comes to her aid. Benny, seeing them attending to Nan, leaves. Jack tries to contact Benny but she refuses to answer. Though learning of Nan's deception, he escorts her to the station despite her protests that he has no responsibility. She asks for forgiveness and heads to England for her delivery (or an illegal abortion). Curiosity over the fraud leads Benny to search Sean's living area. She finds pornographic pictures of fat women. Sean finds her there and attempts to sexually assault her. She fights him off, then finds the money he has embezzled. She demands he leave or she will call the Garda (police). After Jack sees Nan off, he tries to win Benny back. He explains that aiding Nan made his hesitations over medicine disappear and that he loves her and never loved Nan. Benny tells him his actions have changed her and their relationship and they must take their time. In a voiceover, Benny says Jack addressed his studies and pursued her, while she moved to Dublin to share a flat with Eve. A paper Benny writes causes a stir and starts her career as a writer. In time, she falls in love with Jack again. The final scene shows her taking Jack to Eve's cottage.

The wooden sign posted in front of the house states, \\"Josiah West 1854 Octagon House.\\" It is only one of 19 such structures in the state. Deacon West was a blacksmith in Pewaukee. Octagon houses (and barns) were a brief fad started in the 1850s, claiming to use less building material and less fuel to heat than conventional rectangular floorplans. West built his house on top of the only hill in Pewaukee - three stories tall, with walls of grout - an early form of concrete - covered with plaster. The roof was low- pitched and hipped. With West sold the house to Ira Rowe in 1866, and around 1873 it was partially destroyed by fire, but its strong cement walls remained standing. In 1873 Col. N. P. Inglehart of Kentucky bought the house and rebuilt it more or less in its present form, with the Italianate-styled window frames and bracketed eaves, which were popular by the 1870s, but probably not the original 1850s ornamentation. The roof was crowned with a belvedere, allowing a better view of the lake, village, and the countryside, but it was destroyed in a windstorm in the early 1900s. The house passed through several owners until Margaret Ann Kirley sold the house to her son and current owner, Jeffrey D. Kirley in 1998. It features stucco covered walls and a metal peak in lieu of a cupola. On May 12, 1975, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places. ReferencesExternal links * Dale J.

He is best known for devising a climate classification system in 1948 that is still in use worldwide, and also for his detailed water budget computations of potential evapotranspiration. He was Professor of Climatology at Johns Hopkins University, adjunct professor at Drexel University, President of the Commission for Climatology of the World Meteorological Organization, a recipient of the Outstanding Achievement Award of the Association of American Geographers, and the Cullum Geographical Medal from the American Geographical Society. Life Thornthwaite was born in Bay City, Michigan.Much of this article is derived from a chronology by Charles H. Smith et al. He attended Central Michigan Normal School, graduating in 1922. He taught at high school for the next two years in Owosso, Michigan, then for the next four years he was employed as a geographer for the Kentucky Geological Survey. While there, he also became an assistant professor in the University of Oklahoma Department of Geography, serving there from 1927 to 1934. Meanwhile, he studied geography through the auspices of the University of California, Berkeley, a student of Carl Sauer. In 1930 he received a Ph.D. in geography; his thesis was on \\"Louisville, Kentucky: A Study in Urban Geography\\", a research project which used aerial photographs, field observation, data analysis and detailed mapping to describe the urban geography of Louisville. He moved away from geography to climatology, but recent scholarship suggests he was nonetheless ahead of his time in his thesis project and that many of the techniques he used would later be standard procedures.James O. Wheeler and Stanley D. Brunn, ‚ÄúAn urban geographer before his time: C. Warren Thornthwaite's 1930 doctoral dissertation‚Äù, ‚ÄúProgress in Human Geography‚Äù, Vol. 26, No. 4, 463-486 (2002) At Central Michigan Normal School, Thornthwaite befriended John Leighly. Later, they both studied at Berkeley, with Leighly becoming his mentor. Leighly, a professor at UC Berkeley for 62 years, would write his obituary.Berkeley: The Itinerant Geographer University of California: In Memoriam, 1986: John Leighly, Geography: Berkeley In 1931 Thornthwaite published ‚ÄúThe Climates of North America: According to a New Classification‚Äù,C. W. Thornthwaite, ‚ÄúThe Climates of North America: According to a New Classification‚Äù, Geographical Review, Vol. 21, No. 4 (Oct., 1931), pp. 633-655 which launched his career as a climatologist and married the science of climatology with that of geography. In 1934, he left the University of Oklahoma to study internal migration within the United States at the University of Pennsylvania. In 1935, he was appointed chief of the climatic and physiographic research division of the U.S. Soil Conservation Service in the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The division ceased to function in 1942, but he remained on staff of the USDA until 1946. Included in his output from this period was the USDA technical bulletin, written with Benjamin Holzman, Measurement of Evaporation from Land and Water Surfaces.USDA Technical Bulletin #817. 1942. Leaving government in 1946, Thornthwaite opened the Laboratory of Climatology in Seabrook, New Jersey, which he operated until his death in 1963. The facility continued to operate under the management of John Russell Mather. One of his first papers would also be his most cited: \\"An Approach Toward a Rational Classification of Climate\\" (1948).\\"An Approach Toward a Rational Classification of Climate\\", Geographical Review This paper would be used by scientists across North America and around the world. It incorporates evapotranspiration, temperature and precipitation information and is widely used in studying animal species diversity and potential impacts of climate change. Mather shared authorship with Thornthwaite in their 1955 monograph \\"The Water Balance\\",\\"The water balance\\", Climatology, 8:1-104, 1955. which was Thornthwaite‚Äôs second major contribution to climatology, after Rational Classification. The water budget was a simple and easily used methodology for estimating water surpluses and runoff, and the difference between surpluses and runoff, to estimate the amount of water would recharge an aquifer. Thornthwaite was a professor of climatology at Johns Hopkins University from 1947 to 1955. Personal life Thornthwaite married Denzil Slentz in 1925. They had three daughters. When his wife died in 1962, he established the Charles Warren and Denzil Slentz Thornthwaite Memorial Scholarship Fund in her memory. The fund awards annual merit scholarships to students in meteorology and earth science at Central Michigan University. ReferencesFurther reading * F.

He was Professor Emeritus in the School of the Arts and Media at the University of New South Wales, in Sydney, and continued until shortly before his death to contribute articles and reviews to The Sydney Morning Herald, where he served as principal music critic from 1960 until the late 1990s. Biography Published in 1967, Covell's monograph Australia's Music: Themes of a New Society was the first comprehensive study of the history, development and performance of Western serious (classical) music in Australia, and is now regarded as a seminal text in Australian musicology. It has been widely referenced among succeeding generations of Australian composers, practitioners and critics of serious music, and by Australian cultural historians generally. On Australia Day 1986, Covell was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia in recognition of service to music. Seven years later he was awarded the Pascall Prize for Critical Writing, in recognition of his services to music criticism in Australia. Covell accepted the Long-Term Contribution to the Advancement of Australian Music award at the 2006 Classical Music Awards, presented by the Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA) and the Australian Music Centre, in acknowledgement of his lifetime of distinguished achievement and commitment to Australian music. In February 2013, Covell received the 2013 Sir Bernard Heinze Memorial Award. This prize is given annually to persons who have made outstanding contributions to music in Australia.

However, there were three gubernatorial races, state legislative elections in four states, numerous citizen initiatives, mayoral races in several major cities, and a variety of local offices on the ballot. The most high-profile race during this year was the California gubernatorial recall election: California voters replaced incumbent Governor Gray Davis with actor Arnold Schwarzenegger. Federal electionsUnited States Congressional elections= United States House of Representatives special elections In 2003, two special elections to fill vacancies in the House of Representatives were held. They were for Hawaii's 2nd congressional district (on January 4) and Texas's 19th congressional district (June 3). None of these congressional seats changed party hands. State electionsGubernatorial elections= Three states held elections for Governor in 2003. In addition to these regularly scheduled elections, California held a recall election. California held a recall election on October 7. Kentucky and Mississippi voted on November 4. Louisiana's election dates do not coincide with that of most states: Louisiana held its open primary on October 4, with a runoff on November 15. Going into the elections, Republicans held the governorships of twenty-six states and Democrats held twenty-four. Republicans achieved a net gain of two with victories in Kentucky and Mississippi as well as the successful recall and replacement of Californian Governor Gray Davis with actor Arnold Schwarzenegger, but Democrats succeeded capturing Louisiana's Governorship. Thus, Republicans succeeded in reversing a trend in which Republicans had been losing gubernatorial seats to the Democrats since 1998. =Other state-wide Officer elections= In the three states which held regularly scheduled state general elections, elections for state executive branch offices of Lieutenant Governor (in a separate election in Louisiana and Mississippi and on the same ticket as the gubernatorial nominee in Kentucky), Secretary of state, state Treasurer, state Auditor, state Attorney General, and Commissioners of Insurance and Agriculture will be held. In addition, there will also be elections for each states' respective state Supreme Courts and state appellate courts. =State legislative elections= Four states and one territory held elections for their state legislatures. The Covenant Party led by Benigno Fitial won control of the Northern Mariana Islands House of Representatives, but the Northern Mariana Islands Senate would remain in Republican control. Change in Control of any other state legislature did not occur in Louisiana, Mississippi, New Jersey, or Virginia. =Initiatives and Referenda=Local electionsMayoral elections= Some of the many major American cities that held their mayoral elections in 2003 included: *Charlotte- Incumbent Mayor Pat McCrory (R) was re-elected. *Chicago- Incumbent Mayor Richard M.

In practical use elevators are highly stressed components and require regular careful inspection. In practice, sets of elevators and a spare duplicate are required on-site for general operations. Their failure almost always stops operations. To latch around a piece of pipework a set of elevators need a precise internal diameter, with an appropriately profiled shoulder to accommodate the lower profile of a tool joint. The latch mechanism has to prevent opening under radial loads of up to hundreds of tons. For some purposes (casing elevators, and loading pipe into and out of the derrick), the elevators also need to resist cross-axial loads of the weight of the pipe joints.

The E. coli long-term evolution experiment (LTEE) is an ongoing study in experimental evolution led by Richard Lenski that has been tracking genetic changes in 12 initially identical populations of asexual Escherichia coli bacteria since 24 February 1988. The populations reached the milestone of 50,000 generations . Lenski performed the 10,000th transfer of the experiment on March 13, 2017. The populations reached 73,500 generations in early 2020, shortly before the being frozen because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Over the course of the experiment, Lenski and his colleagues have reported a wide array of phenotypic and genotypic changes in the evolving populations. These have included changes that have occurred in all 12 populations and others that have only appeared in one or a few populations. For example, all 12 populations showed a similar pattern of rapid improvement in fitness that decelerated over time, faster growth rates, and increased cell size. Half of the populations have evolved defects in DNA repair that have caused mutator phenotypes marked by elevated mutation rates. The most striking adaptation reported so far is the evolution of aerobic growth on citrate, which is unusual in E. coli, in one population at some point between generations 31,000 and 31,500. Lenski took the decision to pause the experiment on 9 March 2020 when his lab temporarily closed as a precaution against the spread of COVID19. All of the long-term lines have been placed into ultra-low-temperature storage until such time as they can be defrosted for the experiment to continue. On May 4, 2020, Lenski announced a 5-year renewal of the grant through the National Science Foundation's Long- Term Research in Environmental Biology (LTREB) Program that supports the LTEE. He also announced that the experiment would be transferred to the supervision of Dr. Jeffrey E. Barrick, an associate professor of Molecular Biosciences at The University of Texas at Austin, within the next 5 years. Dr. Barrick had previously been a postdoctoral researcher with Dr. Lenski, and has been a major contributor to research based upon the LTEE. Experimental approach The long-term evolution experiment was designed as an open-ended means of empirical examination of central features of evolution. The experiment was begun with three principal goals: # To examine the dynamics of evolution, including the rate of evolutionary change. # To examine the repeatability of evolution. # To better understand the relationship between change on the phenotypic and genotypic levels. As the experiment has continued, its scope has grown as new questions in evolutionary biology have arisen that it can be used to address, as the populations' evolution has presented new phenomena to study, and as technology and methodological techniques have advanced. The use of E. coli as the experimental organism has allowed many generations and large populations to be studied in a relatively short period of time. Moreover, due to the long use of E. coli as a principle model organism in molecular biology, a wide array of tools, protocols, and procedures were available for studying changes at the genetic, phenotypic, and physiological levels. The bacteria can also be frozen and preserved while remaining viable. This has permitted the creation of what Lenski describes as a \\"frozen fossil record\\" of samples of evolving populations that can be revived at any time. This frozen fossil record allows populations to be restarted in cases of contamination or other disruption in the experiment, and permits the isolation and comparison of living exemplars of ancestral and evolved clones. Lenski chose an E. coli strain that reproduces only asexually, lacks any plasmids that could permit bacterial conjugation, and has no viable prophage. As a consequence, evolution in the experiment occurs only by the core evolutionary processes of mutation, genetic drift, and natural selection. This strict asexuality also means that genetic markers persist in lineages and clades by common descent, but cannot otherwise spread in the populations. Lenski chose to carry out the experiment with the bacteria grown in a glucose-limited minimal medium called DM25, which was initially developed by Bernard Davis for use in isolating auxotrophic mutants of E. coli using penicillin as a selective agent. DM25 is supplemented with a low concentration of glucose. Lenski chose this concentration to simplify analysis of the populations' evolution by reducing clonal interference, in which multiple versions of alleles are competing in an evolving population, while also reducing the possibility of the evolution of ecological interactions. This concentration of glucose used supports a maximum population of 500 million cells of the ancestor in a 10 mL culture, though the maximum now varies among the evolved populations. DM25 also contains a large amount of citrate (about 11 times the concentration of glucose), which was originally included by Davis because it improved the killing efficiency of penicillin during his experiments, though it is now known to aid in E. colis acquisition of iron from the medium. =Methods= The 12 populations are maintained in a incubator in Lenski's laboratory at Michigan State University. Each day, 1% of each population is transferred to a flask of fresh DM25 growth medium. The dilution means that each population experiences 6.64 generations, or doublings, each day. Large, representative samples of each population are frozen with glycerol as a cryoprotectant at 500-generation (75-day) intervals. The bacteria in these samples remain viable, and can be revived at any time. This collection of samples is referred to as the \\"frozen fossil record\\", and provides a history of the evolution of each population through the entire experiment. The populations are also regularly screened for changes in mean fitness, and supplemental experiments are regularly performed to study interesting developments in the populations. , the E. coli populations have been under study for over 64,500 generations, and are thought to have undergone enough spontaneous mutations that every possible single point mutation in the E. coli genome has occurred multiple times. =Founding strain= The strain of E. coli Lenski chose to use in the long-term evolution experiment was derived from \\"strain Bc251\\", as described in a 1966 paper by Seymour Lederberg, via Bruce Levin, who had used it in a bacterial ecology experiment in 1972. The defining genetics traits of this strain were: T6r, Strr, r‚àím‚àí, Ara‚àí (unable to grow on arabinose). Lenski designated the original founding strain as REL606. Before the beginning of the experiment, Lenski isolated an Ara+ variant of the strain in which a point mutation in the ara operon had restored growth on arabinose, which he designated as strain REL607. When beginning the long-term evolution experiment, Lenski founded six populations with six individual Ara‚àí colonies of REL606. These populations are referred to as Ara-1 through Ara-6. Lenski also founded six more populations from six individual Ara+ colonies of REL607. These are referred to as populations Ara+1 through Ara+6. The marker differences permit strains to be differentiated on Tetrazolium Arabinose plates, on which Ara‚àí colonies appear red, while Ara+ colonies appear white to pink. Over the course of the experiment, each population has accumulated a large number of distinct mutations, which permit further means of identifying strains by their population of origin. ResultsChanges in fitness= Timeline of the E. coli long-term evolution experiment, showing relationship between years and generations of evolution, as well as significant events and findings. Much analysis of the experiment has dealt with how the fitness of the populations relative to their ancestral strain has changed. All populations showed a pattern of rapid increase in relative fitness during early generations, with this increase decelerating over time. By 20,000 generations the populations grew approximately 70% faster than the ancestral strain. This increase and deceleration in increase has continued in subsequent generations. A 2013 study by Wiser et al. reported ongoing improvement at 50,000 generations relative to samples isolated at 40,000 generations. They found that the fitness increase fit to a power law model much better than the hyperbolic models that had been used earlier. As a power law model describes an ever-slowing increase that has no upper limit, while a hyperbolic model implies a hard limit, the work suggested that the increase would continue without bound as progressively lower benefit mutations were fixed in the populations. Further work published in 2015 reported the results of over 1100 new fitness assays that examined fitness changes through 60,000 generations. The data once again fit the proposed power law model, and, indeed, fit within predictions of the model from earlier data. These results suggest that, contrary to previous thinking, adaptation and adaptive divergence can potentially increase indefinitely, even in a constant environment. =Genome evolution= Of the 12 populations, six have so far been reported to have developed defects in their ability to repair DNA, greatly increasing the rate of mutation in those strains. Although the bacteria in each population are thought to have generated hundreds of millions of mutations over the first 20,000 generations, Lenski has estimated that within this time frame, only 10 to 20 beneficial mutations achieved fixation in each population, with fewer than 100 total point mutations (including neutral mutations) reaching fixation in each population. In 2009, Barrick et al. reported the results of genome sequences from multiple time points in population Ara-1. They found that, unlike the declining rate of fitness improvement, mutation accumulation was linear and clock like, even though several lines of evidence suggested that much of the accumulation was beneficial, rather than neutral. =Evolution of increased cell size in all twelve populations= Growth in cell size of bacteria in the Lenski experiment All twelve of the experimental populations show an increase in cell size concurrent with a decline in maximum population density, and in many of the populations, a more rounded cell shape. This change was partly the result of a mutation that changed the expression of a gene for a penicillin-binding protein, which allowed the mutant bacteria to outcompete ancestral bacteria under the conditions in the long-term evolution experiment. However, although this mutation increased fitness under these conditions, it also increased the bacteria's sensitivity to osmotic stress and decreased their ability to survive long periods in stationary phase cultures. =Ecological specialization= Over the course of the experiment, the populations have evolved to specialize on the glucose resource on which they grow. This was first described in 2000, when Cooper and Lenski demonstrated that all populations had experienced decay of unused metabolic functions after 20,000 generations, restricting the range of substances on which the bacteria could grow. Their analysis suggested that this decay was due to antagonistic pleiotropy, in which mutations that improved ability to grow on glucose had reduced or eliminated the ability to grow on other substances. A later study by Leiby and Marx that used more advanced techniques showed that much of the decay Cooper and Lenski had identified were experimental artifacts, that loss of unused functions was not as extensive as first thought, and that some unused functions had improved. Moreover, they concluded that the metabolic losses were not due to antagonistic pleiotropy, but the neutral accumulation of mutations in unused portions of the genome, suggesting that adaptation to a simple environment might not necessarily lead to specialization. =Evolution of balanced polymorphism and simple ecosystems= Two distinct variants, S and L, were identified in the population designated Ara-2 at 18,000 generations based on their formation of small and large colonies, respectively. Clones of the S and L types could co-exist stably in co-culture with each other, indicating they occupied distinct niches in the population. This was verified by the finding that the L type had an advantage during growth on glucose, but that S had an advantage during stationary phase, after glucose had run out. The two types were found to have initially evolved prior to 6,000 generations, and then co-existed thereafter. Phylogenetic analysis of clones of the two types isolated from different generations demonstrated that the S and L types belonged to distinct, co-existing lineages in the population, and might be undergoing incipient speciation. =Evolution of aerobic citrate usage in one population= Background The population designated Ara-3 (center) is more turbid because that population evolved to use the citrate present in the growth medium. E. coli is normally unable to grow aerobically on citrate due to the inability to express a citrate transporter when oxygen is present. However, E. coli has a complete citric acid cycle, and therefore metabolizes citrate as an intermediate during aerobic growth on other substances, including glucose. Most E. coli can grow anaerobically on citrate via fermentation, if a co-substrate such as glucose is available to provide reducing power. The anaerobic growth is possible due to the expression of a transmembrane citrate-succinate antiporter gene, citT, which was first identified in 1998. This gene is co-regulated with other genes involved in citrate fermentation found on the cit operon, which is turned on only when oxygen is absent. The inability to grow aerobically on citrate, referred to as a Cit‚àí phenotype, is considered a defining characteristic of E. coli as a species, and one that has been a valuable means of differentiating E. coli from pathogenic Salmonella. Although Cit+ strains of E. coli have been isolated from environmental and agricultural samples, in every such case, the trait was found to be due to the presence of a plasmid that carries a foreign citrate transporter. A single, spontaneous Cit+ mutant of E. coli was reported by Hall in 1982. This mutant had been isolated during prolonged selection for growth on another novel substance in a growth broth that also contained citrate. Hall's genetic analysis indicated the underlying mutation was complex, but he was ultimately unable to identify the precise changes or genes involved, leading him to hypothesize activation of a cryptic transporter gene. The genome regions to which Hall was able to narrow down the locations of the changes do not correspond to the known location of the citT gene identified 16 years later, nor did the physiological characteristics in transport assays of Hall's Cit+ mutants match those to be expected for aerobic expression of the CitT transporter. Cit+ evolves in the LTEE In 2008, Lenski's team, led by Zachary D. Blount, reported that the ability to grow aerobically on citrate had evolved in one population. Around generation 33,127, a dramatic increase in turbidity was observed in the population designated Ara-3. They found that the population contained clones that were able to grow aerobically on citrate (Cit+). This metabolic capacity permitted the population to grow several-fold larger than it had previously, due to the large amount of citrate present in the medium. Examination of frozen fossil samples of the populations showed that Cit+ clones could be isolated as early as 31,500 generations. The Cit+ variants in the population were found to possess a number of genetic markers unique to the Ara-3 population; this observation excluded the possibility that the clones were contaminants, rather than spontaneous mutants. In a series of experiments that \\"replayed\\" the tape of Ara-3 evolution from Cit‚àí clones isolated from samples frozen at various time points in the population's history, they demonstrated that the ability to grow aerobically on citrate was more likely to re-evolve in a subset of genetically pure, evolved clones. In these experiments, they observed 19 new, independent instances of Cit+ re- evolution, but only when starting from clones isolated from after generation 20,000. Fluctuation tests showed that clones from this generation and later displayed a rate of mutation to the Cit+ trait which was significantly higher than the ancestral rate. Even in these later clones, the rate of mutation to Cit+ was on the order of one occurrence per trillion cell divisions. Lenski and his colleagues concluded that the evolution of the Cit+ function in this one population arose due to one or more earlier, possibly nonadaptive, \\"potentiating\\" mutations that increased the rate of mutation to an accessible level. The data suggested that citrate usage involved at least two mutations subsequent to these \\"potentiating\\" mutations. More generally, the authors suggest these results indicate, following the argument of Stephen Jay Gould, \\"that historical contingency can have a profound and lasting impact\\" on the course of evolution. These findings have come to be considered a significant instance of the impact of historical contingency on evolution. Genomic analysis of the Cit+ trait and implications for evolutionary innovation The Cit+ trait was actualized by a duplication mutation that created a new regulatory module by placing a copy of the citT gene that encodes a citrate- succinate antiporter under the control of a promoter that supports expression under aerobic conditions. This mutation results in the CitT transporter being expressed when oxygen is present, permitting growth on citrate. In 2012, Lenski and his team reported the results of a genomic analysis of the Cit+ trait that shed light on the genetic basis and evolutionary history of the trait. The researchers had sequenced the entire genomes of twenty-nine clones isolated from various time points in the Ara-3 population's history. They used these sequences to reconstruct the phylogenetic history of the population; this reconstruction showed that the population had diversified into three clades by 20,000 generations. The Cit+ variants had evolved in one of these, which they called Clade 3. Clones that had been found to be potentiated in earlier research were distributed among all three clades, but were over- represented in Clade 3. This led the researchers to conclude that there had been at least two potentiating mutations involved in Cit+ evolution. The researchers also found that all Cit+ clones had mutations in which a 2933-base-pair segment of DNA was duplicated or amplified. The duplicated segment contained the gene citT for the citrate transporter protein used in anaerobic growth on citrate. The duplication is tandem, and resulted in copies that were head-to-tail with respect to each other. This new configuration placed a copy of the previously silent, unexpressed citT under the control of the adjacent rnk gene's promoter, which directs expression when oxygen is present. This new rnk-citT module produced a novel regulatory pattern for citT, activating expression of the citrate transporter when oxygen was present, and thereby enabled aerobic growth on citrate. Movement of this rnk- citT module into the genome of a potentiated Cit‚àí clone was shown to be sufficient to produce a Cit+ phenotype. However, the initial Cit+ phenotype conferred by the duplication was very weak, and only granted a ~1% fitness benefit. The researchers found that the number of copies of the rnk-citT module had to be increased to strengthen the Cit+ trait sufficiently to permit the bacteria to grow well on the citrate. Further mutations after the Cit+ bacteria became dominant in the population continued to accumulate improved growth on citrate. The researchers concluded that the evolution of the Cit+ trait occurred in three distinct phases: (1) mutations accumulated that increased the rate of mutation to Cit+, (2) the trait itself appeared in a weak form, and (3) the trait was improved by later mutations. Blount et al. suggested that this pattern might be typical of how novel traits in general evolve, and proposed a three-step model of evolutionary innovation: # Potentiation: a genetic background evolves in which a trait is mutationally accessible, making the trait's evolution possible. # Actualization: a mutation occurs that produces the trait, making it manifest, albeit likely in a weak form. # Refinement: Once the trait exists, if it provides selective benefit, mutations will accumulate that improve the trait, making it effective. This phase is open-ended, and will continue so long as refining mutations arise and the trait remains beneficial. This model has seen acceptance in evolutionary biology. In 2015 paleontologist Douglas Erwin suggested a modification to a four-step model to better reflect a possible distinction between evolutionary novelty and evolutionary innovation, and to highlight the importance of environmental conditions: potentiation, generation of novel phenotypes (actualization), adaptive refinement, and exploitation (conversion of a novelty to an innovation as it becomes important for the ecological establishment of possessing organisms). Investigation of potentiation In 2014, a research team led by Eric Quandt in the lab of Jeffrey Barrick at the University of Texas at Austin described the application of a new technique called Recursive Genomewide Recombination and Sequencing (REGRES) to identify potentiating mutations among the 70 present in the Ara-3 lineage that evolved Cit+. This method used multiple rounds of a process in which F plasmid based conjugation between a 33,000 generation Cit+ clone, CZB154, and the Cit‚àí founding clone of the LTEE to purge mutations not required for either manifestation of a weak or strong form of the Cit+ trait, which they refer to as Cit++. They found that the rnk-citT module responsible for the phenotypic switch to Cit+ was sufficient to produce a weak Cit+ phenotype in the ancestor. They also identified a mutation that had occurred in the lineage leading to CZB154 after the initial evolution of Cit+ that conferred a strong, Cit++ phenotype in the ancestor absent any mutation but the rnk-citT module. This mutation, found in the regulatory region of a gene called dctA, caused a massive increase in the expression of the DctA transporter, which functions to import C4-dicarboxylates into the cell. This increased DctA expression, they found, permitted Cit+ cells to re-uptake succinate, malate, and fumarate released into the medium by the CitT transporter during import of citrate. They identified a similar mutation in Cit++ clones in the Ara-3 population that increased DctA expression by restoring function to a gene that regulates it, dcuS, that had been deactivated in the ancestral clone. Quandt et al. concluded that the dctA mutation was not involved in potentiation, but refinement. This led them to suggest that evolution of Cit+ in the Ara-3 population might have been contingent upon a genetic background and population-specific ecology that permitted the early, weak Cit+ variants to persist in the population long enough for refining mutations to arise and render growth on citrate strong enough to provide a significant fitness benefit. Quandt and colleagues later published findings definitively identifying a mutation that did potentiate Cit+ evolution. This mutation was in the gltA gene, which encodes citrate synthase, an enzyme involved in the flow of carbon into the citric acid cycle. It had the effect of increasing citrate synthase activity, and they showed that it permitted improved growth on acetate. Moreover, with the gltA mutation, the rnk-citT module that causes the Cit+ trait has a neutral-to-slightly beneficial fitness effect, while, without it, the module was strongly detrimental. The gltA mutation therefore seems to have permitted early, weak Cit+ variants to persist in the population until later refining mutations could occur, consistent with their earlier conclusions. After a strong Cit++ phenotype evolved, the increased citrate synthase activity became detrimental. The researchers found that later mutations in gltA countered the first mutation, reducing citrate synthase activity, and further improving growth on citrate. They concluded that the series of mutation in gltA first potentiated, and then refined growth on citrate. They also suggested that the lineage in which Cit+ arose might have occupied a niche in Ara-3 based on growth on acetate, and that the potentiating mutations that led to evolution of Cit+ in Ara-3 were originally adaptive for acetate use. Investigation of post-Cit+ ecology and persistent diversity A small subpopulation of Cit‚àí cells unable to grow on citrate, and belonging to a separate clade persisted in the population after the Cit+ cells became dominant. Early findings showed that this diversity was partly due to the Cit‚àí cells being better at growing on the glucose in the medium. Turner et al. later found that another factor behind the coexistence was that the Cit‚àí cells evolved the ability to cross feed on the Cit+ majority. They showed that the Cit+ cells release succinate, malate, and fumarate during growth on citrate, as the CitT transporter pumps these substances out of the cell while pumping citrate into the cell. The Cit‚àí cells had rapidly evolved the ability to grow on these substances due to a mutation that restored expression of an appropriate transporter protein that was silent in the ancestor. The Cit‚àí subpopulation eventually went extinct in the population between 43,500 and 44,000 generations. This extinction was shown to not be due to the Cit+ majority evolving to be able to invade the niche occupied by the Cit‚àí minority. Indeed, Cit‚àí clones could invade Cit+ populations from after the extinction event. Moreover, in an experiment in which they restarted twenty replicates of the Ara-3 population from the sample frozen 500 generations before the extinction, Turner et al. found that the Cit‚àí subpopulation had not gone extinct in any of the replicates after 500 generations of evolution. One of these replicates was continued for 2,500 generations, over which Cit‚àí continued to coexist. The researchers concluded that the extinction of Cit‚àí had been due to some unknown \\"rare environmental perturbation\\", similar to that which can impact natural populations. The final replicate was integrated into the main LTEE experiment, becoming the thirteenth population, Ara-7. Criticism of citrate-usage findings Other researchers have experimented on evolving aerobic citrate-utilizing E. coli. Dustin Van Hofwegen et al., working in the lab of intelligent design proponent Scott Minnich, were able to isolate 46 independent citrate-utilizing mutants of E. coli in just 12 to 100 generations using highly prolonged selection under starvation, during which the bacteria would sample more mutations more rapidly. In their research, the genomic DNA sequencing revealed an amplification of the citT and dctA loci, and rearrangement of DNA were the same class of mutations identified in the experiment by Richard Lenski and his team. They concluded that the rarity of the citrate-utilizing mutant in Lenski's research was likely a result of the selective experimental conditions used by his team rather than being a unique evolutionary speciation event. John Roth and Sophie Maisnier-Patin reviewed the approaches in both the Lenski team's delayed mutations and the Van Hofweges team's rapid mutations on E. coli. They argue that both teams experienced the same sequence of potentiation, actualization, and refinement leading up to similar Cit+ variants. According to them, the period of less than a day during which citrate usage would be under selection, followed by 100-fold dilution, and a period of growth on glucose that would not select for citrate use, ultimately lowered the probability of E. coli being able to accumulate early adaptive mutations from one period of selection to the next. On the other hand, Van Hofwegen's team allowed for a continuous selection period of 7 days, which yielded a more rapid development of citrate-using E. coli. Roth and Maisnier- Patin suggest that the serial dilution of E. coli and short period of selection for citrate-use under the conditions of the LTEE perpetually impeded each generation of E. coli from reaching the next stages of aerobic citrate utilization. In response, Blount and Lenski acknowledge that the problem is not with the experiments or the data, but with the interpretations made by Van Hofwegen et al. and Maisnier-Patin and Roth. Lenski notes that the rapid evolution of Cit+ was not necessarily unexpected since his team was also able to produce multiple Cit+ mutants in a few weeks during the replay experiments they reported in the 2008 paper in which his team first described the evolution of aerobic citrate use in the LTEE. Furthermore, Lenski criticizes Van Hofwegen et al.'s description of the initial evolution of Cit+ as a \\"speciation event\\" by pointing out that the LTEE was not designed to isolate citrate-using mutants or to deal with speciation since in their 2008 paper they said \\"that becoming Cit+ was only a first step on the road to possible speciation\\", and thus did not propose that the Cit+ mutants were a different species, but that speciation might be an eventual consequence of the trait's evolution. Lenski acknowledges that scientists, including him and his team, often use short hand and jargon when discussing speciation, instead of writing more carefully and precisely on the matter, and this can cause issues. However, he notes that speciation is generally considered by evolutionary biologists to be a process, and not an event. He also criticizes Van Hofwegen et al. and Roth and Maisnier-Patin for positing \\"false dichotomies\\" regarding the complex concept of historical contingency. He argues that historical contingency means that history matters, and that their 2008 paper presented data that showed that the evolution of Cit+ in the LTEE was contingent upon mutations that had accumulated earlier. He concludes that \\"...historical contingency was invoked and demonstrated in a specific context, namely that of the emergence of Cit+ in the LTEE‚Äîit does not mean that the emergence of Cit+ is historically contingent in other experimental contexts, nor for that matter that other changes in the LTEE are historically contingent‚Äîin fact, some other evolved changes in the LTEE have been highly predictable and not (or at least not obviously) contingent on prior mutations in the populations.\\" See also * Experimental evolution * Long-term experiment ReferencesFurther reading * * External links * E. coli Long-term Experimental Evolution Project Site * Bacteria make major evolutionary shift in the lab Bob Holmes New Scientist 9 June 2008 * Evolution: Past, Present and Future Richard Lenski * List of publications on the experiment * Online Publication of paper on Rapid evolution of citrate utilization Category:1988 in biology Category:Biology experiments Category:Escherichia coli Category:Evolutionary biology Category:Molecular evolution ","title":"E. coli long-term evolution experiment"},{"id":"17998858","text":"XHMLS-FM (91.3 FM, √âxitos 91.3) is a Spanish Contemporary Hit Radio station that serves the Rio Grande Valley, Texas (USA) / Matamoros-Reynosa, Tamaulipas (Mexico) border area.

The club was formed in 1895 by a group of bookmakers disgruntled with a judge's decision on a race at Kensington, New South Wales. The club is located in the heart of the central business district at Pitt Street between Market and Park Streets. History City Tattersalls Club started in 1895 with only 25 members, all bookmakers. The Club began its life with only 50 guineas in the bank. The story started on 26 April 1895, when Merry Girl ‚Äì at 6/1 - was first past the post at Kensington. Although the five-year-old mare appeared to have triumphed, the stewards disqualified her because she turned the scales two pounds overweight and her jockey weighed in with his whip. Thus, Pearl Powder, a four-year-old mare who ran second at 5/2 was declared the winner. No doubt standing to lose heavily on such a heavily backed winner, and believing Merry Girl's connections should have appealed, the paddock bookmakers refused to pay out. It was the last race of the day and then they turned up at Kensington the following Thursday, their leader refused an official request to settle. As a result, all the paddock bookmakers were escorted from the course. No doubt whooping with joy, the St Leger bookmakers were invited to take their places where the serious money was wagered. These banished bookmakers were members of the Australian Bookmakers' Association with headquarters at Tattersalls Club at 202-204 Pitt Street, which had considerable control over racing in New South Wales. Founded in 1858, Tattersall's took its name from Richard Tattersall, the English horse dealer who established the modern concept of horseracing with fair betting rules. The Pearl Powder dispute dragged on for several weeks. While profiting from the situation, members of the St Leger bookmakers Association felt they should now have their own club to go to with their new-found respectability. So, on 30 August 1895, one of their enterprising leaders, George Langley, convened a meeting at Her Majesty's Hotel at which it was resolved that all present form themselves into a club, to be called City Tattersalls Club. The 25 men at the meeting started the financial ball rolling by subscribing two guineas each and agreeing to pay two shillings a week. City Tattersalls Club has its own Act of Parliament, with an Honorary Committee comprising a Chairman, Vice-Chairman and seven Committee members, all of whom are now elected by those who hold either Gold or Silver Membership, and who protect the interests of Members by overseeing the strategies of the Executive Management. The management is headed by four Executive Managers, being the Head of Operations, Head of Finance, Head of Gaming and Head of Communications and Marketing. Location Front view from Pitt Street, Sydney City Tattersalls Club previously occupied the Graphic Arts building and the building alongside Adams Hotel, where the Sydney Hilton Hotel now stands. During the 1950s, a film company was located on the top floor, with its vault on the roof, presumably so that when film exploded the burst would go upward. In December 1992 'Silks Bar and Grill' was born. Sydney during the 90's was seeing an upgrade of office blocks and shopping arcades; City Tattersalls Club was ageing, exclusive and ran a strict dress code. The Silks Bar and Grill opening was strategic as it allowed the club to capitalise on the Government of New South Wales 5 kilometre ruling, allowing residents outside a 5 km radius to simply sign into a registered club. Being a separate entrance, this protected the main membership of City Tattersalls Club. After approval by its Board Members in 2007 City Tattersalls Club purchased the Merivale building at 194 Pitt Street and took back its occupancy of 196 Pitt Street previously occupied by National Australia Bank. History and milestones The City Tattersalls Club building at 202-204 Pitt Street was occupied from 1891. Built at a small cost by today's standards, the building was described as presenting a free and effective rendering of the classic Renaissance style of architecture. It was constructed of Pyrmont, New South Wales freestone, finished in rubble masonry, relieved by handsome pilasters balustrades, moulded Courses and carved enrichments which were said to \\"combine to produce a striking though harmonious effect\\". The rearing horse figure which surmounted the building until 2007 was carved from a single block of stone measuring . City Tattersalls bought the building in 1975 at a fraction of its value in its centenary year. City Tattersalls' second home, premises at 240 Pitt Street with a narrow frontage was occupied until moving to the present site in 1924.

These days digital cameras are ubiquitous. They are one of the most common sensors found in electronic devices, ranging from smartphones to tablets, and laptops to surveillance cams. However, privacy and trust implications surrounding it limit its ability to seamlessly blend into computing environment. In particular, large-scale camera networks have created increasing interest in understanding the advantages and disadvantages of such deployments. It is estimated that over 4 million CCTV cameras deployed in the UK.McCahill, M. and Norris, C. 2004, From cameras to control rooms: the mediation of the image by cctv operatives, CCTV and Social Control: The politics and practice of video surveillance-European and global perspectives, 2004 Due to increasing security concerns, camera networks have continued to proliferate across other countries such as the United States. While the impact of such systems continues to be evaluated, in parallel, tools for controlling how these camera networks are used and modifications to the images or video sent to end-users have been explored. Technologies To enhance visual privacy, a number of different technologies have been suggested. =Forms of Visual Data= Visual Privacy is often typically applied to particular technologies including: * Closed-circuit television (CCTVs) * Visual sensor network (Also referred to as Camera Networks) * Camera phone *Smart homes =Systems= Many different forms of technologies are explored to preserve privacy while providing information collected from camera networks. Most of these solutions rely upon the target application and try to accomplish it in a privacy-preserving manner: * \\"Respectful Cameras\\" is a solution that automatically obscures the faces of observed people in video by overlaying a colored dot over the face of the individual. This technology tracks colored markers, worn by individuals, and then infers the location of a face by an offset from the marker. * Google Streetview uses automatic face-detection to blur all faces in the city of Manhattan.http://google- latlong.blogspot.com/2008/05/street-view-revisits-manhattan.html * Eptascape has a product which provides automatic people tracking and provides privacy- enabled surveillance.https://web.archive.org/web/20080621124054/http://www.eptascape.com/ * Cardea is a context-aware visual privacy protection mechanism that protects bystanders' visual privacy in photos according to their context-dependent privacy preferences, using face recognition and context computing techniques.https://home.cse.ust.hk/~jshuaa/papers/mmsys18_cardea.pdfCardea: Context-Aware Visual Privacy Protection for Photo Taking and Sharing.

Bilateral relations between the Republic of India and the Republic of Singapore have traditionally been strong and friendly, with the two nations enjoying extensive cultural and commercial relations. India and Singapore have signed the Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) and strategic-relationship agreement in order to increase trade, investments and economic cooperation, and expanded bilateral cooperation on maritime security, training forces, joint naval exercises, developing military technology and fighting terrorism. According to a 2010 Gallup poll, 40% of Singaporeans approve of India's leadership, with 23% disapproving and 37% uncertain.{{cite weburl=http://www.gallup.com/poll/144269/Leadership-Popular- Asia-China-India.aspx  title=U.S. Leadership More Popular in Asia Than China's, India's]  publisher=Gallup  Background  India and Singapore share long-standing cultural, commercial and strategic relations, with Singapore being a part of the \\"Greater India\\" cultural and commercial region. More than 500,000 people of Indian origin live in Singapore. Following its independence in 1965, Singapore was concerned with China-backed communist threats as well as domination from Malaysia and Indonesia and sought a close strategic relationship with India, which it saw as a counterbalance to Chinese influence and a partner in achieving regional security. Singapore had always been an important strategic trading post, giving India trade access to the Far East. Although the rival positions of both nations over the Vietnam War and the Cold War caused consternation between India and Singapore, their relationship expanded significantly in the 1990s; Singapore was one of the first to respond to India's \\"Look East\\" Policy of expanding its economic, cultural and strategic ties in Southeast Asia to strengthen its standing as a regional power. Development of bilateral relations Diplomatic relations between India and Singapore were established on 24 August 1965, fifteen days after the latter became independent. Ever since Singapore's independence, both nations have maintained high-level contacts. Between 1966 and 1971 the Prime Minister of Singapore Lee Kuan Yew visited India three times (1966, 1970 and 1971). The then-Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi visited Singapore in 1968, as did Indian leader Morarji Desai. Singapore supported India's bid to become a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council and expand its role and influence in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Singapore also supported India in its war against Pakistan in 1965 and the Kashmir conflict. Military relations between the two nations had been limited due to foreign policy differences in the Cold War era, as Singapore was allied with Nato, whilst India established itself as a founding member of the Non-Aligned Movement, and as the only South Asian country to recognise the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan. In 2003, India and Singapore signed a bilateral agreement on expanding military cooperation, conducting joint military training, developing military technology and achieving maritime security. The Singaporean Navy and the Indian Navy have conducted joint naval exercises and training since 1993 such as SIMBEX and MILAN near India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands. India and Singapore have also expanded their cooperation in fighting terrorism. Over the last two decades, Singapore has positioned itself as the hub of India's economic, political and strategic relationships in Southeast Asia. When India announced its Look East policy in 1992, Singapore positioned itself as India's de facto regional sponsor. As Indian Defence Minister Pranab Mukherjee commented in 2006, Singapore has become ‚Äúthe hub of its political, economic and security strategy in the whole of East Asia.‚Äù After the death of Lee Kuan Yew in 2015, India followed with a weekend of national mourning in memory of the founding father of Singapore, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Singapore in November 2015 reaffirming fifty years of bilateral relations. Commerce Singapore is the 8th largest source of investment in India and the largest amongst ASEAN member nations. It is also India's 9th biggest trading partner as of 2005-06. Its cumulative investment in India totals US$3 billion as of 2006 and is expected to rise to $5 billion by 2010 and $10 billion by 2015. India's economic liberalisation and its \\"Look East\\" policy have led to a major expansion in bilateral trade, which grew from US$2.2 billion in 2001 to $9 billion ‚Äì 10 billion in 2006 ‚Äì a 400% growth in the span of five years ‚Äì and to $50 billion by 2010. Singapore accounts for 38% of India's trade with ASEAN member nations and 3.4% of its total foreign trade. India's main exports to Singapore in 2005 included petroleum, gemstones, jewellery, machinery and its imports from Singapore included electronic goods, organic chemicals and metals. More than half of Singapore's exports to India are \\"re-exports\\" ‚Äì items that had been imported from India. In 2005, both nations signed the Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) and have organised the India-Singapore Parliamentary Forum and the Singapore-India Partnership foundation with active support from the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICC), the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) and the Singapore Business Federation to promote trade, economic development and partnerships. The CECA eliminated tariff barriers, double taxation, duplicate processes and regulations and provided unhindered access and collaboration between the financial institutions of Singapore and India. The CECA also enhanced bilateral collaboration related to education, science and technology, intellectual property, aviation and relaxed visa regulations for Indian professionals in information technology, medicine, engineering and financial fields to emigrate and work in Singapore. Singapore has invested in projects to upgrade India's ports, airports and developing information technology parks and a Special Economic Zone (SEZ). India has become Singapore's 4th biggest tourist destination and more than 650,000 Indians visited Singapore in 2006. Both nations have worked to collaborate on aviation, aerospace engineering, space programmes, information technology, biotechnology and energy. Singapore and India successfully concluded the second review of the India-Singapore Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) on 1 June 2018 in the presence of India Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. In September 2018, India and Singapore formally launched the third review of CECA which focuses on trade facilitation, e-commerce and customs. Military cooperation In 1994, India and Singapore began their annual naval combat exercise, now called \\"SIMBEX\\" Several warships from India and Singapore took part in this interoperable combat exercise. In 2003, India and Singapore signed a Defence Cooperation Agreement, allowing Singapore army and air force to conduct training on Indian soil. On 24 November 2015, India and Singapore signed the agreement for the \\"strategic relationship\\" across the board including defence and military, security and intelligence cooperation, political exchanges, enhancing trade and investment, improving financial linkages, improving air connectivity and cooperation in multilateral forums. On 29 November 2017, the two countries signed a naval cooperation agreement aimed at boosting maritime security, joint exercises and mutual logistics support. The agreement also permits ships of either navy to refuel, restock and, rearm at each other military bases. After signing the agreement, Singapore's Defence Minister Dr. Ng Eng Hen stated, \\"not only would we be more comfortable, we would encourage the Indian Navy to visit Changi Naval base more often\\". The Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) and the Indian Air Force (IAF) regularly conduct joint military training exercises. India and Singapore also signed the revised Defence Cooperation Agreement to strengthen the existing defence relationship between Indian military and Singapore Armed Forces on 29 November 2017. In 2018, \\"India-Singapore Bilateral Agreement for Navy Cooperation\\" was signed which gave Indian Navy ships access to Singapore‚Äôs Changi Naval Base near near the disputed South China Sea, mutual logistical support and refuelling rights at the port.[https://eurasiantimes.com/from-singapores-changi-naval-base-to-omans- duqm-port-how-is-india-countering-chinese-string-of-pearls/ From Singapore‚Äôs Changi Naval Base To Oman‚Äôs Duqm Port, How Is India Countering Chinese String of Pearls?

Randall (circa 1868) Edwin M. Randall was a Florida lawyer and Republican politician who served as Chief Justice of the Florida Supreme Court from January 1869 to January 7, 1885. He was born April 5, 1822. He died July 12, 1895. Randall was born in Canajoharie, New York in Montgomery County, New York on April 5, 1822. His father, Phineas, was a lawyer and a judge. He attended the public schools. After reading law under his father, he was admitted to the bar in 1844. In 1845 the family moved to Waukesha, Wisconsin where he joined his brother, Alexander's, legal practice. In 1847 he married Julia Mills in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. For the next ten years he worked to build the law practice. He became friends with Harrison Reed, then a Madison of newspaper editor. In 1858, Alexander became governor of Wisconsin. His brother's political career furthered Randall's. In 1864, a year after Alexander's appointment as assistant Postmaster General, Randall was appointed federal tax commissioner for Louisiana. After becoming Postmaster General under President Andrew Johnson, his brother sent Randall to Florida to help Harrison Reed, who was then Florida's postal agent. Randall and Reed became ready partners. The Republican Party in Florida was factionalized at that time, and their efforts at the 1868 Florida Constitutional Convention derailed the efforts of the \\"Mule Team,\\" and furthered the efforts of their more conservative faction. As a result, Reed was elected governor and appointed Randall Chief Justice of the Florida Supreme Court. Randall served as Chief Justice during a turbulent time for Florida and the Court. Reconstruction brought division and conflict to Florida and to factions within the Republican Party. He became chief interpreter of the Constitution of 1868. In 1872, he presided over Reed's impeachment. The disputed presidential and gubernatorial elections of 1876 presented unprecedented challenges. Despite Randall's personal and political affiliations, the Court ordered a recount and awarded the governorship to Democrat George F. Drew. On January 7, 1885 Randall returned to private practice in Jacksonville, after the election of Democrat Edward A. Perry as governor. He was one of Duval County's delegates to the state constitutional convention. He served briefly in the early 1890s as Jacksonville city attorney. On July 12, 1895, he died of Bright's disease.

It stands for Microprocessor Intelligent Data Acquisition and Control. CRC was established in order to complete several building automation projects commenced by R-Tec. R-Tec was an Australian development company based in Sydney that focussed on designing innovative computerised building automation products. The proprietors formed R-Tec in the late 1970s after leaving Johnson Controls. The early R-Tec automation systems used TTL logic with control parameters stored in dynamic memory. The early computerised building automation systems or BAS monitored alarms and conditions relating to building services including air conditioning, water and power, etc. They also controlled plant by starting and stopping pumps and fans according to time and other interlock conditions. The systems of the 1970s and early 1980s used parallel or multiple conductor communications data busses to communication with Data Gathering Panels (DGPs) located throughout the building. The DGPs would communicate monitored conditions using multiplex techniques back to a central location and \\"front end\\" system through the parallel data trunk. In the same way commands to start and stop plant would be sent from the front end to the DGP and then to the machine. All decisions or \\"intelligence\\" was centrally located, and the DGPs simply relayed information. Combined Resources Computing was established by Kevin Johnson-Bade, an ex R-Tec software engineer, with the prime goal of completing the building automation system contracted to R-Tec by the University of Melbourne. This occurred when R-Tec closed down, being unable to complete its contractual commitments. The University of Melbourne building automation system was ambitious. In 1982 it was possibly the first successful implementation of a distributed intelligence building automation or Direct Digital Control or DDC system using Z80 microprocessors. Remote units called Satellite Intelligence Units (SIUs) were located in buildings around the campus and were connected to the front end using a serial communications. See: Distributed control system CRC developed a unique object-oriented control algorithm building approach. Even though the Z80 microprocessor of the time ran at only 1 MHz, and had a memory addressing range of 64 Kbytes, the University of Melbourne system out- performed other automations systems of the time significantly. CRC created a front-end computer that used ten processors to share the task, having access to up to 256 pages of shared memory. Each SIU used two Z80 processors. This allowed the intelligence to be shared, and many decisions to be made locally thus further reducing the load on the front end and reducing communications. The University of Melbourne system was a leader in the development of distributed intelligence DDC system. Out of CRC Midac System Pty Limited was formed in 1982, and went on to develop and implement more leading DDC technology included systems where the front-end computer was a CPM operating system MZ3500 Sharp personal computer. The Sharp was chosen because of its much superior graphics compared with the early IBM PC of the early 1980s. Over the following years the major players like Johnson and Honeywell would follow, replacing their mini-computer front-end terminals with PCs as they implemented microprocessor-based distributed intelligence systems using serial communications networks. Toward the end of the 1980s and early 1990s most DDC systems included an object-oriented control algorithm building tool. They compiled the object-oriented instructions into the system's native proprietary linear language, whereas in the Midac approach the control system's native language or operating environment was itself object-oriented. Midac went on to develop three new generations of microprocessor-based DDC systems, the last version being Nexus, developed for DKS that was taken over by James Hardie's Building Automation division. That business and its assets including Nexus were purchased by Chubb International in the late 1990s.

As part of the overall Station District, it will have several facilities all linked together, including an Amtrak intercity rail station, rapid transit, local and intercity bus facility, parking facilities, mixed-use development and an elevated greenway. Estimated at a cost of $800.1 million (2017 US dollars) for full implementation of all public and private components, the project will be built in three phases, with all construction tentatively done by 2024. When completed, it will become the new \\"front door\\" to the city for train and bus passengers, connecting between multiple modes of transportation and establish a new activity center in Uptown Charlotte. When the station is completed, it will be the southern terminus for Amtrak's Carolinian and Piedmont lines, as well as a service stop on the Crescent. It is also intended to be a major stop on the Southeast High Speed Rail Corridor. The station will also be a stop on Charlotte Area Transit System's CityLynx Gold streetcar line and Silver light rail line, and will serve as Charlotte's Greyhound Lines station. History In 1991, the City of Charlotte and the North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) completed a preliminary feasibility study for a new Uptown rail station to replace the existing Amtrak station, built in 1962 by the Southern Railway and located on North Tryon Street near the rail yard for SOU's successor, Norfolk Southern. The site chosen along West Trade Street, currently a Greyhound station since 1973, was once the location of three previous stations: the Atlanta & Charlotte Depot (prior to 1886), the Richmond and Danville Depot (1886-1905) and the Southern Depot (1905-1962). In 1998, NCDOT began the acquisition of property for the station and supportive land uses (i.e. retail and offices). In 2002, NCDOT completed its feasibility study for the Charlotte Multi-Modal Station and Area Track Improvements. The study identified two possible options: The Preferred Alternative, which included the station, various track work and a greenway at $206.8 million (2002 dollars), and the Station Build Only Alternative at $109.6 million (2002 dollars). By 2004, NCDOT had completed property acquisition of . Announced publicly in August 2005, the proposed Gateway Station is envisioned to serve as both a multimodal transit center in addition to both office and retail space. As originally presented, the station would feature an underground station for CATS buses, a office building, and soaring lobby for other rail and bus services in the building's atrium. In 2009, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 awarded $520 million grant for the Piedmont Improvement Project in North Carolina; which was used to make rail improvements identified in the 2002 feasibility study. In that same year, an Environmental impact assessment was completed that resulted in a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) and the City of Charlotte and NCDOT signed an municipal agreement. In 2012, NCDOT completed property acquisition again of approximately for the Charlotte Gateway Station project. On November 1, 2012, NCDOT selected Houston-based developer, the Hines Group, for the project. In 2015, NCDOT won a $25 Million TIGER Grant, to help start construction of Gateway Station. The station will have a long, fully ADA compliant high-level platform, the second in the state behind Raleigh Union Station. It will also significantly improve connections between Amtrak and local transit. Construction Both the Charlotte Area Transit System (CATS) and NCDOT have started/completed various projects that impact the future station, including the CityLynx Gold Line and a new Locomotive and Railcar Maintenance Facility located on West Summit Avenue. However, groundbreaking for the Charlotte Gateway Station did not begin until July 2018. The project is using a phased implementation approach to facilitate the near-term development of the rail station while also setting the stage for private development to occur. There are three general phases with additional sub-phases. =Phase 1= At an estimate cost of $91.3 million (2017 dollars), the first phase has two parts: * 1A) Construct track, structures, and signals to support two new station tracks; construct retaining wall/earthwork; construct temporary intercity bus facility (completed August, 2019). * 1B) Construct rail platform and canopy for passenger loading/unloading. This phase is fully funded with an anticipated construction period is 2018 to 2021. =Phase 2= At an estimate cost of $49.9 million (2017 dollars), the second phase has two parts: *2A) Construct platform canopy; construct station building (interim condition) with full construction of concourse level and core and shell only for plaza and mezzanine levels; construct temporary surface parking and passenger drop-off area. *2B) Decommission existing Amtrak station on North Tryon Street. This phase is partially funded with capital carryover from phase 1. The anticipated construction period is 2019 to 2022. =Phase 3= At an estimate cost of $658.9 million (2017 dollars), the third phase has three parts: *3A) Construct greenway connection with bridge over Fourth Street, vertical circulation and retaining walls; construct bus facility, which includes structured parking and residential over retail wrapping garage (facility will serve as temporary parking for rail passengers till phase 3B is completed). *3B) Complete upper section of station building; extend greenway with bridge over Trade Street, vertical circulation and retaining walls; extend greenway to Bank of America Stadium; construct private development around station. *3C) Construct remote properties between Fifth and Seventh Streets; extend greenway to Ninth Street. This phase is currently not funded, but is expected to be depended mostly from private developers. The anticipated construction period is 2020 to 2024.
