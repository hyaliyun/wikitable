He graduated in archaeology and ancient history at the University of Birmingham and pursued postgraduate research in ancient history at University College London. He has published four books (three co-authored) on various aspects of ancient history. In his best known work, Centuries of Darkness (1991), he and four colleagues challenged traditional chronology for the Bronze to Iron Ages in the Near East and the Eastern Mediterranean. In particular, they advanced the idea that the Greek Dark Ages can be drastically reduced and arose solely from a misreading of key elements of the history of ancient Egypt. Ongoing criticism and discussion of the evidence is listed on the authors' own website. Reviews at the time were sharply divided on the merits of the book, but there was generally more praise for the critique of problems in the conventional ancient Egyptian chronology than for the proposed knock-on revisions to the chronologies of surrounding cultures. The Centuries of Darkness (CoD) debate has recently been met with increased interest, partly due to the organisation of three colloquiums on the subject of ancient World Chronology. The conference papers of the third colloquium were published by Peter James and Peter van der Veen in Solomon and Shishak: Current Perspectives from Archaeology, Epigraphy, History and Chronology (Archaeopress, Oxford, 2015). For a balanced review of this work ‚Äì albeit in Spanish ‚Äì by Dr Juan M. Tebes (2017), see the bibliography below. A clearly more negative review was published by Professor Bernd Schipper in Zeitschrift fuer die Alttestamentliche Wissenschaft 128:1 (2016), 179‚Äì180. A significant review of this book, by Assyriologist Ronald Wallenfels, provides many positive and constructive comments. Wallenfels concurs with James in no longer accepting the equation of Shoshenq I with \\"Shishak\\" of Kings/Chronicles as axiomatic. In The Sunken Kingdom: The Atlantis Mystery Solved, James gives a hypothesis for the location of Atlantis. By first claiming that references to mythological Tartarus by Plato were in fact meant to identify a Lydian king by the name of Tantalus, James identifies Atlantis with a hypothetical lost temple city called Tantalis, now Manisa, Turkey.

In 2018, a controversial project by the Maldivian government was set to destroy two-thirds of the vegetation of the island including dense jungle and cultivation land, to build an airport and luxury hotel on the island. The project will confine the residents of the island to just the settlement and they will lose access to half of the island's beach area. Activists have been campaigning raising concern about the need for the project when there is a domestic airport just 25 minutes away Demography Education Being a small population, the island faces many challenges.

Hulhudhuffaaru was an uninhabited island until 1995 when it was officially declared as inhabited after relocating the people of two other smaller islands in Raa Atoll - Ungulu and Undoodhoo - to this island.  History  Historical evidences from the island suggest that people have lived in the island at some time in the history. Remains of human skull are still being found in many places in the island while digging. Remarkably, like most islands in the Maldives, there is also a ‚Äúziyaaraaiy‚Äù or a tomb of a respected person adding more to the evidences that the island was inhabited. Nothing much is known, however, about the person in the tomb. =Inhabitation= Under a government-financed project, the people left their former islands with the hope of better basic facilities such as education and health care, harbor, etc. when they move to a bigger island with a bigger population than before. The residents of the islands of Ungulu and Undoodhoo were given funds by the government after estimating the value of their properties in their former islands. The people then built their homes in Hulhudhuffaru on their own. People started moving to the island in the early 1990s, until the entire communities of both Ungulu and Undoodhoo were completely relocated. Hulhudhuffaru was officially declared as inhabited on 13 March 1995 by President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom on a visit to the island. That day, unusually, a small protest was held on the island by islanders, who destroyed a display board in the island office, set up by government officials, purportedly praising the government and saying that the islanders were satisfied with the project. The \\"testimonials\\" on the board outraged many who felt that they were not compensated fully for their property and were not provided what they were promised. =Aftermath of the 2004 tsunami= The disastrous tsunami of December 2004 that hit Asia devastated Kandholhudhoo island in Raa Atoll. As a result, the residents of Kandholhudhoo were forced to seek shelter in other islands, Hulhudhufaaru being one of them. Hence even though the tsunami did not have a direct impact on the island, it has had enormous indirect impact on the island community. 5 November 2005 saw disturbances between the communities of the displaced residents of Kandholhudhoo and the Hulhudhuffaaru island community. The disturbances left injuries to some people, and significant damages to public and private property. Since then, security personnel were present in the island until the displaced people were relocated to Dhuvaafaru Island. Geography The island is north of the country's capital, Mal√©.

The model was produced from 1995 to 1999, when production was halted, partly due to slow sales of the cars and mismanagement of the company.  History and specifications  The car was based on the Lamborghini Diablo utilising most of its mechanical components and its V12 engine as Megatech owned Lamborghini at that time and took such steps to produce the car in higher volumes at a low cost. The engine was centrally mounted in front of the gearbox rather than behind it as in the Lamborghini. The styling was a loose copy of the Vector AWX-3, which was a still born project due to the Megatech takeover and later infringed by former company owner Wiegert after he initiated lawsuits and patented the designs to avoid them being reused. The new owners, Megatech, hired designer Peter Stevens to create a more civilised and modern recreation of the AWX-3. The drivetrain was a Lamborghini V12 engine, which had a power output of at 5,200 rpm and of torque at 4,900 rpm. This differed from the twin-turbocharged Rodeck V8 engine in the W8 and the AWX-3, as they were considered to be too costly for series production of the new model. The W8 and AWX-3's engines were transversely mounted, unlike the M12's V12 which was longitudinally mounted. The engineering changes placed the cockpit slightly forward than in the AWX-3, with a shorter nose and longer tail. The M12 was able to accelerate from in 4.8 seconds and had a top speed of .  Production  Vector M12 ASR race car Megatech intended the M12 to be a more road- friendly version of the AWX-3, which could get up to 13 miles per gallon of fuel efficiency. 17 cars were produced in total, which included three or four pre-production models and 14 production models. One of the M12 pre-production cars was converted to motorsport specification by the factory, but did not perform successfully due to mechanical problems. This car would again be converted, this time into the SRV8 that was intended to be the successor to the M12. The M12 production run ended in 1999 when Vector could not pay Lamborghini for the engines. Lamborghini took a W8 as payment, but Wiegert litigated for ownership of that car and won the case.  In the media  The Vector M12 earned the inauspicious award from Autoweek Magazine as being the worst car ever tested in the history of AutoWeek. The M12 is featured in a number of video games, including: * Gran Turismo 2, as both the production version and as an LM edition; * Mercedes Benz World Racing, as a downloadable car * Sports Car GT * San Francisco Rush * Rush 2: Extreme Racing USA * Grand Theft Auto III and Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories, under the name \\"Infernus\\"  References  Category:Vector Motors Category:Rear mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive vehicles Category:Sports cars Category:Cars introduced in 1995 Category:Cars of the United States ","title":"Vector M12"},{"id":"2365885","text":"Inguraidhoo (Dhivehi: ﬁáﬁ®ﬁÇﬁéﬁ™ﬁÉﬁ¶ﬁáﬁ®ﬁãﬁ´) is one of the inhabited islands of Raa Atoll.

The reason is believed to be because carpentry pays well (carpentry is a very good money- maker).

The term can also refer to individual congregations. While some Black churches belong to predominantly African-American Protestant denominations, such as the African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME), many Black churches are in predominantly White Protestant denominations, such as the United Church of Christ (which developed from the Congregational Church of New England). There are also many Black Catholic churches. Most of the first Black congregations and churches formed before 1800 were founded by free Blacks ‚Äì for example, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Springfield Baptist Church (Augusta, Georgia); Petersburg, Virginia; and Savannah, Georgia.\\"Gillfield Baptist Church, Petersburg, Virginia\\" , Virginia Commonwealth University Library, 2008, accessed 22 Dec 2008 The oldest Black Baptist church in Kentucky, and third oldest in the United States, was founded about 1790 by the slave Peter Durrett.H. E. Nutter, A Brief History of the First Baptist Church (Black) Lexington, Kentucky, 1940, accessed 22 Aug 2010 The oldest Black Catholic church, St Augustine in New Orleans, was founded by free Blacks in 1841. After slavery was abolished, segregationist attitudes towards Blacks and Whites worshiping together were not as predominant in the North as compared to the South. Many White Protestant ministers moved to the South after the Civil War to establish churches where Blacks and Whites worshiped together. In some parts of the country, such as New Orleans, Black and White Catholics had worshiped together for almost 150 years before the Civil War‚Äîalbeit without full equality and primarily under French and Spanish rule. The attacks by the Ku Klux Klan or Whites opposed to such efforts thwarted those attempts and even prevented Blacks from worshiping in the same churches as Whites. In communities where Blacks and Whites worshiped together in the South shortly after the Civil War, the persecution of Blacks was less severe. Yet, freed Blacks most often established congregations and church facilities separate from their White neighbors, who were often their former masters. In the Catholic Church, the rising tide of segregation eventually resulted in segregated parishes across the South, even in places where segregation had not previously been the norm. These new, Black churches created communities and worship practices that were culturally distinct from other churches, including forms of Christian worship that derived from African spiritual traditions. These churches also became the centers of communities, serving as school sites, taking up social welfare functions such as providing for the indigent, and going on to establish orphanages and prison ministries. As a result, Black churches were particularly important during the Civil Rights Movement.  History  =Slavery= African American Baptist Church, Silver Hill Plantation, Georgetown County, South Carolina Evangelical Baptist and Methodist preachers traveled throughout the South in the Great Awakening of the late 18th century. They appealed directly to slaves, and a few thousand slaves converted. Blacks found opportunities to have active roles in new congregations, especially in the Baptist Church, where slaves were appointed as leaders and preachers. (They were excluded from such roles in the Anglican or Episcopal Church.) As they listened to readings, slaves developed their own interpretations of the Scriptures and found inspiration in stories of deliverance, such as the Exodus out of Egypt. Nat Turner, a Baptist preacher, was inspired to armed rebellion, in an uprising that killed about 50 White men, women, and children in Virginia. Both free blacks and the more numerous slaves participated in the earliest black Baptist congregations founded near Petersburg, Virginia, Savannah, Georgia, and Lexington, Kentucky, before 1800. The slaves Peter Durrett and his wife founded the First African Church (now known as First African Baptist Church) in Lexington, Kentucky about 1790.Robert Hamilton Bishop's An Outline of the history of the church in the state of Kentucky, during a period of forty years (containing the memoir of Rev. David Rice), T. T. Skillman, 1824, pp. 230‚Äì33. The church's trustees purchased its first property in 1815. The congregation numbered about 290 by the time of Durrett's death in 1823. Following slave revolts in the early 19th century, including Nat Turner's Rebellion in 1831, Virginia passed a law requiring black congregations to meet only in the presence of a white minister. Other states similarly restricted exclusively black churches or the assembly of blacks in large groups unsupervised by whites. Nevertheless, the black Baptist congregations in the cities grew rapidly and their members numbered several hundred each before the Civil War. (See next section.) While mostly led by free blacks, most of their members were slaves. In plantation areas, slaves organized underground churches and hidden religious meetings, the \\"invisible church\\", where slaves were free to mix evangelical Christianity with African beliefs and African rhythms. With the time, many incorporated Wesleyan Methodist hymns, gospel songs, and spirituals.Rosemary Skinner Keller (2006), \\"Encyclopedia of Women and Religion in North America: Women and religion: methods of study and reflection\\", Indiana University Press, p. 997 The underground churches provided psychological refuge from the white world. The spirituals gave the church members a secret way to communicate and, in some cases, to plan a rebellion. Slaves also learned about Christianity by attending services led by a white preacher or supervised by a white person. Slaveholders often held prayer meetings at their plantations. In the South until the Great Awakening, most slaveholders were Anglican if they practiced any Christianity. Although in the early years of the First Great Awakening, Methodist and Baptist preachers argued for manumission of slaves and abolition, by the early decades of the 19th century, they often had found ways to support the institution. In settings where whites supervised worship and prayer, they used Bible stories that reinforced people's keeping to their places in society, urging slaves to be loyal and to obey their masters. In the 19th century, Methodist and Baptist chapels were founded among many of the smaller communities and common planters.Anne H. Pinn, Fortress Introduction to Black Church History, Minneapolis, Minnesota: Augsburg Fortress, 2002, p. 2. During the early decades of the 19th century, they used stories such as the Curse of Ham to justify slavery to themselves. They promoted the idea that loyal and hard-working slaves would be rewarded in the afterlife. Sometimes slaves established their own Sabbath schools to talk about the Scriptures. Slaves who were literate tried to teach others to read, as Frederick Douglass did while still enslaved as a young man in Maryland. \\"Wade in the water.\\" A postcard of a river baptism in New Bern, North Carolina, around 1900. =Free Blacks= Free Blacks in both northern and southern cities formed their own congregations and churches before the end of the 18th century. They organized independent black congregations and churches to practice religion apart from white oversight. Along with white churches opposed to slavery, free blacks in Philadelphia provided aid and comfort to slaves who escaped and helped all new arrivals adjust to city life. In 1787 in Philadelphia, the black church was born out of protest and revolutionary reaction to racism. Resenting being relegated to a segregated gallery at St. George's Methodist Church, Methodist preachers Absalom Jones and Richard Allen, and other black members, left the church and formed the Free African Society. It was at first non-denominational and provided mutual aid to the free black community. Over time, Jones began to lead Episcopal services there. He led most of its members to create the African Church, in the Episcopal tradition. (Butler 2000, DuBois 1866). In the fall of 1792, several black leaders attending services at St. George's Methodist Church and had recently helped to expand the church. The black churchgoers were told to sit upstairs in the new gallery. When they mistakenly sat in an area not designated for blacks, they were forcibly removed from the seats they had helped build. According to Allen, \\"...we all went out of the church in one body, and they were no longer plagued by us\\". While he and Jones led different denominations, they continued to work closely together and with the black community in Philadelphia.... It was accepted as a parish and on July 17, 1794 became the African Episcopal Church of St. Thomas. In 1804 Jones was the first black priest ordained in the Episcopal Church. (Butler 2000, DuBois 1866). Richard Allen, a Methodist preacher, wanted to continue with the Methodist tradition. He built a congregation and founded the Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME). By July 29, 1794, they also had a building ready for their worship. The church adopted the slogan: \\"To Seek for Ourselves.\\" In recognition of his leadership and preaching, in 1799 Bishop Francis Asbury ordained Allen as a Methodist minister. Allen and the AME Church were active in antislavery campaigns, fought racism in the North, and promoted education, starting schools for black children. Finding that other black congregations in the region were also seeking independence from white control, in 1816 Allen organized a new denomination, the African Methodist Episcopal Church, the first fully independent black denomination. He was elected its first bishop in 1816. While he and Jones led different denominations, they continued to work closely together and with the black community in Philadelphia. Soon thereafter, Allen. Jones, and others began soliciting funds, again with the help of Rush. Their appeals met with resistance from white church leaders, many of whom had been supportive of the black community, but disapproved of a separate black church. Petersburg, Virginia had two of the oldest black congregations in the country, both organized before 1800 as a result of the Great Awakening: First Baptist Church (1774) and Gillfield Baptist Church (1797). Each congregation moved from rural areas into Petersburg into their own buildings in the early 19th century. Their two black Baptist congregations were the first of that denomination in the city and they grew rapidly.\\"Civil War history lesson: Petersburg, Virginia, embraces and expands its past\\", Boston.com, 9 March 2005, accessed 22 Dec 2008\\"First Baptist Church, Petersburg\\" , African American Heritage, accessed 22 Dec 2008 In Savannah, Georgia, a black Baptist congregation was organized by 1777, by George Liele. A former slave, he had been converted by ordained Baptist minister Matthew Moore. His early preaching was encouraged by his master, Henry Sharp. Sharp, a Baptist deacon and Loyalist, freed Liele before the American Revolutionary War began. Liele had been preaching to slaves on plantations, but made his way to Savannah, where he organized a congregation.\\"George Liele\\", Africans in America, PBS, accessed 14 Jan 2009 After 1782, when Liele left the city with the British, Andrew Bryan led what became known as the First African Baptist Church. By 1800 the church had 700 members, and by 1830 it had grown to more than 2400 members. Soon it generated two new black congregations in the city. Before 1850, First African Baptist in Lexington, Kentucky grew to 1,820 members, making it the largest congregation in that state. This was under its second pastor, Rev. London Ferrill, a free black, and occurred as Lexington was expanding rapidly as a city. First African Baptist was admitted to the Elkhorn Baptist Association in 1824, where it came somewhat under oversight of white congregations. In 1841, Saint Augustine Catholic Church was established by the Creole community of New Orleans. This church is the oldest Black Catholic parish in the United States. In 1856, First African Baptist built a large Italianate church, which was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. By 1861 the congregation numbered 2,223 members.John H. Spencer, A History of Kentucky Baptists: From 1769‚Äì1885, Vol. II, Cincinnati, OH: J.R.

After emancipation, Northern churches founded by free blacks, as well as those of predominantly white denominations, sent missions to the South to minister to newly freed slaves, including to teach them to read and write. For instance, Bishop Daniel Payne of the AME Church returned to Charleston, South Carolina in April 1865 with nine missionaries. He organized committees, associations and teachers to reach freedmen throughout the countryside. In the first year after the war, the African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church gained 50,000 congregants.\\"Daniel Payne\\", This Far by Faith, PBS, 2003, 13 January 2009. By the end of Reconstruction, AME congregations existed from Florida to Texas. Their missioners and preachers had brought more than 250,000 new adherents into the church. While it had a northern base, the church was heavily influenced by this growth in the South and incorporation of many members who had different practices and traditions.James T. Campbell, Songs of Zion, New York: Oxford University Press, 1995, pp. 53-54, accessed 13 Jan 2009 Similarly, within the first decade, the independent AME Zion church, founded in New York, also gained tens of thousands of Southern members. These two independent black denominations attracted the most new members in the South.\\"The Church in the Southern Black Community\\", Documenting the South, University of North Carolina, 2004, accessed 15 Jan 2009 In 1870 in Jackson, Tennessee, with support from white colleagues of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, more than 40 black Southern ministers, all freedmen and former slaves, met to establish the Southern-based Colored Methodist Episcopal (CME) Church (now Christian Methodist Episcopal Church), founded as an independent branch of Methodism. They took their mostly black congregations with them. They adopted the Methodist Doctrine and elected their first two bishops, William H. Miles of Kentucky and Richard H. Vanderhorst of South Carolina.\\"Roots of Christian Methodist Episcopal Church\\", Christian Methodist Episcopal Church Official website, accessed 15 Jan 2009 Within three years, from a base of about 40,000, they had grown to 67,000 members, and more than ten times that many in 50 years.Anne H. Pinn, Fortress Introduction to Black Church History, Minneapolis, Minnesota: Augsburg Fortress, 2002, p. 56 At the same time, black Baptist churches, well-established before the Civil War, continued to grow and add new congregations. With the rapid growth of black Baptist churches in the South, in 1895 church officials organized a new Baptist association, the National Baptist Convention. This was the unification of three national black conventions, organized in 1880 and the 1890s. It brought together the areas of mission, education and overall cooperation. Despite founding of new black conventions in the early and later 20th century, this is still the largest black religious organization in the United States. These churches blended elements from underground churches with elements from freely established black churches. The postwar years were marked by a separatist impulse as blacks exercised the right to move and gather beyond white supervision or control. They developed black churches, benevolent societies, fraternal orders and fire companies. James T. Campbell, Songs of Zion: The African Methodist Church in the United States and South Africa, New York: Oxford University Press, 1995, p. 54. In some areas they moved from farms into towns, as in middle Tennessee, or to cities that needed rebuilding, such as Atlanta. Black churches were the focal points of black communities, and their members' quickly seceding from white churches demonstrated their desire to manage their own affairs independently of white supervision. It also showed the prior strength of the \\"invisible church\\" hidden from white eyes.Peter Kolchin, American Slavery: 1619‚Äì1877, New York: Hill and Wang, 1994, p. 222. Black preachers provided leadership, encouraged education and economic growth, and were often the primary link between the black and white communities. The black church established and/or maintained the first black schools and encouraged community members to fund these schools and other public services. For most black leaders, the churches always were connected to political goals of advancing the race. There grew to be a tension between black leaders from the North and people in the South who wanted to run their churches and worship in their own way.James T. Campbell, Songs of Zion, New York: Oxford University Press, 1995, accessed 13 Jan 2009 Since the male hierarchy denied them opportunities for ordination, middle-class women in the black church asserted themselves in other ways: they organized missionary societies to address social issues. These societies provided job training and reading education, worked for better living conditions, raised money for African missions, wrote religious periodicals, and promoted Victorian ideals of womanhood, respectability, and racial uplift. =Civil Rights Movement= Ralph David Abernathy was a Baptist minister involved in the American Civil Rights Movement. Black churches held a leadership role in the American Civil Rights Movement. Their history as a centers of strength for the black community made them natural leaders in this moral struggle. In addition they had often served as links between the black and white worlds. Notable minister-activists of the 1950s and 1960s included Martin Luther King Jr., Ralph David Abernathy, Bernard Lee, Fred Shuttlesworth, Wyatt Tee Walker and C. T. Vivian.\\"The Black Church\\", Brotherly Love, Part 3: 1791‚Äì1831  Politics and social issues  The black church continues to be a source of support for members of the African-American community. When compared to American churches as a whole, black churches tend to focus more on social issues such as poverty, gang violence, drug use, prison ministries and racism. A study found that black Christians were more likely to have heard about health care reform from their pastors than were white Christians. Most surveys indicate that while blacks tend to vote Democratic in elections, members of traditionally African-American churches are generally more socially conservative than white Protestants as a whole. Same-sex marriage and other LGBT issues have been among the leading causes for activism in some black churches,Jeffrey S. Siker, Homosexuality and Religion: An Encyclopedia, 2007, p. 49. though a majority of black Protestants remain opposed to this stance. Nevertheless, some denominations have been discussing this issue. For example, the African Methodist Episcopal Church prohibits its ministers from officiating same-sex weddings, but it does not have a clear policy on ordination. Some members of the Black clergy have not accepted same-sex marriage. A group known as the Coalition of African American Pastors (CAAP), maintains their disdain for gay marriage. The CAAP president, Reverend William Owens, claims that the marriage equality act will cause corruption within the United States. The organization insists that a real union is between a man and a woman. They also believe that the law prohibiting gay marriage should have been upheld. The CAAP members agree that the Supreme Court had no right to overturn the constitutional ruling.  Black theology  One formalization of theology based on themes of black liberation is the Black theology movement. Its origins can be traced to July 31, 1966, when an ad hoc group of 51 black pastors, calling themselves the National Committee of Negro Churchmen (NCNC), bought a full-page ad in The New York Times to publish their \\"Black Power Statement\\", which proposed a more aggressive approach to combating racism using the Bible for inspiration.Barbara Bradley Hagerty, \\"A Closer Look at Black Liberation Theology\\", National Public Radio. Black liberation theology was first systematized by James Cone and Dwight Hopkins. They are considered the leading theologians of this system of belief, although now there are many scholars who have contributed a great deal to the field. In 1969, Cone published the seminal work that laid the basis for black liberation theology, Black Theology and Black Power. In the book, Cone asserted that not only was black power not alien to the Gospel, it was, in fact, the Gospel message for all of 20th century America.Obama and His 'White Grandmother' from 'The Wall Street Journal'Cornel West and Eddie S. Glaude, eds, African American Religious Thought: An Anthology, 2003 , p. 850. In 2008, approximately one quarter of African-American churches followed a liberation theology.Powell, Michael. \\"A Fiery Theology Under Fire\\", The New York Times, May 4, 2008. The theology was thrust into the national spotlight after a controversy arose related to preaching by Rev. Jeremiah Wright, former pastor to then-Senator Barack Obama at Trinity United Church of Christ, Chicago. Wright had built Trinity into a successful megachurch following the theology developed by Cone, who has said that he would \\"point to [Trinity] first\\" as an example of a church's embodying his message.TUCC Talking points ; see also [www.mcclatchydc.com/227/story/31079.html Margaret Talev, \\"Obama's church pushes controversial doctrines\\"], McClatchy Newspapers, March 20, 2008.

Smith, \\"The Neighborhood Context of Police Behavior\\", Crime and Justice, Vol. 8, Communities and Crime (1986), pp. 313-41. and fire protection, there are institutions that help to improve the physical and social capital of black neighborhoods. In black neighborhoods the churches may be important sources of social cohesion.Mary Pattillo-McCoy, \\"Church Culture as a Strategy of Action in the Black Community\\", American Sociological Review, Vol. 63, No. 6 (December 1998), pp. 767-84. For some African Americans the kind of spirituality learned through these churches works as a protective factor against the corrosive forces of poverty and racism.Wendy L. Haight, \\"'Gathering the Spirit' at First Baptist Church: Spirituality as a Protective Factor in the Lives of African American Children\\", Social Work, Vol. 43, 1998. Churches may also do work to improve the physical infrastructure of the neighborhood. Churches in Harlem have undertaken real estate ventures and renovated burnt-out and abandoned brownstones to create new housing for residents. Churches have fought for the right to operate their own schools in place of the often inadequate public schools found in many black neighborhoods.Azi Paybarah, \\"A Harlem Church Sues to Operate Charter School \\", October 25, 2007. Traditions Like many Christians, African-American Christians sometimes participate in or attend a Christmas play. Black Nativity by Langston Hughes is a re-telling of the classic Nativity story with gospel music. Productions can be found at black theaters and churches all over the country.Black Nativity Black Nativity The Three Wise Men are typically played by prominent members of the black community. Historically black denominations Throughout U.S. history, religious preferences and racial segregation have fostered development of separate black church denominations, as well as black churches within white denominations. =African Methodist Episcopal Church= Richard Allen The first of these churches was the African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME). In the late 18th century, former slave Richard Allen, a Methodist preacher, was an influential deacon and elder at the integrated and affluent St. George's Methodist Church in Philadelphia. The charismatic Allen had attracted numerous new black members to St. George's. White members had become so uncomfortable that they relegated black worshipers to a segregated gallery. After white members of St. George's started to treat his people as second-class citizens, in 1787 Allen, Absalom Jones, also a preacher; and other black members left St. George's. They first established the non-denominational Free African Society, which acted as a mutual aid society. Religious differences caused Jones to take numerous followers to create an Episcopal congregation. They established the African Episcopal Church of St. Thomas, which opened its doors in 1794. Absalom Jones was later ordained by the bishop of the Philadelphia diocese as the first African-American priest in the Episcopal Church. Allen continued for some years within the Methodist denomination but organized a black congregation. By 1794 he and his followers opened the doors of the all- black Mother Bethel AME Church. Over time, Allen and others sought more independence from white supervision within the Methodist Church. In 1816 Allen gathered four other black congregations together in the mid-Atlantic region to establish the African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church as an independent denomination, the first fully independent black denomination. The ministers consecrated Allen as their first bishop. =African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church= The African Methodist Episcopal Zion or AME Zion Church, like the AME Church, is an offshoot of the ME Church. Black members of the John Street Methodist Church of New York City left to form their own church after several acts of overt discrimination by white members. In 1796, black Methodists asked the permission of the bishop of the ME Church to meet independently, though still to be part of the ME Church and led by white preachers. This AME Church group built Zion chapel in 1800 and became incorporated in 1801, still subordinate to the ME Church. In 1820, AME Zion Church members began further separation from the ME Church. By seeking to install black preachers and elders, they created a debate over whether blacks could be ministers. This debate ended in 1822 with the ordination of Abraham Thompson, Leven Smith, and James Varick, the first superintendent (bishop) of the AME Zion church. After the Civil War, the denomination sent missionaries to the South and attracted thousands of new members, who shaped the church. =National Baptist Convention= The National Baptist Convention was first organized in 1880 as the Foreign Mission Baptist Convention in Montgomery, Alabama. Its founders, including Elias Camp Morris, stressed the preaching of the gospel as an answer to the shortcomings of a segregated church. In 1895, Morris moved to Atlanta, Georgia, and founded the National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc., as a merger of the Foreign Mission Convention, the American National Baptist Convention, and the Baptist National Education Convention. The National Baptist Convention USA, Inc. reports to have 7.5 million members around the globe from 31,000 congregations, thus making it the largest black religious organization in the United States. =Church of God in Christ= In 1907, Charles Harrison Mason formed the Church of God in Christ (COGIC) after his Baptist church expelled him. Mason was a member of the Holiness movement of the late 19th century. In 1906, he attended the Azusa Street Revival in Los Angeles. Upon his return to Tennessee, he began teaching the Pentecostal Holiness message. However, Charles Price Jones and J. A. Jeter of the Holiness movement disagreed with Mason's teachings on the Baptism of the Holy Spirit. Jones changed the name of his COGIC church to the Church of Christ (Holiness) USA in 1915. At a conference in Memphis, Tennessee, Mason reorganized the Church of God in Christ as a Holiness Pentecostal body. The headquarters of COGIC is Mason Temple in Memphis, Tennessee. It is the site of Martin Luther King's final sermon, \\"I've Been to the Mountaintop\\", delivered the day before he was assassinated. =Other denominations= John H.

Description VIN etching uses a variety of methods, commonly a stencil and an acidic etching paste, to engrave a vehicle's vehicle identification number (VIN) onto the windshield and windows. Most parts on a vehicle already have at least a partial VIN stamped onto them, and many auto parts buyers will not purchase parts that carry identification numbers. Should a thief try to sell the parts from a vehicle for profit, those marked parts carry a higher risk for the thief and the auto parts seller. Since automotive glass generally does not have identification numbers and is often interchangeable among many different years and models of vehicles, it usually yields a much greater profit for a thief compared to other components on the vehicle; because a vehicle's windows are stamped with the VIN, thieves would need to discard the glass before \\"parting out\\" the stolen vehicle, thus reducing or eliminating their profit. VIN etching can also increase the odds of recovery of a stolen car by police. VIN etching is recommended by police departments, insurance agencies, and government automobile/vehicle theft prevention agencies This service is sometimes offered free of charge at sponsored events. Vehicles with VIN-etched windows may be eligible for insurance rate reductions of as much as 15% in some US states. Some automobile dealers try to include VIN etching as an extra service to boost their profit margin when selling a vehicle; they may even pre-print a charge for VIN etching on the bill of sale, as if to suggest that VIN etching is mandatory rather than an optional, add-on service. Inflated dealership fees of $200 to $2,000 for VIN etching are not unheard of. However, consumer advocates note that while some states do require that dealers offer VIN etching, no states require that consumers purchase it from the dealer. Consumers who want to have the VIN etched on their vehicle windows but are unable to find a free etching service in their area can often save hundreds of dollars over the dealership fee by using a do-it-yourself VIN etching kit purchased from an Internet retailer or a local auto parts dealer, for as little as $20‚Äì25.

The product was developed by Peak Technologies in 1996 and released in November 1996 at COMDEX in Las Vegas Nevada. NetJet was named a 'Best in Show' product in the internet category. NetJet was derived from the ExpressO server developed by Innovative Desktop Inc. and acquired by Peak Technologies in June, 1996. ExpressO was the first widely distributed, commercially available java application server. NetJet features provided better response time and enhanced download speeds for web browsers by performing work in the background. NetJet caused a stir in the world wide web community in December 1996 when CNET magazine wrote: \\"Web accelerators--one of the hottest tools on the Internet--are supposed to make life easier for Net surfers, but they are causing some headaches for Web site operators.\\" At that time link prefetching was causing a number of HTTP requests to be delivered to each website the browser visited. While this increased browsing speed for the user it did cause web server traffic to be magnified, much to the concern of website administrators. NetJet paved the way for commercial Java technologies and may be considered notable because of the following: #It was the first commercially available, shrink wrapped application written for the Java platform. #It was the first software product updated over the internet. #It provided the first look ahead technologies to enable link prefetching. #It contained intelligent caching algorithms ensuring frequently visited content was fresh and up-to-date. #The product was the first software product to provide web update features allowing NetJet updates to be automatically downloaded online and applied to the product without user intervention. Category:Web accelerators Category:Computer-related introductions in 1997 The product acted as a client-side caching web proxy and was compatible with most web browsers. All fetched content was cached and updated within background threads based upon user's browsing habits. The 'smart cache' used several algorithmic tricks to ensure that content users browsed regularly was updated and fresh. This behavior sped up browsing, much of which was done through dial-up modem at speeds of 56 KBS.

Biography Benson was born and raised in Kansas City, Missouri, where he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Geology from the University of Missouri‚ÄìKansas City. He spent 30 years associated with the computer field, spanning the era from the introduction of modern mainframe computers to the dominance of the computer industry by microcomputers. Benson's partner Hal Woodward invented modern full text computer indexing and searching in 1981 based on the Federal Acquisition Regulation ‚Äì the search system was called FARA (FAR Automated), and Benson exploited the new field through companies he co-founded. Benson was active in the early days of Internet Relay Chat (IRC). In the early 1990s, he assembled a large collection of help files that became the predecessor to today's IRChelp.org. Benson was a founding member of the Personal Spaceflight Federation. Benson was on the Board of Directors of the California Space Authority from 2005 to 20072005-01-25 News release on SpaceRef was named one of the \\"50 People to Watch in 2005\\" by San Diego magazine, and was named 2005 \\"Alumnus of the Year\\" by the University of Missouri at Kansas City. He founded the non-profit Space Development Institute, and introduced the Benson Prize for Amateur Discovery of Near Earth Objects. Benson was Vice-Chairman and private sector representative on NASA's national Space Grant Review Panel. =SpaceDev= After a successful career as a computer industry entrepreneur, Benson decided to take on the challenge of starting a space commercialization venture. It combined his lifelong interests in science, technology and astronomy with his successful business experience. Benson started the trend of successful high tech entrepreneurs moving into the space development arena, by incorporating SpaceDev, Inc. as a publicly owned space exploration and development company in 1997. Benson and SpaceDev worked to develop the world's first private sector enterprise to profitably explore and develop space beyond earth orbit. SpaceDev's mission is to help \\"make space happen\\" for all of humanity, through the development of a comprehensive private space program, by delivering affordable and practical space technologies, products and solutions to SpaceDev's government and commercial customers, while creating value for SpaceDev stockholders. Benson searched NASA's archives and \\"saw the HL-20's potential as a project that had already received huge amounts of development money. [The vehicle had] friendly flying characteristics combined with a thick pedigree of expensive studies.\\" SpaceDev licensed the HL-20 technology from NASA and extended it to use for its new Dream Chaser suborbital spacecraft. Later, the Dream Chaser became a candidate for NASA's Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) Program for delivering cargo to and from the International Space Station. In the event, SpaceDev was not selected for award under COTS, but did sign a non-reimburseable Space Act Agreement to facilitate additional exchange of non-cash project milestones with NASA. Afterwards, Benson stepped down as Chairman of SpaceDev and founded the Benson Space Company to pursue the Dream Chaser project. \\"In the fall of 2007, Benson Space announced a partnership with United Launch Alliance to turn the Dream Chaser into an orbital vehicle by launching it on an Atlas V rocket. Benson and his team were going to try to go all the way to orbit.\\" SpaceDev acquired the former Integrated Space Systems, a space systems engineering firm, in 1998.SpaceDev SEC form 10KSB, 2000 In 1998, SpaceDev and its chairman James Benson were named in an administrative proceeding alleging securities fraud. The SEC alleged that SpaceDev and chairman Benson made false and misleading statements through various media in an attempt to increase its stock value. A settlement was later agreed upon that states that the SEC was founded in its allegations and SpaceDev cease and desist from committing or causing violations or future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder; and Mr. Benson cease and desist from committing or causing violations or future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act and Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. SpaceDev acquired the intellectual property of American Rocket Company in 1999 after AMROC's 1996 bankruptcy. The AMROC-derived hybrid rocket motors were used in several SpaceDev projects that followed. SpaceDev started developing the science mission CHIPSat for the University of California, Berkeley in 1999. In 2003, SpaceDev launched the United States' smallest, low-cost, high performance satellite named CHIPSat for NASA. CHIPSat is a suitcase-size science microsatellite that is also the first U.S. mission to use only TCP/IP Internet communications for end-to-end satellite operations control, becoming the first satellite whose mission control and operations center is any laptop computer located anywhere in the world. Although the nominal mission duration was one year, the satellite operated successfully for almost five years when mission was terminated in April 2008. In 2004, SpaceDev's hybrid rocket motors were used by Burt Rutan's SpaceShipOne to win the $10 million Ansari X Prize. During his 10 years with the company, Benson served as founder, chairman, chief executive officer and chief technology officer of SpaceDev. He stepped down on September 28, 2006 to announce that he was starting a new venture called Benson Space Company. =Benson Space Company= Jim Benson announced on September 28, 2006 that he had launched an ambitious new venture focused on commercial space tourism, Benson Space Company (BSC). , Benson Space stated intentions to be first to market in the emerging multibillion-dollar space tourism or personal spaceflight industry, with the safest and lowest cost astronaut-making suborbital missions. \\"I am dedicated to opening space for all of humanity and, with SpaceDev well-managed and growing, I plan to spend the next several years creating the possibility that anyone who wants to go to space will be able to, safely and affordably,\\" said Benson in September, 2006. SpaceDev owns many of the patents and intellectual property rights associated with hybrid rocket motors used for safe human spaceflight. Under Benson's guidance, SpaceDev developed critical hybrid rocket motor technology and furnished all of the rocket motors for Paul Allen's SpaceShipOne, the craft that earned the $10 million Ansari X Prize in 2004. Benson Space had completed its first round of financing and submitted a request for proposal to SpaceDev for the design and development of its SpaceDev Dream Chaser spaceships.

The newspaper was first published in 1829 and is the oldest continuously-published daily newspaper in the United States. The newspaper has won four Pulitzer Prizes. The Journal bills itself as \\"America's oldest daily newspaper in continuous publication\\", a distinction that comes from the fact that The Hartford Courant, started in 1764, did not become a daily until 1837 and the New York Post, which began daily publication in 1801, had to suspend publication during strikes in 1958 and 1978. The paper's history has reflected the waxing and waning of newspaper popularity throughout the United States. History =Early years= The beginnings of the Providence Journal Company started on January 3, 1820, when publisher \\"Honest\\" John Miller started the Manufacturers' & Farmers' Journal, Providence & Pawtucket Advertiser in Providence, published twice per week. The paper's office was in the old Coffee House, at the corner of Market Square and Canal street. The paper moved many times over the next few decades as it grew. By 1829, demand for more timely news caused Miller to combine his existing publications into the Providence Daily Journal, published six days per week. The first edition of the Providence Daily Journal appeared July 1, 1829. =Knowles, Anthony & Danielson= During the years 1863 to 1884 the Journal was published by Knowles, Anthony & Danielson. These were Joseph Knowles, George W. Danielson and Henry B. Anthony. During this period the paper would reach new heights of political influence, aligning itself with the Republican party and against Irish and Catholic immigrants. Anthony would become one of Rhode Island's most powerful politicians, and go on to serve as Governor of Rhode Island and United States Senator. During the Knowles, Anthony & Danielson years, the paper became known for its strong support of the Republican Party, and became known by the nickname \\"The Republican Bible\\". The Republican party ruled the state for much of the mid-1800s, and the Journal was their mouthpiece. During the Danielson/Anthony years, the paper was solidly allied with textile mill owners and big business, and frequently gave support to nativist anti-Irish Catholic sentiment. In 1877, Danielson hired Charles Henry Dow, a young journalist with an interest in history. At the Journal, Dow developed a \\"news index\\" which summarized stories of historic interest. It is possible this was an early inspiration for Dow's later development of his \\"stock index\\" at the Wall Street Journal. While at the Journal Dow wrote a series on \\"The History of Steam Navigation between New York and Providence.\\" Dow also traveled to Colorado to report on the Colorado Silver Boom and the Leadville miners' strike; these stories were published in May and June 1879. On the Colorado trip, Dow traveled with a team of Wall Street financiers and geologists, leading Dow to leave Providence for New York City in 1879 to advance his career as a reporter on mining stocks. In 1863, Danielson launched an evening edition, called the Evening Bulletin. In 1885, a Sunday edition was added, making the publication schedule seven days per week. After Danielson's death, the paper became less partisan, and by 1888 declared its political independence. Alfred M. Williams, editor from 1884 to 1891, broke from the Republican party and advocated for government reform, women's suffrage, and Indian rights. In contrast to Danielson and Anthony, Williams had a sympathetic appreciation for the Irish culture. =War years= Before American entry into World War I, Journal publisher and Australian immigrant John R. Rathom attempted to stir up public sentiment in favor of the war against the Central Powers. He frequently published expos√©s of German subversive activities in the United States, claiming that the Journal had intercepted secret German communications. By 1920, it was revealed that Rathom's information was supplied by British intelligence agents. Nonetheless, Rathom remained editor until his death in 1923. William H. Garrison joined the staff in 1914, and became the publisher and vice president four years later, in 1918. He and his partners sold the paper to Senator Peter G. Gerry in 1923. The Journal dropped \\"Daily\\" from its name and became The Providence Journal in 1920. In 1992, the Bulletin was discontinued, and its name was appended onto that of the morning paper: The Providence Journal-Bulletin. Starting in 1925, the Journal became the first in the country to expand coverage statewide. It had news bureaus throughout Rhode Island and southeastern Massachusetts, a trend that had been inaugurated in 1925 by then-managing editor Sevellon Brown. Bureaus in Westerly, South Kingstown, Warwick, West Warwick, Greenville, Pawtucket, Woonsocket, Newport, Bristol/Warren in Rhode Island, and Attleboro and Fall River, in Massachusetts, were designed to make sure that reporters were only 20 minutes away from breaking news. In 1937, the only competing Providence-based daily, the Star-Tribune, went bankrupt and was sold. The Providence Journal company bought it and kept it running for four months, then shut it down. The paper also had a variety of regional editions, which it called \\"zones\\", that focused on city and town news. The system produced an intense focus on local news typically seen only in small-town newspapers. For example, everyone who died in the Journals coverage area, rich or poor, received a free staff-written obituary. =Postwar Pulitzers= Chief editorial writer George W. Potter won the Journal's first Pulitzer in 1945 for a series of essays, and the entire editorial staff won in 1953 for local deadline reporting. =Uncovering Nixon tax scandal= During the 1970s, reporter Jack White, then manager of the Providence Journal-Bulletin bureau in Newport, Rhode Island, cultivated sources among Newport's elite. One source passed on to White evidence that President Richard Nixon had paid taxes amounting to $792.81 in 1970 and $878.03 in 1971, despite earning more than $400,000. White discovered that Nixon had illegally back-dated the donation of his papers to the National Archives, in order to avoid a new law which made such donations ineligible for tax deductions. The night he was prepared to write the story, in September 1973, the union representing reporters at the newspaper voted to go on strike. White would later recall rolling the story out of his typewriter, folding it up and putting it in his wallet. He said he never thought about giving the story to management, even though he risked missing the story. Twelve days later, the strike ended, and the story ran on October 3, 1973. At an Associated Press Managing Editors convention the following month, Journal reporter Joseph Ungaro asked Nixon about the story. Nixon replied with a quote that was to become associated with him for the rest of his life: \\"People have got to know whether or not their president is a crook. Well, I am not a crook.\\" Shortly after this, the I.R.S. audited Nixon's tax returns. By December 1973, Nixon, under pressure, released five years of tax documents. This set a precedent for Presidents and presidential candidates to release tax returns, a custom that continued to 2016. White's story forced Nixon to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars in owed taxes. The story won White the 1974 Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting. In 1988 the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSICOP) presented reporter C. Eugene Emery Jr. with the Responsibility in Journalism Award for his researched claims of faith-healer Ralph A. DiOrio and wrote about the results in his journal. =1990s= In the 1990s, rising production costs and declines in circulation prompted the Journal to consolidate both the bureaus and the editions. The editors tried to reinvigorate the coverage of city and town news in 1996, but competition from the Internet added fuel to the decline. In 1997, the Livingston Award, sometimes called the \\"Pulitzer Prize for the Young,\\" was awarded to Journal reporter C. J. Chivers for International Reporting for his series on the collapse of commercial fishing in the North Atlantic. Chivers, aged 32 when he won the award, left the Journal in 1999 to go to The New York Times. =Labor troubles= In 2001, reports in industry journals suggested that the Providence Journal was suffering from labor troubles, in which a \\"poisoned\\" workplace atmosphere led to a \\"talent hemorrhage.\\" At least 35 news staffers left the paper between January 2000 and summer 2001, including 16 reporters, seven desk editors, two managerial staffers, and 10 administrative staff members. Publisher Howard Sutton denied there was a high turnover and called it normal attrition. In 2001 the Providence Newspaper Guild filed 44 charges of alleged unfair labor practices with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) between December 1999 and June 2001. Judge William G. Kocol held a hearing on the complaints and found in the union‚Äôs favor on 28 complaints in his ruling. In June 2001, Livingston Award-winning former Journal reporter C.J. Chivers added to the allegations when he wrote an open letter to Belo chairman Robert Decherd, critical of Belo's management. In the letter he expressed concern that poor management was responsible for the departure of 57 employees. He accused management of \\"assuming a counterproductive attitude toward its staff,\\" which included fights over expenses, and over-reliance on freelancers and interns. =Financial problems and sale= In the face of declining revenue, the paper began charging for obituaries on January 4, 2005. The paper's last Massachusetts edition was published on March 10, 2006. On Oct. 10, 2008, the paper stopped publishing all of its zoned editions in Rhode Island and laid off 33 news staffers, including three managers. Even during the Great Depression, the Journal had not terminated news staff to cut costs. The next few years included an extensive campaign to make the Internet version of the paper profitable. The Journal aggressively marketed its news on the web, pushing to get detailed stories onto its website, projo.com, before competing radio, television and other print outlets. But circulation continued to decline and online advertising failed to compensate. In June 2011, the Journal laid off more than a dozen employees and eliminated its Promotion Department which had internally handled the newspaper‚Äôs marketing and community affairs events for decades. On Oct. 18, 2011, with circulation down to about 94,000 on weekdays and 129,000 on Sundays (down from 164,000 and over 231,000 in 2005), the Journal renamed its website providencejournal.com, a move which meant that most of the previous Internet links to its content no longer worked. It also began implementing a system to require online readers to pay for content. Interactive images of its newspaper pages were initially available on personal computers and on the iPad for free. The paywall was put in place on February 28, 2012. The new website was part of a larger rebranding project by Nail Communications which also included a campaign entitled \\"We Work For The Truth\\".Providence Journal Commercial - \\"Truth\\" The rebranding failed to stem the circulation decline. Throughout most of its history, the paper was privately owned. After the Journal became publicly traded and had acquired several television stations throughout the country (as well as cable television systems under the banner of Colony Communications; these systems were sold to Continental Cablevision in 1995), it was sold to the Dallas-based Belo Corp. in 1996. Belo also owned several television stations. The company later split into two entities and one, A. H. Belo, took control of the newspapers. On Dec. 4, 2013, A. H. Belo announced that it was seeking a buyer for the Journal, including its headquarters on 75 Fountain St. and its separate printing facility. The company said it wanted to focus on business interests in Dallas. Workers were not surprised because the announcement came after the company sold one of its other papers, the Riverside Press-Enterprise in California. A. H. Belo announced on July 22, 2014, that it was selling the paper's assets to New Media Investment Group Inc., parent company of Fairport, N.Y.-based GateHouse Media, for $46 million. By then, the Journal's Monday through Friday circulation had dropped to 74,400, with an average of 99,100 on Sundays. Its website was getting 1.4 million unique users on an average month. The sale was completed on Sept. 3, 2014, as several employees, including widely respected columnist Bob Kerr, were told they would not be transferred to the new company. Bernie Szachara, senior vice president for publishing and group publisher at Local Media Group, a division of GateHouse Media, assumed the title of interim publisher, succeeding Howard G. Sutton. On Feb. 27, 2015, Janet Hasson was named president and publisher of the Journal. (The GateHouse Media news release announcing the appointment incorrectly reported that Hasson was the paper's first female publisher. That distinction belongs to Mary Caroline Knowles, who was publisher from 1874 until 1879.) The paper reported the following October that its average daily paid circulation for the past year, including electronic copies, had dropped to 70,600 with 89,452 on Sundays. By June 2017, circulation was down to about 72,000 on Sundays and 56,000 on weekdays. Headquarters The paper in its early days changed headquarters frequently as the paper grew. The paper's original office was in the old Coffee House, at the corner of Market Square and Canal street. In 1823 it moved to the Union building, on the west side of the bridge, and in the following year to the Granite building, Market Square. In May, 1833, the office moved again to the Whipple building on College street. From 1844 to 1871, the paper was housed at the Washington buildings. In July, 1871 the paper moved to the Barton block on Weybosset street. In May, 1889, the paper purchased the Fletcher building at the corner of Westminster, Eddy and Fulton streets. In 1905 the paper announced its move from Eddy Street to a brand new building next door at the corner of Eddy and Westminster St. The old building was demolished, and the new building extended over the site of the old. The ornate new building was designed by the noted Boston architectural firm of Peabody and Stearns. The Journal moved in 1934 to its present building on Fountain Street where the original Benny's store was located.

The daily edition of the paper followed suit in 1995 (becoming Volume XXIII) upon the termination of the Evening Bulletin. In July 2017, the Journal announced it was reverting to the original volume numbering.

The state park's include a tidal river, a broad salt marsh, white sand beaches, rocky shores, and a large stone pavilion dating from the 1930s. It is managed by the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. History During the 19th century, various fertilizer operations occupied the site. The park traces its beginnings to 1931, when conservationists purchased the land and held it until the state legislature authorized state purchase. During the Great Depression, a 356-foot, timber-and-granite pavilion was constructed by federal relief workers. Features ;Pavilion The Ellie Mitchell Pavilion is a Rustic-style building completed in 1936 by the Works Progress Administration. The curved masonry building stands more than long and wide. It is the largest Depression- era structure in the state. Construction began in the early 1930s as part of an effort to ease crowding at Hammonasset State Park. Much of its timber and granite were drawn from local suppliers and quarries and from an abandoned fish fertilizer plant on the grounds. Supporting pillars were fashioned from trees cut from each of the state parks and forests. The pavilion was handed over to the state in October 1936 and opened as the Ellie Mitchell Pavilion. Visitors could purchase food, eat in the dining areas, and warm themselves by eight fireplaces during cooler months. In 1986, the pavilion and its surrounding were listed on the National Register of Historic Places. ;Footbridge The park is crossed by the Northeast Corridor, Amtrak's main line from New York to Boston, on a right-of-way first chartered in 1848 by the New Haven and New London Railroad. A 1934 footbridge carries pedestrians over the tracks between the pavilion and its parking lot. The arched steel bridge has been documented by the Historic American Engineering Record, which describes it as \\"an unusual surviving example of a railroad footbridge.\\" ;Access road The park has its own exit (exit 72) on the Connecticut portion of Interstate 95. This exit is for the Rocky Neck connector, which is designated as the unsigned Connecticut Special Service Road 449.

The island is among the 10th biggest islands in the Maldives archipelago. According to the census 2014, Kendhikulhudhoo is home to 1767 people making the island most populous in the atoll after Velidhoo, Holhudhoo, and Manadhoo. History The most important day in the history of Kendhikulhudhoo was the day people of Tholhendhoo migrated to the island. Severe island erosion led the people of Tholhendhoo to migrate to Kendhikulhudhoo on 1 January 1993.  Geography  The island is north of the country's capital, Mal√©. Kendhikulhudhoo is located at 5¬∞ 56' 58\\"N degree of latitude and 73¬∞ 25'00'E degree of longitude. The island has an area of with a length of and width of . The geography of Kendhikulhudhoo is unique with six mangrove areas locally known as \\"kulhi\\" in the island. They are \\"Mai falhu\\", \\"Dhimaafalhu\\", \\"Hikikulhi\\", \\"Tholhifalhu\\", \\"Gan'baafalhu\\", Fin'dhana gonni and \\"Gaathudee kolhu\\". However, these mangrove areas are faced with a major problem of dumping garbage by the islanders. In addition, an aquaculture project carried out recently in the largest mangrove area \\"Mai falhu\\" destroyed part of the mangrove ecosystem in the area. Bluepeace, a non- government organization focused on environmental protection of Maldives reported that these mangrove areas absorbed much of the impact of the December 2004 saving the island from the destruction of property and loss of human lives. Several projects have been initiated by local NGOs to protect the mangrove areas in the island. One of such project was \\"Save KK\\" initiated by Society for Kendhikulhudhoo Island Development (SKID) in association with UNDP. Demography Kendhikulhudhoo has the 4th largest population in the atoll with a registered population of 1767 people of which 882 are male and 885 are female. However, only 1288 people live in the island as per census 2014. Since more men work in resorts, industrial islands, and capital Male‚Äô, 724 women live on the island compared to 564 men. As per the statistics of a secretariat of Kendhikulhudhoo council, the population of Kendhikolhu is slightly higher than the population of Kulhudhoo with 923 people in Kendhikolhu while 898 people in Kulhudhoo. The total number of households in Kendhikolhu and Kulhudhoo altogether is 241. The population of the island is expected to grow at 0.79% annually which is 0.17% higher than atoll population growth average of 0.69%. If the growth is maintained at this rate, the population would reach to 3000 people in 2021. Governance People in Kendhikulhudhoo resides in two wards namely Kendhikolhu (Dhivehi: ﬁÜﬁ¨ﬁÇﬁãﬁ®ﬁÜﬁÆﬁÖﬁ™) which is south of the island and Kulhudhoo (Dhivehi: ﬁÜﬁ™ﬁÖﬁ™ﬁãﬁ´) which is the north of the island. Until the local government law which was enacted in 17 May 2010, the two wards were two separate administrative units managed by island offices located in each ward. This developed rivalry and resistance which led to some social issues in the past.  Education  Kendhikulhudhoo School is the only school on the island. It is a public school under the jurisdiction of Ministry of Education which provides preschool, primary, secondary and higher secondary education. There are 455 students currently studying in the school. The school is renowned as a leading edge school in Noonu Atoll and were among the first schools to incorporate science as well as commerce stream subjects in secondary and higher secondary level. The school strives for excellence in all areas, with a well-led team of staff, all highly committed to improving the standard of teaching and learning. In addition, an outreach center under the Faculty of Open Learning of Maldives National University was recently established in the island. The center currently offers foundation, diploma and degree programs in the field of business, judicial administration and education. Courses open for admission in the center January 2017 include Bachelor of Business, Diploma in Judicial Administration, Bachelor of Teaching primary and English for Further Studies. There are some other educational institutions like Quran classes and tuition centers as well in the island.  Economy  The island has 16 shops and 6 restaurants. Most of the shops are dedicated to retail grocery and daily use items while there are 3 shops which sell garment and cosmetic items and 2 dedicated to selling construction materials as well. Major items required for construction like cement, timber and plastic pipe and fittings can be bought from these shops. Goods like furniture and other household items which are not available on the island are bought from the Atoll capital Manadhoo and Capital Male'. Majority of the working age population work in tourism industry especially the youth population. However, an equal number of people also work in the fishing industry. Currently, there are 7 fishing vessels operating on the island. Some have also found employment in the few government institutions in the island while others work in capital Male in public or private offices. There are 5 government institutions providing employment for the people. The biggest employer among them is Kendhikulhudhoo School followed by Kendhikulhudhoo health center and Secretariat of Kendhikulhudhoo council. Kendhikulhudhoo court and the branch of FENAKA cooperation in the island providing electricity to the households also provides some employment opportunities. The island does not have any bank or a branch of a bank. However, one retail shop provides a cash back service where customers can withdraw up to MVR 2000 per transaction from debit cards of Bank of Maldives. Apart from this, a team of Bank of Maldives visits the island every month for one day. This team provides some banking functions like deposits, withdrawals, and applications for different services offered by Bank of Maldives. = Tourism = Lack of proper transportation from the island to connect to major transport hubs in the country has limited the opportunity to open guesthouses and such tourist establishments in the island. The most common mode of transportation from the island to capital Male' is by boat which takes approximately 10 to 12 hours of travel. A scheduled speed boat also operates from Noonu Atoll to the capital twice a week. The domestic airport at Raa Atoll Ifuru is the closet airport to the island. It cost around MVR 3000 to travel from Kendhikulhudhoo to Ifuru by speed boat. There are speed boats for hire available on the kendhikulhudhoo and other islands close to the airport. Few also uses seaplane flying from Hulhule' International Airport to nearby resorts to access to the island. However, these planes are dedicated for tourist visiting the resorts, getting a seat from a seaplane is difficult and the operator cannot confirm your seat until the last moment. A couple of options are available for accommodation on the island. Currently, there are two dedicated places providing room for rental on a daily basis. The best known among them is the recently opened Rizofora Inn. Rizzafora Inn offers rooms per night at the rate of MVR 350. Apart from this, some households might also offer the extra room in their home for rental.

Pie played 55 games of the 2007 season with the Iowa Cubs. Pie was a highly touted young prospect, and put on the fast-track to reach the big-league club, although he did not start the season in the major leagues. Pie's strikeout rates continued to be much higher than average. Pie was called up from Triple-A Iowa on April 17, , and was in the starting lineup, replacing the injured Alfonso Soriano. At the time of his call-up, Pie was batting .444 with one home run and six RBI in 36 at-bats. Before the 2007 season, Pie was ranked as the number one prospect in the Cubs organization. He was nicknamed \\"The Cat.\\" Cubs on June 21, . Pie got his first major league hit on April 17, 2007, a double off Greg Maddux of the San Diego Padres.

However, the Cubs recalled Pie from the minors in order to replace an injured Alfonso Soriano and √Ångel Pag√°n on August 8, 2007. On August 9, Pie was brought back up to Chicago. When the Cubs traded their starting left-handed center fielder Jacque Jones in November 2007, general manager Jim Hendry indicated that the club wasn't necessarily looking outside for a veteran, with Pie and Sam Fuld in the mix. Fuld pushed Pie for the center field spot during spring training (Piniella in late February said that Pie was only \\"a head or nose in front\\" of Fuld).Daily Herald  Feeling right at home, Wood stays with Cubs \\"He's ready to go out there in spring training lined up next to Pie and compete to play center field\\", Hendry said of Fuld. Pie fell victim to the spring training injury bug that afflicted the Cubs. Originally deemed \\"a minor surgery on the groin region\\", Cubs.com reported the injury as \\"a twisted testicle\\", an injury more commonly known as testicular torsion. The surgery involved sewing the outer layer of the testicle to the scrotum wall. The surgery was deemed successful, and Pie reported back to spring training.The Official Site of The Chicago Cubs: News: Soriano suffers fractured fingerhttp://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080314&content;_id=2426522&vkey;=spt2008news&fext;=.jsp&c;_id=mlb Pie won the center field job competition in spring training, and started opening day in center field. However, due to a slow start and the signing of former Toronto Blue Jays outfielder Reed Johnson, Pie by May 2008 was utilized mostly in a platoon with Johnson and as a defensive replacement. The Cubs signed Jim Edmonds on May 14, 2008, and optioned Pie to Iowa to get some more work and play everyday. =Baltimore Orioles= On January 18, 2009, Pie was traded to the Baltimore Orioles for Garrett Olson and Single-A pitcher Henry Williamson.O's acquire outfielder Pie from Cubs In the 2009 season, Pie started in left field for the Orioles for most of April and part of May. However, his struggles at the plate and occasional mental lapses led to the Orioles calling up rookie Nolan Reimold, who had been playing well with the Triple-A Norfolk Tides and quickly seized the opportunity to become the Orioles' starting left fielder. While on the bench for most of June and July, Pie worked extensively on improving his swing and pitch recognition with Orioles' hitting coach Terry Crowley. Injuries to Orioles' center fielder Adam Jones and Nolan Reimold's nagging Achilles problem allowed Pie to play more regularly later in the season, and he showed significant improvement compared to his April performance. On August 14, 2009, Pie took full advantage of a spot in the starting lineup by hitting for the cycle, becoming only the fourth Oriole to ever do so. Pie won the starting left field assignment in 2010 after a very strong spring, but landed on the 60-day disabled list not long into the season, where he remained until July 6, 2010.

Hines Waterwall Park, formerly the Williams Waterwall and the Transco Waterwall, is a multi-story sculptural fountain that sits opposite the south face of Williams Tower in the Uptown District of Houston. The fountain and its surrounding park were built as an architectural amenity to the adjacent tower. Both the fountain and tower were designed by John Burgee Architects with Philip Johnson. Originally privately owned in common with the office tower, the waterwall and the surrounding land were purchased by the Uptown Houston Tax Increment Reinvestment Zone, a non-profit local government corporation, in 2008 to ensure the long term preservation of the waterwall and park. The fountain currently operates between 10 am and 9 pm.  Construction  John Burgee Architects and Philip Johnson, in coordination with developer Gerald D.

He became involved with militancy in December 1999 at secondary school, when he attended gatherings to watch videos about the glory of Jihad and detailing the atrocities of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the Yugoslav wars. The group studied under Ban-dar Marui and read the book Gladiator of Passion. The Hajj and Pakistan On February 15, 2000, Hamlan received a passport and after completing the Hajj, went to Sharjah, UAE, to obtain a visa to enter Pakistan. Once in Islamabad, Pakistan, he and two co-travelers were led by Hassan Ghul to a waypoint controlled by Abu Zubaydah. By March, they had crossed the border into Afghanistan where he attended the Al Khaldan training camp. When the camp was closed, he moved with its other members to Al-Farouq outside Kandahar, where he met Osama bin Laden. After injuring himself at the camp, Hamlan was assigned to guard Kandahar Airport, a task that the eventual hijackers Saeed al-Ghamdi and Waleed al-Shehri shared. Potential martyrs During his time at Al-Farooq and the airport, Hamlan is thought to have befriended Ahmed al-Nami. The two of them studied under Abu Basir al-Yemeni, who coaxed them to enlist with Abu Hafs al Mauritani as potential 'martyrs' who would carry out suicide missions inside the United States. Hamlan and Nami were sent to meet bin Laden, identifying themselves through the phrase \\"I want to be one of this religion's bricks and glorify this religion\\". In October 2000, Hamlan and Nami met with Khalid Shaikh Mohammed who instructed them on encrypting telephone calls. They also had their passports falsified to suggest that they were world travelers visiting locations such as Singapore, Malaysia, Egypt and Turkey. After a meeting with Muhammad Atef, they flew to Tehran, Iran, onward to Qatar and back into the UAE before arriving in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. On instructions from Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, they drove to Jeddah, where they stayed with the future hijacker Waleed al-Shehri. He instructed them how to obtain US visas, which both received on October 28. Return to family Hamlan did not use his visa. Immediately after they were issued their visas, Hamlan phoned his family and learned that his mother was ill. He decided not to pursue martyrdom and returned to his family. Khalid al Zahrani, an associate from Al-Farouq, visited him later to try to convince him to return, but failed.

Manadhoo is the third most populous island and the largest natural island in Noonu Atoll. History So far, the history of Manadhoo has not been studied by any authority despite having a historic place known as \\"Maamiskithu Vevu\\" a bathing tank with ancient Arabic calligraphy and well-bricked walls. Vevu (Dhivehi) or bathing tanks, were used as public baths and later for ablution. The actual period of this Vevu is unknown, however sandstone used in construction is evidence pointing to the pre-Islamic period (500BCE-1153AD).These types of baths are found in other parts of Maldives. Coral stone is also seen in some of the baths and mosques. This supports the theory that the Vevu was built earlier than most coral stone mosques. Little information is available on the ancient people and their way of life. Evidence suggests that Manadhoo has been populated and thriving as early as the 4th- century BC. It is argued that the earliest settlers migrated from Arabia, eastern Africa and the Indian subcontinent among other places. Geography The island is north of the country's capital, Mal√©. Geographically, Manadhoo is situated in the very centre of the atoll equally reachable for rest of other inhabited island to the north and south-west of the atoll. The island of Manadhoo measures approximately , and has a natural harbour surrounded by natural seawalls. The island is at the south-east of the atoll, according to the formation of the atoll. The major available land is uninhabited. Governance The island is the capital of South Miladhunmadulu (Noonu Atoll), and most of the government offices have been established. *The Secretariat of the South Miladhummadulu Atoll Council *Manadhoo Police Station *Secretariat of the Manadhoo Council *Noonu Manadhoo Magistrate court *Noonu Atoll School *Noonu Atoll Hospital *Noonu Atoll Family and Children Service Centre *Maldives Inland Revenue Authority (MIRA) - Manadhoo Branch *Prosecutor General's Office - Miladhunmadulu Dhekunuburi Branch *Business Center - Manadhoo Branch *Maldives Post - Noonu Manadhoo Branch *Bank of Maldives - Manadhoo Branch The President of Manadhoo council is Mohamed Umar Adam Moosa. Demography Manaduans are a mixed race, as in any part of the Maldives. Economy The main livelihood of the population depends on construction carpentry work civil service, tourism, fishing and private business. The island has become a hub for the atoll ferry service, and wholesale business. Hence, respective citizens from other islands travel for medical and banking service, while retailers acquire their day-to-day supplies at the same rates as in the capital city. Most of the basic infrastructure was built through aid granted from overseas organizations, such as the recent upgrade to the harbour which was funded by French aid. The sewerage and sanitation systems were built through aid granted from the UN. Manadhoo has the atoll school, which was built with grant aid from Japanese government during the 1980s. Manadhoo is in close proximity to luxury hotels, which have been built recently, such as Soneva Jani and Cheval Blanc Randheli (operated by Louis Vuitton and Mo√´t Hennessy), now owned by Sheik Mansour from Abu Dhabi. The economy of Manadhoo is unhealthy like other islands of Maldives, hence no large-scale economic activities take place. Most of the citizens were engaged in public sector employment, with the rest employed in the tourism sector. There has been a plan to develop tourist guest houses on the island, knowing that Maafaru Airport would begin operation in 2018 (funded by investment from the UAE). This could be a vital turning point for Manadhoo, hence the island is capable of leasing large amount of land to the beach front facing towards sunset. =Other services= Atoll Development Council Guest House, Bank of Maldives Manadhoo Branch, Noonu Atoll Family and Children Service Center and Noonu Manadhoo Post contributes to the infrastructure of the island.  Education  Noonu Atoll School is located on the island. Traditionally, education in the Manadhoo was limited to the basic literacy skills; namely the recital of the Quran, reading and writing the Dhivehi language. The modern system of English medium education was introduced in 1997.  Health  Noonu Atoll Hospital, the STO Pharmacy and Maldivian Redcrescent Noonu Branch Office. The island has severely poor achievements in human population. Culture =Language= Dhivehi is the language spoken in Manadhoo. Spoken only in Maldives, Dhivehi belongs to the Indo-Aryan branch of the Indo-European family of languages. It has numerous loanwords from Tamil, Malayalam, Sinhalese, Arabic, Urdu, Hindi, Portuguese and English. =Religion= Islam is the official religion of the Republic of Maldives.

Many of the more than 300 inductees since 1972 were born in Virginia or enjoyed success in college, professional, amateur or Olympic sports after moving to the state. Each April the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame inducts eight new members into its ranks. From 2005-2017, the Hall of Fame operated a museum in Portsmouth. In 2017, to reduce expenses and dependence on government support as well as increase sponsorship interest, it changed its business model, closing the building in Portsmouth and moving its operations to Town Center in nearby Virginia Beach. There it placed many of its educational exhibits and Hall of Honor, listing all inductees, in high-rise office and hotel lobbies within that popular mixed-use development. It made the displays accessible to the public through a novel and free pedestrian tour called \\"Walk the Hall\\" and began hosting a variety of sports oriented programs throughout Town Center of Virginia Beach, where its offices are now situated. The non-profit changed its website address to www.VaSportsHOF.com. The Hall of Fame has a statewide board of directors and an Honors Court that receives and reviews nominations of potential inductees, announcing its selections each December.

His stark poster-like artwork often dealt with themes of social alienation and spiritual emptiness. All his work was done for publication, rather than in 'fine art' media such as paintings or series of prints. As a result, he has been neglected in comparison with contemporaries such as Graham Sutherland and John Piper, but Wragg's choice of medium was an ideological one. As a socialist and pacifist, Wragg wanted his art to speak directly to common people rather than to art-lovers. His vivid, polemical style had considerable influence on other popular forms in the 1940s and 1950s, such as government information posters and advertising. He was born in Eccles, Greater Manchester, and grew up in Harrogate, Yorkshire, along with his sister Amy Wragg, born 1898. He was the son of George Arthur Wragg (a travelling soap salesman for Lively Polly) from Sheffield, Yorkshire, and Alice Smethurst Eckersley (a telegraphist) from Salford, Lancashire (a member of the prominent Williamson family of Salford). He trained at Sheffield School of Art before settling in London as a freelance commercial artist, in which capacity he was in continuous demand for the rest of his life. In the 1920s he contributed mostly to various women's illustrated magazines, but later branched out into book-jackets and work for left-wing newspapers such as Tribune and Peace News (including cartoons) and illustrations for books and pamphlets about Christian socialism, pacifism and social justice. Out of this more committed range of work, and out of the social issues raised by the Great Depression of the 1930s, came several books in which Wragg illustrated biblical texts in a politicised way, notably The Psalms for Modern Life (Selwyn & Blount 1933) which went through several reprints. The simplified block-style and dramatic chiaroscuro effects of these illustrations make them resemble woodcuts rather than pen and ink drawings (misleading some collectors into thinking the books are just reissues of hand-printed original editions) and there are many affinities with the visual-symbolic language of propaganda art, although Wragg's agenda is more generalised. Social realities and symbols are blended to convey deprivation, justice, conscience, and the persistence of spiritual values in the alienated urban-industrial environment. A friend and follower of the popular pacifist preacher Canon Dick Sheppard, Wragg became a sponsor of the Peace Pledge Union and was a conscientious objector during World War II. After imprisonment, he became an art-teacher in schools, returning to freelance work after the war. His personal style became more airy and more fantastical, and sometimes surreal. From 1953 until his death he produced illustrations for record covers for the Argo record company. As yet there is no catalogue of his work but there is a book about the artist: Arthur Wragg: Twentieth-century Prophet and Jester (Sansom 2001) by the late Judith Brook, who had been taught art by him at school. Early in his career he featured as the 'Artist of Note' in the long-running magazine The Artist (Vol XI No 5, July 1936).

LII electronically publishes on the Web the U.S. Code, U.S. Supreme Court opinions, Uniform Commercial Code, the US Code of Federal Regulations, several Federal Rules, and a variety of other American primary law materials.. LII also provides access to other national and international sources, such as treaties and United Nations materials. According to its website, the LII serves over 30 million unique visitors per year. Since its inception, the Legal Information Institute has inspired others around the world to develop namesake operations. These services are part of the Free Access to Law Movement. History LII was established in 1992 at Cornell Law School by Professor Peter Martin and Tom Bruce with a $250,000 multi-year startup grant from the National Center for Automated Information Research. The LII was originally based on Gopher and provided access to United States Supreme Court decisions and the US Code. Its original mission included the intent to \\"carry out applied research on the use of digital information technology in the distribution of legal information,...[and t]o make law more accessible.\\" In the early years of LII, Bruce developed Cello the first web browser for Microsoft Windows. Cello was released on 8 June 1993. In 1994 LII moved from Gopher to the Web. Since 2007 the IRS has distributed its IRS Tax Products DVD with LII's version of 26 USC (Internal Revenue Code).

The man in the background is preparing the hose to deliver water to prevent harmful dust from rising up, whilst the operator is moving the saw to the required position. A substantial engine powers the unit. kerf left by a diamond blade used to cut control joints in concrete. A concrete saw (also known as a consaw, road saw, cut-off saw, slab saw or quick cut) is a power tool used for cutting concrete, masonry, brick, asphalt, tile, and other solid materials. There are many types ranging from small hand-held saws, chop-saw models, and big walk-behind saws or other styles, and it may be powered by gasoline, hydraulic or pneumatic pressure, or an electric motor. The saw blades used on concrete saws are often diamond saw blades to cut concrete, asphalt, stone, etc. Abrasive cut-off wheels can also be used on cut-off saws to cut stone and steel. The significant friction generated in cutting hard substances like concrete usually requires the blades to be cooled to prolong their life and reduce dust. Blade choice Choosing a proper diamond saw blade for the concrete saw is a necessary condition to perform a cutting task well. Apart from some basic aspects, for example, what diameters of diamond saw blades the concrete saw can accommodate, its arbor size and the blade's quality, there are some other important aspects which should also be considered: * The match between the diamond saw blade's features and the concrete/asphalt's type. For example, some concretes have steel bars in them (reinforced concrete) and some do not have. Some concretes' stone aggregate is pebbles and some is crushed rocks. Some concretes' curing time is long (cured concrete) and some is short (green concrete). The diamond saw blades should have different design to fit these concrete and asphalt. *Wet or dry cutting. Though diamond saw blades for concrete are usually laser welded, they are normally designed for wet cutting because the concrete to be cut is often very hard or abrasive. If the blades are used without adequate water, the diamond segment itself may break or the steel core below the segment may wear and break, and then the segment may fly out and may hurt the operator or people nearby. If you have to perform dry cutting for some reason (e.g. there is no water source near your work area), you can choose sharper diamond blades, and the dry cutting should be intermittent and shallow (you can do several passes of shallow cuttings to gain a deep cut) to keep the diamond blade cool. * Whether faster cutting or longer lifespan is needed. The basic cutting speed of the diamond saw blades should be first determined. On this basis, a blade which has a faster cutting speed or a longer lifespan can be selected. *The power output of the concrete saw. If the concrete saw has a high power output, the diamonds on the saw blade will receive a higher impact when cutting is performed. In this case, the diamond concentration of the diamond saw blade should be higher, or its bond should be harder. Whilst if the saw has a low power output, the diamond concentration should be lower or the bond should be softer to make the blade become sharper to ensure the cutting speed needed. Dust control Highway road workers using concrete saws and generating dust. Stones, rocks, sands and clays can contain large amounts of crystalline silica and are used to make kerbs, flags, bricks, tiles and concrete. Cutting these materials produces airborne dust containing very fine respirable crystalline silica (RCS) particles. These particles are small and it is not always possible to see the RCS dust in normal lighting.Dust Control on Cut-off Saws Used for Stone or Concrete Cutting Serious health effects, such as lung cancer or silicosis, can result from exposure to RCS. This is because fine RCS particles can penetrate deep into the lungs. There are following ways to reduce or control the dust: * Wet cutting with adequate water supply. * If possible, diamond saw blades should be used instead of abrasive saw blades to cut. Diamond saw blades normally cut more quickly than abrasive blades while requiring less water. * The concrete saw should have a local exhaust ventilation (LEV) system, which can capture the majority of dust emitted during the cutting operation. * When operating, the operator should always wear personal protective equipment (PPE). There are some other risks during the cutting process which will also need to be controlled to protect the operator and the passers-by, for example, noise, flying debris, hand-arm vibration, manual handling, electricity and refueling.

They are available in many different flavors. Mashed potatoes can be reconstituted from potato flour, but the process is made more difficult by lumping; a key characteristic of instant mashed potatoes is that it is in the form of flakes or granules, eliminating the chunkiness. Analogous to instant mashed potatoes are instant poi made from taro and instant fufu made from yams or yam substitutes including cereals. Poha, an instant rice mush, is also much in the same spirit, as more broadly are other instant porridges, formed from flakes, granules, or pearls to avoid lumping. Brands include Smash and Idahoan Foods. Flaked instant mashed potatoes are most commonly found in stores in the United States and Canada. Granulated forms are generally reserved more for institutional or restaurant use.  History  Dehydrated shredded potatoes from Oregon State University, ca. 1940. The practice of drying and grinding starchy root vegetables for preservation and portability is widely attested around the world, and likely dates back to before the advent of agriculture. Potatoes in particular have been freeze dried since at least the time of the Inca empire, in the form of chu√±o; another example is in Japanese Ainu cuisine, where potatoes are collected frozen from the ground in spring, then dried. , developed by Mr. Sullivan, titled \\"Dehydrate Potatoes and Process of Preparing the Same\\", and describing a product that was to be reconstituted in hot water, was applied for in 1905 and granted in 1912. Flake-form instant mashed potatoes date back at least to 1954, when two United States Department of Agriculture researchers were issued a patent for \\"Drum drying of cooked mashed potatoes\\" (), which describes the end product specifically being \\"as a thin sheet or flake\\". In 1962, Canadian scientist Edward A. Asselbergs was issued , entitled \\"Preparation of dehydrated cooked mashed potato\\", for a particular industrial method of producing the product.  Nutrition  Instant mashed potatoes have substantially more sodium than fresh potatoes, and much less dietary fiber. In other respects they are similar to mashed fresh potatoes in their nutritional qualities, about two- thirds starch by dry weight, with smaller amounts of protein, dietary fiber, and vitamins. The largest difference is the loss of vitamin C, although some products may be enriched to compensate. One hundred grams of unenriched instant mashed potatoes provides 11% of the Dietary Reference Intake of vitamin C, compared to 18% provided by the fresh potato version.Nutrition Facts and Analysis for Potatoes, mashed, dehydrated, prepared from granules with milk, water and margarine added  Other uses  * Thickening agent in gravy, soups and saucesAthens Banner Herald, \\"Thicken sauces and soups with instant potato flakes\\" *Sourdough starterAthens Banner Herald, \\"Try a bit of creativity with instant potato flakes\\" *Substitute for bread crumbsGlobal Post, \\"Things to Make With Instant Potato Mix\\" See also * List of instant foods * List of dried foods  References  Category:Potatoes Category:Canadian inventions Category:Dried foods Category:Instant foods and drinks ","title":"Instant mashed potatoes"},{"id":"2366194","text":"Ludwig van Beethoven's String Quartet No. 10 in E-flat major, Op. 74, was written in 1809 and is nicknamed the \\"Harp\\" quartet. The nickname \\"Harp\\" refers to the characteristic pizzicato sections in the allegro of the first movement, where pairs of members of the quartet alternate notes in an arpeggio, reminiscent of the plucking of a harp. Like many nicknames for Beethoven's works, this was created by the publisher. Movements =I.

Allegretto con variazioni = The fourth movement is a set of ornamental variations on a theme in E major. Its coda begins at m. 142.  Analysis  The first movement, of about ten minutes duration, is one of the best examples of Beethoven's management of musical tension. The short adagio introduction (24 bars long) is not tightly thematically integrated with the rest of the movement; it serves a similar function to the introduzione of the first movement of Op 59, No 3. The main motifs of the allegro are the lyrical melody appearing several bars from the beginning, and the pizzicato arpeggios played by two instruments accompanied by repeating quavers played by the other two. At first, these two themes appear thematically and rhythmically unrelated. It is only the last fifty bars that the listener discovers that Beethoven's true purpose is for them to be played simultaneously, beneath a frenetic violin part, to generate the climax of the movement. The Harp quartet parallels many facets of the Fifth Symphony. The heroic quality pervading Beethoven's middle period is heard extensively in the first movement. Both the Fifth Symphony and Harp quartet have intense scherzi. Nevertheless, the grand entrance to the opening of the finale of the Fifth is noticeably absent in the opening of Op. 74. The fourth movement of the Harp quartet follows a highly traditional theme and variations form. The Classical style of the fourth movement juxtaposed against the Heroic nature of the first movement frustrates Beethoven scholars who seek to contextualize this piece in Beethoven's stylistic trajectory.

The museum focuses on the contribution made by the United States to Allied victory in World War II. Founded in 2000, it was later designated by the U.S. Congress as America's official National WWII Museum in 2003. The museum is a Smithsonian Institution affiliated museum. The mission statement of the museum emphasizes the American experience in World War II. History The museum opened as the D-Day Museum, on June 6, 2000, the 56th anniversary of D-Day, focusing on the amphibious invasion of Normandy. As the Higgins boats, vital to amphibious operations, were designed, built, and tested in New Orleans by Higgins Industries, the city was the natural home for such a project. Furthermore, New Orleans was the home of historian and author Stephen Ambrose, who spearheaded the effort to build the museum. Ambrose also wrote a book entitled D-Day in 1994, which describes the planning and execution of Operation Neptune, which was launched on June 6, 1944. Museum description In addition to opening a second gallery exploring the amphibious invasions of the Pacific War in the original building, known as the Louisiana Memorial Pavilion, the museum has since opened the Solomon Victory Theater, the John E. Kushner Restoration Pavilion, the US Freedom Pavilion: The Boeing Center, and the Campaigns of Courage pavilion. There are further plans to construct what will be called the Liberation Pavilion. In 2017, the museum was ranked by TripAdvisor Travelers‚Äô Choice Awards as the #2 museum in the United States and #2 in the world. Within the large atrium of the Louisiana Memorial Pavilion several aircraft are on display, including a Supermarine Spitfire and a Douglas C-47 Skytrain suspended from the ceiling. A LCVP, or \\"Higgins boat,\\" is also usually on display in this pavilion. The exhibits in this pavilion focus on the amphibious landings in the European theater of the war and on the contributions of the home front. The Louisiana Memorial Pavilion is also home to rotating temporary exhibits, as well as the immersive and interactive train car (part of the larger \\"Dog Tag Experience\\" interactive), which opened in 2013. This part of the museum includes several permanent galleries, including the Home Front, Planning for D-Day, and The D-Day Beaches. The third floor of the Louisiana Memorial Pavilion includes an observation deck for closer viewing of the hanging aircraft. In January 2013, the museum opened The US Freedom Pavilion: The Boeing Center, which is the now largest building on the campus.National World War II Museum press release of January 13, 2013. Retrieved on July 12, 2020. The collection in the US Freedom Pavilion includes a B-17E Flying Fortress bomber, a B-25J Mitchell bomber, an SBD-3 Dauntless, a TBF Avenger, a P-51C Mustang, Corsair F4U-4 and an interactive submarine experience based on the final mission of the USS Tang. The B-17E is the airplane dubbed My Gal Sal, famous for having been lost over Greenland and recovered 53 years later. The US Freedom Pavilion was paid for with a $15 million donation from the Boeing Company and with a $20 million grant from the US Department of Defense with congressional approval.D.

The entire pavilion, including both galleries, measures 32,000 square feet. In June 2017, a new exhibit, The Arsenal of Democracy, opened in the Louisiana Memorial Pavilion, dealing the experience on the Home Front. The museum also has plans to open what will be called the Liberation Pavilion by 2020. Its goal would be to explore the \\"joys, costs, and meaning of liberation and freedom,\\" as well as how the legacy of World War II affects us today. Visitors to the museum are encouraged to allocate roughly 2¬Ω to 3 hours to tour the museum. An award-winning 4-D film, Beyond All Boundaries, is shown in the Solomon Victory Theater and gives the visitor an overview of the war on every front. Other multimedia displays are integrated into most of the museum's exhibits, notably the dozens of video oral histories conducted with veterans of the war by museum staff. The museum currently houses two restaurants, The American Sector Restaurant & Bar and the Soda Shop. The museum sponsors a wargaming club and holds a wargame convention each year called \\"Heat of Battle\\". The museum also hosts a World War II-themed quiz bowl tournament, which is televised on Cox 4 New Orleans. Relation to New Orleans Artillery and a \\"Higgins Boat\\" on display in the museum lobby The Museum closed for three months after Hurricane Katrina ravaged New Orleans on August 29, 2005, re-opening on December 3 of that year. A museum banner promoted the re-opening by proclaiming \\"We Have Returned,\\" a phrase made famous by General Douglas MacArthur regarding his eventual return to the Philippines in 1944. As of 2015, the Museum is in the midst of a $400 million capital expansion campaign called The Road to Victory: A Vision for Future Generations. The expansion has resulted in significant increases in attendance.National WWII Museum Sees Busiest Month Ever, 11 April 2012. Accessed 9 May 2012.

The School was established in September 2017, with a liberal arts college model as its basis. The School is the second of its kind in Russia, after the Smolny College. SAS was developed in the framework of the University of Tyumen‚Äôs strategy within the 5-100 Project. The School combines three major fields of study: social sciences, arts and humanities, and life sciences. The BA and MA programs offered by SAS are in English, though some courses are also available in Russian.  Academics  SAS faculty are a combination of full- time professors and visiting professors. Full-time professors are on a three- year contract. They are paid a subsistence level base salary. The remaining 80% of their salary is made up of performance bonuses which are automatically removed if they fail the annual external peer review. = Undergraduate education = In terms of the undergraduate education model, SAS is an honors college within the University of Tyumen.within the University of Tyumen. During the first two years, students follow the core curriculum and also take elective courses. Afterwards, students declare one of the seven majors: Information Technology and Digital Society, Cultural Studies, Life Sciences, Economics, Film and Media Studies, Historical Studies, and Sociology and Anthropology. Additionally, students complete one of the minors. = Graduate education = Currently, SAS is running one professional Master‚Äôs program: Master of Arts in Digital Cultures and Media Production, with the other one, Master of Arts in Experimental Higher Education, to be launched in the Fall of 2020. = Research = SAS research is carried out in multidisciplinary research teams. In 2020, there were five research teams operating within SAS. = Tuition = SAS offers a combination of state-funded, university-funded, and places with a tuition fee. Additionally, the best students according to the academic rating, receive scholarships. = Academic calendar = The academic year at SAS is divided into four quarters. = Faculty hiring model = Faculty are selected via the Project Design Session cluster hiring process, based on how they perform in multidisciplinary teamwork exercises.  Outreach  During the academic year, SAS offers open courses twice a week, which are free for the public to attend, are recorded and published on the School‚Äôs youtube channel.youtube channel Every summer, SAS runs a summer school for high-school students.  Network memberships  SAS is a member of the Consortium of Humanities Centers and Institutes, which currently has a membership of over 250 organisations around the world.  Building  SAS has a separate building, renovated in 2017. Apart from the School itself, there is a nonfiction bookstore and a caf√© in the building.  Controversy  SAS has been described as an \\"academic sweatshop\\" and an \\"abusive institution\\" by a former faculty member who canvassed the opinions of her colleagues and students for an article in openDemocracy.https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/odr/how-love-what-you-do-went- wrong-in-an-academic-sweatshop-in-siberia/ This article has been widely discussed in academic circles within Russia and beyond. In these discussions SAS has been criticised for not being open about the fact that it is run by faculty from Skolkovo Management School in Moscow, according to principles derived from Soviet-era management guru Georgi Shchedrovitsky. Skolkovo Management School is a private business school which is involved in training university and corporate management teams across Russia and uses, in its organization of teamwork, elements of Shchedrovitsky methodology.https://corporate.skolkovo.ru/en/corporate/method/ It is said on the Carnegie Moscow Center website that \\"Shchedrovitsky essentially viewed human beings as machines that must be programed to perform certain functions‚Äîessentially, the theory of ‚Äúsocial engineering.‚Äù\\"https://carnegie.ru/commentary/65015 However, the director of SAS, whose SKOLKOVO affiliation has now been included on his SAS bio in response to criticism that he concealed it, claims he has never been an adept of this management theory, that it only has a limited following at SKOLKOVO and is not nearly as radical as Carnegie center suggests. Although he has never himself been a faculty member in a liberal arts college, he says his vision of education and research was formed as a graduate student at St. Petersburg State University (Russia), at the University of California, Berkeley, as well as during his postdoc years at Columbia University and the University of Sheffield. He has described it as an \\"anti-human\\" philosophy in conversation with faculty, and compares it to the methods used in World Series Baseball by the Brad Pitt character in Moneyball. It is a model based on high attrition rates among students and faculty in order to find people willing to suppress their individuality as researchers in conformity with a rigidly abstract formula. 75% of the founding cohort left, were fired, or failed to have their contracts renewed in the first three years of the institute. However, the dire nature of the academic job market means SAS has a growing body of international faculty (currently representing 12 countries). A less critical analysis of SAS has recently been published by a team of Stanford graduate students who interviewed management-approved faculty and administrators under the title \\"Reimagining Russian Higher Education\\". Current SAS faculty are contractually prohibited from publicly criticising the school and most have chosen to stay silent about the controversy surrounding it. Those who did speak out did not have their contracts renewed. SAS has internal machinery devoted to cleaning the internet of the kind of critical commentary that is rife on social media;https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fsvetlana.yerpyleva%2Fposts%2F4001612636575332commentary posting counterfeit testimonials;https://tabiturient.ru/sliv/n/?1801 and misleading independent journalism such as the article '\\"Go big or go home\\" - My first teaching experience', written for a blog edited by the SAS Education Director, by an adjunct faculty member whom he hired to cover a teacher- shortage created by the school's brutal measures against its own faculty;https://www.echer.org/my-first-teaching-experience/ or 'A Bold Move in Multidisciplinarity and Academic Hiring' written by a SKOLKOVO employee for University World News.https://www.universityworldnews.com/post.php?story=20190422080823183 References External links * Category:Education in Tyumen Oblast Category:Universities in Russia Category:Tyumen ","title":"School of Advanced Studies"},{"id":"2366277","text":"A papponymic is a personal name based on the name of one's grandfather, similar to a patronymic, a name derived from the name of one's father.

Funadhoo is a very common Maldivian place name and is derived from the Dhivehi name for the tree Calophyllum inophyllum (or Funa) which grows on the shores of some islands. It is the administrative capital of Shaviyani Atoll. History =Overview= Sh.Funadhoo is the capital island of the atoll. The Shaviyani Atoll Office was established on 9 September 1958 by the state. Until 1 January 1968, the atoll office was located in Lhaimagu which was the capital of the atoll. The government declared that effective from 1 January 1968, the capital would be Farukolhu Funadhoo (Funadhoo) and hence, the atoll office was transferred to Funadhoo. =Migration= Under the policy to integrate population and development, the first phase of the project to relocate people from Firubaidhoo to Funadhoo was launched on June 6, 1996. The 26 houses planned for this phase were completed and handed over to their owners on the December 1, 1997. Geography Funadhoo Island is located on the eastern rim of Miladhummadulhu Atoll at approximately 73¬∞17'23.27\\"E and 6¬∞ 8'58.73\\"N\\". The island is located approximately 218 km from Capital Mal√© and has a domestic airport. Funadhoo is among the largest inhabited islands in Northern Maldives. The nearest island is Farukolhu Island located within the same lagoon about 1100m to the north. The nearest inhabited island is Lhaimagu Island located at 3.80 km. The nearest resort is JW Marriott Maldives Resort & Spa in Vagaru Island (11.2 km). Funadhoo is a fairly large island with a length of 3000m and a width of 585 m at its widest point. The total surface area of the island is 84.5 Ha (0.85 km2). This island appears to be a relatively stable and constantly growing island. During the last 50 years the island has grown in size including the natural merging of a separate island north of the Funadhoo. Islands coastal environment features a strip of vegetated land close to the coastline followed by a lagoon area between the main island. The lagoon area [locally known as Dhahfalhu] has become a mangrove habitat over the years. Dhahfalhu's southern part is locally known as Gabaa Kulhi, this part is mostly made of muddy clay, and its home for various wild life; including Mud crab, Truncated Mangrove Snail, Hermit crab, Mangrove crab, Grey heron, Great egret & many other migratory birds. Northern side of island also has a lake ‚ÄúGoni‚Äù which was formed after Funadhoo mainland merged with another island north of the Funadhoo. It was a freshwater lake until 2004 Tsunami, now it is a home for Tilapia, Mangrove crab and wetland birds. Health Basic medical care was introduced for the first time in the atoll with the establishment of a health centre on 25 December 1970 in the island of Lhaimagu . This health centre was shifted to Farukolhu Funadhoo (now Funadhoo ) in 1971 when the island was made the atoll capital. This health centre is now developed to Atoll Hospital which has a well-equipped laboratory, X-ray and operation theatre facilities and are manned by a Gynecologist, Anesthetist, Pediatrician, General surgeon and a general practitioner. Transport Maldivian (airline) has commenced scheduled direct flights to Funadhoo Airport on February 3, 2020. There is a well-established sea transport mechanism between Male and Funadhoo. This includes daily speed ferry service & Cargo-passenger ferry services from Funadhoo to Mal√© and from Mal√© to Funadhoo. There are more than 3 speed ferry service providers in the area. One-way trip takes around 4 to 5 hours and price ranges between MVR 600-750 per head. There are 5 Cargo-passenger ferry boats which transit Funadhoo harbor, unlike speed ferry service, these ferries are slow, one-way journey takes around 10 hours & price ranges between MVR 250-350 per head. On the other hand, Funadhoo is connected to the northern business hub Kulhudhuffushi via cargo-passenger ferries operated by MTCC. These ferries also operate around the atoll connecting people to atolls capital Funadhoo. The first test flight to the regional airport developed in Shaviyani Funadhoo landed on January 24, 2020. National carrier Maldivian, on 3rd February 2020, successfully landed first schedule flight at the domestic airport in Funadhoo, Shaviyani Atoll at 8:13 am in the morning. Operations will first see three flights to the airport per week, which will be increased to three per day by the end of March.

The school opened in 1922 as a primary school specifically for African American students. The school is named after local civil rights activist, Douglas Anderson. In 1985, the school was renovated into a magnet high school specializing in performing, visual and language arts.http://dcps.duvalschools.org/domain/2500 Over the years, the school has accomplished many achievements including becoming a National Blue Ribbon School of Excellence and receiving numerous awards from the United States Department of Education, International Network of Schools for the Advancement of Arts Education and the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences. Notably, the school lacks any athletic programs. In December 2009, the school became a Florida Heritage Landmark by the Bureau of Historical Preservation. The ceremony was attended by students and school officials, Anderson's family and the first graduates of the school from 1959. History Opening in 1922 as The South Jacksonville Grammar School for grades 1--9\\\\. The school was primarily attended by African American students, the only school in the region during that time. In 1945, the school name changed to Douglas Anderson School. During the 1950s, the school morphed into a high school with the mascot of \\"Fiery Dragons\\" and in 1959, the school saw its first graduating class in 1959 with a commencement speech given by Benjamin E. Mays. During the 1960s, the school closed briefly and reopened in 1968 as a campus for Florida Junior College. In 1970, the school closed briefly again and reopened in 1971 as the Douglas Anderson Seventh Grade Center. In 1985, the school opened as Douglas Anderson School of the Arts becoming the only school in the county offering arts education. During its tenure, the school has produced award-winning performances in theatre, dance and music. Many students from the school were featured in major films including Brenda Starr, Sunshine State and The New Adventures of Pippi Longstocking as well as the short-lived television series Safe Harbor. Education The school focuses on providing a standard high- school curriculum along with creative education. Currently, the school offers instrumental music (including piano and guitar), vocal music, creative writing, performance and technical theatre, dance, visual arts and cinematic arts. Students are accepted to the school based on auditions offered in the winter and spring (and rarely, summer) of each school year. Vocal music, performance theatre, and dance students also have the opportunity to attend a second audition for entrance into the musical theatre program. In addition to excelling in their chosen area of artistic study, students are expected to maintain an average (>2.0) GPA. or face probation and/or eventual expulsion. Also, students can be put on probation for missing over 8 instructional units. Each department features an end of year \\"jury\\" wherein a student's contributions to their respective department are assessed and critiqued. \\"Extravaganza\\" is an annual performance event showcasing students' work. It is held at the Times-Union Center for Performing Arts in Jacksonville, FL. ;Creative writing The department was opened in 1990 and in 2006 became one of the last to receive its own building (although some departments have yet to receive their own buildings). Students take a variety of classes to learn, in depth, the techniques involved in writing fiction, poetry, and creative non- fiction, in addition to philosophy, humanities and literary history, playwriting, and journalism. The Creative Writing department produces a literary magazine, √âlan, and the school news magazine, The Artisan. For a short while the journalism classes also produced a magazine, titled Segue. The Creative Writing Department also organizes the school's Homecoming Dance, as well as a Writers' Festival which invites famous writers from around the world to read their works and give workshops to students and local writers. Writers who have attended the Douglas Anderson Writers' Festival include Margaret Atwood, George Saunders, Joyce Carol Oates, Tracy K. Smith, Sarah Kay, Ron Carlson, Richard Blanco, and Billy Merrell. ;Cinematic arts The formerly named \\"Film/TV Department,\\" established in 1997 under the instruction of Lorry Romano, is the newest department in the school. The department originally began as an extension of the Theatre Department. In 2001, it became its own department with only 10 students. Students are educated in all aspects of film making including writing, directing, editing, and cinematography. Each grade level focuses on different specialized projects that require a myriad of skills. The department supports a small number of extracurricular major film projects that act as the flagship pieces in the bi-annual film showcases. Department films have gone on to gain admittance and in some cases awards in national film festivals and the local Jacksonville Film Festival. In 2003, the department was given its own studio featuring a classroom and editing bay. During the time, students would film, produce and edit the \\"Brain Brawl\\" competition for WJCT. ;Dance The Dance department offers many different classes to about 150 students. The two performing groups, Creative Dance Ensemble and Dance Theatre, require an audition to join. Dance majors study every day with a rotating schedule of modern and ballet/pointe classes. The Dance department also offers electives such as Dance Production I and II, Jazz, Dance Career Prep, Research, American Musical Theatre, Dance Aesthetics, Variations, and Ethnic Dance. Also, all dancers are required to complete a Choreography credit during either their Junior or Senior year. ;Instrumental and vocal music Musical instruction is divided into four departments: piano, vocal, orchestra, instrumental‚Äîwhich includes both band and guitar groups.

In the summer of 2013, several piano students attended the Boukobza Academy in France and Belgium. The guitar department, the smallest, has been directed by Mr. Don Casper since its opening. Its guitar ensemble, entitled the Douglas Anderson Guitar Ensemble, opens at a yearly performance called the Great Guitar Gathering at the Florida Theatre. In the department, students take daily classes on classical guitar technique. In the solo classes the repertoire students are graded on is selected by the students from multiple books approved by the director. In the ensemble class, the director assigns pieces for students to rehearse and later perform at the aforementioned concert. The various groups perform throughout Florida and the nation on a regular basis. In 2006, the DASOTA Jazz Ensemble I, formerly under the direction of Ace Martin, won first place in the Essentially Ellington High School Jazz Band Competition and Festival in New York. Now, both Jazz Ensembles are led by Don Zentz. The vocal department's top group, Chorale Women, performed at the 2011 ACDA (American Choral Director's Association); a National Music Conference in Chicago. They are under the direction of Jeffrey Clayton and currently hold the title of the best high school women's chorus in the nation. Other honors include the invitation extended to the Symphonic Band to play at the Midwest Band and Orchestra Festival in 1999 under the direction of Tom Haller. The Wind Symphony, under the direction of Shawn Barat, performed at the 2008 MENC National Biennial In-Service Conference in Milwaukee, the 2009 FMEA In-Service Clinic-Conference in Tampa, and the 2011 Music For All National Concert Band Festival in Indianapolis. More recently, the Wind Symphony performed at the 2011 Midwest International Band and Orchestra Clinic in Chicago, IL, and the Chamber Orchestra performed at the same clinic the following year, becoming the first high school string orchestra in Northeast Florida to receive an invitation. The jazz band was also featured in the award-winning documentary Chops. The film followed the jazz band on their journey to the Essentially Ellington High School Jazz Band Competition and Festival starting with their first experience with jazz in middle school, at LaVilla School Of The Arts, and going through winning the competition. ;Performance and technical theatre The Performance and technical theatre department has existed since the school's inception. With a state-of- the-art theatre, as well as a modern 'black box' theatre, students have all the trappings of a professional theatre. The department averages four shows a year, including a children's show, a musical or Shakespearean play, and a contemporary piece. All theatre students are given a background of general theatrical knowledge, taking classes such as stagecraft, acting, plays and playwrights and theatre history, in addition to more specialized courses like Directing and Voice and Dialect. There is also an audition only acting class, in the style of a BFA program, called Company. It is made of 20 students from the department, with Class 3 being the first class to integrate both performance and musical theatre. The tech department allows students to assist in design, technical direction, and creation of costumes, props, and sets. Musical Theatre‚Äîa more recently added major opportunity‚Äîallows students to enter as either a theatre, vocal, or dance student, and integrate the three beginning in the second year. The performing theatre majors and tech majors are expected to prepare juries at the end of each school year that show their growth over the course of the year. In 2010, the theatre department began to produce a production of Mois√©s Kaufman's The Laramie Project. The production gained national attention as the infamous religious institution Westboro Baptist Church protested the event. A counter-protest was staged by current students, faculty, and staff along with city officials and alumni of the school. The production went as planned in April 2010. ;Visual arts In this arts area, many students take part in drawing, painting, sculpting, photography, printmaking, and art history. Gallery openings occur throughout the year to showcase the students' talent. There is an annual Senior Show marking the last gallery opening for the outgoing seniors, and in which they are the only contributors, subtracting the underclass work. The program boasts a fully operational and state-of-the-art photo lab, yearly student built installations around campus, and full facilities for printmaking, sculpture and drawing/painting classes. In 2002, the visual arts curriculum was challenged by one of its former students. During a lesson in sculpture history, a video was shown featuring nude depictions of Indigenous peoples of the Americas. The student's parents pressed the school board to fire the teacher and remove the section from the course. The case was eventually thrown out and the student chose to voluntarily leave the school.

History Milandhoo was uninhabited in 1997, when the Maldive's Minister of Atolls Abdulla Hameed launched a project to construct houses there and relocate residents from the neighboring island Maakandoodhoo, where the water had become contaminated. The resettlement was hastened in 2004, when the Boxing Day tsunami severely damaged Maakandoodhoo. The government officially recognized Milandhoo as an inhabited island on 20 March 2005. With more than 2140 residents, it is now the most populous island in Shaviyani Atoll. Geography The island is north of the country's capital, Mal√©. Milandhoo is at 06¬∞17‚Ä≤05‚Ä≥N 73¬∞14‚Ä≤36‚Ä≥E in the southeast of Shaviyani atoll between Maakandoodhoo and Nalandhoo. Covering 126 hectares, Milandhoo is the largest island in the atoll. In northwestern Milandhoo is a lake, Sikundi Kulhi (\\"Prawn Lake\\"), so named because of its abundant prawns and shrimp, which are transparent and up to long. Barracudas and a few other fish species also inhabit the lake, while crabs and hermit crabs live around its shore. Sikundi Kulhi is about long, wide, and up to deep. Clay deposited at its center is used for traditional medicine. Bottle gourd plants, ironwood, sea hibiscus and mangroves are common nearby, while great morinda and coconut palm are rare. In southwestern Milandhoo is a pond, Rayy Kulhi (\\"Red Pond\\"), so named because debris from bottle gourd plants and mangroves in the surrounding swamp redden its water. It is smaller and shallower than Sikundi Kulhi, but a popular picnic destination.

It is believed that they are early Maldivian settlers dating back to 5th century BC with the Aryan immigrants coming from neighboring countries India and Sri Lanka. The island had maintained its uniqueness like that of many other islands in the Maldives; its culture, traditions, language and religion had been as of any other island in Maldives. In Maldivian History, little has been written about Noomaraa. One of the available books was written by Maldives prominent historian Mr.Mohamed Ibrahim Luthufy in his famous history book \\"Dhivehi Raajjeyge Geographyge Vanavaru\\" (The Geographical Atlas of Maldives), in which he mentioned about the physical of the people of Noomaraa.

Economy Fishing is the backbone of the economy of Noomaraa, with most fishing done by pole and line. The government-owned Maldives Industrial Fisheries Company also operates in the region. Fish sought include tuna of the \\"Latti\\" and \\"Raagondi\\" kinds. These tuna are boiled and dried in the sun, then sold to buyers in Male. Locally caught fish are also used to make rihaakuru, a traditional fish soup. During the past years, fish catch has increased rapidly. Education In 1986, a school called \\"Noomaraa Makthab\\" opened on the island. In 1991, it moved to new premises and changed its name to \\"Noomaraa School\\". In 2005, it became a government school. In that year, secondary education began, with only business streams. The school had an enrollment of 95 in 2012.

A fishing weir, fish weir, fishgarth or kiddle is an obstruction placed in tidal waters, or wholly or partially across a river, to direct the passage of, or trap fish. A weir may be used to trap marine fish in the intertidal zone as the tide recedes, fish such as salmon as they attempt to swim upstream to breed in a river, or eels as they migrate downstream. Alternatively, fish weirs can be used to channel fish to a particular location, such as to a fish ladder. Weirs were traditionally built from wood or stones. The use of fishing weirs as fish traps probably dates back prior to the emergence of modern humans, and have since been used by many societies across the world. History The English word 'weir' comes from the Anglo- Saxon wer, one meaning of which is a device to trap fish. A line of stones dating to the Acheulean in Kenya may have been a stone tidal weir in a prehistoric lake, which if true would make this technology older than modern humans. In Ireland, fish traps in association with weirs have been found that date from 8,000 years ago. Stone tidal weirs were used across the world and by 1707, 160 such structures, some of which reached 360 metres in length, were in use along the coast of the Shimabara Peninsula of Japan. In medieval Europe, large fishing weir structures were constructed from wood posts and wattle fences. V-shaped structures in rivers could be as long as 60 m and worked by directing fish towards fish traps or nets. Such weirs were frequently the cause of disputes between various classes of river users and tenants of neighbouring land. Basket weir fish traps are shown in medieval illustrations and surviving examples have been found. Basket weirs are about two metres long and comprise two wicker cones, one inside the other ‚Äî easy for fish to get into but difficult to escape.Shooting and Fishing the Trent , ancient fish traps. In September 2014 researchers from University of Victoria investigated what may turn out to be a 14,000-year-old fish weir in 120 ft of water off the coast of Haida Gwaii, British Columbia./ Great Britain Remains of a medieval fish weir just above the low water mark at Lligwy Bay, Anglesey. In Great Britain the traditional form was one or more rock weirs constructed in tidal races or on a sandy beach, with a small gap that could be blocked by wattle fences when the tide turned to flow out again. Surviving examples, but no longer in use, can be seen in the Menai Strait, with the best preserved examples to be found at Ynys Gored Goch (Red Weir Island) dating back to around 1842. Also surviving are 'goredi' (originally twelve in number) on the beach at Aberarth, Ceredigion. Another ancient example was at Rhos Fynach in North Wales, which survived in use until World War I.Reid, Ian (2001): \\"Rhos- on-Sea Heritage Trail\\". BBC Wales North West website retrieved 7 August 2007. The medieval fish weir at Traeth Lligwy, Moelfre, Anglesey (pictured) was scheduled as an Ancient Monument in 2002. Fish weirs were an obstacle to shipping and a threat to fish stocks, for which reasons over the course of history several attempts were made to control their proliferation. The Magna Carta of 1215 includes a clause embodying the barons' demands for the removal of the king's weirs and others: A statute was passed during the reign of King Edward III (1327-1377) and was reaffirmed by King Edward IV in 1472Byrne, Muriel St. Clare, (ed.) The Lisle Letters, 6 vols, University of Chicago Press, Chicago & London, 1981, vol.2, p.622, quoting Luders, A., Statutes of the Realm, vol.2, 1810-28, pp.439-42 A further regulation was enacted under King Henry VIII, apparently at the instigation of Thomas Cromwell, when in 1535 commissioners were appointed in each county to oversee the \\"putting-down\\" of weirs. The words of the commission were as follows:Byrne, Muriel St. Clare, (ed.) The Lisle Letters, 6 vols, University of Chicago Press, Chicago & London, 1981, vol.2, p.628 > All weirs noisome to the passage of ships or boats to the hurt of passages > or ways and causeys (i.e. causeways) shall be pulled down and those that be > occasion of drowning of any lands or pastures by stopping of waters and also > those that are the destruction of the increase of fish, by the discretion of > the commissioners, so that if any of the before-mentioned depend or may grow > by reason of the same weir then there is no redemption but to pull them > down, although the same weirs have stood since 500 years before the > Conquest. The king did not exempt himself from the regulation and by the destruction of royal weirs lost 500 marks in annual income.Byrne, Muriel St. Clare, (ed.) The Lisle Letters, 6 vols, University of Chicago Press, Chicago & London, 1981, vol.2, pp623-627 The Lisle Papers provide a detailed contemporary narrative of the struggle of the owners of the weir at Umberleigh in Devon to be exempted from this 1535 regulation.Byrne, 1981, 6 vols., the matter is referred to in all 6 vols The Salmon Fisheries Act 1861 (relevant provisions re-enacted since) bans their use except wherever their almost continuous use can be traced to before the Magna Carta (1215). North America Salmon weir at Quamichan Village on the Cowichan River, Vancouver Island, ca 1866 Algonquin fishing with weir and spears in a dugout canoe. After a drawing by colonist, John White (1585) In Virginia, the Native Americans built V-shaped stone weirs in the Potomac River and James River. These were described in 1705 in The History and Present State of Virginia, In Four Parts by Robert Beverley Jr: This practice was taken up by the early settlers but the Maryland General Assembly ordered the weirs to be destroyed on the Potomac in 1768. Between 1768 and 1828 considerable efforts were made to destroy fish weirs that were an obstruction to navigation and from the mid-1800s, those that were assumed to be detrimental to sports fishing. In the Back Bay area of Boston, Massachusetts, wooden stake remains of the Boylston Street Fishweir have been documented during excavations for subway tunnels and building foundations. The Boylston Street Fishweir was actually a series of fish weirs built and maintained near the tidal shoreline between 3,700 and 5,200 years ago. Natives in Nova Scotia use weirs that stretch across the entire river to retain shad during their seasonal runs up the Shubenacadie, Nine Mile, and Stewiacke rivers, and use nets to scoop the trapped fish. Various weir patterns were used on tidal waters to retain a variety of different species, which are still used today. V-shaped weirs with circular formations to hold the fish during high tides are used on the Bay of Fundy to fish herring, which follow the flow of water. Similar V-shaped weirs are also used in British Columbia to corral salmon to the end of the \\"V\\" during the changing of the tides. The Cree of the Hudson Bay Lowlands used weirs consisting of a fence of poles and a trap across fast flowing rivers. The fish were channelled by the poles up a ramp and into a box-like structure made of poles lashed together. The top of the ramp remained below the surface of the water but slightly above the top of the box so that the flow of the water and the overhang of the ramp stopped the fish from escaping from the box. The fish were then scooped out of the box with a dip net.

Biography Craig Morgan during a USO performance, March 20, 2007 Craig Morgan Greer was born in Kingston Springs, Tennessee, on July 17, 1964. He became an Emergency medical technician at age 18. He served on active duty for nine and a half years in the US Army as a member of the 101st and 82nd Airborne Divisions and remained in the reserves for another six and a half years. Musical career Upon his return home to Tennessee, he worked various jobs to support his family, including as a construction worker, a security guard and a Wal-Mart employee. He would later land a job in Nashville singing demos for other songwriters and publishing companies. The demos led to releasing his first album with Atlantic Records, the self-titled Craig Morgan in 2000. It produced three singles including \\"Something to Write Home About\\", which reached number 39 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now Hot Country Songs) charts. The album was produced by Buddy Cannon and Norro Wilson, with co-writing credits from Cannon, Bill Anderson and Harley Allen among others. The album's final track, \\"I Wish I Could See Bakersfield\\", included a recitation from Merle Haggard. Country Standard Time critic Jon Weisberger gave the album a mixed review, saying that Morgan had a strong singing voice but that most of the songs were \\"by-the-numbers\\". Jim Patterson of The Ledger said that lead-off single \\"Something to Write Home About\\" was \\"pedestrian\\", but that the rest of the album was \\"an uncommonly assured hard- country effort\\". Late in the year, Morgan charted a Christmas single entitled \\"The Kid in Me\\". Morgan left Atlantic Records in early 2001 when the label closed its Nashville branch, but said that he was not afraid of his musical future because he still had a publishing contract at the time. =2002‚Äì2004: I Love It= In 2002, Morgan signed with Broken Bow Records. The label released his second album, I Love It, in March 2003. Leading off this album was \\"God, Family and Country\\", a song dedicated to former Nashville session drummer Randy Hardison, with backing vocals from the group 4 Runner. It peaked at number 49 on the country charts. Following this song was Morgan's second Top 40 hit, \\"Almost Home\\". The song originally fell off the Hot Country Songs charts from a peak position of number 33. However, it experienced an unexpected increase in airplay after falling off the charts, so it was reinstated at the number 25 position three weeks later. After re-entering the charts, the song went on to a new peak position of number six on Hot Country Songs, also reaching number 59 on the Billboard Hot 100. In addition, it won Morgan and co-writer Kerry Kurt Phillips a Song of the Year award from Broadcast Music Incorporated. The album's next two singles, \\"Every Friday Afternoon\\" and \\"Look at Us\\", both reached the country top 30. By 2004, the album had sold more than 300,000 copies, and its success was cited by Billboard as the beginning of a new wave of commercial success among independently signed country music artists. Rick Cohoon of Allmusic gave I Love It four stars out of five, saying that Morgan's songwriting was \\"well- crafted\\" and that his service in the Army justified the patriotic themes of \\"God, Family and Country\\". Jeffrey B. Remz of Country Standard Time commended the album for maintaining a neotraditionalist country sound, but said that the ballads were \\"generic\\". =2005‚Äì2006: My Kind of Livin= Morgan released his third album, My Kind of Livin', in 2004. It included eight songs that he co- wrote, and guest vocals from John Conlee and Brad Paisley on \\"Blame Me\\". The first single release, \\"That's What I Love About Sunday\\", became his only No. 1 on the country charts, spending four weeks in that position while also reaching No. 51 on the Hot 100. It was also the first No. 1 single for the Broken Bow label, as well as the first independently distributed single to top the country charts in five years, and the first such single to spend multiple weeks at that position since The Kendalls' \\"Heaven's Just a Sin Away\\" in 1977. \\"That's What I Love About Sunday\\" also placed at No. 1 on that year's Billboard Year-End charts for the country format. The album's next single, \\"Redneck Yacht Club\\", reached No. 2 on the country charts and accounted for his highest peak on the Hot 100, where it went to 45. After it came \\"I Got You\\". Morgan wrote this song while on tour with Keith Urban, with the intention of having Urban record it, but decided to keep it for himself after recording a demo of it. My Kind of Livin was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America for shipping 500,000 copies, and \\"Redneck Yacht Club\\" received a gold single certification for 500,000 music downloads. Chris Willman of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a B rating, saying in his review that \\"Morgan's is an idealized Kind of Americana, to be sure. But at least he provides enough writerly detail to avoid setting off smarm alarms.\\" Country Standard Time reviewer Jeffrey B. Remz was generally favorable in his review, saying that Morgan has \\"a strong voice\\" and \\"a number of quality songs\\", but his review criticized the album's \\"big and clean\\" production. =2006‚Äì2008: Little Bit of Life and Greatest Hits= Craig Morgan performing for the USO, March 20, 2007 His third and final album for Broken Bow, Little Bit of Life, was issued in 2006. Morgan and O'Donnell co-produced the album with Keith Stegall, a record producer known for his work with Alan Jackson, and Morgan co-wrote four of its eleven songs. The label shipped more than 200,000 copies of the album in its first week, and made special exclusive releases for retailers such as Target and Walmart. Three singles were issued: the title track, \\"Tough\\", and \\"International Harvester\\", all of which made the Hot Country Songs charts. Kevin Oliver of Country Standard Time commended the album's neotraditionalist sound and called Morgan \\"a classic country singer\\" but said that, beyond the title track and \\"Tough\\", \\"the traditional sound is mostly wasted.\\" Billboard reviewer Deborah Evans Price gave \\"Tough\\" a positive review, praising Morgan's \\"strong, warm voice\\" and calling the song \\"yet another gem\\" from the album. A greatest hits package followed in February 2008, shortly before his departure from Broken Bow. =2008‚Äì2010: That's Why= On September 18, 2008, Morgan was invited by John Conlee to become a member of the Grand Ole Opry. Conlee formally inducted him as a member during the October 25, 2008, edition of the Opry.\\"Craig Morgan Inducted as Newest Member of the Grand Ole Opry: Officially Inducted by Opry Member John Conlee\\", Grand Ole Opry official website, October 26, 2008 . Retrieved October 26, 2008. Although it had been first announced that Morgan would sign to Big Machine Records' sister label Valory Music Group, he instead signed to BNA Records, a division of Sony BMG Nashville. His first album for the label, That's Why, was released in October 2008. Its first single, \\"Love Remembers\\", became his sixth top ten hit by early 2009, but follow-up \\"God Must Really Love Me\\" peaked at number 26. BNA re-issued the album in May 2009, replacing two of its tracks with the newly recorded \\"Bonfire\\" and \\"This Ain't Nothin'\\". The former was released that month as the album's third single, also reaching top ten. In October 2009, the music video for \\"God Must Really Love Me\\" won Video of the Year from the Inspirational Country Music Awards. In early 2010, \\"This Ain't Nothin'\\" was released as the album's fourth single. It became a top 20 country hit by year's end. Stephen Thomas Erlewine criticized the album for having \\"uninspired\\" material, but praised Morgan's \\"cured country croon\\". In a more favorable review, Country Standard Time wrote that the songs were \\"simple but profoundly observant\\" and compared Morgan's singing voice to Randy Travis. Morgan's last single for BNA, \\"Still a Little Chicken Left on That Bone\\", was released in October 2010. The song peaked at number 37 on the country music charts in January 2011. A month later, he left the label. =2011‚Äì2015: This Ole Boy, The Journey (Livin' Hits)= On April 1, 2011, Morgan signed with Black River Entertainment. Two months later, he sang guest vocals on Colt Ford's single \\"She Likes to Ride in Trucks\\". Morgan's first release for Black River was \\"This Ole Boy\\", a song co-written by The Peach Pickers (Rhett Akins, Dallas Davidson, and Ben Hayslip) that also appears on Joe Nichols' 2011 album It's All Good. The song is the title track to Morgan's first Black River album, This Ole Boy, which was released on February 28, 2012. The title track was a Top 20 hit for Morgan on the Hot Country Songs chart. After it, \\"Corn Star\\" failed to make Top 40, while \\"More Trucks Than Cars\\" reached top 30. In July 2013, Morgan released \\"Wake Up Lovin' You\\", the first single from his second compilation album The Journey (Livin' Hits). Morgan canceled several shows in May 2014 due to surgical complications for torn tendons in his shoulders. =2015‚Äìpresent: A Whole Lot More to Me= The lead single to Morgan's third album for Black River Entertainment, \\"When I'm Gone\\", was released to digital retailers on September 18, 2015, and to radio on September 21, 2015. The song peaked at number 48 on the Billboard Country Airplay chart. The album, A Whole Lot More to Me, was released on June 3, 2016. In 2019, Morgan released a new single called \\"The Father, My Son, and the Holy Ghost,\\" written about the grief he experiences after his son Jerry's death at the age of 19. Upon hearing the song, Blake Shelton started a campaign on Twitter to help boost the song's chart position. Following this song's release, Morgan was re-signed to Broken Bow for distribution of the single. Personal life Morgan is married to wife Karen with whom he has five children: daughters Marisa and Alexandra and sons Kyle, Jerry, and Wyatt. He and his family currently reside in Dickson, Tennessee. In February 2011, Morgan rescued two young children from a burning house in Dickson, Tennessee, and then manned a fire hose to help put out the fire. On April 23, 2011, Morgan became an honorary initiate of the Delta Theta chapter of the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity. On July 10, 2016, Morgan's son, Jerry Greer, went missing after falling off an innertube in Kentucky Lake on the Tennessee River. His body was recovered one day later. He was 19 years old. Charitable efforts Morgan frequently performs at military bases both in the U.S. and abroad and on USO tours. He was awarded the 2006 USO Merit Award for his tireless support of US soldiers and their families. Having served in the military, Morgan told American Songwriter Magazine, \\"Because I have been there, I can appreciate that and have the ability to communicate with them a little differently.\\" Morgan has been active in raising money for the Special operations warrior foundation. Morgan has an annual two-day charity (Craig Morgan Charity Fund) for Billy's Place. The most recent, and fifth one, was held in Dickson, Tennessee on August 6‚Äì7, 2011. The event raised more than $95,000. Morgan came up with the idea for Billy's Place while serving as an assistant Dickson County sheriff's deputy from 1995 to 1996. Through the Craig Morgan Charity Fund, Morgan plans to provide lasting funding to the home.

The daughter of an influential family within Scientology which gave millions of dollars to the organization, she attended The Delphian School in Yamhill County, Oregon, which uses techniques developed by the movement's founder, L. Ron Hubbard. At age 19, Feshbach joined the Scientology division Sea Org, an elite group described by the organization as occupying \\"the most essential and trusted positions in the senior churches in the Scientology hierarchy\\". She was characterized in 2005 by MSNBC as a \\"Senior Scientologist\\", and by Fox News Channel as \\"a high-level Scientologist\\"; in 2006 MSNBC described her as \\"a high-level Scientology practitioner and member of the church's influential Feshbach family\\". Feshbach is most well known for her stint as Tom Cruise's assistant, and for her friendship with Katie Holmes during the couple's engagement. In this role she traveled with Holmes during publicity for the actresses's film roles, sat in on interviews, and responded to questions about Holmes from journalists. Warner Bros. made special accommodations for Feshbach to accompany Holmes during promotion of Batman Begins, and she attended Holmes' wedding to Cruise in Italy in 2006. Feshbach was later a guest of honor at Scientology's Patron Ball, held at the organization's headquarters in Britain. By 2009, Feshbach had become a high-ranking spokesperson for the Scientology organization. Early life and family Born on December 18, 1975, Feshbach comes from an influential family within Scientology. She is a devoted member of the organization, and her family, having given millions of dollars to the organization, are one of the most significant donors to Scientology. Her mother is Lucinda Horn Feshbach and her father was Joseph Feshbach, an investor in Palo Alto, California; he was profiled in a 1991 article about Scientology in Time magazine. Feshbach has a twin sister, Melissa, and an older brother Kurt. As of 2005, her aunt was the manager of a Florida-based Scientology center. Along with two brothers, Joseph Feshbach worked out of facilities in California and Clearwater, Florida. The Feshbachs are noteworthy for gaining wealth through the process of short selling companies on the stock market. The brothers are all devout adherents to Scientology, and have used Dianetics, a philosophy which serves as the base of Scientology methodology, to aid their trading techniques. One of Feshbach's uncles told the St. Petersburg Times that a Scientology program titled Super Powers had helped him improve his investing skills. Feshbach's brother Kurt later utilized the same approach to invest successfully. Feshbach received elementary education from The Delphian School, a private boarding school whose teaching techniques are based on the methodology of L. Ron Hubbard, the founder of Scientology. The Delphian School is located in Sheridan, Oregon, and delivers instruction to grades K-8. In 2005, Feshbach began going by the name Rodriguez, her second husband. Scientology official =Sea Org= In 1994, Feshbach joined the division of Scientology called the Sea Org, an elite unit within the organization. 3 News characterized the Sea Org as \\"Scientology's senior management\\". In their book Cults and New Religions, Douglas E. Cowan and David G. Bromley wrote, \\"Described by the Church as 'a fraternal religious order,' members of the Sea Org 'occupy the most essential and trusted positions in the senior churches in the Scientology hierarchy'.\\" Rolling Stone notes, \\"Sea Org members staff all of the senior ecclesiastic positions in the church hierarchy\\". As of 2010, there were 5,000 members in the Sea Org. Feshbach told the Associated Press, \\"When you sign up as a Sea Org member, you're signing up as a member of a religious order. You're a volunteer. You sign a contract that says, 'I'm not going to be paid minimum wage and I know that.'\\" As part of her ascent within the church's hierarchy, Feshbach completed Scientology courses including \\"Security Checker Internship,\\" \\"False Purpose Rundown Auditorship\\" and \\"Clear Certainty\\". In 2005, MSNBC characterized Feshbach as a \\"Senior Scientologist\\", and Fox News Channel called her \\"a high-level Scientologist\\" within the organization. In 2006, MSNBC described Feshbach as \\"a high-level Scientology practitioner and member of the church's influential Feshbach family\\". =Assistant to Cruise and Holmes= Feshbach soon began working as an assistant to Scientologist actor Tom Cruise. In April 2005, she transferred from her Sea Org duties to serve as a personal \\"handler\\" to his then-fiancee, Katie Holmes. Soon after beginning her relationship with Cruise, Holmes fired her long-time manager and agent, and Feshbach became her new \\"best friend\\". Feshbach tutored Holmes in Scientology methodologies, traveled with Holmes when the actress was interviewed during publicity events. In one cover story for W Magazine, journalist Robert Haskell wrote that Feshbach \\"was described to me as Holmes's 'Scientology chaperone' and it was clear that she would be on hand during our interview despite my protests.\\" Holmes simply characterized Feshbach as her best friend, and Feshbach said the same. During the interview, however, Feshbach intervened multiple times to answer questions posed to Holmes. Feshbach additionally accompanied Holmes to promote her film Batman Begins. Warner Bros., the studio that distributed the film, released a statement to New York Daily News that denied reported friction with Feshbach: \\"There's no discord between us and Jessica. We, in fact, made Jessica's hotel reservations for her and brought her along on our plane. If she's someone Katie wants to travel with, that's fine. The people who made the tour made every effort to accommodate her. It's a very amicable situation.\\" Later that year, along with Cruise and Holmes, Feshbach was a guest of honor at the Patron Ball, a Scientology event held at Saint Hill Manor, the organization's British headquarters. In 2006, Feshbach attended Holmes' wedding to Cruise in Italy. =Organization spokesperson= By 2009, Feshbach had become a public spokesperson for Scientology; she continued to serve in this capacity in 2010. Feshbach and Scientology official Tommy Davis held a meeting on February 27, 2009 in Burbank, California with actor Larry Anderson. Anderson, who had previously starred in the Scientology introduction film Orientation, asked Feshbach and Davis to give back money he had donated to the Scientology organization. Anderson recorded the 90-minute discussion and it was made public by the St. Petersburg Times. In June 2009, Feshbach commented on the expertise of Scientology leader David Miscavige to the St. Petersburg Times, regarding his experience in the methodology of the organization and his ability to monitor a controversial case involving the death of Scientologist Lisa McPherson. Feshbach asserted, \\"He is an expert in every field.\\" In July 2010 the Church of Scientology International publicized a \\"Scientology Newsroom\\" website tailored for members of the media; Feshbach was one of four international representatives for Scientology listed as \\"Spokespersons\\". =Life After Leaving Sea Org= In 2009, Feshbach married Scientology executive Tommy Davis in a small private ceremony.Wright, Lawrence ( February 14, 2011). \\"The Apostate: Paul Haggis vs. the Church of Scientology,\\" The New Yorker; http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/02/14/110214fa_fact_wright?currentPage=18 The pair divorced in 2018.

The series follows a brash NYPD detective who goes to London when one of his cases goes sour and remains to work with New Scotland Yard. The soundtrack and incidental music for the first episode was provided by British techno duo Orbital. Daniel Ash of Love and Rockets scored the rest of the series. The series was scheduled to premiere during the 2002‚Äì2003 television season, but was postponed and premiered as a summer replacement in June 2003. Fox canceled the series, pulling it from the schedule after airing seven episodes. The American cable network Bravo picked up the series to begin airing in January 2004, including the six episodes never aired on Fox. All thirteen episodes of the series were released on DVD by Paramount Home Entertainment on September 7, 2004; however, some of the music was replaced for the DVD release. Plot After his investigation into an oxycodone ring results in a botched drug bust, NYPD Detective Eddie Arlette is sent to London to assist Scotland Yard with its work on the same case. Eddie and his British police partner, Inspector Monty Pippin, help crack the case, and Eddie is asked to stay on at Scotland Yard. He initially declines but suddenly changes his mind to the surprise of those around him. In addition to his work, Eddie has an adversarial but flirtatious relationship with Fiona, who occupies the flat he is renting from her parents; she begrudgingly puts up with him (and his Bull Terrier, Pete), because he has threatened to reveal to her parents that she is not actually enrolled at university. Eddie frequently tries to make Fiona question her relationship with her boyfriend, Nigel. It is possible that he would like them to break up so he might be able to date Fiona. In the final episodes of the series, Eddie and Fiona seem to be forming a deeper connection with each other, while still maintaining their teasing relationship. In the final episode, it is predicted that Eddie will fall in love with a woman on a red bus. In the last moments of the episode, Eddie sees Fiona get off a red bus. He clearly notices this fact but chooses not to tell Fiona. Eddie's other influential relationship, while in England, is with his friend and co-worker Monty Pippin. On his first day in London, Pippin takes Eddie to a swingers club. Pippin explains that he is not actually married but he and a friend pretend to be, so they can take part in the club. Pippin has many other strange sexual habits. In one episode, Pippin joins a support group for \\"sexaholics\\" (nymphomaniacs) but tells the group his name is Eddie Arlett. He also drops his English accent and takes on an American one. He never takes the support group seriously and promptly attempts to seduce one of his group members. While Eddie puts up with Pippin's antics, he frequently tries to encourage Pippin to change. Eddie also states that Pippin's personality is not natural as everything Pippin does contradicts something he did previously. Eddie also has a flirtatious, albeit a seemingly imaginary, relationship with Carol Ross (Superintendent Nathanial Johnson's assistant), whom he calls \\"Ms. Moneypenny\\" and with whom he banters using double entendres. When he asks her seemingly innocent questions, she gives a sexual reply (\\"How are you, Miss Moneypenny?\\" \\"Completely...shaved.\\" or \\"What's new, Miss Moneypenny?\\" \\"Crotchless panties.\\" or \\"What's your position, Miss Moneypenny?\\" \\"On...all...fours.\\"). Eddie frequently asks those around him if they heard her response. Except for a single incident in the episode Keeping Up Appearances, no one ever appears to have heard her sexual response but simply hear a neutral comment (when he asks her how she's doing, he hears her say \\"Terribly horny\\", but anyone he asks heard \\"Terribly well\\"). Eddie's dog Pete is extremely ill-tempered. Eddie attempts to leave him in quarantine at the airport when he arrives in England but Pippin rescues Pete, by claiming Pete is a police dog. Pete chews on everything and frequently destroys TV remote controls and cellphones. He also has strange sexual appetites, from Fiona's cat Princess to a fur coat to sleeping humans. More than once, he has aggressively cornered visitors at the apartment and forced them to stand motionless for hours until Fiona or Eddie come home. Eddie also has a catchphrase when introduced to a villain or upon making an arrest: \\"Hi, I'm Eddie...how do you like me so far?\\" Cast =Main= The main cast of Keen Eddie * Mark Valley as Detective Eddie Arlette, NYPD * Sienna Miller as Fiona Bickerton * Julian Rhind-Tutt as Inspector Monty Pippin, New Scotland Yard * Colin Salmon as Superintendent Nathanial Johnson, New Scotland Yard =Recurring= * Alexei Sayle as Rudy Alexander * Rachael Buckley as Carol Ross A.K.A. \\"Miss Moneypenny\\" * Theo Fraser Steele as Nigel * Sophie Hunter as Lois * Daniel Goldenberg as Johnny Red * Alex McSweeney as One Ball Bill * Sarah-Jane Potts as Audry * Ivana Horvat as Milli * Anya Lahiri as Zoe * Meredith Ostrom as Dominique * Sarah Vandenberg as Valentine Hughes * Martin Hancock as Fishy * Nick Malinowski as Cheap Trick Episodes Paramount opted to put the episodes in the order they were aired, not produced, for the DVD release.

The time release feature allows the drug to suppress the cough reflex for a longer period of time. The active ingredient per teaspoon (5 mL) is dextromethorphan polistirex, equivalent to dextromethorphan HBr 30 mg. Method of action The active ingredient, dextromethorphan (metabolized to dextrorphan), is surrounded by an edible plastic called polistirex. When the Delsym arrives in the stomach, an initial amount of dextromethorphan is immediately released into the bloodstream while the rest is surrounded by a plastic that is slowly dissolved by stomach acid. After the polistirex is dissolved sufficiently, more dextromethorphan is released. Recreational use Intentionally consuming more than the recommended dosage of Delsym may result in euphoria, lack of coordination, hallucinations, apathy, feelings of dissociation, and disorientation. This is due to dextromethorphan as well as its pharmacologically-active metabolite dextrorphan, both dissociative drugs that work as NMDA receptor antagonists the same way nitrous oxide (N2O), ketamine, and phencyclidine (PCP) do. Because of the abuse potential, many pharmacies and large retail chains have begun taking precautions such as restricting sales to those under age 18 and limiting the number of sales of dextromethorphan-containing products per customer.

Unlike Manley's previous webcomic sites, Webcomics Nation was based on user-generated content and relied on online advertisement revenue, which increased in viability in the second half of the 2000s. Webcomics Nation quickly became Manley's most financially successful website, and encouraged him to turn his Modern Tales sites partially free as well. Manley began merging Webcomics Nation into Josh Roberts' ComicSpace in 2007, but this process took longer than hoped and Webcomics Nation eventually closed down in 2013. Concept Though Joey Manley was well known for creating a family of webcomic subscription services (consisting of Modern Tales, Serializer, Girlamatic, and Graphic Smash), he stated that he mainly focused exclusively on the subscription business model because online advertisement rates were low and bandwidth was expensive in the early 2000s. When online advertisement became more lucrative in the mid-2000s, and the subscriber numbers of his existing platforms remained stagnant, Manley decided to transition into a business model more similar to that of Keenspot. Webcomics Nation tried to do for webcomics what services like Blogger and Flickr did for blogs and photo sharing respectively. Webcomics Nation offered unlimited Web space and support to any cartoonist for $7 USD per month, but the website was mainly known as a free hosting service, supported entirely through advertisement money. As the revenue of free webcomics supported through advertising eclipsed the increasingly unpopular subscription model, Manley eventually turned Modern Tales into a free website as well. Webcomics Nation also aided cartoonists with little to no experience with web technologies to set up a webcomic. Talking with Publishers Weekly, Manley stated that \\"A lot of people don't have that kind of dedication to technology. The younger cartoonists do, but some older cartoonists don't.\\" History Manley launched WebcomicsNation.com on July 29, 2005 after having the service beta tested by a large number of major cartoonists (including James Kochalka, Lea Hernandez, Roger Langridge, Tom Hart, Cayetano Garza, Daniel Merlin Goodbrey, and Spike Trotman). Manley advertised the service in part through its use of modern Web technologies such as XML, RSS, and \\"web services\\". Paying users were offered unlimited bandwidth and disk storage, the ability to lock their own webcomics behind a subscription wall or to sell advertisements on their own pages, an automated email list, a scheduling system, and an archive management system, among other features. Webcomics Nation quickly became Manley's most profitable project. The free version of Webcomics Nation became available in 2006. Eric Millikin, beta-testing new Webcomics Nation features in late 2006, described the evolving user interface as closer to that of Adobe products than a typical Web-based interface. By 2006, many cartoonists were running webcomics on Webcomics Nation, including Modern Tales usuals such as Shaenon K. Garrity, Lea Hernandez, and Tom Hart, as well as print comics veterans like Jay Stephens, Batton Lash, and Ingalill Roesberg. In 2007, Manley collaborated with OnlineComics.net-creator Josh Roberts to expand on ComicSpace, Roberts' comics-oriented social media and publishing platform. Webcomics Nation was merged into this platform, alongside some of Manley's other websites, and ComicSpace was planned to \\"relaunch\\" in the second quarter of 2008 as an \\"all-in-one solution for webcomic creators [and] social networkers interested in comics\\". In January 2009, Manley wrote that the merger was \\"one of the more technically difficult projects\\" they had undertaken, and that it was taking longer than he had hoped. Webcomics Nation and Manley's other websites closed down in April 2013, and he died in November that same year.

California Death Index, 1940‚Äì1997. Center for Health Statistics, California Department of Health Services, Sacramento, California. Searchable at http://www.familytreelegends.com/records/caldeaths was an Australian-born American film director, producer and screenwriter. In 1942 he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Director for Wake Island, and in 1957 he won the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay for Around the World in Eighty Days. He had seven children by his wife, actress Maureen O'Sullivan, including actress Mia Farrow. Early life Farrow was born in Sydney, Australia, the son of Lucy Villiers (n√©e Savage; 1881‚Äì1907), a dressmaker, and Joseph Farrow (1880‚Äì1925), a tailor's trimmer. His mother died when he was three years old. His parents were both of English descent. Farrow was educated at Newtown Public School and Fort Street Boys' High School and then started a career in accountancy. He claimed to have run away to sea in an American barquentine, sailed \\"all over the Pacific\\", and fought in revolts in Nicaragua and Mexico. Reaching California, he enrolled at St. Ignatius College (later known as the University of San Francisco) in 1923, but left after one month. He traveled throughout the Pacific, including Fiji, Hawaii and Guam. On arrival in Hollywood, Farrow fabricated his education, saying he had attended Newington College in Sydney, Australia (he lived in a street below its ovals), Winchester College in England and the US Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. Many publications and websites still contain this information.Profile, Tcm.com; retrieved 3 May 2014. Writer Farrow started writing while working as a sailor and became interested in screenwriting after a chance voyage in the South Seas with the film-maker Robert J. Flaherty. Re-entering the United States, allegedly by jumping ship at San Francisco, he found his way to Hollywood where from 1927, his nautical expertise brought him work as a script consultant and technical adviser. He had already earned minor recognition as a poet and writer of short stories. He soon established himself as a notable screenwriter. He worked for DeMille Productions, doing titles for White Gold (1927) and The Wreck of the Hesperus (1927). He adapted Richard Connell's 1923 short story \\"A Friend of Napoleon\\" but it does not appear to have been made. He also wrote the original story for The Blue Danube (1928) and the script for The Bride of the Colorado (1929). At Warner Bros he wrote A Sailor's Sweetheart (1927) for director Lloyd Bacon. =Paramount and RKO= At Paramount Farrow worked a series of \\"woman's pictures\\" Three Weekends (1928), with Clara Bow; The Woman from Moscow (1928) for Pola Negri; The First Kiss (1928), with Fay Wray and Gary Cooper, and Ladies of the Mob (1929) with Bow. At that studio he also made The Showdown (1928), The Four Feathers (1929), The Wheel of Life (1929), A Dangerous Woman (1929) and Wolf Song (1929) with Gary Cooper. He wrote The Bad One (1930) for United Artists. Shadow of the Law (1930) and Seven Days' Leave (1930) (with Cooper) were for Paramount. Farrow began to work increasingly at RKO: Inside the Lines (1930); The Common Law (1931), with Constance Bennett, and a big hit; A Woman of Experience (1931) with Helen Twelvetrees. =Britain= He compiled an English-French-Tahitian dictionary and wrote a novel, Laughter Ends (1933). In 1932 he went to England where he wrote The Impassive Footman (1932) for Basil Dean. He worked as a writer and assistant director on G. W. Pabst's film Don Quixote (1933), and briefly visited Tahiti again. =Return to Hollywood and arrest= Farrow returned to Hollywood and re-established himself as a screenwriter. On 27 January 1933, while dancing at the Cocoanut Grove nightclub, he was arrested for breach of his visa, as part of a general crackdown against illegal immigrants in the film industry. Farrow was charged with making a false statement while entering the US, having claimed he was Romanian. Although threatened with deportation, eventually he was given five years' probation, before being acquitted of the charges the following year. At MGM Farrow wrote Last of the Pagans (1935), partly set in Tahiti, and directed a short, The Spectacle Maker (1934). He received a plum appointment to work on Tarzan Escapes (1936) but the film was subsequently rewritten and reshot. Film director =Warner Bros.= In 1930, it was announced that Farrow would direct his own story First Love but this did not materialize. He signed to Warner Bros. in 1936 looking to direct and was linked with a number of projects, including a Foreign Legion story and an adaptation of Edgar Allan Poe's 1842 short story \\"The Pit and the Pendulum\\". Farrow finally made his directorial debut in 1937 with Men in Exile, a remake of Safe in Hell (1931). Following this, he accompanied his wife to Europe, where she was making A Yank at Oxford (1938), lecturing on Father Damien, about whom Farrow had written a book (published in 1937), and receiving a Papal knighthood. On his return to Hollywood, Farrow resumed working as a B-picture director for Warner Bros., with West of Shanghai (1937) with Boris Karloff and She Loved a Fireman (1937) with Dick Foran and Ann Sheridan. He was reunited with Karloff in The Invisible Menace (1938) then made Little Miss Thoroughbred (1938) with John Litel and Sheridan, the first film for Peggy Ann Garner. Farrow followed this with Broadway Musketeers (1938) with Margaret Lindsay and Sheridan (a remake of a 1932 drama, Three on a Match), and My Bill (1938) with Kay Francis, the first of Francis' B movies for Warner Bros. He did some uncredited work on Comet Over Broadway (1938), starring Francis, when director Busby Berkeley fell ill. Farrow left his contract for a number of months, ostensibly to finish a book he was writing on the history of the papacy, and also due to disputes over the script for his next film, another starring Kay Francis, Women in the Wind (1939). =RKO= Farrow re-emerged as a contract director for RKO; directing the highly profitable The Saint Strikes Back (1939), the second in the \\"Saint\\" series and the first to star George Sanders in the lead. He followed it with Sorority House (1939), from a script by Dalton Trumbo and produced by Robert Sisk. RKO then announced Farrow would direct a film version of the director's book Damien the Leper produced by Sisk and starring Joseph Calleia but it was never made. Instead he directed Five Came Back (1939), which, although a \\"B\\", became a surprise hit and received excellent reviews. \\"I deliberately set out to become the damndest commercial director in the business\\", he said later. \\"The only way to get anywhere in Hollywood is to make money pictures. Then you can get some measure of respect and authority from the studio bosses, and little by little you get to do more of the things you want to do.\\" Farrow went on to direct Full Confession (1939), with Victor McLaglen; Reno (1939); Married and in Love (1940); and A Bill of Divorcement (1940), a remake of the 1932 Katharine Hepburn film, with Maureen O'Hara in the lead. All these films were produced by Sisk. Bill of Divorcement was Farrow's first \\"A\\" as director. =War service= Despite his flourishing career and recently having become a father for the first time, Farrow was keen to be involved in World War II. He went to Vancouver in November 1939 and enlisted in the Canadian Navy. He went back to RKO to finish Bill of Divorcement then joined the navy. RKO promised to hold his job when he returned. Farrow was appointed lieutenant in March 1940 and assigned to Naval History and the Controller of Information Unit. He worked on anti-submarine patrols and in April 1941 was loaned to the Royal Navy and appointed to HMS Goshawk naval base in Trinidad, and served as assistant to the Senior British Naval Officer, Cura√ßao. He contracted typhus fever and returned to Naval Headquarters, Ottawa, in late 1941. It was announced he would direct a Canadian war film starring his wife Maureen O'Sullivan while on leave, but this did not eventuate. Farrow was invalided out of the Canadian Navy with typhus in January 1942 at the rank of Commander but remained in the naval reserve. He was gravely ill when he returned but was nursed back to health by his wife. His illness meant he was unable to return to active service. =Paramount= Farrow resumed his directing career at Paramount, whose then- head of production, Buddy de Sylva, had been impressed by Five Came Back and offered Farrow a contract. For the first time, Farrow was directing nothing but \\"A\\" movies. The association began brilliantly with Wake Island (1942), which earned him an Oscar nomination for Best Director, and was one of the year's biggest hits. Farrow followed it with another war film, Commandos Strike at Dawn (1942), which also proved popular. China (1943), with Alan Ladd and Loretta Young, was another big hit. In February 1943, Farrow signed a long-term contract with Paramount. In July 1943 he served as technical consultant for the proposed Royal Canadian Navy show. He directed The Hitler Gang (1944); Two Years Before the Mast (filmed 1944, not released until 1946), with Ladd; and You Came Along (1945), from a script co-written by Ayn Rand. In May 1945, Farrow was briefly recalled to active duty, travelling to Britain for work in connection with the Director of Special Services.John Farrow: \\"Commander Hollywood\\", CFB Esquimalt Naval & Military Museum Shortly after he made Calcutta (1947) with Ladd, though it was not released until two years later, to strong box office. Two Years Before the Mast was released in 1946 and became the tenth most popular movie of the year. In 1946 Farrow was reportedly writing a biography of Jun√≠pero Serra but it appears to have never been made. Ladd was meant to star in Farrow's California (1947) but dropped out over money and was replaced by Ray Milland. It was a big hit. Less popular were two films with Sonny Tufts: Blaze of Noon (1947), about flyers, and Easy Come, Easy Go (1947), with Barry Fitzgerald. Farrow became an American citizen in July 1947. =Film noir and westerns= In 1947, Farrow made one of his most highly regarded films, the noir The Big Clock (1948) with Ray Milland and O'Sullivan. He was reunited with Ladd for a military drama, Beyond Glory (1948), then returned to noir with Night Has a Thousand Eyes (1948), starring Edward G. Robinson from a Cornell Woolrich novel, and Alias Nick Beal (1949), with Milland. As a change of pace he produced and directed a comedy with Betty Hutton, Red, Hot and Blue (1949), followed by a popular Western with Milland, Copper Canyon (1950). Farrow did some uncredited work on the Ladd Western, Red Mountain (1951), with William Dieterle fell ill. He also published a history of the papacy, Pageant of the Popes (1950). For Howard Hughes at RKO he directed Robert Mitchum in a noir, Where Danger Lives (1950). Hughes liked Farrow's work enough to hire him again for His Kind of Woman (1951), also with Mitchum, although the film would be extensively re-shot by Richard Fleischer. Back at Paramount he made Submarine Command (1951) with William Holden. He wound up his contract with a final movie with Ladd, Botany Bay (1952), a half- successful attempt to repeat Two Years to the Mast. It was one of his few movies to have a connection to his native Australia. =Freelancer = Farrow directed Robert Taylor and Ava Gardner in the MGM Western, Ride, Vaquero! (1953), which was a hit. He made two produced by John Wayne for Wayne's company, Batjac: Plunder of the Sun (1953), an adventure story with Glenn Ford, and Hondo (1953) with Wayne, from a story by Louis L'Amour; the latter especially was popular at the box office. He made A Bullet Is Waiting (1954) at Columbia, then he had another big hit with Wayne, The Sea Chase (1955), where Wayne played a German sea captain in World War II. The early part of the film was set in Sydney, Australia, although not filmed there. Farrow was the original director of Around the World in 80 Days (1956) but was fired by producer Michael Todd shortly after filming commenced. However Farrow remained credited for his contribution to the screenplay, which won an Oscar in 1956. He also published a collection of poetry and a biography of Sir Thomas More. =RKO= Farrow signed a three-picture deal with RKO. He only made two of them, neither successful: Back from Eternity (1956), a remake of Five Came Back, and The Unholy Wife (1957), a failed attempt to launch Diana Dors to US audiences. =Samuel Bronston= He received an offer from Samuel Bronston to make two films, a biography of John Paul Jones and a story of the life of Jesus Christ, which Farrow had been trying to make for years. He directed the first one ‚Äì John Paul Jones. However he was replaced as director on the second by Nicholas Ray ‚Äì it was released as King of Kings (1961). Personal life Farrow was a notorious playboy in his youth, being linked to Dolores del R√≠o and Diana Churchill among others. He married Felice Lewin on August 18, 1924. They had one daughter, Felice Patricia Farrow (1925‚Äì1997). The marriage ended in divorce in September 1927. In 1934, he became engaged to actress Maureen O'Sullivan and they married on 12 September 1936. Farrow and O'Sullivan had seven children: four daughters, who became actresses, Mia (born 1945), Prudence (born 1948), Stephanie (born 1949), Tisa (born 1951); and three sons, Michael Damien (1939‚Äì1958), Patrick Villiers (1942‚Äì2009), and John Charles (born 1946). Maureen O'Sullivan was his second wife, after he converted to Catholicism and received an annulment of his first marriage. Farrow often wrote about Catholic themes. =Death= Farrow died of a heart attackhttp://www.pbs.org/weta/finding-your-roots/about/season-6-episode- guide/episode-1/ in Beverly Hills, California on January 27, 1963 at the age of 58 and was buried in the Holy Cross Cemetery, Culver City.

He accepted the Oscar won by the Australian documentary Kokoda Front Line! (1943), met Australian Senator Richard Keane, the Minister for Trade and Customs, when he visited Hollywood during the war and offered to assist in the establishment of an Australian information service in the US.

He made 2 Test appearances for the Australian national representative side; he represented in 7 World Cup matches in two World Cups and in one World Championship match and in 5 Kangaroo tour matches in 1973. Early life and club career Born in Griffith but reared in the northern town of Gunnedah, in his early twenties John O'Neill showed promise in appearances for Country against both City and the French tourists and was spotted by Sydney premiership talent scouts 1964. O'Neill came to South Sydney in 1965 and his aggressive play in the scrums and charging runs close to the rucks caused him to be noticed. His toughness and solidity earned him the nickname \\"Lurch\\", and in his debut season O'Neill played for South Sydney in the Grand final against the champion St George team. A tall and strongly framed man, O'Neill was able to develop consistently as he built up his weight from in 1965 to by 1970. Between 1967 and 1971 he played in five grand finals for South Sydney, winning all but the 1969 contest against Balmain. In 1971 the financial problems at South Sydney caused him along with teammate Ray Branighan to leave for Manly until the end of 1974. There O'Neill played in two more premiership sides, and his battle with Cronulla strongman Cliff Watson in the brutal 1973 grand final (won by Manly 10‚Äì7) is regarded as one of the toughest conflicts seen in the Australian game. Representative career O'Neill first played for New South Wales in 1967, and made his international debut in the 1970 World Cup. It was in this match that his remarkable strength in the toughest conflicts first showed itself. He continued to hit opponents in a way that would have been remarkable for anyone with a split shin, and refused to take first aid even when blood spilt into his sock! John O'Neill remained a regular international player until he retired, He is listed on the Australian Players Register as Kangaroo No. 449.ARL Annual Report 2005, page 55 In 1975, still a major force in representative rugby league, O'Neill returned to South Sydney. Paradoxically, though he was superb in representative games, he was disappointing in club rugby league and retired during the 1976 season. O'Neill coached South Sydney in 1977 but could win only one of the last eighteen games and he stood down. During his playing days, O'Neill had developed a highly profitable building businesses along with Rabbitoh teammate Gary Stevens, which by 1977 would prevent him from devoting his attention fully to coaching. In the 1980s, he used the profits from this business to build a home at Lake Conjola.Whitticker, Alan; Glory Days: the Story of South Sydney's Golden Era, p. 280 Death and accolades In 1995, after being named in Australia's best rugby league team since the limited tackle rule was introduced, O'Neill was diagnosed with cancer. He fought a long battle, but died on 9 August 1999 at the age of 56. It is estimated that 4,000 people attended his funeral, showing the respect in which he was held. In 1990, O'Neill was named in the front row for Manly in their best team from 1947‚Äì1990. Later in 2006 he was named in the front row for Manly's 60th anniversary Dream Team. In 2004 he was named by Souths in their South Sydney Dream Team,South Sydney Dream Team from the official South Sydney website. consisting of 17 players and a coach representing the club from 1908 through to 2004.In February 2008, O'Neill was named in the list of Australia's 100 Greatest Players (1908‚Äì2007) which was commissioned by the NRL and ARL to celebrate the code's centenary year in Australia.

Echo Lake Echo Lake is a shallow, oligotrophic lake situated at above sea level near Mount Evans in the Colorado Rocky Mountains. It formed during the latest period of glaciation roughly 10,000 years ago. As glaciers retreated in the Chicago Creek valley, lateral moraines formed a natural dam to drainage, forming the lake. The ecosystem around the lake is dominated by Engelmann Spruce (Picea engelmannii) and Subalpine Fir (Abies lasiocarpa), with some Limber Pine (Pinus flexilis) on exposed sites.

The event focuses the public to get in the mood of Christmas during the summer season, 5-6 months prior reaching to December, with Christmas-themed activities and entertainment, including small Christmas events, Christmas music, Christmas specials, and as well as shopping. Origins Werther, an 1892 French opera with libretto by √âdouard Blau, Paul Milliet, and Georges Hartmann, had an English translation published in 1894 by Elizabeth Beall Ginty. In the story, a group of children rehearses a Christmas song in July, to which a character responds: \\"When you sing Christmas in July, you rush the season.\\" It is a translation of the French: \\"vous chantez No√´l en juillet... c'est s'y prendre √† l'avance.\\"Act I, Scene II. This opera is based on Goethe's The Sorrows of Young Werther. Christmas features in the book, but July does not. In 1935, the National Recreation Association's journal Recreation described what a Christmas in July was like at a girl's camp, writing that \\"all mystery and wonder surround this annual event.\\"\\"Christmas in July\\", Recreation, 1935, vol. 29, p. 216. The term, if not the exact concept, was given national attention with the release of the Hollywood movie comedy Christmas in July in 1940, written and directed by Preston Sturges.Christmas in July, Internet Movie Database. In the story, a man is fooled into believing he has won $25,000 in an advertising slogan contest. He buys presents for family, friends, and neighbors, and proposes marriage to his girlfriend. In 1942, the Calvary Baptist Church in Washington, D.C. celebrated Christmas in July with carols and the sermon \\"Christmas Presents in July\\".\\"Christmas in July Theme of Calvary Church Service\\", The Washington Post, July 11, 1942, p. 6. They repeated it in 1943, with a Christmas tree covered with donations. The pastor explained that the special service was patterned after a program held each summer at his former church in Philadelphia, when the congregation would present Christmas gifts early to give ample time for their distribution to missions worldwide.\\"Calvary Baptist Church Holds 'Christmas-in-July' Service\\", The Washington Post, July 12, 1943, p. B1. It became an annual event, and in 1945, the service began to be broadcast over local radio. The U.S. Post Office and U.S. Army and Navy officials, in conjunction with the American advertising and greeting card industries, threw a Christmas in July luncheon in New York in 1944 to promote an early Christmas mailing campaign for service men overseas during World War II.\\"'Christmas in July' Luncheon Opens Drive To Speed Gift Mailing to Armed Forces\\", The New York Times, July 28, 1944, p. 15. The luncheon was repeated in 1945. American advertisers began using Christmas in July themes in print for summertime sales as early as 1950.\\"It's Christmas in July at Browning King\\" (advertisement), The New York Times, July 20, 1950, p. 16. In the United States, it is more often used as a marketing tool than an actual holiday. Television stations may choose to re-run Christmas specials, and many stores have Christmas in July sales. Some individuals choose to celebrate Christmas in July themselves, typically as an intentionally transparent excuse to have a party. This is in part because most bargainers tend to sell Christmas goods around July to make room for next year's inventory. Celebrations =Southern Hemisphere= Christmas in July promotional banner in Melbourne, Australia In the Southern Hemisphere, seasons are in reverse to the Northern Hemisphere, with summer falling in December, January, and February, and with winter falling in June, July, and August. Therefore, in some southern hemisphere countries, such as Australia, South Africa and New Zealand, Christmas in July or Midwinter Christmas events are undertaken in order to have Christmas with a winter feel in common with the northern hemisphere. These countries still celebrate Christmas on December 25, in their summer, like the northern hemisphere. =Northern Hemisphere= In the Northern Hemisphere, a Christmas in July celebration is deliberately ironic; the July climate is typically hot and either sunny or rainy with thunderstorms, as opposed to the cold and snowy conditions traditionally associated with Christmas celebrations in the higher latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. Some people throw parties during July that mimic Christmas celebrations, bringing the atmosphere of Christmas but with warmer temperatures. Parties may include Santa Claus, ice cream and other cold foods, and gifts. Nightclubs often host parties open to the public. Christmas in July is usually recognized as July 25 but also sometimes celebrated on July 12. The Hallmark Channel and its companion outlets (Hallmark Drama and Hallmark Movies & Mysteries) run blocks of their original Christmas television films in July to coincide with the release of the Keepsake Ornaments in stores, thus literally making the event a Hallmark holiday (an accusation that Hallmark Cards officially denies). Every July, the television home shopping channel QVC has Christmas in July sales, mostly decor and early gift ideas for children. What was once a 24-hour block of holiday shopping every July 25 (or the closest weekend day to it) has become a month-long event: generally, the sales begin on July 1 and are showcased throughout the day, with various blocks of holiday sale programming sales throughout the month. Generally during the last week of July, QVC will dedicate entire days to holiday sales. There is also Christmas in June. In some western countries, July has a limited number of marketing opportunities. In the United States and Canada, for example, there are no national holidays between the first week of July (Canada Day on July 1 in Canada and American Independence Day on July 4 in the United States) and Labor/Labour Day (the first Monday in September for both the US and Canada), leaving a stretch of about two months with no holidays (some Canadian provinces hold a Civic Holiday, but neither Canada nor the United States has ever recognized a national holiday during that time). The late July period provides relatively few opportunities for merchandising, since it is typically after the peak of summer product sales in June and early July, but before the \\"back to school\\" shopping period begins in August. Therefore, to justify sales promotions, shops (such as Leon's in Canada) will sometimes announce a \\"Christmas in July\\" sale. A Summer Christmas celebration is held on June 25 each year, in Italy and throughout the world. 25 June is 6 months before, or 6 months after (depending how one chooses to look at it), the traditional Christmas celebration. It is celebrated at this particular moment, as a statement and a reaction to the traditional Christmas celebration: there is no need to wait for one specific day to celebrate love, friendship and peace. The movement started in Italy, Europe, where traditional Christmas is celebrated in winter, leading to the alternative celebration, 6 months later, to be celebrated in summer. While it started out as an improvised summer celebration in Venice, it has now become a yearly tradition. In the last 8 years, the celebrations have taken place mainly in Sardinia, but the tradition is spreading across the world and becoming a worldwide movement. In parts of Denmark people may have small Christmas celebrations and put up decorations for what is known as 'Jul i Juli' (translated as 'Christmas in July'). It is a simple play on words that has come to be celebrated by some, although it is not an official holiday. Christmas in August (Yellowstone, USA) In the 1950s, the Christmas in July celebration became a Christmas in August celebration at Yellowstone National Park. There are multiple theories concerning the origin of this celebration. Park employees, who were nicknamed \\"Savages\\" until the mid-1970s, were known to throw large employee parties in July complete with floats, skits, and dances. Some have speculated that the Christmas in August celebration was a way to extend the mid-summer festivities to the public and subdue the employee-only celebration. Another theory is that the celebration began as a way to incorporate a performance of Handel's 'Messiah' by a student ministry working in the park.

It is the westernmost inhabited island in the Maldives. History Historically, several ships have been wrecked on the treacherous reefs surrounding the island. The most famous wreck was that of the English spice ship Hayston in July 1891. Several tons of cloves were salvaged and later distributed to the military and aristocrats in Male'. Makunudhoo is also famous as the island where Vazir Ibrahim Famuladeyri Takurufaanu who plotted to assassinate Sultan Muhammed Ghiya'as ud-din was exiled to in 1767. However along with other plotters of the assassination he escaped to Chandannagar where they got protection from the French governor Monsieur Le Termellier.

This atoll has a large reef with lagoon, 15 miles long by only 3 miles broad. It has only one inhabited island and a small islet and it lies 10 miles west of the NW part of the Miladhummadulhu group. It is said to have been unknown to non-Maldivians previous to the 1834-36 survey of the Maldives. According to the locals, many ships have been lost on its barren reefs with crew, cargo and all, scarcely a vestige of the wrecks remaining after a few hours, from the violence of the surf and the perpendicular sides of the reef. The lagoon is deep but full of coral patches (giri). In the Admiralty Chart this atoll is named after Sir Charles Malcolm, commander of the Bombay Marine (renamed the Indian Navy in 1832). Malcolm had the vision to introduce steam navigation to the Red Sea, which would enable boats to navigate up the Gulf of Suez. He was instrumental in making sure that the surveys conducted by Commander Robert Moresby in the Maldives took place.

Briefly crown prince from 1964 to 1965, he was among the wealthiest and most powerful members of the Saudi royal family. His advice was sought and deferred to in all matters by his brothers. Until his death in 1988, he was a close and powerful confidant and senior adviser to his younger full brother, King Khalid (r. 1975‚Äì1982), and his younger half-brother, King Fahd (r. 1982‚Äì2005). Early life Prince Muhammad was born the fourth son of Ibn Saud. His birth date is, according to different sources, either 1909 or 1910. Indeed, William A. Eddy also states that he was the third son (not fourth son) of Ibn Saud. Prince Muhammad's mother was Al Jawhara bint Musaed Al Jiluwi. She was born into the important Al Jiluwis family, which was in fact a cadet branch of the Al Saud family itself. She was a second cousin of her husband (their paternal grandfathers had been brothers). This was in keeping with long-standing traditions in Arabia of marriage within the same lineage, and members of the Al Jiluwi family frequently intermarried with the members of Al Saud family. Prince Mohammad was one of three children born to Al Jawhara bint Musaed and Ibn Saud. King Khalid was his full brother, and he had a full sister, Al Anoud, who married successively two sons of Saad bin Abdul Rahman. Al Anoud was first given in marriage to Saud bin Saad. After Saud died, she was married to his brother Fahd bin Saad. Royal duties From early age Prince Muhammad participated in fights during the formation years of the Kingdom with his older brothers and cousins. He and Prince Faisal were given the responsibility for the Ikhwan in mid-1920s. In December 1925 Prince Muhammad was named governor of Madinah following the conquest of the city in which he also involved. In 1934 Ibn Saud ordered his forces to attack Yemen's forward defences. Then, Faisal bin Saad, the son of the Saudi king's brother Saad, advanced to Baqem and the son of his other brother Muhammad, Khaled bin Muhammad, advanced to Najran and Saada. King's son Prince Faisal assumed command of the forces on the coast of Tihama and Mohammed bin Abdulaziz had advanced from Najd at the head of a reserve force to support his brother Saud. Prince Muhammad together with then Crown Prince Saud represented Ibn Saud at the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth in London in 1937. Prince Muhammad and Prince Mansour accompanied Ibn Saud in the latter's meeting with the then US president Franklin D. Roosevelt on 14 February 1945. They together with their uncle Prince Abdullah also attended the meeting between Ibn Saud and British premier Winston Churchill in Egypt in February 1945. Prince Muhammad also accompanied King Saud during his visit to the US in January 1962. Prince Muhammad was known as king-maker. He was a key prince in the coalition against King Saud. He was head of royal family council and acted as a mediator during the dispute between King Saud and Crown Prince Faisal. He was sent to King Saud's Al Na·π£ariah Palace in Fall 1964 to demand his and his sons' loyalty to the chosen king, Faisal. On 28 November 1964 Radio Mecca announced the allegiance of eleven of Saud's sons to King Faisal. During the reign of King Khalid Prince Muhammad was very influential in reducing the power of Crown Prince Fahd and his brothers, namely Sudairi Seven, who attempted to put to end Prince Abdullah's potential position of future Crown Prince. The royal family council led by Prince Muhammad expressed its allegiance to Crown Prince Fahd after the death of King Khalid on 13 June 1982. Renunciation of the succession Muhammad bin Abdulaziz was Crown Prince during the first few months (November 1964 ‚Äì March 1965) of the reign of King Faisal. He then voluntarily stepped aside from the succession to allow his younger and only full brother, Prince Khalid, to become heir apparent to the Saudi throne. Prince Muhammad's nickname was Abu Sharayn or \\"the father of two evils\\" (bad temper and drinking). In fact, his original nickname was \\"the father of evil\\" due to his aggressive and violent character during his youth which was first said by Ibn Saud. In addition, Prince Muhammad was a frequent visitor to the parties in Beirut which he himself did not consider a proper act for a royal. All such traits were the reasons for not being selected as the king by his brothers. It is also argued that Prince Muhammad, the oldest surviving son of Ibn Saud after Faisal, either declined the role of crown prince or was passed over because of his close association with King Saud during the latter's reign. =Controversy= Prince Muhammad's granddaughter, Misha'al bint Fahd, was convicted of adultery in Saudi Arabia; she and her lover were sentenced to death on the explicit instructions of her grandfather, Prince Muhammad, who was a senior member of the royal family, for the alleged dishonour she brought on her clan and defying a royal order calling for her to marry a man selected by the family, and were subject to public execution. Western media criticized the event as a violation of women's rights. A British TV channel presented a dramatized documentary, Death of a Princess, which was based on this incident. The broadcast hurt Saudi‚ÄìUK relations significantly. Following the execution, segregation of women became more severe, and the religious police also began patrolling bazaars, shopping malls and any other place where men and women might happen to meet. When Prince Muhammad was later asked if the two deaths were necessary, he said, \\"It was enough for me that they were in the same room together\\". Wealth Prince Muhammad had considerable wealth which was based on his share of the sales of crude oil. In the early 1980s his daily share was half a million barrel of oil. Views Prince Muhammad objected to Prince Saud bin Abdulaziz's role as Crown Prince immediately after his installation to the post. Prince Muhammad sent a letter to his father, King Abdulaziz, stating his negative views about Prince Saud's capacity to rule the state. Following the announcement that Prince Khalid was chosen as Crown Prince on 29 March 1965 Radio Mecca reported a statement by Prince Muhammad: \\"I would rather stay away from positions and titles.\\" Prince Muhammad later stated that he would not be a good king if he would have been chosen as the king. Prince Muhammad led the conservative members of the royal family. They did not support the fast modernization of the society witnessed at the end of the 1970s and thought that modernization and the presence of too many foreign workers in the country would lead to the erosion of traditional Muslim values. Personal life and death Muhammad bin Abdulaziz married many times. Five of his wives were linked to the Al Saud family, and the others were concubines. He had twenty-nine children, seventeen sons and twelve daughters. One of his daughters, Al Anoud bint Muhammed, was the spouse of Khalid bin Saud. Prince Fahd, the eldest son of Prince Muhammad, was one of the members of Al Saud Family Council established by Crown Prince Abdullah in June 2000 to discuss private issues such as business activities of princes and marriages of princess to individuals who were not member of House of Saud. One of his grandsons, Muhammad bin Abdulaziz bin Muhammad, was named deputy governor of Jizan Province in May 2017. Prince Muhammad died at approximately 78 years of age and was buried in Riyadh on 25 November 1988. Legacy Prince Mohammad bin Abdulaziz Airport is named after him. A hospital in Riyadh, Prince Mohammed bin Abdulaziz Hospital, is also named after him.

In 1989 new school master Mr. Hussain Hassan made arrangements to discontinue special classes, allowing the students to enter grade classes according to their qualification. Soon grade 6 and grade 7 were introduced to the school. After two years, Mr. Hussain Hassan left for another island. In 1994, school management introduced grade 8 to the school. In some cases, students were held in the same grade for more than four years in hopes of joining eighth grade. The dream was realized in 1996, when they introduced 8th grade commerce stream. In the year 2013 higher secondary education was introduced with five students. =Obstacles= Substandard educators and management officials are a major risk to current education on the island. Some employees with long tenures were trained as temporary teachers and were promoted without looking at their academic qualifications. The government allocates a budget for educational activities to be controlled by school management. There are rumors that allocated budgets are incompletely spent almost every year. While students are in need of extra help and facilities, funds are given back to the government. Economy The island specialized in producing a few varieties of short-term crops, including watermelon, scotch bonnet pepper, green chili, papaya, taro, and pumpkin. From the beginning of the 19th century, they were the largest producer of finger millets in the country, which helped them to stave off starvation during World War II. Finger millet (Binbi) and screwpine (Kashi-keyo) fruits were largely traded between Raa atoll people in exchange of goods or money. Since the beginning of dictator Maumoon Abdul Qasoom's regime, farming has become almost extinct. After a long time, people have started to grow watermelon and few varieties of vegetable on a very minor scale. This is largely practiced as a hobby rather than a way to make a living. Media and socialization Being an isolated small island, its inhabitants know each other very well. Mass social gatherings are common, especially for weddings and birthday ceremonies. In 2003, cable TV service was introduced to the island by a private operator for less than $7.00 per month. service was discontinued after couple of years. In 2009, people started to use \\"AirTell\\" satellite dishes to watch the TV shows. =Online media = Since 2005, two online newspapers have been published. \\"Vaikaradhoo Live\\" contributed to the overthrowing of dictator Maumoon Abdul Qayoom. After the successful attempt to collapse the government in 2008, the owner decided to cease the news. In late 2010, \\"Vaikaradhoo Live\\" emerged, claiming the team is back with new hopes.

He played upright slap bass on the iconic 1950s rock and roll records \\"Crazy Man, Crazy\\", \\"Shake, Rattle and Roll\\", and \\"Rock Around the Clock\\". Career Born in Old Fort, North Carolina, Lytle was a guitar player before joining Bill Haley's country music group, The Saddlemen, in 1951. But Lytle was hired to play double bass for the group, replacing departing musician Al Rex, so Haley taught Lytle the basics of slap bass playing. Lytle, who was only a teenager at the time, grew a moustache in order to look a little older, and became a full-time member of The Saddlemen and, in September 1952, he was with the group when they changed their name to Bill Haley & His Comets. Soon after, Lytle co-wrote with Haley the band's first national hit, \\"Crazy Man, Crazy\\" although he did not receive co-authorship credit for it (until 2002). Lytle played on all of Haley's recordings between mid-1951 and the summer of 1955, including the epochal \\"Rock Around the Clock\\" in 1954 (saxophonist Joey Ambrose is now the only remaining player to have appeared on the original of the classic track). He was paid $41.25 for the three-hour Decca recording session which also included the original A side, \\"Thirteen Women (And Only One Man in Town)\\".May 29, 2013, Tampa Bay Times. He played a late 1940s model Epiphone B5 upright double bass, purchased in October 1951, for about $275.\\"Interview with Marshall Lytle\\", The Art of Slap Bass. He used gut strings for the G and D strings while the A and E strings were wound. Lytle's style of playing, which involved slapping the strings to make a percussive sound, is considered one of the signature sounds of early rock and roll and rockabilly. The athletic Lytle also developed a stage routine, along with Ambrose, that involved doing acrobatic stunts with the bass fiddle, including throwing it in the air and riding it like a horse. This became a signature performance for The Comets that later musicians working for Haley were instructed to emulate. He was part of the band when they appeared on the NBC Texaco Star Theatre show hosted by Milton Berle and the Ed Sullivan Show on CBS in 1955. He also appeared in the 1954 Universal International Pictures movie short Round Up of Rhythm.Round Up of Rhythm (1954). IMDB. In September 1955, Lytle, along with drummer Dick Richards and Ambrose, quit The Comets in a salary dispute and formed their own musical group, The Jodimars. Before leaving, Lytle and his colleagues offered to train their replacements in the art of rock and roll playing, Comets style. Lytle was succeeded by Al Rex‚Äîironically, the same musician he had originally been hired to replace. The Jodimars became one of the first rock and roll groups to take up residence in Las Vegas showrooms, but only managed to score minor hits for Capitol Records and, later, smaller labels. By 1958 they had broken up, though Lytle attempted to continue the group on his own. Lytle continued to work in music off-and-on into the 1960s, but also got involved in other interests, changing his name to Tommy Page and getting into real estate and later opening an interior design business. In October 1987, six years after the death of Bill Haley, Lytle was invited to take part in a reunion of the original 1954‚Äì55 Comets that was held in Philadelphia as part of a tribute concert in honor of Dick Clark. Despite the musicians not having seen each other in decades, The Comets quickly found their groove again although Lytle sang the lyrics of \\"Rock Around the Clock\\" out-of-order. Their performance was the hit of the show, and over the next couple of years The Comets began touring again, primarily in Europe. The band has recorded several albums for the German label Hydra Records, the UK-based Rockstar Records, and the US label Rollin' Rock Records. Lytle also recorded a solo album in 1993 entitled Air Mail Special back by members of The Stargazers, a UK rockabilly group; the album was credited to \\"Marshall and the Shooting Stars\\". Lytle continued to write music, and in the late 1990s he and his friend Warren Farren wrote a topical tune called \\"Viagra Rock\\" that The Comets recorded; the song proved to be popular on radio stations in Florida. On July 5, 2005, The Comets played a high-profile concert for NASA employees at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California to celebrate the success of the Deep Impact space mission. The next day, the band played to a standing-room-only audience at the Viper Room in West Hollywood; the show ended with Lytle duetting with Bill Haley's youngest daughter, Gina Haley on \\"Rock the Joint\\" and a reprise of \\"Rock Around the Clock\\". As of December 2009, Lytle retired performing and touring with the Comets, stating 20 years was a long enough reunion for him, and he wished to try some new things including concentrating on a solo project. In 2006 the group took up a long-term residence at the Dick Clark American Bandstand Theater in Branson, Missouri, performing more than 150 shows at the venue, with more in 2007. The group also toured Europe in early 2007. Following the death of Johnny Grande and the retirement from touring of Franny Beecher, both in 2006, Lytle was one of three remaining original band members still with the group. In 2009, Lytle released his memoir, entitled Still Rockin' Around The Clock. At that time, he underwent surgery to remove part of his leg. Despite that setback, Lytle continued to perform, albeit with other musicians and without the other Comets. In 2012, Lytle was inducted as a member of the Comets into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Bill Haley had previously been inducted in 1987, but at the time the Hall did not include backing groups in its inductions; this was rectified in later years, resulting in the Comets and several other backing groups being inducted on their own in 2012. On May 25, 2013, Lytle died of lung cancer at his home in New Port Richey, Florida, at the age of 79.

It was the first Adventure Island game released for the SNES and came out between the releases of the NES games Adventure Island II and Adventure Island 3. It was later followed by Super Adventure Island II. The game's soundtrack was composed by Yuzo Koshiro. An unrelated game also titled was released for mobile phones between 2004 in Japan and 2005 in North America. It is a remake of Wonder Boy: Monster Land, which was previously ported to the PC Engine by Hudson as Bikkuriman World. Plot Over the course of his adventures, Master Higgins managed to maintain the peace and tranquility of his home, the mystical Adventure Island, and even earned the love and support of the local \\"Miss Jungle\\", the lovely Tina (erroneously called \\"Jeannie Jungle\\" in English materials). At nighttime, the young hero was quietly enjoying a well-deserved rest with his grateful girlfriend Tina loyally leaning on his side atop a treetop (said to be stargazing in the English manual). When the warmth of Tina's soft touch suddenly becomes a chilling coldness, he turns around and is shocked to find that the evil sorcerer, Dark Cloak, used a spell to turn Tina into a stone statue for eternity. Dark Cloak retreats to the legendary Ice Mountain across the sea, and Higgins resolves to defeat the wicked sorcerer in order to restore her to life. The player controls Higgins as he travels his way through five stages with four areas each. The first three areas in each stage has Higgins fighting his way through an obstacle course, fighting many traps and enemies, in order to reach the goal ball. The final area in each stage consists of a boss battle. Gameplay Other than the improved visuals and audio as a result of the switch of hardware to the SNES, the rules of the game are not much different from the original Adventure Island. Although released shortly after Adventure Island II for the NES, Master Higgins' dinosaur companions are not present in this installment. However, Higgins now has a choice between two weapons: the standard stone axe from previous games and a boomerang (which was later introduced in Adventure Island 3). Whereas the axe can only be tossed left or right, Higgins can shoot the boomerang in four directions (up and down, as well as left and right). When Higgins first picks a weapon, he can only toss one shot at a time. By picking up the same weapon in a row, Higgins can toss up to three shots consecutively. When Higgins picks a fourth weapon of the same kind, his shots will turn into fireballs, which are more powerful and capable of destroying stones. At this point, when the player switches from axes to boomerangs or vice versa, the fireball effect will remain in place until the player loses a life. While Higgins has lost the ability to run faster in this game, he has gained the ability to crouch, which can be followed up with a super-jump. During gameplay, Master Higgins must collect tropical fruit in order to keep his life bar from depleting; he also can acquire a skateboard which will allow him to travel across the stage faster.

Harold Leak engaged Don Barlow, who had devised a way of making the cone of the loudspeaker from expanded polystyrene foam sandwiched between two sheets of aluminium foil. This made it both very light and extremely stiff, and correspondingly accurate in sound. Contemporary publicity photographs show Harold standing calmly on top of one of his sandwich cones to demonstrate its exceptional rigidity. The speaker was innovative in other ways as well and was produced, relatively unchanged, for about 10 years. The original Leak 'Sandwich' hi-fi speaker was a large two-way system employing a 330 mm (13\\") low frequency element, with the sandwich cone, cambric roll suspension, and cast aluminium chassis. As was common at the time, the 75mm (3\\") high frequency unit was a miniature version of the woofer, and was mounted onto the grille assembly, so fitted neatly into its own foam lined cavity on the face of the 60 litre bass enclosure. A large wood block was bolted between the back of the woofer magnet and the back panel of the enclosure, as a structural brace, a technique later used by other manufacturers. Crossover network components were attached onto three sides of this block. Since it was designed for use with tube amplifiers, the system was rated at 15 Ohms. The 'Sandwich 200' model had a 200 mm (8\\") version of Barlow's foam-and-foil sandwich driver, together with two 60mm (2.3\\") purple Mylar coned elements, one employed as a midrange, and the other as a tweeter. This smaller model was a great commercial and critical success for Leak, and was produced for some years. Since transistorized amplifiers had become more common by this time, it was rated at a more contemporary 4~8 Ohms, with power handling of 18 watts. The Sandwich cone woofer was also used in the later 2060, as the low frequency element of a three-way system.

The state highway runs from U.S. Route 1 (US 1) in Huntington north to SR 236 in Alexandria. SR 241 connects US 1 and SR 236, bypass Old Town Alexandria to the southwest. The state highway connects those highways with Interstate 95 and I-495, Huntington Avenue, and Eisenhower Avenue in a series of interchanges along the boundary of Fairfax County and the independent city of Alexandria. SR 241 also connects the above highways to the Huntington station of the Washington Metro, for which the portion of the highway from US 1 to the station is part of the National Highway System. Route description View south along SR 241 in Huntington The north end of SR 241 at SR 236 in Alexandria SR 241 begins at an intersection with US 1 (Richmond Highway) on the southern edge of Huntington. Immediately to the west of the intersection, the state highway has an intersection with SR 633, which heads south as Kings Highway and has a tangent intersection with US 1 before veering southwest toward Groveton. SR 241 heads northwest as Kings Highway, a five-lane road with center turn lane that passes through a residential area. Within Huntington, the state highway passes the Huntington station, which is the southern terminus of the Washington Metro's Yellow Line. At the northern end of Kings Highway, SR 241 turns north onto six-lane divided Telegraph Road, which continues south as SR 611. Passing above Telegraph Road immediately to the south and north of the intersection are direct ramps from northbound I-95 and I-495 (Capital Beltway) to Kings Highway and Huntington Avenue, respectively. Southbound SR 611 also receives a direct ramp from the Beltway. Opposite Kings Highway is a loop ramp from southbound SR 241 that joins the Beltway's ramp to Huntington Avenue. The west leg of SR 241's intersection with Huntington Avenue includes a third direct ramp from the Beltway. North of the Telegraph Road - Kings Highway - Huntington Avenue intersection- interchange complex, SR 241 crosses Cameron Run and has its partial cloverleaf interchange with the Beltway. This interchange includes a flyover ramp from northbound I-95 and I-495 that splits into ramps to northbound SR 241 and Eisenhower Avenue. Immediately north of Cameron Run, northbound SR 241 has an exit ramp to join the ramp to Eisenhower Avenue, which meets the east-west boulevard just west of the Eisenhower Avenue station of the Washington Metro. Within the interchange, the state highway enters the city of Alexandria and passes under Eisenhower Avenue. Northbound SR 241 receives a ramp from Eisenhower Avenue via Pershing Avenue. Southbound SR 241 has a right-in/right- out interchange with Mill Road, which provides access to Eisenhower Avenue to the west. SR 241 crosses over Mill Road, CSX's RF&P; Subdivision, and Washington Metro's Blue Line and reaches its northern terminus at a trumpet interchange with SR 236 (Duke Street) a short distance west of Old Town Alexandria.

First opened on September 2, 1895 (one session held in fall 1893), it is the oldest public high school in Cabarrus County and one of the oldest extant in North Carolina. It became part of Cabarrus County Schools in 1983 when Concord City Schools merged with the county school system. It is also a half regular high school and half IB high school History The Concord City Schools were created on May 2, 1891, upon passage of a citywide voter referendum. The system began with a single school building, the Concord Graded School (a pre-existing private academy purchased for the public school use), which first opened in December 1891. In September 1893, Concord High School was founded under the guidance of a professor from Salisbury, NC. It is not clear whether this first high school term was completed. But on September 2, 1895, with classes held in the \\"old Lutheran Church' on East Corban Street in downtown Concord, Concord High School opened for good. The first Concord High School principal was Holland Thompsonhttp://docsouth.unc.edu/nc/thompson/bio.html from 1895 to 1899. Concord High School would continue in the old Lutheran Church building on East Corban Avenue through at least the 1902-03 school year. As the schools and community grew, so did the need for new facilities. A new voter referendum for school buildings was approved in 1902, and three new schools (Central Graded School. Number 2 School, and Concord Colored School) were built. Central Graded School was by far the largest of these schools, which opened on November 28, 1902 at the corner of North Spring Street and Grove Avenue. From 1903-1915 Concord High School appears to have been relocated to the Central Graded School campus, which housed all grades and was located at the present site of Coltrane-Webb Elementary School on North Spring Street. A picture of the 1914 Concord High School graduating class of 29 students may be found in the 1988 book, The Heritage of Cabarrus County.The Heritage of Cabarrus County The picture was likely taken at the Central School. In 1913, Concord voters approved another referendum for school facilities, including a separate high school building. The Board of Education immediately received a gift of the old Lutheran church property on East Corban Street. On June 8, 1914, the board agreed to build a new high school with six classrooms and an auditorium on this site (later to become Clara Harris Elementary School). This Concord High School was completed in April 1915 and it would serve as Concord High from 1915 to 1924. In 1922, a new larger high school was proposed, and city voters again approved bonds, this time in the amount of $225,000, for a new high school. This school was to be \\"a showcase of education for the city,\\" located on Beech and Cedar Streets just north of downtown. The ornate, three-story brick building was completed in 1924, including a large auditorium, and adjoining playing fields. Although part of the school was destroyed by fire in 1937, it was rebuilt, and included a larger, grander auditorium, later named Sauvain Auditorium. Sauvain Auditorium was the focus of many shows and performances, and was widely heralded for its beauty and acoustics. This facility would remain Concord High School for 43 years, until the CCS Board of Education selected and built a new school in northeast Concord. The existing building became Concord Junior High in 1967 (renamed Concord Middle School 1976‚Äì1999), when it was replaced by a new school on NC 73 east of Concord. The 1924 school building is now the Glenn Alternative Center for the Cabarrus County Schools, and is on the National Register of Historic Places. Concord High School moved to its current location, situated on a wooded hilltop on Burrage Road in northeast Concord, in August 1967. The new school, which opened as Concord Senior High School (grades 10‚Äì12), featured a two-story modern 1960s layout and design to maximize circulation and HVAC efficiency. However, the design was such that the school appeared to have no \\"front,\\" a quirk that was resolved during a renovation in the late 1990s. In 1974, the Concord City Schools moved to the 5‚Äì3‚Äì4 school grade model, and the school was again known as Concord High School, with grades 9‚Äì12. In the 1968‚Äì69 school year, the Concord City Schools integrated high schools (other grades integrated in 1969‚Äì70). Concord High became the sole public high school in the district as students from Logan High School, the historic African-American school, were transferred to Concord High. Located in a natural bowl alongside the school is the athletic stadium, which was dedicated as Robert C. Bailey Memorial Stadium in 1977, named for the longtime team physician, the late Dr. Robert C. Bailey. The stadium opened for play in 1967, with the first game played against Central Cabarrus High School. Bailey Memorial Stadium is widely considered one of the more scenic stadiums among North Carolina high schools, nestled within a hardwood forest that is ablaze with color in the late fall. The horseshoe stadium features 5,000 fixed seats, most with aluminum seating, and a grassy horseshoe that can accommodate an additional 8,000 fans, for a total capacity of 13,000, a capacity that has been reached on occasion, usually in the annual \\"Battle of the Bell\\" game. Graduation was held in the Bailey Memorial Stadium each year, weather permitting, through 2002. In 2003, graduation for Concord High School, as well as all other Cabarrus County schools, was moved to the Cabarrus Arena and Events Center, and has been held at the Center each year since. Two major additions have been made to the 1967 high school building in the nearly four decades since. The school remains at this location on Burrage Road. The enrollment at Concord High School in the 2007‚Äì08 school year is 1,194 students in grades 9‚Äì12. The Concord City Schools (CCS) continued in operation until its merger with the Cabarrus County Schools on July 1, 1983. Athletics The first year of interscholastic sports at Concord High was the 1915‚Äì1916 school year. Concord's first football game was played on November 5, 1915 against Salisbury High at the Rowan County fairgrounds in Salisbury, and resulted in a 13‚Äì12 Concord win. Under the guidance of Coach Robert S. Haltiwanger, Concord would go on to defeat Salisbury a second time, playing at Locke Mill Park in Concord, and finish its initial gridiron campaign at 2‚Äì0. Coach Haltiwanger would later become teacher, coach and principal at Hanes High School in Winston-Salem, NC. The school's athletic teams are known as the \\"Spiders.\\" The nickname, unique to North Carolina high schools, was a tribute to longtime principal and CCS superintendent Dr. A.S. Webb. The athletic stadium at the 1924 Concord High School campus was named Webb Field in his honor, and Concord teams playing at Webb Field were said to be bringing opponents \\"into the spider's 'Webb.'\\" The nickname stuck--it was first found in print for the 1927 season, and Concord High athletic teams have been the \\"Spiders\\" ever since. Webb Field was renovated and \\"rededicated\\" for the season football opener in September 1935 against Charlotte Central, which Concord won in a 49‚Äì12 rout. From 1924 to 1955, football games were usually played on Friday afternoons. Lights were installed at the stadium for the 1956‚Äì57 school year. Concord High football teams played at Webb Field through the 1966 season, until the opening of the new Burrage Road high school. Concord baseball teams continued to make Webb Field their home for another 25 years, and the facility (originally featuring a grandstand) also saw minor-league baseball for several decades with the Concord Weavers in the 1930s and 1940s. Webb Field is now on the National Register of Historic Places study list). Concord High also has the distinction of having a unique mascot in North Carolina schools. The mascot is known as the Spider-Man. A student dresses up like the Marvel Comics superhero and performs, usually at football games. In the history of the school, there have been two mascots: One who served from 2001 to 2003, and the most recent one from 2009 to 2011. The first wore a gold costume, while the second wore a costume with the black more emphasized. Concord High competed in the North Carolina High School Athletic Association (NCHSAA) from 1915 to 1929, and won a state football title in 1929, defeating Oxford 13‚Äì6 in one of the first 10 football games ever to be played at new Kenan Memorial Stadium at UNC-Chapel Hill. However, shortly after winning the 1929 state football title, Concord High became a charter member of the new Western North Carolina High School Activities Association (WNCHSAA), and participated in this sports association from the next 47 seasons (1930‚Äì1976), when the WNCHSAA merged with the NCHSAA. Concord won many WNCHSAA titles during the 47 seasons in this association, including the WNCHSAA football title in 1935 with an impressive 9‚Äì1‚Äì1 campaign during which the Spiders scored over 41 points on several occasions, and allowed 4 points per game, losing only 12‚Äì6 at S.C. state champion Gaffney. The 1935 Spiders defeated Newton-Conover 39‚Äì0 at Davidson College for the association title. Concord won the WCNHSAA again 12 years later in 1947, as star George \\"Ick\\" Alley and teammates were victorious in the postseason Harvest Bowl title game over Shelby 13-6. The Western North Carolina High School Activities Association contained up to 42 schools, mainly from the mid- sized cities of the Piedmont and Blue Ridge foothills--from the mountains to the Winston-Salem area, and especially along the US 29 (now I-85) corridor between Kings Mountain and High Point, and continuing west along US 74 to Rutherfordton. The WNCHSAA schools featured some of the best high school sports in the state, with many longtime traditional sports powerhouses among their midst. Many of these schools continue to feature strong sports programs to this day, having won a large number of state titles since rejoining the NCHSAA. Since 1977, Concord High has been a 3A (AAA) member of the North Carolina High School Athletic Association and still competes in the South Piedmont Conference (SPC). The South Piedmont Conference dates back to the 1930 season and the WNCHSAA, and Concord High is the only charter member of the SPC that remains in that league, having never played in another athletic conference. The school sponsors interscholastic football, volleyball, tennis (boys and girls), cross country (boys and girls), basketball (boys and girls), wrestling, swimming (boys and girls), baseball, softball, golf, track and field (boys and girls), and soccer (boys and girls). Concord's football team is notable throughout North Carolina due to two recent state titles (2004 and 2006), and to its role as one half of the state's longest-running high school football rivalry with A. L. Brown High School in neighboring Kannapolis. What is now known as the \\"Battle for the Bell\\" was long thought to have begun in 1931, and has been played each year since that time. However, in 2013 new historical research uncovered a previous game from 1924, which is now the first meeting of the two high schools in football. Since 1950, the victor of the game has been awarded a mounted Southern Railway train bell that is painted in the colors of both high schools. The annual football game has long been a tradition in the area and is among the state's most highly attended single high school sports events, regularly drawing crowds of 10,000-plus. In recent years, A.L. Brown won the 2010 and 2011 games, with Concord winning back-to-back games in 2012 and 2013. The 89-game series record as of the 2018 game stands at Concord 43-42-4\\\\. The 2006‚Äì07 school year was a very special year for Concord athletics, as the Spiders won both football and men's basketball championships In 2006‚Äì07, the Concord's men's basketball team rolled through the season and made its second straight return to the state 3A championship game, making this back-to-back years for the Spiders. The Spiders won the 2007 3A state title game at Reynolds Coliseum in Raleigh, and brought home its very first 3A state basketball championship ever in history, defeating Kinston High School 85-79. This win secured a state championship in both basketball and football in the same academic school-year, giving the Spiders the honor of being the first 3AA team to ever win both championships in the same school year.

(2005 World Aquatics Championships) First awarding =First awarding winner: Montreal= The venue for the games was itself controversial. The games were awarded initially to Montreal, and then taken away again in February 2005 (leading to the suicide of organizing-committee head Yvon Desrochers) when the city was unable to raise sufficient funding, with other cities indicating their willingness to take the games on. However, following promises of funding from various levels of government, Montreal re- bid for the games and they were re-awarded to the city. The championships were the first major international sporting competition hosted solely by Montreal since the 1976 Summer Olympics, a gap of nearly 30 years. The bid for the event was started by former Montreal mayor Pierre Bourque, who was a critic of the way the administration of G√©rald Tremblay handled the event, and warned about massive losses which would be carried by Montreal taxpayers. The games were awarded to Montreal in part as an experiment to see if it is possible to hold the championships in North America. The lack of exposure for these sports in North America resulted in very low sponsorship rates. The organizing committee could not meet basic levels of commercial sponsorship in the year before 2005, resulting in lack of government funding that depended on commercial sponsorship levels. In the end, although basic planning had been completed, and some construction was underway, FINA determined that the organizing committee was unable to meet the commitment to host the games. Revocation of award FINA revoked the award, and set about on a second round of bidding. Many candidate cities lined up to have a chance at hosting the championships, while Montreal campaigned vigorously to keep the games. All seemed lost when statements by FINA officials seemed to indicate that Montreal would be excluded. Montreal mayor G√©rald Tremblay made a bold move and guaranteed that any loss coming from the event would be covered by the city of Montreal. Second awarding =Second awarding winner: Montreal= When the second vote and awarding took place, Montreal's planning, and the commitment of the city were enough to win the second bid. The organizing committee was revamped with Norman Legault as director, and construction ramped up rapidly to finish the venues. Event logistics Sponsorship by the STM, Montreal's public transit commission, allowed competitors to take public transit for free. This allowed competitors to enjoy the lively city of festivals. The recommended way to reach the event site was by Montreal Metro. Coincident with the championships were the Montreal Fireworks Festival (visible from the event site), Just for Laughs comedy festival, and Fantasia Festival of genre film. The event featured new outdoor diving and long-course (50m) swimming pools, to the delight of many, instead of indoor pools, on Saint Helen's Island. The open water swimming events took place in the Olympic rowing basin, legacy of Montreal's 1976 Summer Olympics, on the neighbouring Notre Dame Island. Both islands are part of Parc Jean-Drapeau. The opening ceremony was created by the Cirque du Soleil, whose home base is Montreal, and was a water show. In the end, a total of 160,000 spectators attended, short of the 200,000 projected to break even on the event. This resulted in a $4,000,000 loss, about $1.10 per resident of Montreal. Post-event The well-planned-and-executed event has made the Montreal civic administration plan for future world-class games. Anticipation, from comments by the mayor, are that Montreal will bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics, to take place 40 years after the last one. The next major games event in Montreal will be the 2006 World Outgames, the first World Outgames, which also has controversy around it, with the revocation of the awarding of the 2006 World Gay Games from Montreal.

As one of the four muscles of the rotator cuff, the main function of the infraspinatus is to externally rotate the humerus and stabilize the shoulder joint. Structure It attaches medially to the infraspinous fossa of the scapula and laterally to the middle facet of the greater tubercle of the humerus. The muscle arises by fleshy fibers from the medial two-thirds of the infraspinatous fossa, and by tendinous fibers from the ridges on its surface; it also arises from the infraspinatous fascia which covers it, and separates it from the teres major and teres minor. The fibers converge to a tendon, which glides over the lateral border of the spine of the scapula and passing across the posterior part of the capsule of the shoulder-joint, is inserted into the middle impression on the greater tubercle of the humerus. The trapezoidal insertion of the infraspinatus onto the humerus is much larger than the equivalent insertion of the supraspinatus, the reason why the infraspinatus is involved in rotator cuff tears about as frequently as the supraspinatus. =Relations= The tendon of this muscle is sometimes separated from the capsule of the shoulder-joint by a bursa, which may communicate with the joint cavity. =Innervation= The suprascapular nerve innervates the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles. These muscles function to abduct and laterally rotate the arm, respectively. =Variation= The infraspinatus is frequently fused with the teres minor. Function The infraspinatus is the main external rotator of the shoulder. When the arm is fixed, it adducts the inferior angle of the scapula. Its synergists are teres minor and the deltoid. The infraspinatus and teres minor rotate the head of the humerus outward (external, or lateral, rotation); they also assist in carrying the arm backward. Additionally, the infraspinatus reinforces the capsule of the shoulder joint. In animals From an evolutionary prospective, the pectoral muscles ‚Äì the pectoralis major and pectoralis minor ‚Äì are thought to have evolved from a primitive muscle sheet that connected the coracoid to the humerus. In late reptilians and early mammals, this muscle structure was displaced dorsally; while most of its components evolved into the pectoralis major, some fibers eventually attached to the scapula and evolved into the supraspinatus, the infraspinatus, and parts of the subscapularis., p 541 Additional images References Saladin, Kenneth.

The author of multiple treatises, ranging in subject matter from the iconoclast controversy to Spanish Adoptionism to critiques of the Carolingian royal family, Agobard is best known for his critiques of Jewish religious practices and political power in the Frankish realm. He was succeeded by Amulo of Lyons. Early life A native of Spain, Agobard moved to Lyon in 792. He was ordained as a priest , and was well-liked by the archbishop of Lyon, Leidrad (r. 799‚Äì816). At some point, Agobard was ordained as a chorbishop, or assistant bishop. Controversy arose in 814, when the aging Leidrad retired into a monastery, appointing Agobard as his successor. While emperor Louis the Pious did not object to the appointment, some of the other bishops did, calling a synod at Arles to protest the elevation of a new bishop while the old bishop still lived. Archbishop Leidrad died in 816, and the controversy fizzled out, leaving Agobard as the new archbishop. Soon after taking office, he confronted several issues, which included opposing trials by ordeal,For example, Adversus legem Gundobadi (PL:104:113B-126B) and Contra judicium Dei (PL 104: 249C- 287C). and, in 818, writing against Felix of Urgel‚Äôs Spanish Adoptionist Christology.Against the Dogma of Felix: Adversus dogma Felicis Urgellensis PL:104:29C-70A. Anti- Jewish Polemic Agobard is notorious for his vocal attacks on the local Jewish population. Jewish communities in the Frankish realm (today's France) had been granted considerable freedoms under Louis the Pious son of Charlemagne, including a prohibition on Christian proselytizing. Louis appointed a magister Iudaeorum to ensure Jewish legal protection, and did not force Jews to allow baptism for their slaves. Agobard found this last provision particularly galling, and wrote his first anti-Jewish tract on the matter: De Baptismo Judaicorum Mancipiorum ().PL 104:99D-106B For the rest of the decade, Agobard campaigned against what he saw as the dangerous growth in power and influence of Jews in the kingdom that was contrary to canon law.Allen Cabaniss, Agobard of Lyons: Churchman and Critic, (Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University Press, 1953), 46‚Äì7. It was during this time that he wrote such works as Contra Praeceptum ImpiumPL 104:173D-178C (), De Insolentia JudeorumPL 104:69B-76B (), De Judaicis SuperstitionibusPL 104:77A-100C (), and De Cavendo Convictu et Societate JudaicaPL 104:107A-114B ().McCracken, Early Medieval Theology, 329. Agobard's rhetoric, which included describing Jews as \\"filii diaboli\\" (\\"children of the devil\\") was indicative of the developing anti-Jewish strain of medieval Christian thought. As Jeremy Cohen has claimed, Agobard's response was paradoxically both stereotypical and knowledgeable (he showed a great knowledge of contemporary Judaism, while maintaining and perpetuating stereotypes).Jeremy Cohen, Living Letters of the Law: Ideas of the Jew in Medieval Christianity, (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1999), 144‚Äì5. Icons In the 820s, a controversy emerged over the iconoclastic policies of bishop Claudius of Turin.S. Wemple, \\"Claudius of Turin's Organic Metaphor or the Carolingian Doctrine of Incorporation,\\" Speculum 49 (1974): 222‚Äì37; James R. Ginther, Westminster Handbook to Medieval Theology, (Louisville, KY: Westminster John Knox Press, 2009), 40. This stance was opposed by Dungal of Bobbio at the request of Louis the Pious. Agobard, in his Book on Paintings and Images, came out in opposition to Dungal's method of using secular knowledge to justify veneration of images.Giulio D‚ÄôOnofrio, ed. History of Theology II: The Middle Ages, (Collegeville, MN: Liturgical Press, 2008),68-9. Political Problems In the 820s, Agobard had already shown his willingness to challenge Louis the Pious on the subject of Jews and on secular holdings of church land.Cabaniss, Agobard of Lyons, 85. Agobard continued to confront the emperor, particularly on the issues of royal succession and the matter of land ownership. Agobard accused the emperor of abandoning his 817 Ordinatio imperii decree, which promoted an all-encompassing unity of church and empire.Cohen, Living Letters of the Law, 138-9. In both of the two rebellions against Louis, 830 and 833, Agobard supported the ill-fated revolt of Louis‚Äô son Lothair I. In 833, when Lothair launched his second revolt, Agobard published his support for Lothair once more in several works: A Comparison of Ecclesiastical and Political Government and Wherein the Dignity of the Church Outshines the Majesty of Empires and the Liber Apologeticus in defense of the rebelling sons of Louis.Cabaniss, Agobard of Lyons, 85-9. Exile and Return After Louis was restored to his power, backed by his sons Louis the German and Pepin I of Aquitaine, Agobard was suspended from his episcopate by the Council of Thionville and exiled, replaced by the chorbishop Amalarius of Metz ().D‚ÄôOnofrio, History of Theology II: The Middle Ages, 68. During his tenure in Lyon, Amalarius worked to impose liturgical reforms upon the archdiocese of Lyon. Amalarius‚Äô reforms were characterized by a heavy reliance upon allegorical and symbolic representations within the Mass. Agobard, on the other hand, disdained Amalarius‚Äô reforms as ‚Äútheatrical‚Äù and ‚Äúshowy‚Äù and favored a more plain liturgy.McCracken, Early Medieval Theology, 331. Amalarius‚Äô reforms were also opposed by Agobard‚Äôs disciple Florus of Lyon; Amalarius was deposed and accused of heresy in 838.McCracken, Early Medieval Theology, 330. Agobard wrote three works against Amalarius: On Divine Psalmody, On the Correction of the Antiphonary, and Liber officialis. When he returned to Lyon, Agobard worked to roll back Amalarius‚Äô actions, with the support of Florus.Ginther, Westminster Handbook to Medieval Theology, 9. Other works During his life, Agobard wrote more works on other issues, including several against pagan practices,For example,De grandine et tonitruis (PL 104:147A-158C) and De quorumdam inclusion signorum (PL 104:179A-186A). two on the role of clergy,De modo regiminis ecclesiastici (PL 104:189A-200A); De privilegio et jure sacerdotii (PL 104: 127A-148A). and a treatise on icons.De imaginibus (PL 104: 199B-228A). Agobard also wrote a treatise arguing against weather magic called De Grandine et Tonitruis (\\"On Hail and Thunder\\"). A passage in it mentions the popular belief in ships in the clouds whose sailors were thought to take crops damaged by hail or storms to their land of Magonia. Many of his works were lost until 1605, when a manuscript was discovered in Lyons and published by Papirius Masson, and again by Baluze in 1666. Agobard's complete works can be found in Volume 104 of J.P. Migne's Patrologia Latina, and, in a more recent edition, in Van Acker's Agobardi Lugdunensis Opera Omnia.Agobard of Lyon, Agobardi Lugdunensis Opera Omnia, L. Van Acker, ed.

Raised in 1915, it formed part of the 2nd Canadian Division and fought on the Western Front during World War I before being disbanded. Later, it was re-raised in September 1939 and subsequently took part in Allied operations in north-west Europe in 1944 and 1945. History =World War I= Formed in early 1915, the 5th Brigade formed part of the 2nd Canadian Division that was raised as part of the Canadian Expeditionary Force. Departing Canada in May 1915, further training was conducted in the United Kingdom around Shorncliffe before the brigade was committed to the Western Front in September 1915. The brigade's first major actions commenced early the following year around St Eloi, after which the brigade participated in many significant actions for the next two-and-a-half years that it was deployed along the Western Front. =World War II= Mobilized on 1 September 1939 as part of the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division, the brigade was formed before the declaration of World War II, and the battalions were promptly fleshed out by volunteers. Further expansion of the brigade was hindered by a temporary halt in recruitment and uncertainty about overseas deployment. Consequently, brigade headquarters were not actually formed until May ‚Äì June 1940. After the Dieppe Raid the brigade, with the 2nd Canadian Division, moved to Normandy in time to serve with the British Second Army. They participated in the advance along the Channel Coast with the First Canadian Army, including the liberation of Dieppe. The division saw heavy action in the Netherlands in late 1944, and took part in the final offensives in 1945. Organization =World War I= During World War I, the brigade consisted of four infantry battalions, as follows: *22nd (Canadien Francais) Battalion Canadian Infantry: 21 October 1914 ‚Äì 11 November 1918; *24th (Victoria Rifles) Battalion Canadian Infantry: 22 October 1914 ‚Äì 11 November 1918; *25th (Nova Scotia) Battalion Canadian Infantry: 28 October 1914 ‚Äì 11 November 1918; *26th (New Brunswick) Battalion Canadian Infantry: 2 November 1914 ‚Äì 11 November 1918. In addition, the brigade was supported by a machine gun company and trench mortar battalion. =World War II= In 1939, the second division was organized along regional lines, like the 1st Canadian Infantry Division. The 5th Infantry Brigade's order of battle upon formation in Quebec was as follows:Stacey, C.P. The Canadian Army 1939‚Äì1945 (Queen's Printer, 1948) *The Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment) of Canada ‚Äì Montreal, Quebec *Les Fusiliers Mont-Royal ‚Äì Montreal, Quebec *Le R√©giment de Maisonneuve ‚Äì Montreal, Quebec *Le R√©giment de la Chaudi√®re (Mitrailleuses) ‚Äì Levis, Quebec Second Canadian Division in the Victory Campaign 1944‚Äì1945. By 1944‚Äì45, a ground defence platoon had been added to the brigade's order of battle. Provided by the Lorne Scots, this platoon was designated the 5th Canadian Infantry Brigade Ground Defence Platoon (Lorne Scots).

History Serama originate in the Malaysian state of Kelantan, apparently through the crossing of Japanese and Malaysian bantams. Other stories of the birds derived from a gift of some small chickens by the King of Thailand to a local sultan in ancient times. Small chickens have always been popular pets in this area and are often referred to as \\"ayam katik\\" (pygmy chickens) and \\"ayam cantik\\" (pretty chickens). The modern breed is attributed to the efforts of Wee Yean Een from Kelantan, who named the breed \\"Serama\\" after Rama, the title of the Kings of Thailand. The breed was first exhibited in 1990. The breed was hit hard by the Asian bird flu epidemic in 2004 when many birds were culled amid government concerns. There are no written standards for the breed in its native country. However, they do now have an overall guide on scoring and judging for competitions in Malaysia. Many breeders have a style or type that they breed to, but often breeders keep several \\"styles\\". These styles are often names given by breeders to describe a blood line of a champion (e.g. Husin, Mat Awang), but may also be more general shape, characteristics or behaviour (e.g. slim, submarine, and dragon). Hence there is quite a lot of diversity in Malaysia, but an overall theme of a small brave chicken with a persona of fearless warrior or toy soldier. The shape, behaviour, temperament and size of the bird are the most important characteristics. They compete against each other in open table top competitions (often described as \\"beauty contests\\") and scored by several judges. The prize for the winning birds can be quite a bit of money. =United States= Serama Rooster in the United States The Serama is promoted by several organizations in the U.S. One is known as \\"The Serama Council of North America\\". This council helped to introduce the Serama to North America in various National Poultry shows. In the spring of 2004 a Serama-only show, known as the Cajun Classic, was held in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The American Serama as put forth by the Serama Council of North America has now gained acceptance by the American Poultry Association and the American Bantam Association as of April 2011 with the White color variety being the first to be accepted. Color Variety Acceptance In November 2017, a number of Serama fanciers were brought together by longtime breeder Josiah Woodfield to attempt a qualifying meet for the black and exchequer varieties of Serama. Following this meet, in January 2018, the black variety was accepted by the ABA. The Exchequer variety was later accepted following a 2nd qualifying meet at the Ohio Nationals in fall 2018. More meets are currently being planned by SCNA along with members of several other organizations to petition ABA for acceptance of Blue, Splash, Wheaten, Chocolate, & Cuckoo varieties. Other Serama Clubs in US In early 2012, a group of fanciers splintered from SCNA to form their own organization. Their purpose is to bring together breeders and exhibitors of American Serama in the US. They claim to have sanctioning authority for tabletop shows and offer a master breeder points system, not unlike that used by SCNA. This group is known as the American Serama Association. In more recent times, a third group known as Serama-USA as formed to promote the more extreme styles of Serama as found in their home country of Malaysia since the bird flu. Serama-USA has several tabletop shows yearly. =Europe= Seramas were initially imported into the UK in 2004. Birds were imported from both America and directly from Malaysia. The foundation Serama flock in the UK consisted of only a few dozen birds. In 2005, a small group of Serama owners and enthusiast decided to form the \\"Serama Club of Great Britain\\", the first Serama club in the UK. They established the standard for the Serama breed for the UK. Eventually in 2008, the club was officially recognized as the affiliated breed club of the \\"Poultry Club of Great Britain\\". Seramas are still relatively rare and expensive in much of mainland Europe. The Netherlands probably has the largest number of Seramas outside the UK. Most of the stock in the Netherlands are descendant from birds/eggs imported from America and from the UK. In France and other European countries they are increasing in popularity. They have 4 classes of seramas. General characteristics The Serama are characterized by their upright posture, full breast, vertical tail feathers held upright and tight up to the body and vertical wings held down nearly touching the ground. In Malaysia they are described as brave warriors and archangel chickens, because of their very human like appearance. They are the smallest breed of chicken in the world. Typically under 500g, but with even smaller birds that are under 250g being bred in its native Malaysia. However, size alone does not define a Serama. A small chicken without the Serama \\"type\\" is not a Serama, but just another small bantam. The following describes the overall characteristics of \\"Malaysian type.\\" The Americans and Europeans have defined variants thereof. =Carriage and Temperament= Assertive with confident bold stance yet calm and manageable. Should be easily handled and show no aggression. The bird should pose readily and when viewed from the side should create a vase like or wide ‚ÄòV‚Äô shape outline. They shake their wings and pose, walk with pride, pull their head back to reveal a large chest, lift the legs, and in some styles have neck/head vibrations similar to that of a pigeon. =Body= The body is well muscled with breast carried high, full and well forward. From above the shape is somewhat elliptical, tapering towards the tail. The body should be short. =Wings= Fairly large wings in proportion to the body they should be held in a vertical position just clearing the ground and leaving the feet partially visible. Shoulders should be set high on the bird. Primaries are long of medium width with secondaries moderately long and broad. =Tail= Tail is full and carried high, pointing upwards and held close to the body of the bird with no space between the body and tail. The sickle feathers are relatively straight and spear like. A minimum of one inch longer than the other tail feathers, but ideally no more than a couple of inches above the head is desirable. The remaining tail feathers should ideally be no higher than the top of the comb when the bird is standing to attention. The Main tail feathers should be broad and should over lap neatly. The tail should be open and when viewed from behind should be open to an angle of 45 degrees creating an open ‚ÄòV‚Äô shape. =Head= Head should be small and carried well back. Head is required beyond the level of the feet and held in position of more than 90 degrees from the feet. The single comb is small to medium in size with a minimum of five serrations preferred. The comb should be straight smooth, free of folds or any deformities and tending towards flyaway type. Wattles are to complement the comb, smaller being preferred and free from folds and wrinkles. =Legs and feet= The legs are of medium to long length, straight and set wide apart to allow for full and muscular body. They should be strong and stable. Thighs should be of medium length and well muscled with shanks of good thickness. They should not appear soft and weak. =Feathers & Color= Like some other Asiatic breeds, they are not color bred in their native country. Only normal feathered birds are accepted in Malaysia. Feathers held tight against the body and should not be long or flowing. Silkied feathered birds are accepted in America and much of Europe. The silkied gene was believed to be carried by some birds imported from Malaysia. Other mutations (e.g. frizzled, rumpless and booted) have been introduced in America and some parts of Europe by crossing to other breeds. They can have a range of varieties in color and structure. =Breeding types= AMERICAN SERAMA ABA recognized colors, shown in ABA/APA in cage competition Disqualifications, include weights above our under weights listed above, shank colors other than yellow or swarthy and white earlobes. TRADITIONAL SERAMA All colors accepted, these are shown in Table Top competition No Disqualification, neither feather, shank or earlobe. Sizes ‚Äì Cocks, Micro ‚Äì up to 13 ounces Class A ‚Äì under 13 ounces Class B ‚Äì under 16 ounces Class C ‚Äì under 19 ounces Hens Micro ‚Äì up to 8 ounces Class A ‚Äì under 12 ounces Class B ‚Äì under 15 ounces Class C ‚Äì under 17 ounces Micros are a novelty only and guaranteed not to reproduce Class A ‚Äì too are virtually useless. They do not have the musculature to give them the full- bodied type required per standard and rarely are they viable or good layers. Class B - anyone interested in breeding the SERAMA would settle for the B Class. These are guaranteed to breed and reproduce ot will be replaced for the cost of shipping. B's can and do give Micro and A Class offspring. Class C ‚Äì C class are excellent breeders capable of giving B offspring and smaller. Any Cock over 19 ounces or Hens over 17 ounces are considered culls, because of weight. MALAYSIAN (AYAM) SERAMA These are the extreme types. They have no color nor weight disqualifications and are used for Table Top Competitions only. https://jerrysseramasllc.weebly.com/availability.html Breeding Seramas are much like other Bantam breeds. After laying an egg it takes around 19 days for the chicks to develop and hatch. Chicks are more susceptible to cold temperatures compared to other breeds because of their relative small size. After hatching, it takes about 16‚Äì18 weeks for the chicks to mature and reach the point at which they themselves can begin laying eggs. One U.S. breeder of note was Mr. Brian Sparks of Wisconsin. Mr. Sparks advocated the Malaysian style of breeding. He was successful in recreating the strong type and small size seen in true Malaysian birds. Word got back to the serama's native country and top breeders. They took interest in his work and articles about his successes were published by Malaysian news sources.

The history of Arizona encompasses Spanish, Mexican, and American periods. Arizona was part of the state of Sonora, Mexico from 1822, but the settled population was small. In 1848, under the terms of the Mexican Cession the United States took possession of Arizona above the Gila River after the Mexican War, which became part of the Territory of New Mexico. By means of the Gadsden Purchase, the United States secured the northern part of the state of Sonora, which is now Arizona south of the Gila River in 1854. In 1863, Arizona was split off from the Territory of New Mexico to form the Arizona Territory. The remoteness of the region was eased by the arrival of railroads in 1880. Arizona became a state in 1912 but was primarily rural with an economy based on cattle, cotton, citrus, and copper. Dramatic growth came after 1945, as retirees who appreciated the warm weather and low costs emigrated from the northeast. Arizona was a part of northern Mexico in the 1840s. It was remote and poor and seldom had outside contacts. The Mexican population, based in Tucson, was a few hundred, in addition to a presidio garrison of about 100 soldiers. The mission was deactivated in 1828. South of the Gila River it was mostly in the province of Sonora, and a fragment of Chihuahua in the east. To the north, Arizona was nominally part of Alta California and a fragment of Santa Fe de Nuevo M√©xico in the east. Together with help from Pima and Papago militia, the garrison provided a little protection from a hostile Apache population to the east of the San Pedro River and north of the Gila. In the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, the garrison commander avoided conflict with Lieutenant Colonel Cooke and the Mormon Battalion, withdrawing from the town while the Americans marched through the town on their way to California. In the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (1848), Mexico ceded to the U.S. the northern 70% of modern-day Arizona above the Sonora border along the Gila River. During the California Gold Rush upwards of 50,000 men traveled through on the Southern Emigrant Trail pioneered by Cooke, to reach the gold fields in 1849.C. L. Sonnichsen, Tucson: The Life and Times of an American City (1987) pp 30-38 The Pima Villages often sold fresh food and provided relief to distressed travelers among this throng and to others in subsequent years.  Spanish and Mexican Arizona  The history of Arizona as recorded by Europeans began in 1539 with the first documented exploration of the area by Marcos de Niza, early work expanded the following year when Francisco V√°squez de Coronado entered the area as well. Arizona was part of the state of Sonora, Mexico from 1822, but the settled population was small. American Arizona The Gadsden Purchase (shown with present-day state boundaries and cities) Arizona Territory in 1866 Starting in 1853, the entirety of present-day Arizona was part of the New Mexico Territory. In 1849, the California Gold Rush led as many as 50,000 miners to travel across the region, leading to a boom in Arizona's population. In 1850, Arizona and New Mexico formed the New Mexico Territory. In 1853, President Franklin Pierce sent James Gadsden to Mexico City to negotiate with Santa Anna, and the United States bought the remaining southern strip area of Arizona and New Mexico in the Gadsden Purchase. Before 1846 the Apache raiders expelled most Mexican ranchers. One result was that large herds of wild cattle roamed southeastern Arizona, By 1850, the herds were gone, killed by Apaches, American sportsmen, contract hunting for the towns of Fronteras and Santa Cruz, and roundups to sell to hungry Mexican War soldiers. and forty-niners en route to California.Larry D. Christiansen, \\"The Extinction of Wild Cattle in Southern Arizona,\\" Journal of Arizona History (1988) 29#1 pp 89‚Äì100. =Civil War= During the Civil War, on March 16, 1861, citizens in southern New Mexico Territory around Mesilla (now in New Mexico) and Tucson invited take- over by the Confederacy. They especially wanted restoration of mail service. These secessionists hoped that a Confederate Territory of Arizona (CSA) would take control, but in March 1862, Union troops from California captured the Confederate Territory of Arizona and returned it to the New Mexico Territory. The Battle of Picacho Pass, April 15, 1862, was a battle of the Civil War fought in the CSA and one of many battles to occur in Arizona during the war among three sides‚ÄîApaches, Confederates and Union forces. In 1863, the U.S. split up New Mexico along a north‚Äìsouth line to create the Arizona Territory. The first government officials to arrive established the territory capital in Prescott in 1864. The capital was later moved to Tucson, back to Prescott, and then to its final location in Phoenix in a series of controversial moves as different regions of the territory gained and lost political influence with the growth and development of the territory. This ornate grain basket by Akimel O'odham dates from the early 20th century, showing the Native American dimension to the state's culture =Native American relations= In the late 19th century the Army built a series of forts to encourage the Natives to stay in their territory and to act as a buffer from the settlers. The first was Fort Defiance. It was established on September 18, 1851, by Col. Edwin V. Sumner to create a military presence in Din√© bik√©yah (Navajo territory). Sumner broke up the fort at Santa Fe for this purpose, creating the first military post in what is now Arizona. He left Major Electus Backus in charge. Small skirmishes were common between raiding Navajo and counter raiding citizens. In April 1860 one thousand Navajo warriors under Manuelito attacked the fort and were beaten off.\\"History of Arizona\\" Page 163, 1915 The fort was abandoned at the start of the Civil War but was reoccupied in 1863 by Colonel Kit Carson and the 1st New Mexico Infantry. Carson was tasked by Brigadier- General James H. Carleton, Commander of the Federal District of New Mexico, to kill Navajo men, destroy crops, wells, houses and livestock. These tactics forced 9000 Navajos to take the Long Walk to a reservation at Bosque Redondo, New Mexico. The Bosque was a complete failure. In 1868 the Navajo signed another treaty and were allowed to go back to part of their former territory. The returning Navajo were restocked with sheep and other livestock.John O. Baxter, \\"Restocking the Navajo Reservation after the Bosque Redondo,\\" New Mexico Historical Review (1983) 58#4 pp 325‚Äì345 Fort Defiance was the agency for the new Navajo reservation until 1936; today it provides medical services to the region.Clayton R. Newell, \\"Fort Defiance, Arizona.\\" On Point: Journal of Army History, (June 2008) 14#1 pp 44‚Äì47 Fort Defiance, painted 1873 by Seth Eastman Fort Apache was built on the Fort Apache Indian Reservation by soldiers from the 1st Cavalry and 21st Infantry in 1870. Only one small battle took place, in September 1881, with three soldiers wounded. When the reservation Indians were granted U.S. citizenship in 1924, the fort was permanently closed down.Newell, \\"Fort Apache Arizona,\\" pp 44‚Äì47 Fort Huachuca, east of Tucson, was founded in 1877 as the base for operations against Apaches and raiders from Mexico. From 1913-33 the fort was the base for the \\"Buffalo Soldiers\\" of the 10th Cavalry Regiment. During World War II, the fort expanded to 25,000 soldiers, mostly in segregated all-black units. Today the fort remains in operation and houses the U.S. Army Intelligence Center and the U.S. Army Network.Newell, \\"Fort Huachuca Arizona,\\" pp 45‚Äì47 The Pueblos in Arizona were relatively peaceful through the Navajo and Apache Wars. However, in June 1891, the army had to bring in troops to stop Oraibi from preventing a school from being built on their mesa. =Ranching= After the Civil War, Texans brought large-scale ranching to southern Arizona. They introduced their proven range methods to the new grass country. Texas rustlers also came, and brought lawlessness. Inexperienced ranchers brought poor management, resulting in overstocking, and introduced destructive diseases. Local cattleman organizations were formed to handle these problems.James A. Wilson, \\"West Texas Influence on the Early Cattle Industry of Arizona,\\" Southwestern Historical Quarterly (1967) 71#1 PP 26‚Äì36. The Territory experienced a cattle boom in 1873‚Äì91, as the herds were expanded from 40,000 to 1.5 million head. However the drought of 1891-93 killed off over half the cattle and produced severe overgrazing. Efforts to restore the rangeland between 1905 and 1934 had limited success, but ranching continued on a smaller scale.Nathan Sayre, \\"The Cattle Boom in Southern Arizona: Towards A Critical Political Ecology,\\" Journal of the Southwest, (1999) 41#2 pp 239‚Äì271 Arizona's last major drought occurred during Dust Bowl years of 1933‚Äì34. This time Washington stepped in as the Agricultural Adjustment Administration spent $100 million to buy up the starving cattle. The Taylor Grazing Act placed federal and state agencies in control of livestock numbers on public lands.Conrad J. Bahre and Marlyn L. Shelton. \\"Rangeland Destruction: Cattle and Drought in Southeastern Arizona at the Turn of the Century,\\" Journal of the Southwest, (1996) 38#1 pp 1‚Äì22 Most of the land in Arizona is owned by the federal government which leased grazing land to ranchers at low cost. Ranchers invested heavily in blooded stock and equipment. James Wilson states that after 1950, higher fees and restrictions in the name of land conservation caused a sizable reduction in available grazing land. The ranchers had installed three-fifths of the fences, dikes, diversion dams, cattleguards, and other improvements, but the new rules reduced the value of that investment. In the end, Wilson believes, sportsmen and environmentalists maintained a political advantage by denouncing the ranchers as political corrupted land-grabbers who exploited the publicly owned natural resources.James A. Wilson, \\"The Arizona Cattle Industry: Its Political and Public Image, 1950‚Äì1963,\\" Arizona & the West (1966) 8#4 pp 339‚Äì348 =Copper= Inspiration Copper Company smelter at Miami, Arizona, c. 1915 On February 23rd 1883 United Verde Copper Company was incorporated under New York law. The small mining camp next to the mine was given a proper name, 'Jerome.' The town was named after the family which had invested a large amount of capitol. In 1885 Lewis Williams opened a copper smelter in Bisbee and the copper boom began, as the nation turned to copper wires for electricity. The arrival of railroads in the 1880s made mining even more profitable, and national corporations bought control of the mines and invested in new equipment.Robert L. Spude, \\"Mineral Frontier in Transition: Copper Mining in Arizona, 1880‚Äì85,\\" New Mexico Historical Review (1976) 51#1 pp 19‚Äì34 Mining operations flourished in numerous boom towns, such as Bisbee, Jerome, Douglas, Ajo and Miami. =Wild West= Hourly re-enactment for tourists of the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral Arizona's \\"wild west\\" reputation was well deserved. Tombstone was a notorious mining town that flourished longer than most, from 1877 to 1929.Eric L. Clements, \\"Bust and bust in the mining West,\\" Journal of the West (Oct 1996) 35#4 pp 40‚Äì53 Silver was discovered in 1877, and by 1881 the town had a population of over 10,000. Western story tellers and Hollywood film makers made as much money in Tombstone as anyone, thanks to the arrival of Wyatt Earp and his brothers in 1879.C.L. Sonnichsen, \\"Tombstone in Fiction,\\" Journal of Arizona History (Summer 1968) 9#2 pp 58‚Äì76, They bought shares in the Vizina mine, water rights, and gambling concessions, but Virgil, Morgan and Wyatt were soon appointed as federal and local marshals. They killed three outlaws in the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, the most famous gunfight of the Old West.Hubert I. Cohen, \\"Wyatt Earp at the O. K. Corral: Six Versions,\\" Journal of American Culture (June 2003) 26#2 pp 204‚Äì223 In the aftermath, Virgil Earp was maimed in an ambush and Morgan Earp was assassinated while playing billiards. Walter Noble Burns's novel Tombstone (1927) made Earp famous. Hollywood celebrated Earp's Tombstone days with John Ford's My Darling Clementine (1946), John Sturges's Gunfight at the O.K. Corral (1957) and Hour of the Gun (1967), Frank Perry's Doc (1971), George Cosmatos's Tombstone (1993), and Lawrence Kasdan's Wyatt Earp (1994). They solidified Earp's modern reputation as the Old West's deadliest gunman. Connor Hotel in Jerome Jennie Bauters (1862‚Äì1905) operated brothels in the Territory from 1896‚Äì1905. She was an astute businesswoman with an eye for real estate appreciation, and a way with the town fathers of Jerome regarding taxes and restrictive ordinances. She was not always sitting pretty; her brothels were burned in a series of major fires that swept the business district; her girls were often drug addicts. As respectability closed in on her, in 1903 she relocated to the mining camp of Acme. In 1905, she was murdered by a man who had posed as her husband.Melanie Sturgeon, \\"Belgian Jennie\\" Bauters: Mining- Town Madam, Journal of Arizona History (Winter 2007) 48#4 pp 349‚Äì374For colorful details see Jana Bommersbach, \\"Jana's View: (Un)Clean Sweep,\\" Phoenix Magazine June 2009 ; Acme is now the ghost town of Goldroad. 20th century =Tourism= Harvey House hotel opened in 1905 overlooking the South Rim of the Grand Canyon; it remains in operation as the El Tovar Hotel. By 1869 Americans were reading John Wesley Powell's reports of his explorations of the Colorado River. In 1901, the Santa Fe Railroad reached Grand Canyon's South Rim. With railroad, restaurant and hotel entrepreneur Fred Harvey leading the way, large-scale tourism began that has never abated. The Grand Canyon has become an iconic symbol of the West and the nation as a whole. ch. 1 =Chinese= The Chinese came to Arizona with the construction of the Southern Pacific Railroad in 1880. Tucson was the main railroad center and soon had a Chinatown with laundries for the general population and a rich mix of restaurants, groceries, and services for the residents. Chinese and Mexican merchants and farmers transcended racial differences to form 'guanxi,' which were relations of friendship and trust. Chinese leased land from Mexicans, operated grocery stores, and aided compatriots attempting to enter the United States from Mexico after the Mexican Revolution in 1910. Chinese merchants helped supply General John Pershing's army in its expedition against Pancho Villa. Successful Chinese in Tucson led a viable community based on social integration, friendship, and kinship.Grace Pe√±a Delgado, \\"Of Kith and Kin: Land, Leases, and 'Guanxi' in Tucson's Chinese and Mexican Communities, the 1880s-1920s,\\" Journal of Arizona History 2005 46(1): 33-54, =Statehood= Bob Satterfield, depicting Arizona and New Mexico as crazed gunfighters intent on gaining access to the \\"E pluribus unum tavern\\". In 1912, Arizona almost entered the Union as part of New Mexico in a Republican plan to keep control of the U.S. Senate. The plan, while accepted by most in New Mexico, was rejected by most Arizonans. Progressives in Arizona favored inclusion in the state constitution of the initiative, referendum, recall, direct election of senators, woman suffrage, and other reforms. Most of these proposals were included in the constitution that was rejected by Congress.Cindy Hayostek, \\"Douglas Delegates to the 1910 Constitutional Convention and Arizona's Progressive Heritage,\\" Journal of Arizona History 2006 47(4): 347-366 A new constitution was offered with the problematic provisions removed. Congress then voted to approve statehood, and President Taft signed the statehood bill on February 14, 1912. State residents promptly put the provisions back in. Hispanics had little voice or power. Only one of the 53 delegates at the constitutional convention was Hispanic, and he refused to sign.Linda C. Noel, \\"' I am an American': Anglos, Mexicans, Nativos, and the National Debate over Arizona and New Mexico Statehood,\\" Pacific Historical Review, (Aug 2011) 80#3 pp 430-467, at p 436 In 1912 women gained suffrage in the state, eight years before the country as a whole. Signing of Arizona statehood bill in 1912 Arizona's first Congressman was Carl Hayden (1877‚Äì1972).Ross R. Rice, Carl Hayden: Builder of the American West (1994) He was the son of a Yankee merchant who had moved to Tempe because he needed dry heat for his bad lungs. Carl attended Stanford University and moved up the political ladder as town councilman, county treasurer, and Maricopa County sheriff, where he nabbed Arizona's last train robbers. He also started building a coalition to develop the state's water resources, a lifelong interest. A liberal Democrat his entire career, Hayden was elected to Congress in 1912 and moved to the Senate in 1926.Jack L. August, Jr., \\"Water, Politics, and the Arizona Dream: Carl Hayden and the Modern Origins of the Central Arizona Project, 1922-1963,\\" Journal of Arizona History (1999) 40#4 pp 391-414 Reelection followed every six years as he advanced toward the chairmanship of the powerful Appropriations Committee, which he reached in 1955. His only difficult campaign came in 1962, at age 85, when he defeated a young conservative. He retired in 1968 after a record 56 years in Congress. His great achievement was his 41-year battle to enact the Central Arizona Project that would provide water for future growth. =The Great Depression= The Great Depression of 1929-39 hit Arizona hard. At first local, state and private relief efforts focused on charity, especially by the Community Chest and Organized Charities programs. Federal money started arriving with the Federal Emergency Relief Committee in 1930. Different agencies promoted aid to the unemployed, tuberculosis patients, transients, and illegal immigrants. The money ran out by 1931 or 1932, and conditions were bad until New Deal relief operations began on a large scale in 1933.James A. Williams, \\"Before the New Deal\\" Private Charity and Government Efforts to Help the Poor in Tucson, 1929-1933,\\" Journal of Arizona History, (2009) 50#2 pp 103-124, Construction programs were important, especially the Hoover Dam (originally called Boulder Dam), begun by President Herbert Hoover. It is a concrete arch-gravity dam in the Black Canyon of the Colorado River, on the border with Nevada. It was constructed by the Federal Bureau of Reclamation between 1931 and 1936. It operationalized a schedule of water use set by the Colorado River Compact of 1922 that gave Arizona 19% of the river's water, with 25% to Nevada and the rest to California.Michael A. Hiltzik, Colossus: Hoover Dam and the Making of the American Century (2010) =World War II= Major airfields in Arizona during World War II. Construction of military bases in Arizona was a national priority because of the state's excellent flying weather and clear skies, large amounts of unoccupied land, good railroads, cheap labor, low taxes, and its proximity to California's aviation industry. Arizona was attractive to both the military and private firms and they stayed after the war. Fort Huachuca became one of the largest nearly-all-black Army forts, with quarters for 1,300 officers and 24,000 enlisted soldiers. The 92nd and 93rd Infantry Divisions, composed of African-American troops, trained there. During the war Mexican-American community organizations were very active in patriotic efforts to support American troops abroad, and made efforts to support the war effort materially and to provide moral support for the young American men fighting the war, especially the young Mexican-American men from local communities. Some of the community projects were cooperative ventures in which members of both the Mexican-American and Anglo communities participated. Most efforts made in the Mexican-American community represented localized American home front activities that were separate from the activities of the Anglo community.Christine Mar√≠n, \\"Mexican Americans on the Home Front: Community Organizations in Arizona During World War II,\\" Perspectives in Mexican American Studies 1993 4: 75-92 Mexican-American women organized to assist their servicemen and the war effort. An underlying goal of the Spanish- American Mothers and Wives Association was the reinforcement of the woman's role in Spanish-Mexican culture. The organization raised thousands of dollars, wrote letters, and joined in numerous celebrations of their culture and their support for Mexican-American servicemen. Membership reached over 300 during the war and eventually ended its existence in 1976.Julie A. Campbell, \\"Madres Y Esposas: Tucson's Spanish-American Mothers and Wives Association,\\" Journal of Arizona History 1990 31(2): 161-182, Heavy government spending during World War II revitalized the Arizona economy, which was still based on copper mining, citrus and cotton crops and cattle ranching, with a growing tourist business. Military installations peppered the state, such as Davis-Monthan Field in Tucson, the main training center for air force bomber pilots. Two relocation camps opened for Japanese and Japanese Americans brought in from the West Coast.Thomas Fujita-Rony, \\"Arizona and Japanese American History: The World War II Colorado River Relocation Center,\\" Journal of the Southwest (2005) 47#2 pp 209+. online After 1945 After World War II the population grew rapidly, increasing sevenfold between 1950 and 2000, from 700,000 to over 5 million. Most of the growth was in the Phoenix area, with Tucson a distant second. Urban growth doomed the state's citrus industry, as the groves were turned into housing developments.Patrick Graham, \\"Urban Development Putting the Squeeze on Arizona Citrus Industry Agriculture: As groves are swallowed up by sprawl, the importance of grapefruits, oranges, lemons and tangerines to the state's economy is shrinking steadily\\", Associated Press, June 27, 1999. The cost of water made growing cotton less profitable, and Arizona's production steadily declined. Manufacturing employment jumped from 49,000 in 1960 to 183,000 by 1985, with half the workers in well-paid positions. High- tech firms such as Motorola, Hughes Aircraft, Goodyear Aircraft, Honeywell, and IBM had offices in the Phoenix area. By 1959, Hughes Aircraft had built advanced missiles with 5,000 workers in Tucson. =Political leadership= Despite being a small state, Arizona produced several national leaders for both the Republican and Democratic parties. Two Republican Senators were presidential nominees: Barry Goldwater in 1964 and John McCain in 2008; both carried Arizona but lost the national election. Senator Ernest McFarland, a Democrat, was the Majority Leader of the U.S. Senate from 1951 to 1952, and Congressman John Rhodes was the Republican Minority Leader in the House from 1973 to 1981. Democrats Bruce Babbitt (Governor 1978‚Äì87) and Morris Udall (Congressman 1961‚Äì90) were contenders for their party's presidential nominations. In 1981 Sandra Day O'Connor became the first woman on the U.S. Supreme Court; she served until 2006. =Retirement communities= Warm winters and low cost of living attracted retirees from the so-called snowbelt, who moved permanently to Arizona after 1945, bringing their pensions, Social Security, and savings with them. Real estate entrepreneurs catered to them with new communities with amenities pitched to older people, and with few facilities for children. Typically they are gated communities with controlled access and had pools, recreation centers, and golf courses. In 1954, two developers bought 320 acres (1.3 km2) of farmland near Phoenix and opened the nation's first planned community dedicated exclusively to retirees at Youngtown. In 1960, developer Del Webb, inspired by the amenities in Florida's trailer parks, added facilities for \\"active adults\\" in his new Sun City planned community near Phoenix. In 1962 Ross Cortese opened the first of his gated Leisure Worlds. Other developers copied the popular model, and by 2000 18% of the retirees in the state lived in such \\"lifestyle\\" communities.Judith Ann Trolander, \\"Age 55 or Better: Active Adult Communities and City Planning\\", Journal of Urban History, (Nov. 2011) 37#6 pp 952-974 =Environmental issues= Water delivered by the Central Arizona Project's canal. The issues of the fragile natural environment, compounded by questions of water shortage and distribution, led to numerous debates. The debate crossed traditional lines, so that the leading conservative, Senator Barry Goldwater, was also keenly concerned. For example, Goldwater supported the controversial Colorado River Storage Project (CRSP). He wrote: Water issues were central. Agriculture consumed 89% of the state's strictly limited water supply while generating only 3% of the state's income. The Groundwater Management Act of 1980, sponsored by Governor Bruce Babbitt, raised the price of water to farmers, while cities had to reach a \\"safe yield\\" so that the groundwater usage did not exceed natural replenishment. New housing developments had to prove they had enough water for the next hundred years. Desert foliage suitable for a dry region soon replaced grass. Cotton acreage declined dramatically, freeing up land for suburban sprawl as well as releasing large amounts of water and ending the need for expensive specialized machinery. Cotton acreage plunged from 120,000 acres in 1997 to only 40,000 acres in 2005, even as the federal treasury gave the state's farmers over $678 million in cotton subsidies. Many farmers collect the subsidies but no longer grow cotton. About 80% of the state's cotton is exported to textile factories in China and (since the passage of NAFTA) to Mexico.Gabe Judkins, \\"Declining Cotton Cultivation in Maricopa County, Arizona: An Examination of Macro and Micro-Scale Driving Forces\\", Yearbook of the Association of Pacific Coast Geographers (2008) Vol. 70, pp 70‚Äì95  Recent events  Super Bowl XXX was played in Tempe in 1996 and Super Bowl XLII was held in Glendale in 2008. Super Bowl XLIX was also held in Glendale in 2015. Illegal immigration continued to be a prime concern within the state, and in April 2010, Arizona SB1070 was passed and signed into law by Governor Jan Brewer. The measure attracted national attention as the most thorough anti-illegal immigration measure in decades within the United States. On June 30, 2013, nineteen members of the Prescott Fire Department were killed fighting the Yarnell Hill Fire. The fatalities were members of the Granite Mountain Hotshots, a hotshot crew, of whom only one survived as they were working in another location. In June 2017, a heat wave grounded more than 40 airline flights of small aircraft, with American Airlines reducing sales on certain flights to prevent the vehicles from being over the maximum weight permitted for safe takeoff.https://www.msn.com/en-us/weather/topstories/heat- wave-hits-southwest-on-1st-day-of-summer/ar- BBCX7Yb?li=BBnb7Kz&ocid;=mailsignout See also * History of the Colorado Plateau * History of the Western United States * Territorial evolution of Arizona * Timeline of Arizona * Arizona v.

This disease is named after the region where it was first discovered and isolated at the Trinidad Regional Virus Laboratory in 1955 by the Oropouche River in Trinidad and Tobago. Oropouche fever is caused by a specific arbovirus, the Oropouche virus (OROV), of the Bunyaviridae family. Large epidemics are common and very swift, one of the earliest largest having occurred at the city of Bel√©m, in the Brazilian Amazon state of Par√°, with 11,000 recorded cases. In the Brazilian Amazon, oropouche is the second most frequent viral disease, after dengue fever. Several epidemics have generated more than 263,000 cases, of which 130,000 alone occurred in the period from 1978 to 1980. Presently, in Brazil alone it is estimated that more than half a million cases have occurred. Nevertheless, clinics in Brazil may not have adequate testing reliability as they rely on symptoms rather than PCR viral sequencing, which is expensive and time consuming, in many cases there may be co-infection with other similar mosquito-borne viruses.  Symptoms and signs  Oropouche fever is characterized as an acute febrile illness, meaning that it begins with a sudden onset of a fever followed by severe clinical symptoms. It typically takes 4 to 8 days from the incubation period to first start noticing signs of infection, beginning from the bite of the infected mosquito or midge. Fevers are the most common symptom with temperatures as high as 104F. Clinical symptoms include chills, headache, myalgia, arthralgia, dizziness, photophobia, vomiting, joint pains, epigastric pain, and rashes. There also have been some cases where rashes resembles rubella and patients presented systematic symptoms including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, conjunctive congestion, epigastric pain, and retro-orbitial pain. The initial febrile episode typically passes after a few days, but it is very common to have a reoccurrence of these symptoms with a lesser intensity. Studies have shown this typically happens in about 60% of cases.  Cause  The oropouche virus is an emerging infectious agent that causes the illness oropouche fever. This virus is an arbovirus and is transmitted among sloths, marsupials, primates, and birds through the mosquitoes Aedes serratus and Culex quinquefaciatus. The oropouche virus has evolved to an urban cycle infecting humans though midges as its main transporting vector. OROV was first described in Trinidad in 1955 when the prototype strain was isolated from the blood of a febrile human patient and from Coquillettidia venezuelensis mosquitoes. In Brazil, OROV was first described in 1960 when it was isolated from a three-toed sloth (Bradypus tridactylus) and Ochlerotatus serratus mosquitoes captured nearby during the construction of the Bel√©m-Brasilia Highway. The oropouche virus is responsible for causing massive, explosive outbreaks in Latin American countries, making oropouche fever the second most common arboviral infection seen in Brazil. So far the only reported cases of Oropouche fever have been in Brazil, Panama, Peru, and Trinidad and Tobago. ORO fever occurs mainly during the rainy seasons because there is an increase in breeding sites in the vector populations. There has also been reports of the oropouche epidemics during the dry season but this is most likely due to the high population density of mosquitoes from the past rainy season. Moreover, during the dry season there is a deceased chance of outbreaks which decreases the amount of midges this is because the amount of outbreaks is related to the number of human population that has not yet been exposed to this virus.  Mechanism  Oropouche fever is caused by the oropouche virus (OROV) that belongs to the bunyaviridae family of arboviruses. This virus is a single-stranded, negative sense RNA virus which is the cause of this disease. There are no specific ultrastructural studies of the oropouche virus in human tissues that have been recorded to this date. It is likely that this viral agent shares similar morphological characteristics with other members of the Orthobunyavirus genus. Members of the Orthobunyavirus genus have a three part, single-stranded, negative sense RNA genome of small (S), medium (M) and large (L) RNA segments. These segments function to encode nucleocapsids, glycoproteins and the RNA polymerase in that sequential order. Through phylogenetic analysis of nucleocapsid genes in different oropouche virus strains, it has been revealed that there are three unique genotypes (I, II, III) that are currently spreading through Central and South America. = Genomic Reassortment = Genetic reassortment is said to be one of the most important mechanisms in explaining the viral biodiversity in orthobunyaviruses. This occurs when two genetically related viruses infect the same cell at the same time forming a progeny virus and this virus holds various components of genetic L, M and S segments from the two parental viruses. In reassortment, the S and L segments are the ones that are usually exchanged between species further, the S segment, that is coded by the nucleocapsid protein, and the L polymerase function together to create a replication of the viral genome. Due to this, one segment will restrict the molecular evolution of another segment and this is said to be inherited as a pair. On the contrary, the M segment codes for viral glycoproteins and these could be more prone to mutations due to a higher selective pressure in their coding region because these proteins are major host range determinants. = Pathogenesis = There is not a significant amount of information about regarding the natural pathogenesis of OROV infections because there have been no recorded fatalities to date. It is known that within 2‚Äì4 days from the initial onset of systematic symptoms in humans, the presence of this virus is detected in the blood. In some cases this virus has also been recovered from the cerebrospinal fluid, but the route of invasion to the central nervous system remains unclear. To further understand the pathogenesis of how this virus manifests in the body experimental studies using murine models have been performed.  Murine Models  BALB/c neonate mice were treated with this virus subcutaneously and presented clinical symptoms five days after inoculation. The mice revealed a high concentration of the replicating virus in the brain along with inflammation of the meninges and apoptosis of neurons without encephalitis, which is inflammation of the brain due to an infection. These findings confirmed the neurotropism of this virus, which means that this virus is capable of infecting nerve cells. Immunohistochemistry was used to reveal how this virus had access to the central nervous system. The findings indicated that the OROV infection starts from the posterior parts of the brain and progresses toward the forebrain. The oropouche virus spreads through the neural routes during early stages of the infection, reaching the spinal cord and traveling upward to the brain through brainstem with little inflammation. As the infection progresses, the virus crosses the blood-brain barrier and spreads to the brain parenchyma leading to severe manifestations of encephalitis. Damage to the brain parenchyma can result in the loss of cognitive ability or death.  Diagnosis  Diagnosis of the oropouche infection is done through classic and molecular virology techniques. These include: # Virus isolation attempt in new born mice and cell culture (Vero Cells) # Serological assay methods, such as HI (hemagglutination inhibition), NT (neutralization test), and CF (complement fixation test) tests and in-house-enzyme linked immunosorbent assay for total immunoglobulin, IgM, and IgG detection using convalescent sera (this obtained from recovered patients and is rich in antibodies against the infectious agent) # Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and real time RT-PCR for genome detection in acute samples (sera, blood, and viscera of infected animals) Clinical diagnosis of oropouche fever is hard to perform due to the nonspecific nature of the disease, in many causes it can be confused with dengue fever or other arbovirus illness.  Prevention  Prevention strategies include reducing the breeding of midges through source reduction (removal and modification of breeding sites) and reducing contact between midges and people. This can be accomplished by reducing the number of natural and artificial water-filled habitats and encourage the midge larvae to grow. Oropouche fever is present in epidemics so the chances of one contracting it after being exposed to areas of midgets or mosquitoes is rare.  Treatment  Oropouche Fever has no cure or specific therapy so treatment is done by relieving the pain of the symptoms through symptomatic treatment. Certain oral analgesic and anti-inflammatory agents can help treat headaches and body pains. In extreme cases of oropouche fever the drug, Ribavirin is recommended to help against the virus. This is called antiviral therapy. Treatments also consist of drinking plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration. Asprin is not a recommended choice of drug because it can reduce blood clotting and may aggravate the hemorrhagic effects and prolong recovery time. Prognosis The infection is usually self-limiting and complications are rare. This illness usually lasts for about a week but in extreme cases can be prolonged. Patients usually recover fully with no long term ill effects. There have been no recorded fatalities resulting from oropouche fever.  Recent Research  One study has focused on identifying OROV through the use of RNA extraction from reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. This study revealed that OROV caused central nervous system infections in three patients. The three patients all had meningoencephalitis and also showed signs of clear lympho-monocytic cellular pattern in CSF, high protein, and normal to slightly decreased glucose levels indicating they had viral infections. Two of the patients already had underlying infections that can effect the CNS and immune system and in particular one of these patients has HIV/AIDS and the third patient has neurocysticercosis. Two patients were infected with OROV developed meningitis and it was theorized that this is due to them being immunocompromised. Through this it was revealed that it's possible that the invasion of the central nervous system by the oropouche virus can be performed by a previous blood- brain barrier damage.

It was first published in 1916 as a serial in New York's Metropolitan Magazine (September‚ÄîOctober) in the English Review (September 1916-March 1917) and published in book form in 1917 in the UK (March) and America (April). The novella depicts the development of a young man upon taking a captaincy in the Orient, with the shadow line of the title representing the threshold of this development. The novella is notable for its dual narrative structure. The full, subtitled title of the novel is The Shadow-Line, A Confession, which immediately alerts the reader to the retrospective nature of the novella. The ironic constructions following from the conflict between the 'young' protagonist (who is never named) and the 'old' drive much of the underlying points of the novella, namely the nature of wisdom, experience and maturity. Conrad also extensively uses irony by comparison in the work, with characters such as Captain Giles and the ship's 'factotum' Ransome used to emphasise strengths and weaknesses of the protagonist. The novel has often been cited as a metaphor of the First World War, given its timing and references to a long struggle, the importance of camaraderie, etc. This viewpoint may also be reinforced by the knowledge that Conrad's elder son, Borys, was wounded in the First World War. Others however see the novel as having a strong supernatural influence, referring to various plot-lines in the novella such as the 'ghost' of the previous captain potentially cursing the ship, and the madness of first mate Mr Burns. Conrad himself, however, denied this link in his 'Author's Note' (1920), claiming that although critics had attempted to show this link, \\"The world of the living contains enough marvels and mysteries as it is.\\" Georges Franju made a 1973 television film La ligne d'ombre based on the novel. Andrzej Wajda made a 1976 film adaptation of the novel under its Polish title - Smuga cienia. In the 2004 novel (trs 2005) House of Paper by Carlos Maria Dominguez the plot is driven by the narrator's quest for the person who sent a copy of The Shadow Line to a recently deceased colleague.

He served as Archbishop of York from 1508 until his death. Early life Christopher Bainbridge was born in Hilton, Cumbria to a Westmorland family with roots in Bainbridge, North Yorkshire and was a maternal nephew of Thomas Langton, Bishop of Winchester, which likely accounts for his ecclesiastical career.Schofield, Nicholas. \\"Christopher Bainbridge (1464‚Äì1514), cardinal archbishop of York and Henry VIII's ambassador to the pope\\", The Venerable English College Archives He was educated at Oxford, possibly at The Queen's College.\\"Christopher Bainbridge (c.1464‚Äì1514), Provost (1496‚Äì1508), Cardinal \\", ArtUK He also studied law at Ferrara and Bologna. He was granted an indult in 1479 which allowed him to hold church benefices while still unordained and under the age of 16, and another in 1482 that allowed him to hold more than one benefice concurrently. He was said to have been fifty years old at his death and must therefore have been born about 1464. He was described as a magister, or scientist, by 1486; in the early 1490s, he was named a chamberlain of the English Hospice in Rome and rented one of its houses. At Bologna he was admitted DCL in 1492; he was in Rome between 1492‚Äì1494. He succeeded his uncle as Provost of Queen's College, Oxford in 1496. He was a Prebendary of Salisbury, and by 1497, had become chaplain to Henry VII, dean of York in 1503, and Master of the Rolls in 1504. He was incorporated at Lincoln's Inn on 20 January 1505. In 1505 he was Dean of St. George's Chapel, Windsor. He was appointed Bishop of Durham on 27 August 1507. Archbishop of York and Cardinal Bainbridge was translated to York on 22 September 1508, a sign of the favour he enjoyed at court. On 24 September 1509, King Henry VIII (whose coronation he had attended) appointed Bainbridge to be his ambassador to Pope Julius II. Just at this time Julius had taken alarm at the invasion of Italy by Louis XII of France, and the support of England was therefore of great importance. Julius left Rome to relieve Bologna, and was nearly taken prisoner in the war. A group of pro-French cardinals summoned a council in opposition to him at Pisa, which Julius opposed by calling another council at Rome, the Fifth Lateran Council,Francesco Guicciardini, Storia d'Italia, Lib.10, cap.2 in the course of which he created (in March 1511) several new Cardinals, of which Bainbridge was one, with the title of \\"Cardinal of St. Praxed's\\" or Santa Prassede. Bainbridge was immediately sent with an army to lay siege to Ferrara, but the creation of the Holy League relieved the papacy of some pressure by involving Spain against the French forces. Pope Julius II was succeeded on his death by Pope Leo X, who was initially willing to grant the title of Christianissimus Rex (Most Christian King) to Henry, after Francis had automatically forfeited the title by waging war on the Pope. However, Henry's making peace with France in 1514 probably ended these hopes. Bainbridge died on 14 July 1514, having been poisoned by a priest, Rinaldo de Modena, who acted as his steward or bursar, in revenge for a blow which the cardinal, a man of violent temper, had given him.Birt, Henry. \\"Christopher Bainbridge.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 2.

Thomas Cromwell:A life, Penguin, 2018 Rinaldo was imprisoned and confessed to the crime. He also implicated Silvester de Giglis, then Bishop of Worcester, as the instigator of the plot. De Giglis was the resident English ambassador at Rome, and regarded Bainbridge as a threat to his position: he also had sufficient power and influence to make Rinaldo retract his confession and have him killed in prison. Richard Pace and John Clerk, the cardinal's executors, were eager to prosecute De Giglis, but he maintained that the priest was a madman whom he had dismissed from his own service some years before in England, and his defence was accepted as sufficient. Bainbridge was buried in the chapel of St Thomas of Canterbury at the English hospice in Rome, which later became the Venerable English College. He left Baldon Manor, Oxfordshire to The Queen's College.

The Aero 8 shape evolved in the traditional Morgan way of form follows function and the main players were Chris Lawrence, Charles Morgan and other members of the Morgan Engineering Team, and Norman Kent of Survirn Engineering Ltd - especially for the tooling of the Aero wings. The AeroMax, Aero Supersports and Aero Coupe were designed by the firm's designer Matthew Humphries. Matthew sent the basic design of it to Charles Morgan when he was at Coventry University and joined Morgan on a KTP programme. Radshape were heavily involved in the chassis (Graham Chapman, the current MMC Development Director was working for them at that time) and Superform with much of the body panels, both companies eventually producing for MMC when the car was launched. The Aero 8 is notable for several reasons, primarily because it is the first new Morgan design since 1964's +4+. It was touted as Morgan's first supercar and undertook a comprehensive development programme including endurance testing at BMW's huge proving grounds L'Autodrome de Miramas. It does not use anti-roll bars, an oddity in a modern sporting car. It is also the first Morgan vehicle with an aluminium chassis and frame as opposed to traditional Morgan vehicles (\\"trads\\") that have an aluminium skinned wooden body tub on a steel chassis. The engine first powering the Aero 8 was a 4.4 L BMW M62 V8 mated to a 6-speed Getrag transmission. In 2007, the Series 4 Aero 8 was released which had an upgraded 4.8 L BMW N62 V8 with an optional ZF automatic transmission. All Aero 8s are assembled at Morgan's Malvern Link factory, where they are able to produce up to 14 cars a week (Aeros and trads). It has been criticised for its \\"crosseyed\\" look which originally was justified by the manufacturers as conferring aerodynamic benefits. In response, Morgan changed the design from 2005 (Series 3 and all subsequent Aero iterations), using Mini rather than VW New Beetle headlights.  Prototypes  9 produced  Aero 8 Series 1  (2000-2004) - estimated number produced 214 Morgan's first supercar, the first run of Aero models was unveiled at the Geneva motorshow in 2000 by Charles Morgan, it was in his words \\"the result of the biggest development project ever undertaken by the Morgan Motor Company\\". The result of many years of hard work, a development programme that included racing in the FIA GT series and a partnership with BMW. Whilst the car structure comes as pre-formed bonded aluminium elements significant work goes into hand making the overall vehicle continuing the handmade history of the company. The method of building the car was ahead of most companies in the marketplace and represented a dramatic shift for the company. The bonded aluminium chassis has elements of an ash frame to provide a link to the more traditional cars. It was designed by Chris Lawrence who had a long standing relationship with Morgan and included many features of racing cars of the time. Items such as in-board shock absorbers, double wishbones all round, a flat floor, centre lock magnesium wheels, rose- jointed suspension and other elements were included providing significant handling improvements over previous models. Complete with a bespoke aluminium chassis, all independent suspension and powered by a 4.4 litre BMW V8 engine (M62TUB44) producing 286 bhp (210kW) at 5500 rpm and 322 lbs-ft (430Nm) at 3750 rpm this was a radical departure from the traditionally built Morgans. Performance was 0 to 62 mph in 4.8 seconds with a top speed of 160 mph. The interior had a turned aluminium dashboard, unusual asymmetric design and a custom made Burberry case for use as a removable glovebox, along with nods to modern services such as cruise control, air-conditioning and a heated windscreen. With many elements from BMW including the engine, gearbox and axle to push 1100kgs the performance was on a par with Ferraris, Porsches, TVRs and other supercars of the day. Whilst the car did include an LSD the absence of other stability and traction aids mean the driver had total control over the car. Famous for its cross-eyed squint courtesy of the reversed VW Beetle headlamps, this was a culmination of both aerodynamic requirements and availability of light units at the time. Initially Porsche lights had been trialled along with the yet to be released new Mini units, the Mini lights were a favourite but BMW didn't want the first model to launch their new headlights to be the Aero so these were not an option. Aerodynamically (extensive wind tunnel testing was carried out at MIRA - another Morgan first) Morgan needed a way to allow the leading edge of the front wings to be forward of the radiator, thus providing space to incorporate a front splitter. The VW Beetle headlamps were spotted by Chris Lawrence who envisaged reversing them to give the perfect angle to meet the aerodynamic requirements, and thus the cross-eyed look was born. Around 210 Series 1 cars were made with many smaller changes being made to the car over this period internally and externally.  Aero 8 GTN  (2004) - 11 produced Morgan Aero 8 GTN This limited edition run- out model of the Series 1 was a nod to the successful Aero GT racing car and included the 4.6L Alpina BMW engine used on Alpina B10 and on BMW X5 4.6iS - 4619cc, 330bhp (246kW) and a top speed of 165mph (266 km/h). This version had slightly different and stiffened suspension plus semi-slick AO48's fitted as standard. Eleven were produced, all of them in a two tone color scheme of blue/grey. It was the first model to be offered with an optional hardtop alongside the soft top roof. Along with a carbon fibre dashboard, unique gloss black wooden trim, a custom Mota-Lita steering wheel and side exhausts the car had blistering performance as demonstrated on Top Gear by Richard Hammond (Season 5 Episodes 5) who later went on to own several Morgans.  Aero 8 Series 2  (2004‚Äì2005) - estimated number produced 60 Series 2 of the Aero 8 was launched at the 2004 Los Angeles Motor Show. This was the first Aero that was made for sale in North America. It was called the Aero Series 2 or Aero America as a result. The back of the car was changed in a number of ways. The petrol tank was repositioned to comply with US rear impact regulations. The boot lid was raised to improve aero-dynamics and storage. The previous folding roof was changed for a pram style changing the shape from the previous low ‚Äúgangster‚Äù style roof of the Series 1. Now using the BMW V8 4.4L engine N62B44 333 bhp (248kW) at 6,100 rpm and 331 lb-ft (450Nm) at 3,600 rpm using VarioCam on the inlet manifold. The factory offered single side exit exhausts as an option with the exit just in front of the rear wheels on each side. The new V8 provided a top speed of 160 mph with 0 to 62 mph acceleration in 4.8 seconds. Further revisions included a conversion to standard 5 stud wheels, uprated gearbox, brakes and other elements of the running gear. The car retained the same overall dimensions but internal space was increased by moving the doors further out and making the wings/running boards narrower over the Series 1. The unusual asymmetric dashboard of the Series 1 was replaced with a more conventionally styled dashboard however the fly-off handbrake was retained. Something in the region of 60 cars (both LHD and RHD) were produced.  Aero 8 Series 3  (2005-2007) - estimated number produced 208 The third iteration of the Aero was largely around adding the new style Mini headlamps with changes to the wings and front panels resolving the famous squint of the earlier cars. It retained the interior and mechanical platform of the Series 2. This new front design went on to be used on the new AeroMax and subsequent Aero models. Approximately 200 Series 3 models were produced.  Aero GT3  (2009) 2009 was the centenary year of Morgan and the company took part in FIA GT3 using the Aero Supersports which was claimed to be more aerodynamic. The Aero Supersports had been released at the prestigious 2009 Villa d‚ÄôEste event. The AutoGT team sponsored by Banque Baring Sturdza with former Renault F1 drivers Jean Pierre Jabouille and Jacques Laffite made a great impression at the start of the year. At the Silverstone race car 100 got pole and won the first race then car 101 secured pole and won the second race. The car was among Audi R8, Aston Martin, Ferrari and other supercars which made the styling contrast all the more remarkable. With a custom gearbox and slight enlargement of the engine the car was instantly competitive. The lower revving V8 and side exhaust layout resulted in a very distinctive NASCAR style off-beat sound which was deep and very loud. After one year of racing the rules were amended making it difficult for the car to run in 2010. One of the cars in racing colours remains with the factory and can be seen on the very popular factory tours.  Aero 8 Series 4  (2007-2010) - estimated number produced 179 Version 4 of the Morgan Aero 8 has seen the 3rd new engine in the life of the vehicle; the BMW 4.4 V8 has been replaced with the BMW 4.8 V8 (N62B48) with 362 bhp (270kW) and 370 lb/ft of torque. This 13% power increase over the previous Aero gives the new Series 4 Aero 8 a power to weight ratio of 315bhp per tonne. While heavier BMW saloons were unable to meet emissions regulations with the 4.8l V8 the lighter Aero did meet the Euro 6 emissions standard. BMW produced a short run of engines on a prototype line for Morgan. A first for the Aero 8 also comes in the form of an optional automatic transmission; Morgan state: - ZFs 6 HP26 six speed gives even better performance than a manual gearbox due to its special lock up clutch, low power loss design and instant change characteristic. The automatic is usable either as a full automatic for more relaxed driving or in sport manual mode when the bespoke gear lever will hold the engine revs up to the maximum in each gear, increase change speed and blip the throttle to smooth down changes. In addition to these technical changes, a repositioned fuel tank (to improve the weight distribution), revised instrumentation (from cream dials with blue numerals to black with white), an increase in luggage space, revised air vents, a move to a conventional handbrake lever and air intakes and exits on the front wings distinguish the Series 4 Aero 8 from previous models. AeroMax Morgan AeroMax, pictured in London, showing the distinctive 'boat tail' rear (2005, 2008-2009) - produced 1+103,Morgan Products Retrieved on 20 November 2010 Initially seen at the 2005 Geneva motor show as a bespoke car built for a well respected Morgan customer Prince Eric Sturdza of Banque Baring Sturdza in Geneva, the AeroMax was the next development of the Aero chassis. It is said that the car is named after Charles Morgan‚Äôs son Max. Due to the level of interest at the show and with the agreement of Prince Sturdza a limited production run of 100 in celebration of Morgan‚Äôs centenary was agreed, with final numbers ending slightly over this due to replacement of crashed cars. Production was initiated in 2008 and completed in 2009. The iconic design was created by Matt Humphries a 21 year old Coventry University Graduate working at the factory. The Empire Line or Art Deco influenced styling has often been compared to cars such as classic Bugatti‚Äôs whilst retaining a clear family relationship with Morgan's other cars. Many refinements were made to the overall shape including the use of the rear lights from the Lancia Thesis, flush fit of the doors and changes to the interior finish. The Rays alloy wheels introduced on this model became popular on other models following the AeroMax. It was the first Morgan to have a retail price above ¬£100,000 at ¬£110,000 but sold out within a few months. Owners have included Richard Hammond, Rowan Atkinson and Paul O'Grady. Taillights used on AeroMax, Aero Supersports, Aero Coupe and Aero 8 Series 5 were borrowed from Lancia Thesis. Aero Supersports left (2009-2016) - estimated number produced 180 The Morgan Aero SuperSports is a targa-roofed development of the AeroMax platform.Morgan Aero Supersports review Retrieved on 20 November 2010 Presented in 2009 at Villa d‚ÄôEste Elegance Concours to celebrate the 100 years of Morgan, the Supersports shares the same chassis, engine and transmission of the Aero 8 Series 4. The Aero Supersports presented at Villa d'Este was based on AeroMax. Main differences with the production model are: different position of the fuel tank, the refill fuel cap on the rear wheel arch, smaller boot (targa roof panels could not fit into the boot) and two fancy champagne bottle and glass holders behind the seats. The rear of the car retained the Lancia Thesis rear lights and wing shape but had a boat tail style with a comparatively large practical boot. Charles Morgan visited Jay Leno's Garage in a Supersports  Aero Coupe  145x145px (2012-2016) estimated number produced 40 The Coupe was introduced a short time after the Supersports and remained in production alongside it. The cars are largely identical with the Coupe having a fixed roof in the same design as the targa panels on the Supersports.  Plus 8  (2012-2019) - estimated number produced 300 Morgan Aero Plus 8 The new Plus8 was introduced in 2012 using the Aero 8 platform, 4.8L engine and manual or automatic gearbox. The body is intended to match the style of the traditional model with the same shape wings and rear panels. It also has an interior more like the traditional model with central dials, removable side-screens and a traditional soft-top. Where the Aero cars have a boot the Plus 8 has a rear shelf behind the seats but no boot. In most cases the owners mount a luggage rack. When the Aero 8 Series 5 was launched Morgan updated the rear suspension design of the Plus 8 to match that of the Aero, generally cars built in 2015 have Aero 8 Series 4 rear suspension, and cars build from 2016 have the Series 5 suspension. When viewed from the front the additional width makes it look lower and broader than the traditional cars. With the lower weight due to the reduced bodywork the car is among the quickest using the Aero platform but can have a more lively handling balance. The Plus8 is the lightest V8 passenger car in the world approved to European safety standards. The car also has one of the stiffest chassis of all the convertible roadsters available today. As the limited supply of BMW 4.8L V8 engines ran out Morgan produced a final batch of 50 Plus 8 models labeled Plus 8 50th Anniversary to celebrate the models 50 years of production through the Rover based Traditional model onto the Aero platform.  Plus 8 Speedster  (2014)- estimated number produced 60 This special edition of the Plus 8 is intended to look like a traditional cafe racer. The changes were simple bodywork and paint options however it did provide a very neat style. The minimal aero screens similar to those on Caterhams along with the broad stance of the car make it look very long and low on the road. In addition a new alloy wheel was added, this was made to look like a traditional plain steel wheel. Other options offered were bonnet straps and bright contrasting external trim colours. It was possible to spec a Speedster with the normal Plus 8 windscreen and a few were converted however the small reduction in usability that the Speedster had over a Plus 8 were always going to be celebrated by the eccentric Morgan community and the car gained very positive reviews. Aero 8 Series 5 (2016-2018) - estimated number produced 130 Morgan Aero 8 Series 5 At the Geneva Motor Show in March 2015 Morgan announced that the Morgan Aero 8 would be revived with a Series 5 model. The Series 5 reintroduced a soft top to the Aero range but still using the same BMW 4.8L V8 engine and manual or automatic gearbox (with a paddle option for the auto). This was completed by the new design lead Jonathan Wells with the intention of bringing a fresh theme to the model with more modern materials. New interior finishes with a change to the dashboard and infotainment continue to update the experience. The car retained the front design of the Aero models however the rear design was more akin to the boat tail of the Supersports with the Lancia Thesis lights and curves. The revised rear design permitted it to have a fabric roof that can be stored in the rear parcel slot, giving the car a flat rear deck profile. Morgan offered an optional, removable, carbon fibre hard top. The Series 5 also has a completely new front and rear suspension, with anti roll bars and outboard conventional wishbones and coil over units. Additional structural elements replacing the inboard suspension units gave added chassis stiffness. As the supply of BMW V8 engines came to an end a final run of 8 Aero GTs was released with a number of design changes including vents in the front wings, canards at the leading edges and an enhanced rear venturi. The standard carbon fibre hard top added a ventilation bulge at its rear. The GT has adjustable suspension, and is otherwise mechanically identical to the Series 5. At launch the GTs were said to be manual gearbox-only, but at least one of the eight has been seen with an autobox. This run out model sold out quickly despite having a quite substantial list price increase over the normal Series 5 at ¬£145,000. Morgan MD Steve Morris was regularly seen in a metallic orange GT, which was a rebodied Series 5. With the close of production of the Aero GT and Plus 8 50th Anniversary model the Aero chassis was retired to be replaced with the new CX aluminium platform. The CX name meaning 110 in roman numerals as it was introduced in the 110th year of Morgan's business. The CX model represented another big step forward for the company as it introduced a new range of power trains again from BMW. Shortly after the development and release of the CX based PlusSix Morgan gained external investment from InvestIndustrial an Italian venture capital company which took a majority share in the business.

Composition The song, which is two minutes and 30 seconds in length, begins with the sound of an infant crying. The main body of the song is a 50s progression, with time signature in 6/8, commonly heard in doo-wop songs such as \\"Stand by Me\\", progressing from C Major to A minor, then F Major to G Major, played softly on piano and synthesiser. The first half of the lyrics are sung by David Gilmour in a gentle tone, beginning with \\"Mama loves her baby\\", and a refrain of \\"Ooh babe, ooh, baby blue\\". A bass guitar creates a dissonant effect mid-song, when it plays an F‚ôØ against an A minor, the major sixth of the chord, and the augmented fourth of the key. Then Roger Waters takes over the lead vocal. The piano becomes staccato, as the lyric takes on a warning tone, with Waters singing \\"If you should go skating/On the thin ice of modern life....\\" As the lyrics end, the diatonic sense of C Major is abandoned, as the melody heard earlier (E, D, F, E, and A) becomes stripped to a simple power chord riff, played loud by distorted guitars, with brief soloing. The song ends on a sustained C Major chord, but through crossfading with the next song on the album, \\"Another Brick in the Wall, Part 1\\", a D minor chord is interpolated, contributing to uneasiness intimated by the lyrics.Pink Floyd: The Wall (1980 Pink Floyd Music Publishers Ltd., London, England, [USA ])Phil Rose, Which One's Pink? An Analysis of the Concept Albums of Roger Waters and Pink Floyd. Collector's Guide Publishing Inc. [US ] Plot The Wall is the story of Pink, who grows up to become an alienated and embittered rock star, with a failing marriage and feelings of megalomania.Schaffner, Nicholas (1991), Saucerful of Secrets (UK paperback ed.), London: Sidgwick & Jackson, \\"The Thin Ice\\" can be seen as the introduction to his story, since the previous song, the album's opening track \\"In The Flesh?\\" is chronologically placed later in the album's narrative, and then the story is begun via flashback. \\"The Thin Ice\\" introduces Pink as a baby and young child, and while the lyrics assure the listener that \\"Mama loves her baby, and Daddy loves you, too\\", it warns that \\"[T]he sea may look warm... the sky may look blue\\", but \\"Don't be surprised when a crack in the ice/Appears under your feet\\". Film version The film shows hundreds of soldiers in the war, either wounded or dead, then cuts to Pink floating in his hotel pool.

As in the production of conventional corn syrup, the starch is broken down into glucose by enzymes. To make HFCS, the corn syrup is further processed by glucose isomerase to convert some of its glucose into fructose. HFCS was first marketed in the early 1970s by the Clinton Corn Processing Company, together with the Japanese Agency of Industrial Science and Technology, where the enzyme was discovered in 1965. As a sweetener, HFCS is often compared to granulated sugar, but manufacturing advantages of HFCS over sugar include that it is easier to handle and more cost-effective. \\"HFCS 42\\" and \\"HFCS 55\\" refer to 42% and 55% fructose composition respectively, the rest being glucose and water. HFCS 42 is mainly used for processed foods and breakfast cereals, whereas HFCS 55 is used mostly for production of soft drinks. The United States Food and Drug Administration states that HFCS is a safe ingredient for food and beverage manufacturing. Uses and exports of HFCS from American producers have grown steadily during the early 21st century.  Food  In the U.S., HFCS is among the sweeteners that mostly replaced sucrose (table sugar) in the food industry.(Bray, 2004 & U.S. Department of Agriculture, Economic Research Service, Sugar and Sweetener Yearbook series, Tables 50‚Äì52) Factors contributing to the rise of HFCS include production quotas of domestic sugar, import tariffs on foreign sugar, and subsidies of U.S. corn, raising the price of sucrose and lowering that of HFCS, making it cheapest for many sweetener applications. In spite of having a 10% greater fructose content, the relative sweetness of HFCS 55, used most commonly in soft drinks, is comparable to that of sucrose. HFCS (and/or standard corn syrup) is the primary ingredient in most brands of commercial \\"pancake syrup\\", as a less expensive substitute for maple syrup. Because of its similar sugar profile and lower price, HFCS is often added to adulterate honey. Assays to detect adulteration with HFCS use differential scanning calorimetry and other advanced testing methods.  Production  = Process = In the contemporary process, corn is milled to extract corn starch and an \\"acid-enzyme\\" process is used, in which the corn-starch solution is acidified to begin breaking up the existing carbohydrates. High-temperature enzymes are added to further metabolize the starch and convert the resulting sugars to fructose. The first enzyme added is alpha-amylase, which breaks the long chains down into shorter sugar chains ‚Äì oligosaccharides. Glucoamylase is mixed in and converts them to glucose. The resulting solution is filtered to remove protein, then using activated carbon, and then demineralized using ion- exchange resins. The purified solution is then run over immobilized xylose isomerase, which turns the sugars to ~50‚Äì52% glucose with some unconverted oligosaccharides and 42% fructose (HFCS 42), and again demineralized and again purified using activated carbon. Some is processed into HFCS 90 by liquid chromatography, and then mixed with HFCS 42 to form HFCS 55. The enzymes used in the process are made by microbial fermentation. = Composition and varieties = HFCS is 24% water, the rest being mainly fructose and glucose with 0‚Äì5% unprocessed glucose oligomers. The most common forms of HFCS used for food and beverage manufacturing contain fructose in either 42% (\\"HFCS 42\\") or 55% (\\"HFCS 55\\") amounts, as described in the US Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR 184.1866). * HFCS 42 (approx. 42% fructose if water were ignored) is used in beverages, processed foods, cereals, and baked goods. * HFCS 55 is mostly used in soft drinks. * HFCS 65 is used in soft drinks dispensed by Coca-Cola Freestyle machines. *HFCS 70 is used in filling jellies * HFCS 90 has some niche uses, but is mainly mixed with HFCS 42 to make HFCS 55. Commerce and consumption Consumption of sugar and corn-based sweeteners in the United States from 1966 to 2013, in dry-basis pounds per capita The global market for HFCS is expected to grow from $5.9 billion in 2019 to a projected $7.6 billion in 2024. = China = HFCS in China makes up about 20% of sweetener demand. HFCS has gained popularity due to rising prices of sucrose, while selling for a third the price. Production was estimated to reach 4,150,000 tonnes in 2017. About half of total produced HFCS is exported to the Philippines, Indonesia, Vietnam, and India. = European Union = In the European Union (EU), HFCS is known as isoglucose or glucose-fructose syrup (GFS) which has 20‚Äì30% fructose content compared to 42% (HFCS 42) and 55% (HFCS 55) in the United States. While HFCS is produced exclusively with corn in the US, manufacturers in the EU use corn and wheat to produce GFS. GFS was once subject to a sugar production quota, which was abolished on 1 October 2017, removing the previous production cap of 720,000 tonnes, and allowing production and export without restriction. Use of GFS in soft drinks is limited in the EU because manufacturers do not have a sufficient supply of GFS containing at least 42% fructose content. As a result, soft drinks are primarily sweetened by sucrose which has a 50% fructose content. = Japan = In Japan, HFCS is also referred to as isomerized sugar. HFCS production arose in Japan after government policies created a rise in the price of sugar. Japanese HFCS is manufactured mostly from imported U.S. corn, and the output is regulated by the government. For the period from 2007 to 2012, HFCS had a 27‚Äì30% share of the Japanese sweetener market.International Sugar Organization March 2012 Alternative Sweeteners in a High Sugar Price Environment. Japan consumed approximately 800,000 tonnes of HFCS in 2016. The United States Department of Agriculture states that corn from the United States is what Japan uses to produce their HFCS. Japan imports at a level of 3 million tonnes per year, leading 20 percent of corn imports to be for HFCS production. = Mexico = Mexico is the largest importer of U.S. HFCS. HFCS accounts for about 27 percent of total sweetener consumption, with Mexico importing 983,069 tonnes of HFCS in 2018. Mexico's soft drink industry is shifting from sugar to HFCS which is expected to boost U.S. HFCS exports to Mexico according to a U.S. Department of Agriculture Foreign Agricultural Service report. On 1 January 2002, Mexico imposed a 20% beverage tax on soft drinks and syrups not sweetened with cane sugar. The United States challenged the tax, appealing to the World Trade Organization (WTO). On 3 March 2006, the WTO ruled in favor of the U.S. citing the tax as discriminatory against U.S. imports of HFCS without being justified under WTO rules. = Philippines = The Philippines was the largest importer of Chinese HFCS. Imports of HFCS would peak at 373,137 tonnes in 2016. Complaints from domestic sugar producers would result in a crackdown on Chinese exports. On 1 January 2018, the Philippine government imposed a tax of 12 pesos ($.24) on drinks sweetened with HFCS versus 6 pesos ($.12) for drinks sweetened with other sugars. =United States= In the United States, HFCS was widely used in food manufacturing from the 1970s through the early 21st century, primarily as a replacement for sucrose because its sweetness was similar to sucrose, it improved manufacturing quality, was easier to use, and was cheaper. Domestic production of HFCS increased from 2.2 million tons in 1980 to a peak of 9.5 million tons in 1999. Although HFCS use is about the same as sucrose use in the United States, more than 90% of sweeteners used in global manufacturing is sucrose. Production of HFCS in the United States was 8.3 million tons in 2017. HFCS is easier to handle than granulated sucrose, although some sucrose is transported as solution. Unlike sucrose, HFCS cannot be hydrolyzed, but the free fructose in HFCS may produce hydroxymethylfurfural when stored at high temperatures; these differences are most prominent in acidic beverages. Soft drink makers such as Coca-Cola and Pepsi continue to use sugar in other nations but transitioned to HFCS for U.S. markets in 1980 before completely switching over in 1984. Large corporations, such as Archer Daniels Midland, lobby for the continuation of government corn subsidies. Consumption of HFCS in the U.S. has declined since it peaked at per person in 1999. The average American consumed approximately of HFCS in 2018, versus of refined cane and beet sugar. This decrease in domestic consumption of HFCS resulted in a push in exporting of the product. In 2014, exports of HFCS were valued at $436 million, a decrease of 21% in one year, with Mexico receiving about 75% of the export volume. In 2010, the Corn Refiners Association petitioned the FDA to call HFCS \\"corn sugar\\", but the petition was denied. = Vietnam = 90% of Vietnam's HFCS import comes from China and South Korea. Imports would total 89,343 tonnes in 2017. One ton of HFCS was priced at $398 in 2017, while one ton of sugar would cost $702. HFCS has a zero cent import tax and no quota, while sugarcane under quota has a 5% tax, and white and raw sugar not under quota have an 85% and 80% tax. In 2018, the Vietnam Sugarcane and Sugar Association (VSSA) called for government intervention on current tax policies. According to the VSSA, sugar companies face tighter lending policies which cause the association's member companies with increased risk of bankruptcy.  Health  =Nutrition= HFCS is 76% carbohydrates and 24% water, containing no fat, protein, or micronutrients in significant amounts (table). In a 100-gram serving, it supplies 281 calories, while in one tablespoon of 19 grams, it supplies 53 calories (table link). = Obesity and metabolic syndrome = There is no scientific evidence that HFCS itself causes obesity or metabolic syndrome, but rather overconsumption and excessive caloric intake of any sweetened food or beverage may contribute to these diseases. Epidemiological research has shown that the increase in metabolic disorders, such as obesity and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, is linked to increased consumption of sugars and calories in general. A 2012 review found that fructose did not appear to cause weight gain when it replaced other carbohydrates in diets with similar calories. A 2014 systematic review found little evidence for an association between HFCS consumption and liver diseases, enzyme levels or fat content. A 2018 review by the university of Colorado found that diets high in fructose can cause the Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease, due to the conversion of fructose by fructokinase C, resulting in ATP consumption, nucleotide turnover and uric acid generation that mediate fat accumulation. The American Heart Association recommended that people limit added sugar (such as maltose, sucrose, high fructose corn syrup, molasses or cane sugar) in their diets. = Safety and manufacturing concerns = Since 2014, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has determined that HFCS is safe as an ingredient for food and beverage manufacturing. and there is no evidence that retail HFCS products differ in safety from those containing alternative nutritive sweeteners. The 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommended that added sugars should be limited in the diet. One consumer concern about HFCS is that processing of corn is more complex than used for ‚Äúsimpler‚Äù or ‚Äúmore natural‚Äù sugars, such as fruit juice concentrates or agave nectar, but all sweetener products derived from raw materials involve similar processing steps of pulping, hydrolysis, enzyme treatment, and filtration, among other common steps of sweetener manufacturing from natural sources. In the contemporary process to make HFCS, an \\"acid-enzyme\\" step is used in which the corn starch solution is acidified to digest the existing carbohydrates, then enzymes are added to further metabolize the corn starch and convert the resulting sugars to their constituents of fructose and glucose. Analyses published in 2014 showed that HFCS content of fructose was consistent across samples from 80 randomly selected carbonated beverages sweetened with HFCS. One prior concern in manufacturing was whether HFCS contains reactive carbonyl compounds or advanced glycation end-products evolved during processing. This concern was dismissed, however, with evidence that HFCS poses no dietary risk from these compounds. Through the early 21st Century, some factories manufacturing HFCS had used a chlor-alkali corn processing method which, in cases of applying mercury cell technology for digesting corn raw material, left trace residues of mercury in some batches of HFCS. In a 2009 release, The Corn Refiners Association stated that all factories in the American industry for manufacturing HFCS had used mercury- free processing over several previous years, making the prior report outdated. As of 2018, the USDA, FDA and US Centers for Disease Control list HFCS as a safe food ingredient, and do not mention mercury as a safety concern in HFCS products. = Fructose concentration and consistency = The USFDA has recognized that studies have found differences between how humans metabolize fructose compared to other simple sugars. The agency does not consider HFCS-42 nor HFCS-55 to be better or worse for health due to it providing a relatively equivalent amount of dietary fructose as other approved sweeteners. Expressed in a 2013 review; ‚Äúdietary fructose consumption, which cannot be measured by conventional dietary methods because the fructose content of HFCS is not disclosed, may be much higher than...common assumptions.‚Äù  Other  = Taste difference = Most countries, including Mexico, use sucrose, or table sugar, in soft drinks. In the U.S., soft drinks, such as Coca-Cola, are typically made with HFCS 55. HFCS has a sweeter taste than glucose. Some Americans seek out drinks such as Mexican Coca-Cola in ethnic groceries because they prefer the taste over that of HFCS-sweetened Coca-Cola. Kosher Coca-Cola, sold in the U.S. around the Jewish holiday of Passover, also uses sucrose rather than HFCS and is highly sought after by people who prefer the original taste. While these are simply opinions, a 2011 study further backed up the idea that people enjoy sucrose (table sugar) more than HFCS. The study, conducted by Michigan State University, included a 99-member panel that evaluated yogurt sweetened with sucrose (table sugar), HFCS, and different varieties of honey for likeness. The results showed that, overall, the panel enjoyed the yogurt with sucrose (table sugar) added more than those that contained HFCS or honey. = Beekeeping = In apiculture in the United States, HFCS is a honey substitute for some managed honey bee colonies during times when nectar is in low supply. However, when HFCS is heated to about , hydroxymethylfurfural, which is toxic to bees, can form from the breakdown of fructose. Although some researchers cite honey substitution with HFCS as one factor among many for colony collapse disorder, there is no evidence that HFCS is the only cause. Compared to hive honey, both HFCS and sucrose caused signs of malnutrition in bees fed with them, apparent in the expression of genes involved in protein metabolism and other processes affecting honey bee health. = Public relations = There are various public relations concerns with HFCS, including how HFCS products are advertised and labeled as \\"natural\\". As a consequence, several companies reverted to manufacturing with sucrose (table sugar) from products that had previously been made with HFCS. In 2010, the Corn Refiners Association (CRA) applied to allow HFCS to be renamed \\"corn sugar\\", but that petition was rejected by the United States Food and Drug Administration in 2012. In August 2016 in a move to please consumers with health concerns, McDonald's announced they would be replacing all HFCS in their buns with sucrose (table sugar) and would cut out preservatives and other artificial additives from their menu items. Marion Gross, senior vice president of McDonald's stated, \\"We know that they [consumers] don't feel good about high-fructose corn syrup so we're giving them what they're looking for instead.\\" Over the early 21st century, other companies such as Yoplait, Gatorade, and Hershey's also phased out HFCS, replacing it with conventional sugar because consumers perceived sugar to be healthier. Companies such as PepsiCo and Heinz have also released products that use sugar in lieu of HFCS, although they still sell HFCS-sweetened products.  History  Commercial production of corn syrup began in 1964.White J. S. Sucrose, HFCS, and Fructose: History, Manufacture, Composition, Applications, and Production. Chapter 2 in J. M. Rippe (ed.), Fructose, High Fructose Corn Syrup, Sucrose and Health, Nutrition and Health. Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014. . In the late 1950s, scientists at Clinton Corn Processing Company of Clinton, Iowa, tried to turn glucose from corn starch into fructose, but the process was not scalable. In 1965‚Äì1970 Yoshiyuki Takasaki, at the Japanese National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) developed a heat-stable xylose isomerase enzyme from yeast. In 1967, the Clinton Corn Processing Company obtained an exclusive license to manufacture glucose isomerase derived from Streptomyces bacteria and began shipping an early version of HFCS in February 1967. In 1983, the FDA approved HFCS as Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS), and that decision was reaffirmed in 1996. Prior to the development of the worldwide sugar industry, dietary fructose was limited to only a few items. Milk, meats, and most vegetables, the staples of many early diets, have no fructose, and only 5‚Äì10% fructose by weight is found in fruits such as grapes, apples, and blueberries. Most traditional dried fruits, however, contain about 50% fructose. From 1970 to 2000, there was a 25% increase in \\"added sugars\\" in the U.S. When recognized as a cheaper, more versatile sweetener, HFCS replaced sucrose as the main sweetener of soft drinks in the United States. Since 1789, the U.S. sugar industry has had trade protection against tariffs imposed by foreign-produced sugar, while subsidies to corn growers cheapen the primary ingredient in HFCS, corn. Industrial users looking for cheaper replacements rapidly adopted HFCS in the 1970s.

It appeared on The Wall album in 1979. Composition The song is approximately one minute, 46 seconds in length, beginning with 24 seconds of a helicopter sound effect, followed by the schoolmaster shouting (in a helicopter) \\"You! Yes, you! Stand still, laddie!\\" performed by Roger Waters. Waters's lead vocal is treated with a reverse echo. The lead instrument is an electric guitar with an added delay effect, playing roots (mostly D, G and A over a melody in D minor). The bass and guitar figure heard during the verses, G to A, is similar to the one in \\"Waiting for the Worms\\", a song that appears much later in the album. During the transition to \\"Another Brick in the Wall, Pt. 2\\", the key shifts from D minor to the relative major, F major, with dramatic drum rolls and harmony vocals. On the album, \\"The Happiest Days of Our Lives\\" segues into \\"Another Brick in the Wall, Pt. 2\\" with a loud, high-pitched scream by Roger Waters. Because of this segue, many radio stations play one right after the other, and subsequent Floyd compilation albums (both Echoes and A Foot in the Door) use this song as the extended intro to \\"Another Brick in the Wall\\". In the film based on the album, the sound at the beginning of the song is depicted as coming from a train entering a large tunnel, rather than a helicopter, as heard on the album. According to Gerald Scarfe, there was supposed to be a puppet of the teacher at the end of the tunnel in the film. Alan Parker made shots of it, but it didn't work out, so they used Alex McAvoy, who played the schoolteacher, to do the scene instead. Before the cut in the middle for the Schoolmaster to mock Pink, somewhat quiet hysterical laughter is heard, extremely similar to the Schoolmaster's voice. Additionally, the song is slightly faster and the bass is noticeably louder compared to the album version. Plot The Wall tells the story of Pink, an embittered and alienated rock star in retreat from society and personal relationships. \\"The Happiest Days of Our Lives\\" concerns Pink's youth, attending a school run by strict and often violent teachers who treat the pupils with contempt. According to Waters, the lyrics were a reflection of his own negative experience in school. He described this in an interview with Tommy Vance of BBC Radio One. Film version Pink and his two friends go down to a railway track to lay bullets on the rails and watch them explode under the passing train. Pink, putting himself up against the tunnel wall, sees that the train cars are packed with faceless people. He sees his teacher at the other end of the tunnel yelling at him to stand still. In the next scene, in Pink's school, the teacher discovers Pink writing a poem (which contains lyrics from \\"Money\\") and, as punishment, ridicules Pink by reading his poem out loud to the entire class then slaps his left hand with a ruler. The following scene shows the Schoolmaster in his own home, being forced to eat a piece of tough meat during dinner at his wife's silent command. To relieve himself of his humiliation, the teacher spanks a child with a belt the next day.

Speechwriters are employed by many senior-level elected officials and executives in the government and private sectors. They can also be employed to write for weddings and other social occasions. Skills and training A speechwriter works directly with senior executives or leaders to determine what points, themes, positions, or messages the executive would like to cover. Speechwriters need to be able to accept criticism and comments on the different drafts of the speech, and be able to incorporate the proposed changes into the draft. Speechwriters have to be able to work on several different speeches at once, and manage their time so that they can meet strict deadlines for finishing the speech on time. Speechwriters must also be able to accept anonymity, because with few exceptions, speechwriters are not officially credited or acknowledged. This aspect creates a dilemma for historians and compilers of speech anthology; namely, when some poignant phrase gains popularity such as John F. Kennedy's \\"ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country,\\". Should credit be given to the President, to speechwriter Ted Sorensen, or to both? Professional speechwriter Lawrence Bernstein writes: While there is a guild called \\"The UK Speechwriters' Guild\\" for professional speechwriters, they do not usually have specific training in the area or field for which they are writing speeches. Instead, speechwriters often have a broad understanding of basic economics, political roles, and policy issues, which make them generalists who are able to \\"translate\\" complex economic and policy issues into a clear message for the general public. As with many other writing occupations, most speechwriters do not have specific training in their writing craft. Instead, speechwriters often develop their speech writing skills by combining a general liberal arts education (e.g., in political science, philosophy, or English literature) with a variety of work experience in politics, public administration, journalism, or a related field. The delivery of the speech is part of the challenge speechwriters face when crafting the message. Executive speechwriter Anthony Trendl writes: Speechwriting process U.S. President Barack Obama and aides Carol Browner, David Axelrod and Jon Favreau working on a speech in June 2010. Writing a speech involves several steps. A speechwriter has to meet with the executive and the executive's senior staff to determine the broad framework of points or messages that the executive wants to cover in the speech. Then, the speechwriter does his or her own research on the topic to flesh out this framework with anecdotes and examples. The speechwriter will also consider the audience for the speech, which can range from a town-hall meeting of community leaders to an international leaders' forum. Then the speechwriter blends the points, themes, positions, and messages with his or her own research to create an \\"informative, original and authentic speech\\" for the executive. The speechwriter then presents a draft version of the speech to the executive (or the executive's staff) and makes notes on any revisions or changes that are requested. If the speechwriter is familiar with the topic and the positions and style of the executive, only small changes may be needed. In other cases, the executive may feel that the speech does not have the right tone or flow, and the entire speech may have to be re-drafted.

The term abrasive jet refers specifically to the use of a mixture of water and abrasive to cut hard materials such as metal or granite, while the terms pure waterjet and water-only cutting refer to waterjet cutting without the use of added abrasives, often used for softer materials such as wood or rubber. Waterjet cutting is often used during fabrication of machine parts. It is the preferred method when the materials being cut are sensitive to the high temperatures generated by other methods. Waterjet cutting is used in various industries, including mining and aerospace, for cutting, shaping, and reaming.  History  CNC cutting machine = Waterjet = While using high-pressure water for erosion dates back as far as the mid-1800s with hydraulic mining, it was not until the 1930s that narrow jets of water started to appear as an industrial cutting device. In 1933, the Paper Patents Company in Wisconsin developed a paper metering, cutting, and reeling machine that used a diagonally moving waterjet nozzle to cut a horizontally moving sheet of continuous paper.Fourness, Charles A et al, Paper Metering, Cutting, and Reeling , filed May 22, 1933, and issued July 2, 1935. These early applications were at a low pressure and restricted to soft materials like paper. Waterjet technology evolved in the post-war era as researchers around the world searched for new methods of efficient cutting systems. In 1956, Carl Johnson of Durox International in Luxembourg developed a method for cutting plastic shapes using a thin stream high-pressure waterjet, but those materials, like paper, were soft materials.Johnson, Carl Olof, Method for Cutting Up Plastic and Semi-Plastic Masses , filed March 13, 1956, and issued April 14, 1959. In 1958, Billie Schwacha of North American Aviation developed a system using ultra-high-pressure liquid to cut hard materials.Schwacha, Billie G., Liquid Cutting of Hard Metals , filed October 13, 1958, and issued May 23, 1961. This system used a pump to deliver a hypersonic liquid jet that could cut high strength alloys such as PH15-7-MO stainless steel. Used to cut honeycomb laminate for the Mach 3 North American XB-70 Valkyrie, this cutting method resulted in delaminating at high speed, requiring changes to the manufacturing process.Jenkins, Dennis R & Tony R Landis, Valkyrie: North American's Mach 3 Superbomber, Specialty Press, 2004, p. 108. While not effective for the XB-70 project, the concept was valid and further research continued to evolve waterjet cutting. In 1962, Philip Rice of Union Carbide explored using a pulsing waterjet at up to to cut metals, stone, and other materials.Rice, Phillip K., Process for Cutting and Working Solid Materials , filed October 26, 1962, and issued October 19, 1965. Research by S.J. Leach and G.L. Walker in the mid-1960s expanded on traditional coal waterjet cutting to determine ideal nozzle shape for high-pressure waterjet cutting of stone,Leach, S.J. and G.L. Walker, The Application of High Speed Liquid Jets to Cutting, Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London Series A, Mathematical and Physical Sciences, Vol 260, No 1110, July 28, 1966, pp. 295‚Äì310. and Norman Franz in the late 1960s focused on waterjet cutting of soft materials by dissolving long chain polymers in the water to improve the cohesiveness of the jet stream.Franz, Norman C., High Velocity Liquid Jet , filed May 31, 1968, and issued August 18, 1970. In the early 1970s, the desire to improve the durability of the waterjet nozzle led Ray Chadwick, Michael Kurko, and Joseph Corriveau of the Bendix Corporation to come up with the idea of using corundum crystal to form a waterjet orifice,Chadwick, Ray F Chadwick, Michael C Kurko, and Joseph A Corriveau, Nozzle for Producing Fluid Cutting Jet , filed March 1, 1971, and issued September 4, 1973. while Norman Franz expanded on this and created a waterjet nozzle with an orifice as small as that operated at pressures up to .Franz, Norman C., Very High Velocity Fluid Jet Nozzles and Methods of Making Same , filed July 16, 1971, and issued August 7, 1973. John Olsen, along with George Hurlburt and Louis Kapcsandy at Flow Research (later Flow Industries), further improved the commercial potential of the waterjet by showing that treating the water beforehand could increase the operational life of the nozzle.Olsen, John H., George H. Hurlburt, and Louis E. Kapcsandy, Method for Making High Velocity Liquid Jet , filed June 21, 1976, and issued August 12, 1980. = High pressure = High-pressure vessels and pumps became affordable and reliable with the advent of steam power. By the mid-1800s, steam locomotives were common and the first efficient steam-driven fire engine was operational. By the turn of the century, high-pressure reliability improved, with locomotive research leading to a sixfold increase in boiler pressure, some reaching . Most high-pressure pumps at this time, though, operated around . High-pressure systems were further shaped by the aviation, automotive, and oil industries. Aircraft manufacturers such as Boeing developed seals for hydraulically boosted control systems in the 1940s,Berry, Mitchell M., Piston Sealing Assembly , filed March 3, 1941, and issued March 23, 1943. while automotive designers followed similar research for hydraulic suspension systems.Templeton, Herbert W., Metering Valve Seal , filed July 11, 1958, and issued July 18, 1961. Higher pressures in hydraulic systems in the oil industry also led to the development of advanced seals and packing to prevent leaks.Webb, Derrel D., High Pressure Packing Means , filed August 12, 1957, and issued October 17, 1961. These advances in seal technology, plus the rise of plastics in the post-war years, led to the development of the first reliable high-pressure pump. The invention of Marlex by Robert Banks and John Paul Hogan of the Phillips Petroleum company required a catalyst to be injected into the polyethylene.Hogan, John Paul and Robert L. Banks, Polymers and Production Thereof , filed March 26, 1956, and issued March 4, 1958. McCartney Manufacturing Company in Baxter Springs, Kansas, began manufacturing these high-pressure pumps in 1960 for the polyethylene industry. Flow Industries in Kent, Washington set the groundwork for commercial viability of waterjets with John Olsen‚Äôs development of the high-pressure fluid intensifier in 1973,Olsen, John H., High Pressure Fluid Intensifier and Method , filed January 12, 1973, and issued May 21, 1974. a design that was further refined in 1976.Olsen, John H., High Pressure Fluid Intensifier and Method , filed March 16, 1976, and issued June 14, 1977. Flow Industries then combined the high-pressure pump research with their waterjet nozzle research and brought waterjet cutting into the manufacturing world. = Abrasive waterjet = The Evolution of the Abrasive Waterjet NozzleWhile cutting with water is possible for soft materials, the addition of an abrasive turned the waterjet into a modern machining tool for all materials. This began in 1935 when the idea of adding an abrasive to the water stream was developed by Elmo Smith for the liquid abrasive blasting.Smith, Elmo V., Liquid Blasting , filed June 10, 1935, and issued May 12, 1936. Smith‚Äôs design was further refined by Leslie Tirrell of the Hydroblast Corporation in 1937, resulting in a nozzle design that created a mix of high-pressure water and abrasive for the purpose of wet blasting.Tirrell, Leslie L., Sandblast Device , filed April 3, 1937, and issued October 17, 1939. The first publications on the modern Abrasive Waterjets (AWJ) cutting were published by Dr. Mohamed Hashish in the 1982 BHR proceedings showing, for the first time, that waterjets with relatively small amounts of abrasives are capable of cutting hard materials such as steel and concrete. The March 1984 issue of the Mechanical Engineering magazine showed more details and materials cut with AWJ such as titanium, aluminum, glass, and stone. Dr. Mohamed Hashish, was awarded a patent on forming AWJ in 1987.Hashish, Mohamed, Michael Kirby and Yih-Ho Pao, Method and Apparatus for Forming a High Velocity Liquid Abrasive Jet , filed October 7, 1985, and issued March 10, 1987. Dr. Hashish, who also coined the new term Abrasive Waterjet (AWJ), and his team continued to develop and improve the AWJ technology and its hardware for many applications which is now in over 50 industries worldwide. A most critical development was creating a durable mixing tube that could withstand the power of the high-pressure AWJ, and it was Boride Products (now Kennametal) development of their ROCTEC line of ceramic tungsten carbide composite tubes that significantly increased the operational life of the AWJ nozzle. Current work on AWJ nozzles is on micro abrasive waterjet so cutting with jets smaller than in diameter can be commercialized. Working with Ingersoll-Rand Waterjet Systems, Michael Dixon implemented the first production practical means of cutting titanium sheets‚Äîan abrasive waterjet system very similar to those in widespread use today. By January 1989, that system was being run 24 hours a day producing titanium parts for the B-1B largely at Rockwell's North American Aviation facility in Newark, Ohio. = Waterjet control = As waterjet cutting moved into traditional manufacturing shops, controlling the cutter reliably and accurately was essential. Early waterjet cutting systems adapted traditional systems such as mechanical pantographs and CNC systems based on John Parsons‚Äô 1952 NC milling machine and running G-code. Challenges inherent to waterjet technology revealed the inadequacies of traditional G-Code, as accuracy depends on varying the speed of the nozzle as it approaches corners and details. Creating motion control systems to incorporate those variables became a major innovation for leading waterjet manufacturers in the early 1990s, with Dr John Olsen of OMAX Corporation developing systems to precisely position the waterjet nozzleOlsen, John H., Motion Control for Quality in Jet Cutting , filed May 14, 1997, and issued April 6, 1999. while accurately specifying the speed at every point along the path,Olsen, John H., Motion Control with Precomputation , filed October 7, 1993, and issued April 16, 1996. and also utilizing common PCs as a controller. The largest waterjet manufacturer, Flow International (a spinoff of Flow Industries), recognized the benefits of that system and licensed the OMAX software, with the result that the vast majority of waterjet cutting machines worldwide are simple to use, fast, and accurate. Large Water Jet Abrasive Cutting Machine  Operation  All waterjets follow the same principle of using high pressure water focused into a beam by a nozzle. Most machines accomplish this by first running the water through a high pressure pump. There are two types of pumps used to create this high pressure; an intensifier pump and a direct drive or crankshaft pump. A direct drive pump works much like a car engine, forcing water through high pressure tubing using plungers attached to a crankshaft. An intensifier pump creates pressure by using hydraulic oil to move a piston forcing the water through a tiny hole. The water then travels along the high pressure tubing to the nozzle of the waterjet. In the nozzle, the water is focused into a thin beam by a jewel orifice. This beam of water is ejected from the nozzle, cutting through the material by spraying it with the jet of speed on the order of Mach 3, around . The process is the same for abrasive waterjets until the water reaches the nozzle. Here abrasives such as garnet and aluminium oxide, are fed into the nozzle via an abrasive inlet. The abrasive then mixes with the water in a mixing tube and is forced out the end at high pressure.  Benefits  An important benefit of the water jet is the ability to cut material without interfering with its inherent structure, as there is no heat-affected zone (HAZ). Minimizing the effects of heat allows metals to be cut without harming or changing intrinsic properties.Lorincz, Jim. Waterjets: Evolving from Macro to Micro, Manufacturing Engineering, Society of Manufacturing Engineers, November, 2009 Sharp corners, bevels, pierce holes, and shapes with minimal inner radii are all possible. Water jet cutters are also capable of producing intricate cuts in material. With specialized software and 3-D machining heads, complex shapes can be produced.Lorincz, Waterjets: Evolving from Macro to Micro. The kerf, or width, of the cut can be adjusted by swapping parts in the nozzle, as well as changing the type and size of abrasive. Typical abrasive cuts have a kerf in the range of , but can be as narrow as . Non-abrasive cuts are normally , but can be as small as , which is approximately that of a human hair. These small jets can permit small details in a wide range of applications. Water jets are capable of attaining accuracy down to and repeatability down to . Due to its relatively narrow kerf, water jet cutting can reduce the amount of scrap material produced, by allowing uncut parts to be nested more closely together than traditional cutting methods. Water jets use approximately per minute (depending on the cutting head's orifice size), and the water can be recycled using a closed-loop system. Waste water usually is clean enough to filter and dispose of down a drain. The garnet abrasive is a non-toxic material that can be mostly recycled for repeated use; otherwise, it can usually be disposed in a landfill. Water jets also produce fewer airborne dust particles, smoke, fumes, and contaminants, reducing operator exposure to hazardous materials. Meatcutting using waterjet technology eliminates the risk of cross contamination since the contact medium is discarded.  Versatility  A water jet cutting a metal tool Because the nature of the cutting stream can be easily modified the water jet can be used in nearly every industry; there are many different materials that the water jet can cut. Some of them have unique characteristics that require special attention when cutting. Materials commonly cut with a water jet include textiles, rubber, foam, plastics, leather, composites, stone, tile, glass, metals, food, paper and much more. \\"Most ceramics can also be cut on an abrasive water jet as long as the material is softer than the abrasive being used (between 7.5 and 8.5 on the Mohs scale)\\". Examples of materials that cannot be cut with a water jet are tempered glass and diamonds. Water jets are capable of cutting up to of metals and of most materials,, though in specialized coal mining applications, water jets are capable of cutting up to using a nozzle. Specially designed water jet cutters are commonly used to remove excess bitumen from road surfaces that have become the subject of binder flushing. Flushing is a natural occurrence caused during hot weather where the aggregate becomes level with the bituminous binder layer creating a hazardously smooth road surface during wet weather.  Availability  Commercial water jet cutting systems are available from manufacturers all over the world, in a range of sizes, and with water pumps capable of a range of pressures. Typical water jet cutting machines have a working envelope as small as a few square feet, or up to hundreds of square feet. Ultra-high-pressure water pumps are available from as low as up to .  Process  There are six main process characteristics to water jet cutting: # Uses a high velocity stream of Ultra High Pressure Water which is produced by a high pressure pump with possible abrasive particles suspended in the stream. # Is used for machining a large array of materials, including heat-sensitive, delicate or very hard materials. # Produces no heat damage to workpiece surface or edges. # Nozzles are typically made of sintered boride or composite tungsten carbide. # Produces a taper of less than 1 degree on most cuts, which can be reduced or eliminated entirely by slowing down the cut process or tilting the jet. # Distance of nozzle from workpiece affects the size of the kerf and the removal rate of material. Typical distance is . Temperature is not as much of a factor.  Edge quality  Different edge qualities for waterjet-cut parts Edge quality for water jet cut parts is defined with the quality numbers Q1 through Q5. Lower numbers indicate rougher edge finish; higher numbers are smoother. For thin materials, the difference in cutting speed for Q1 could be as much as 3 times faster than the speed for Q5. For thicker materials, Q1 could be 6 times faster than Q5. For example, thick aluminium Q5 would be and Q1 would be , 5.8 times faster.  Multi-axis cutting  A 5-Axis Waterjet Cutting Head A 5-Axis Waterjet Part In 1987, Ingersoll-Rand Waterjet Systems offered a 5-axis pure-water waterjet cutting system called the Robotic Waterjet System. The system was an overhead gantry design, similar in overall size to the HS-1000. With recent advances in control and motion technology, 5-axis water jet cutting (abrasive and pure) has become a reality. Where the normal axes on a water jet are named Y (back/forth), X (left/right) and Z (up/down), a 5-axis system will typically add an A axis (angle from perpendicular) and C axis (rotation around the Z-axis). Depending on the cutting head, the maximum cutting angle for the A axis can be anywhere from 55, 60, or in some cases even 90 degrees from vertical. As such, 5-axis cutting opens up a wide range of applications that can be machined on a water jet cutting machine. A 5-axis cutting head can be used to cut 4-axis parts, where the bottom surface geometries are shifted a certain amount to produce the appropriate angle and the Z-axis remains at one height. This can be useful for applications like weld preparation where a bevel angle needs to be cut on all sides of a part that will later be welded, or for taper compensation purposes where the kerf angle is transferred to the waste material ‚Äì thus eliminating the taper commonly found on water jet-cut parts. A 5-axis head can cut parts where the Z-axis is also moving along with all the other axes. This full 5-axis cutting could be used for cutting contours on various surfaces of formed parts. Because of the angles that can be cut, part programs may need to have additional cuts to free the part from the sheet. Attempting to slide a complex part at a severe angle from a plate can be difficult without appropriate relief cuts.

History It began operations in 1901 as a drydock, and continued as a navy facility until 1996 when it ceased operations as the result of recommendations of the 1993 Base Realignment and Closure Commission. At that time it was leased to Detyens Shipyards, Inc. Originally designated as the Navy Yard and later as the Naval Base it had a large impact upon the local community, the tri-county area and the entire State of South Carolina. The yard first produced the destroyer , then began to increase production in the 1930s. A total of 21 destroyers were assembled at the naval facility. USS Beatty (DD-640) and USS Tillman (DD-641) at the Charleston Navy Yard in 1941 In 1931, Ellicott Dredges delivered the 20-inch cutter dredge Orion still in operation at the old Charleston Naval Shipyard. Two of the largest vessels ever built at the yard were two destroyer tenders, and . The keels of these ships were laid in November 1944 and July 1945, respectively. Peak employment of 25,948 was reached in July 1943. After the war, the shipyard was responsible for the repairs and alterations of captured German submarines. In April 1948, Secretary of the Navy John L. Sullivan told Charleston's Representative Rivers and Senator Burnet R. Maybank that the navy planned for CNSY to become a submarine overhaul yard and would ask for an initial appropriation for a battery-charging unit. Aerial view of the Charleston Navy Yard in 1941. The first submarine, , arrived for overhaul in August 1948. The shipyard expected to overhaul about 132 ships during the year, and its work force had stabilized to nearly 5,000 persons. North Korean invasion of South Korea in June 1950 increased production once again. By 1951, the shipyard was back to over 8,000 employees. In all, the shipyard activated forty-four vessels and converted twenty-seven for active fleet duty during the Korean War. Submarines continued to be built into the 1960s along with missiles, and nuclear submarine overhauls took place including in 1962. In 1966, the shipyard completed the first refueling of a nuclear submarine, , and began its first overhaul of a Fleet Ballistic Missile (FBM) submarine, . Work began on deepening Dry Dock No. 2 so it could handle the massive FBM submarines and destroyers fitted with sonar.\\" Colletta, Paolo E., Ed.United States Navy and Marine Corps Bases, Domestic..

The facility remained a major installation throughout the Cold War as a homeport to numerous cruisers, destroyers, attack submarines, FBM submarines, destroyer tenders, and submarine tenders of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet until its closure in the 1990s as a result of the end of the Cold War and subsequent BRAC Commission action. Post-BRAC = Military and industrial use = With the closure of the Naval Base and Charleston Naval Shipyard in 1996, Detyens, Inc. signed a long term lease. With three dry docks, one floating dock, and six piers, Detyens Shipyards, Inc. is the largest commercial facility on the East Coast. Projects include military, commercial, and cruise ships. In supporting Joint Base Charleston, of the former Charleston Naval Base/Naval Shipyard facility have been transformed into a multiuse Federal complex, with 17 Government and Military tenants, as well as homeport for six RO-RO Military Sealift Command ships, two Coast Guard National Security Cutters, two NOAA research ships, the United States Coast Guard Maritime Law Enforcement Academy, and the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center FLETC-Charleston. Lastly, a 350-acre section of the former base was planned to be a sustainable, mixed-use urban hub for the city of North Charleston to be called The Navy Yard at Noisette, starting in 2005. However, in 2010, the developer, the Noisette company, went into foreclosure and Palmetto Railways, part of the S.C. Department of Commerce purchased over 200-acres of the property. In 2013, Palmetto Railways purchased the remaining part of The Navy Yard. The plan is to run freight trains through the north end of the former base to serve a new container port, Navy Base Intermodal Container Transfer Facility, that is under construction at the south end of the former base. State railroad division pays $10 million for remaining Noisette properties on former Navy Base Post and Courier, October 7, 2013. In February 2020, Coast Guard Admiral Karl Schultz announced that the shipyard would be included in a planned \\"super base.\\" The plan would consolidate Coast Guard assets to the North Charleston region and occur within five years. = The Naval Hospital Historic District = The initial Palmetto Railways plan for the former Naval Shipyard required the demolition of several historic structures which led the National Trust for Historic Preservation to add the Charleston Naval Hospital Historic District to its 11 Most Endangered Places list in 2016.

The original Fighter's History was first released for the arcades in 1993 and ported to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1994. Two different sequels were produced: Fighter's History Dynamite (aka Karnov's Revenge outside of Japan) for the Neo Geo in 1994, followed by , released in Japan for the Super Famicom in 1995. The main unique feature of the Fighter's History series is its \\"weak point system\\". By repeatedly hitting an opponent's weak point, the player can temporarily stun them once per round, leaving the opponent open for an attack. The location of an opponent's weak spot varies with each character and is usually represented by a specific article of clothing (i.e.: a headband, a vest, a mask). Games =Fighter's History= The original Fighter's History was released as an arcade game in March 1993. The game uses a six-button control configuration similar to Street Fighter II and its iterations, as well as an alternate version of the first Street Fighter, with three punch buttons and three kick buttons, each for different strength levels (light, medium, and heavy). There are a total of nine playable characters, as well as two non-playable boss characters at the end of the single-player tournament. The final boss and sponsor of the tournament is revealed to be Karnov, the protagonist of the Data East action game of the same name. In this installment hitting an opponent's weak point will not only stun the opponent, it will also cause the opponent to sustain greater damage when the weak point is repeatedly struck afterward. =Karnov's Revenge= Karnov's Revenge, also titled Fighter's History Dynamite in Japan, was released for the arcades March 17, 1994. Due to change of hardware to SNK's MVS platform, the control configuration was reduced from six attack buttons to just four (only light and heavy attacks are available this time). Likewise, the game was released for the Neo Geo home console, as well as the Neo Geo CD, on April 28, 1994. A new gameplay feature is introduced in the form of \\"one- two attacks\\". When the player presses a heavy attack button while performing a light attack or blocking, the interval between light attacks is reduced, making combos easier to perform. All eleven fighters from the previous game return (including the bosses Clown and Karnov, who are now playable) and are joined by two new characters: Yungmie, a female taekwondo exponent from Korea, and Zazie, a karate practitioner from Kenya, for a total of 13 characters. Karnov is the only returning character who was given entirely new sprites. Most of the returning characters were given new special techniques (with a few exceptions), including hidden techniques which are not listed on the instruction card (the manual for the home version hints of their inclusion). =Fighter's History: Mizoguchi Kiki Ippatsu!!= Fighter's History: Mizoguchi Kiki Ippatsu!! (\\"Mizoguchi's Moment of Crisis!!\\") was released in Japan for the Super Famicom on February 17, 1995. Based on Karnov's Revenge, many changes were made to the game, including the addition of a new game mode where Mizoguchi is the protagonist. In addition to the story-based Mizoguchi Mode, there are also three new game modes (Practice, Tag Battle, and Survival) in addition to the traditional CPU Battle and 2-Player Versus Modes. There are nine playable characters in this installment, as five of the characters from the previous Fighter's History games were cut from the roster (Ray, Jean, Matlock, Samchay, and Marstorius). Chelnov, the main character from Data East's arcade game Atomic Runner Chelnov, appears in this game as the final boss. Characters * - The lead character in the first two games. A detective from Los Angeles with a unique fighting style. * - A high school delinquent from Osaka who is in his late 20s after being held back repeatedly for many years. He is the most prominent character in the series, having appeared in several games outside the Fighter's History franchise, including SNK's KOF: Maximum Impact Regulation A. * - A top actress in the Chinese classical opera world. She is also a master of the Chinese murderer's fist, which appears to be Praying Mantis Kung Fu. * - A Japanese high school girl who learned jud≈ç from her grandfather since the age of 3. * - A punk rock guitarist from England who seeks a legendary guitar. * - A muay Thai fighter from Thailand who seeks to support his younger siblings in the absence of his parents. * - A Chinese Bajiquan exponent who participates in the Great Grapple in order to seek the mysterious warrior who killed his father . * - A French gymnast who has always achieved perfect scores until the day he scored a 9.98. Since then, he began picking martial arts in order to improve his grace and strength. He participates in the tournament in order to see the results of his training. * - A professional wrestler from Italy in his 40s who believes that wrestling is the strongest martial art. In the versus screen of Karnov's Revenge, his name is misspelt as Marstrius. * - The sub-boss in the first game. Like his name suggests, he is a clown from a traveling circus who fights with his quick agility as a circus performer. His special moves include a rolling attack and card throws. In Karnov's Revenge, he forms his own circus called \\"Clown's Circus\\" and participates in the second tournament to become stronger than Karnov, as well as to find an \\"attractive male fighter\\". In the Japanese version of the series, Clown is depicted as a homosexual who is attracted to younger men. While the English localization of the first two games removed all references of Clown's sexuality in the game, the manual for the Neo Geo home version still mentions his preferences for men. * - The main boss in the first two games. Originally a character from a previous Data East game of the same name. The second son of a poor Russian farmer, his full name is Jinborov Karnovski. He earned his reputation as a brawling ruffian at a young age by picking fights at neighboring places. He was forced to become a servant of God in the past as punishment for his past behavior, but has since renounced the heavens in order to host his own martial arts tournament, where he is the undefeated champion. After losing in the first game, he hosts the second tournament in Karnov's Revenge in order to seek revenge for his defeat. In Mizoguchi Kiki Ippatsu!, Karnov leaves the heavens from his retirement in order to defeat the people mocking him. * - One of the new characters introduced in Karnov's Revenge. A nature-loving practitioner of the style from Kenya. He participates in the Great Grapple tournament in order to fund his self-made environmentalist organization and protect the African wildlife from poachers. * - The other new character introduced in Karnov's Revenge. A young female taekwondo practitioner from Korea whose parents were both top-class martial artists. She participates in the Great Grapple in order to investigate her parents' disappearance. When she defeats Karnov, she is told that her father committed suicide after losing to Karnov and that her mother disappeared afterward. In Mizoguchi Kiki Ippatsu!, she participates in Chelnov's Great Grapple tournament in order to face her rival Feilin. In her ending in Mizoguchi Kiki Ippatsu!, she becomes a tour guide who travels the world. * - A hidden final opponent in Karnov's Revenge, he is based on the ox that players faced in the early Data East fighting game Karate Champ. * - The final boss exclusive to Mizoguchi Kiki Ippatsu!. The organizer of the \\"Last Great Grapple tournament\\", who wears a strange suit that conceals his true face. It is said that he was a former Russian scientist who was involved in a huge accident that almost killed him. Chelnov was originally the title character of a Data East arcade game of the same name. Related releases =Soundtracks= All three titles in the series had their soundtracks published on CD albums exclusively in Japan. On June 18, 1993, the original arcade version of the original Fighter's History soundtrack was released by Pony Canyon and Scitron Label, while the SNES version's soundtrack was released by Project EGG on July 19, 2011, which can be downloaded on the official Project EGG website. On March 18, 1994, the soundtrack of the Neo Geo MVS / Neo Geo AES version of Karnov's Revenge was added with the Neo Geo MVS / Neo Geo AES soundtrack of Windjammers (known in Japan as Flying Power Disc) by Pony Canyon and Scitron Label in an album titled Fighter's History Dynamite / Flying Power Disc. This album features two exclusive arranged versions of \\"DYNAMITE\\" (from Karnov's Revenge) (Arrange Version begins) and \\"SHOOOT!!\\" (from Windjammers). On July 26, 2011, Project EGG published the soundtrack of the Neo Geo MVS / Neo Geo AES version of Karnov's Revenge alone without the arranged version of \\"DYNAMITE\\", which like their other soundtrack, also can be downloaded on the official Project EGG website. On August 26, 2005, Insanity Naked Hunter Co., Ltd. published the same version Project EGG published, but exclusively as a CD album. On March 19, 1995, Pony Canyon and Scitron Label published the soundtracks of the Neo Geo CD version of Karnov's Revenge and Fighter's History: Mizoguchi Kiki Ippatsu!! both in the album titled Fighter's History Dynamite NEO-GEO CD & Mizoguchi Kiki Ippatsu!!. =Other appearances in media= Outside of the Fighter's History series, Makoto Mizoguchi became prominent when he appeared in several other video games. He appeared in the Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation versions of Data East's 1995 Water Margin- based fighting arcade game, Outlaws Of The Lost Dynasty as an extra character. The Sega Saturn version is known outside Japan as Dark Legend. He and Liu Yungmie later appeared in its Japan-exclusive semi-sequel, titled as Suiko Enbu: Fuuun Saiki. Five years after Data East went out of business while giving their video game rights to G-Mode, Paon, WorkJam and Crea-tech, SNK Playmore signed a deal with G-Mode to use their characters from the Fighter's History series in two SNK Playmore titles. Makoto Mizoguchi became the only character from the Fighter's History series as a special guest character in an upgrade to KOF: Maximum Impact 2 titled as KOF: Maximum Impact Regulation A, to promote the Japan-exclusive cell phone game specifically featuring the cast of Fatal Fury Special and Karnov's Revenge titled as Garou Densetsu vs. Fighter's History Dynamite. Makoto Mizoguchi also appeared in Joe & Mac Returns as one of the enemies in the game, and as a hidden character in Kenka Bancho: Badass Rumble. In the 1998 movie The Replacement Killers, a Fighter's History arcade cabinet appears along with several other arcade cabinets. See also * Data East USA, Inc. v. Epyx, Inc.

It appears on The Wall album, released in 1979. Composition \\"Mother\\" is 5:32 in length. The majority of the song is in G major, though the chorus is predominantly a plagal cadence in C major. The song is notable for its varied use of time signatures, such as 5/8 and 9/8.Pink Floyd: The Wall (1980 Pink Floyd Music Publishers Ltd., London, England, [USA ]) Pink Floyd drummer Nick Mason found these time-signature changes difficult to learn, and, with the band recording on a very tight schedule, ceded the drumming duties to session drummer Jeff Porcaro.Vintage Pink Floyd Interview , Classic Rock magazine. The song begins quietly with solo voice and a single acoustic guitar, and gradually expands its instrumentation to include, by song's end, reed organ, piano, drums, electric bass, and electric guitar. The song has a short introduction, consisting only of a sharp inhalation and rapid exhalation before the first verses are sung by Roger Waters. The verse timing progression is: 5/8 - 8/8 √ó 4 - 5/8 - 8/8 √ó 8 - 6/8 - 8/8 √ó 2 - 5/8 - 8/8 √ó 4 - 5/8 - 8/8 √ó 8 - 6/8 - 8/8 √ó 3. The chorus, sung by David Gilmour, starts out on two measures of 4/4 before going into 6/8 (or \\"compound duple meter\\") for most of the chorus, in a narrative response to the first set of lyrics. There is also one measure of 9/8. Then a guitar solo follows over a chord progression in 4/4 time. Waters sings another verse, which is once more followed by Gilmour's chorus (with different lyrics). Finally, the song concludes with an arrangement stripped back down to one acoustic guitar and Waters's voice, and a ritardando in which Waters sings, \\"Mother, did it need to be so high?\\", a reference to the metaphorical wall constructed by the character Pink. The song ends on the subdominant, C major, which may create an \\"unfinished\\" or \\"dissatisfying\\" feeling. Waters explained to Mojo magazine that the song is about \\"the idea that we can be controlled by our parents' views on things like sex. The single mother of boys, particularly, can make sex harder than it needs to be.\\" Plot The Wall tells the story of Pink, an embittered and alienated rock star. As told through the song \\"Mother\\", part of Pink's sense of alienation comes from being raised by an overprotective single mother, who lost her husband, Pink's father, in World War II. The song narrates a conversation by Pink (voiced by Waters) and his mother (voiced by Gilmour). The listener learns of the overprotectiveness of Pink's mother, who is helping Pink build his wall to try to protect him from the outside world, evidenced by the line \\"Of course Momma's gonna help build the wall,\\" spoken by Pink's mother. She insists that Pink stay by her side even after he grows up, and cannot stand it when Pink eventually grows older and falls in love. Film version For the film, the song was re-recorded completely with the exception of David Gilmour's guitar solo. One line of the lyrics, \\"Is it just a waste of time\\", became \\"Mother, am I really dying\\", as the original LP lyrics read. This change ties in with a brief subplot in the film where Pink contracts a fever after caring for a sick rat that died from it.

Cover versions One of the most prominent covers of this song was done by Pearl Jam on the show - Late Night with Jimmy Fallon. This performance marked the end of The Pink Floyd Week celebrated on the show as a tribute to Pink Floyd. For the 1990 The Wall ‚Äì Live in Berlin concert, vocals by Sin√©ad O'Connor backed by Rick Danko & Levon Helm, accordion by Garth Hudson, acoustic instruments by The Hooters + Roger Waters and many others. In 2003, A Fair Forgery of Pink Floyd, a tribute album of Pink Floyd covers was released; it included a version of \\"Mother\\" by Quetzal called by AllMusic a \\"heart- ripping country rendition\\", and featuring a caj√≥n, an accordion, and a violin solo. Natalie Maines covered \\"Mother\\" for her 2013 album, also titled Mother. According to critic Ann Powers, Maines' \\"interpretation of Roger Waters's lyrics helps the original becomes something new ‚Äî something bigger\\". Amanda Palmer released her cover of the song, orchestrated by Jherek Bischoff, on November 15, 2017. The accompanying video was funded by her Patreon subscribers. She dedicated the song and music video to \\"the current administration\\". The single features a cello solo by Zo√´ Keating. The video was directed by Jordan Rathus. In the final episode of the FX cable TV series, Legion, \\"Mother\\" was sung by Dan Stevens (as David Haller) and Stephanie Corneliussen (as Gabrielle Xavier). Further reading * Fitch, Vernon.

Debugging is the process of finding and resolving errors in a system; in computing it also includes exploring the internal operation of software as a help to development. It can be used to debug user mode applications, device drivers, and the operating system itself in kernel mode. Like the better-known Visual Studio Debugger it has a graphical user interface (GUI), but is more powerful and has little else in common. WinDbg can be used for debugging kernel-mode memory dumps, created after what is commonly called the Blue Screen of Death which occurs when a bug check is issued. It can also be used to debug user-mode crash dumps. This is known as post-mortem debugging. WinDbg can automatically load debugging symbol files (e.g., PDB files) from a server by matching various criteria (e.g., timestamp, CRC, single or multiprocessor version) via SymSrv (SymSrv.dll), instead of the more time-consuming task of creating a symbol tree for a debugging target environment. If a private symbol server is configured, the symbols can be correlated with the source code for the binary. This eases the burden of debugging problems that have various versions of binaries installed on the debugging target by eliminating the need for finding and installing specific symbols version on the debug host. Microsoft has a public symbol server that has most of the public symbols for Windows 2000 and later versions of Windows (including service packs). Recent versions of WinDbg have been and are being distributed as part of the free Debugging Tools for Windows suite, which shares a common debugging back-end between WinDbg and command line debugger front-ends like KD, CDB, and NTSD. Most commands can be used as is with all the included debugger front-ends. It is worth noting that in 2017 Microsoft announced new version of WinDbg called WinDbg Preview (aka WinDbgX). One of the most notable features of WinDbg Preview is so called Time-Travel- Debugging (TTD). The main idea here is that you can record an actual live process (at a performance penalty) to later debug going back and forth in time. This feature is especially useful during reverse-engineering process. It also allows writing scripts in JavaScript language. Extensions WinDbg allows the loading of extension DLLs that can augment the debugger's supported commands and allow for help in debugging specific scenarios: for example, displaying an MSXML document given an IXMLDOMDocument, or debugging the Common Language Runtime (CLR). These extensions are a large part of what makes WinDbg such a powerful debugger. WinDbg is used by the Microsoft Windows product team to build Windows, and everything needed to debug Windows is included in these extension DLLs. Extension commands are always prefixed with !. While some extensions are used only inside Microsoft, most of them are part of the public Debugging Tools for Windows package. The extension model is documented in the help file included with the Debugging Tools for Windows. =Ext.dll= Ext is a standard Windows Debugger extension that ships with WinDBG and is loaded by default. !analyze command The most commonly used command is !analyze -v, which analyzes the current state of the program being debugged and the machine/process state at the moment of crash or hang. This command is often able to debug the current problem in a completely automated fashion. When used without any switches, !analyze simply returns the results of its analysis. The -v and -vv give further details about that analysis. =Wow6432exts.dll= Wow6432exts is a standard Windows Debugger extension that ships with WinDBG. It is used to debug processes running inside WoW64 (32-bit processes running in 64-bit Windows). =SOS.dll= The SOS (Son of Strike) Debugging Extension (SOS.dll) assists in debugging managed programs in Visual Studio and WinDbg by providing information about the internal common language runtime (CLR) environment. This tool requires a project to have unmanaged debugging enabled. SOS.dll is automatically installed with the .NET Framework. To use SOS.dll in Visual Studio, install the Windows Driver Kit (WDK). To debug a process or memory dump, the sos.dll version must match the .NET Framework version. Psscor2 and Psscor4 are a superset of SOS. =Psscor2.dll= Psscor2 is the Windows Debugger Extension used to debug .NET Framework applications that use the .NET CLR version 2.0 (.NET Framework versions 2 through 3.5). Psscor2 was developed for internal use at Microsoft as part of their Product Support Services tools. While Microsoft only released Psscor2 in 2010 Microsoft had been publishing commands from the extension several years before, causing difficulty for those who were trying to follow their processes. =Psscor4.dll= Psscor4 is a Windows Debugger extension used to debug .NET Framework 4 applications. Coupling with virtual machines WinDbg allows debugging a Microsoft Windows kernel running on a virtual machine by VMware, VPC or Parallels using a named pipe. This can be achieved by using a virtual COM port. In the case of VMware and VirtualBox, the VirtualKD extension adds native support for VM debugging to the Windows kernel, claiming to speed debugging by a factor of up to 45. For Windows 8 and later, kernel debugging over network is allowed, allowing fast kernel debugging without special configuration. Protocol The WinDbg protocol is not documented, but is supported by the IDA Pro and radare2 disassemblers.

Administratively, the islands are part of Tambon Ko Phra Thong, Khura Buri District, in Phang Nga Province, Thailand. Mu Ko Surin National Park (‡∏≠‡∏∏‡∏ó‡∏¢‡∏≤‡∏ô‡πÅ‡∏´‡πà‡∏á‡∏ä‡∏≤‡∏ï‡∏¥‡∏´‡∏°‡∏π‡πà‡πÄ‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏∞‡∏™‡∏∏‡∏£‡∏¥‡∏ô‡∏ó‡∏£‡πå) encompasses the islands and their surrounding waters. The park covers an area of approximately 141.25 km2. It contains the Surin Islands and the surrounding waters. Of the protected area, 108 km2 or 80 percent is ocean. The park was gazetted as the 29th national park of Thailand on 9 July 1981. The park is closed during rainy season, 1 May-31 October, every year. Geography The five islands are Ko Surin Nuea, Ko Surin Tai, Ko Ri, Ko Kai, and Ko Klang, with Ko Surin Nuea and Ko Surin Tai being the two main islands of the group. The Thai-Burmese oceanic border is a few kilometers north of the park. Christie Island, Burma's southernmost point, lies 18 km to the north of Ko Surin Nuea and about 100 km to the south is Mu Ko Similan National Park. Richelieu Rock, a rock in the middle of the sea, about 10 km southwest of the Ko Surin, is commonly referred to one as one of the ten best dive spots in the world. Named after Andreas du Plessis de Richelieu, the first (and only foreign) commander-in-chief of the Thai Navy, the remote rock is home to some of the largest marine life species in Thailand. Other popular dive sites include Hin Kong, Ko Torinla, and Ko Chi. Climate A hot season runs from mid-February to May. The rainy season is from mid-May to October, the rainiest month. The yearly average rainfall is more than 3,000 millimetres with average humidity is 83 percent. The park is closed during rainy season, 1 May-31 October, every year. The best time for diving is from December to April with dry conditions, minimum wind and an average water temperature at around 29 ¬∞C. February to April is the more ideal time to spot large pelagic species like manta rays. Due to marine conservation initiatives diving is not allowed in certain areas of the national park. Moken people Moken boat, Surin Islands The Surin Islands host two small communities of the small ethnic Moken minority, known as \\"chao lay\\" or \\"sea gypsies\\". The Moken population of the Surin Island averages around 150 persons. The Moken are three distinct tribes living on the Andaman Coast of Burma and Thailand: the Moken of the Mergui archipelago, the Moklen of Phang Nga Province, and the Urak Lawoi living from Phuket south to Satun. With Austronesian roots, their language, culture, and lifestyle are unique, and they have a history of peaceful coexistence with mainland neighbors. The Moken, proper, have a long history of living in the Mergui archipelago between Burma and the islands of Thailand's North Andaman coast. As sea nomads, the Moken used to spend most of their lives on traditional houseboats known as kabang, moving from bay to bay depending on the wind and weather. During the monsoon rains, families would come together and build temporary villages on protected beaches. The Moken do not have a written language and their history is passed down orally through folklore from generation to generation. Family connections are strong and dependable. Furthermore, the Moken language has no native words for individual possession which is reflected in a culture of sharing and giving. The Moken are animists and have great understanding and respect for their environment and natural resources. In past times, the Moken people were subsistence hunter-gathers, trading shells, sea cucumbers, and fish for rice and other necessities. They use over 80 plant species for food, 28 for medicinal purposes, and 105 for shelter, handicrafts and other purposes. Flora Primary rain forest covers most area of the park. Beach forest can be found in beach areas where Barringtonia and Cerbera odollam abound. Mangrove forest can be found in the mud and brackish water of Mae Yai Bay. Fauna Dolphins off the islands Surveys have found: * Ninety-one types of birds including 57 local species. Others are migrating species. * Twenty-two mammal species including 12 types of bats. * Marine mammals such as Bryde's whales live around.‡∏ó‡∏∞‡πÄ‡∏•‡πÑ‡∏ó‡∏¢‡∏™‡∏°‡∏ö‡∏π‡∏£‡∏ì‡πå ‡∏û‡∏ö‡∏ß‡∏≤‡∏¨‡∏ö‡∏£‡∏π‡∏î‡πâ‡∏≤! ‡πÄ‡∏¢‡∏∑‡∏≠‡∏ô‡∏´‡∏°‡∏π‡πà‡πÄ‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏∞‡∏™‡∏∏‡∏£‡∏¥‡∏ô‡∏ó‡∏£‡πå ‡∏≠‡πà‡∏≤‡∏ô‡∏Ç‡πà‡∏≤‡∏ß‡∏ï‡πà‡∏≠‡πÑ‡∏î‡πâ‡∏ó‡∏µ‡πà * Six species of reptiles such as Indian or Bengal monitors, water monitors, skinks, and reticulated pythons. * Sea turtles still nest on the Surin islands, with two species coming ashore to lay their eggs, critically endangered hawksbill and green turtles.

It is a three-part instrumental. Recording and sounds The track features Pink Floyd playing in the background as Pink Floyd roadie Alan Styles (1936 - 2011) speaks about the breakfast he is preparing and eating, as well as breakfasts he has had in the past (\\"Breakfast in Los Angeles. Macrobiotic stuff...\\"). There are significant breaks before the first and in between all three instrumental parts where only Alan's muttering and movements, with occasional exterior background noise, are heard. Much of Alan's speech is overdubbed throughout the piece in gradually fading echoes e.g. \\"Macrobiotic stuff\\" is repeated every couple of seconds, more quietly each time. It was performed live three times in the United Kingdom during the winter of 1970. In addition to the talking, the sounds of Alan making breakfast‚Äîsuch as lighting the stove, cooking bacon, pouring milk and cereal (which makes a popping sound associated with Kellogg's Rice Krispies), loudly gulping and drinking, and loudly and vigorously eating cereal‚Äîare clearly audible in the background, which adds a conceptual feel to the track. Alan can be heard entering the kitchen and gathering supplies at the start of the track, and washing up and exiting the kitchen at the end; a dripping tap can be heard during both of these instances. On some copies of the vinyl version, the dripping tap at the end of the song is cut into the run-off groove, so it plays on infinitely until the listener removes the stylus from the album. On the CD release, the dripping continues for approximately 17 seconds after all other sounds have ceased. Sections =Rise and Shine= This piece consists of two pianos, bass, Hammond organ, a steel guitar fed through a Leslie speaker and hi-hats. During the opening of this section, Alan can be heard muttering to himself, deciding what to have as he begins to prepare his breakfast. He can be heard saying the following: \\"Oh... Er... Me flakes... Scrambled eggs, bacon, sausages, tomatoes, toast, coffee... Marmalade, I like marmalade... Yes, porridge is nice, any cereal... I like all cereals... Oh, God. Kickoff is 10am.\\" At the end of this section, the sound of a whistling kettle can be heard as the music stops. =Sunny Side Up= This piece takes the form of a modified fugue, and was written and performed entirely by David Gilmour on two acoustic guitars and a steel guitar. =Morning Glory= This piece was performed by the entire band. The main instrument is Richard Wright's piano, which was overdubbed three different times (one in the left channel, one in the centre, and one in the right channel). The piece also features very prominent bass, electric guitar, ADTed drums, and Hammond organ. At the end, after saying \\"My head's a blank\\", Alan picks up his car keys and leaves via the door. Faintly, a car can be heard starting and driving away. Reception In a review for the Atom Heart Mother album, Alec Dubro of Rolling Stone described \\"Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast\\" as \\"the only redeeming feature on [side 2 of Atom Heart Mother], but only partially so.\\" Dubro found \\"the integrated Arising and Breakfast sounds\\" as the redeeming factor, not the music in the track itself. In a less-than-enthusiastic review, Stephen Deusner of Paste described \\"Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast\\" as \\"a cut-and-paste assemblage of sounds that never coalesces into much of anything.\\" Because Deusner enjoyed \\"If\\" and \\"Fat Old Sun\\", he was disappointed Pink Floyd ended Atom Heart Mother with this track. In another review for the Atom Heart Mother album, Irving Tan of Sputnik Music described the track as an 'incredibly effective form of \\"wallpaper music'\\". However, Tan also described the track as not so much a \\"song\\", but rather an ambient psychedelic sketch.

After one engine failed in mid-flight, a series of critical mistakes by the flight crew caused the pilot to lose control of the plane during the final approach to a routine stopover at Love Field in Dallas, Texas. The airliner slid off the runway and struck a parked airplane, a hangar, and a flight school before crashing into a business across from the airport. 26 passengers and two flight attendants died. The pilot, co-pilot, flight engineer, and 15 passengers survived. Flight history The American Airlines DC-6, carrying a registration number of N90728 and the title \\"Flagship of South Carolina\\", had taken off from LaGuardia Airport in New York City bound for Mexico City with intermediate stopovers at Washington National Airport and Dallas Love Field.. Retrieved on December 23, 2006. After the stop in Washington D.C., the flight was carrying 41 passengers and 5 crew members: Captain Laurens \\"Tommy\\" Claude, First Officer Robert Lewis and Flight Engineer William S. Forbes. The flight was uneventful until the No. 1 engine, the outboard engine on the left wing, began backfiring and running roughly as the airplane neared Nashville, Tennessee. After reducing power and attempting corrective measures, the flight crew shut down the engine and feathered the propeller near Altheimer, Arkansas. Engine failures were considered fairly routine events on piston- engined airliners in the 1940s, so the crew elected to continue the flight to Dallas, and Captain Claude announced to the passengers that they would switch to another airplane upon arrival. Crash At 5:25 AM, as they approached Dallas airspace, the crew of Flight 157 alerted air traffic control that they were flying on three engines. The flight was given permission to enter the traffic pattern at Love Field at 5:36 AM. Weather in Dallas was clear, with visibility of , and no other air traffic was reported in the area. Captain Claude ordered the crew to lower the flaps and landing gear. At 5:45 AM, the pilot made a right-hand turn to land on Runway 36, but the airplane came out of the turn slightly to the left of the runway. An \\"S\\"-turn was initiated to align the DC-6 with the runway centerline. The plane suddenly shook and its airspeed dropped precipitously. The left wing dropped and the plane began to turn to the left. Flight Engineer Forbes noted that the fuel flow meter was not indicating any flow to the No. 4 engine. Captain Claude quickly applied full throttle and ordered Forbes to apply the booster pump, which increases the fuel flow to the engines in emergencies. The captain applied full right aileron in an attempt to raise the dropping left wing, and ordered First Officer Lewis to raise the flaps and landing gear, intending to circle the airport and attempt another landing (known as a go-around). Lewis raised the landing gear but did not raise the flaps, stating later that he ‚Äúwas afraid‚Äù to raise them because he assumed that the airplane would immediately stall if he complied. Lewis noticed that the No. 4 engine's fuel pressure was zero and its RPM was dropping, and he feathered the prop, hoping that the resulting reduction in drag would help the airplane accelerate and climb. However, with the flaps down and only two of the four engines working, the DC-6 did not accelerate; it continued to drop, headed on a path crossing Runway 36 approximately 40 degrees to the left. The captain raised the airplane's nose in a futile attempt to climb, but the airliner stalled instead, striking the runway tail-first. The airplane slid off the left side of the runway, bouncing into the air as it struck a parked airplane (identified in newspaper reports only as \\"an old Army Air Force trainer\\") and set it ablaze. The airliner's left wing cut through the wall of a hangar, causing the roof to partially collapse, and then exploded into flames as its right wing tore through the Dallas Aviation School. The craft then struck the ground, broke into several pieces, and turned sideways as it slid across Love Field Drive, finally coming to rest after plowing into a building owned by the American Magnaflux Corporation. Aftermath The 15 surviving passengers escaped in the initial seconds after the crash, scrambling through a gaping hole in the forward fuselage and through the emergency exit doors over the wings. The cockpit section of the aircraft had separated from the fuselage, helping the flight crew to escape the fire. Most survivors escaped with only minor injuries. Only one passenger would die of his injuries after managing to escape from the burning aircraft. The remaining 25 passengers and two flight attendants were trapped in the wreck as the flames quickly grew too intense to allow any rescue attempts. Firefighters fought the massive blaze for at least 30 minutes before the wreckage could be approached, by which time many of the victims were charred beyond recognition. The Dallas Aviation School and American Magnaflux buildings were almost destroyed and the hangar was extensively damaged. The parked airplane that was struck by the DC-6 burned so extensively that little remained of it afterwards. Investigation The Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) held a hearing in Dallas in December 1949 to investigate the causes of the accident. During the hearings, it was revealed that neither Claude nor Forbes knew that Lewis had feathered the No. 4 propeller; Claude did not find out until hearing Lewis‚Äô statement being read to the CAB. After investigating the remains of the aircraft, conducting flight tests to replicate the accident scenario, and completing the hearing, the CAB concluded in August 1950 that the probable cause of the accident was \\"the faulty execution of an engine-out approach.\\" A series of significant mishaps by the crew contributed to the final outcome: * The captain failed to align the aircraft with the runway centerline after the final turn. * After realizing the misalignment, the captain attempted to correct it with a risky \\"S\\"-turn at low altitude. There is little room for error if a problem arises during this maneuver because as the angle of the bank increases, so does the probability of stalling the airplane. * The crew made no attempt to balance the airplane's fuel load after the No. 1 engine failed. The DC-6 is equipped with four main fuel tanks that serve individual engines, while a network of valves allow fuel to be transferred from one engine's tank to feed other engines. The crew did not cross feed fuel from the tank serving the failed engine to balance the plane's weight as recommended in the flight operations manual. Flight 157 had flown for almost three hours with the No. 1 engine out, and the CAB concluded that the No. 1 main fuel tank was holding about 1,400 lbs (635 kg) more gasoline than the other three main tanks when the plane arrived at Love Field. The investigators primarily attributed the left wing's sharp drop to the excessive weight of the fuel at its outboard end. * The captain applied excessive rudder during the ‚ÄúS‚Äù-turn, causing a condition known in aviation terminology as a skid. This maneuver would have caused the plane's airspeed to drop, and according to the CAB findings, it caused the fuel in the No. 4 main tank to slosh away from the fuel outlet, lowering the engine's fuel pressure. * The captain's application of full throttle to both right-hand engines caused to airplane to turn further to the left due to the relative lack of thrust from the single functioning left-hand engine. This exacerbated his loss of directional control. * The first officer disobeyed the captain's order to raise the wing flaps, and did not tell the captain. * The first officer misinterpreted the No. 4 engine's fuel pressure drop as a sign of incipient engine failure and feathered the prop. However, the CAB partially exonerated Lewis for this act, concluding that the craft was so close to the ground at that point that his mistake probably had little influence on the final outcome. * Excessive elevator input by the captain caused the aircraft to stall. The CAB concluded that the accident could have been avoided if the crew had held the plane straight and level when the misalignment was first noticed, then raised the flaps, climbed to a safe altitude, circled the airport, and attempted another landing. The CAB concluded that there were no factors present that would compel the crew to land immediately despite the sloppy approach, such as rapidly deteriorating weather or a shortage of fuel.

Early life  Joe Serna Jr. was born in Stockton, the son of migrant farm workers. He was raised in labor camps near Lodi and worked with his family in the fields at a young age. He graduated from what was then known as Sacramento State College in 1966.  Activism  He would grow up to become a supporter of the United Farm Workers and worked with C√©sar Ch√°vez. Serna organized clothing and food drives for striking farm workers in the 1960s and was one of the UFW's main Sacramento leaders for close to 30 years. Serna was also a sometime member of the Royal Chicano Air Force  Public career  Serna became the first Latino mayor of Sacramento. Before becoming mayor, Serna had served 11 years on the Sacramento City Council. He also served in the Peace Corps and was a professor in the Government Department at California State University Sacramento. As mayor, Serna attempted to revitalize Sacramento's downtown area, but joined previous Mayors in failing to succeed. He pushed through initiatives to honor C√©sar Ch√°vez when the legendary civil rights leader died in 1993. Serna organized a caravan from Sacramento to march in Ch√°vez's funeral and renamed a park in front of City Hall to Cesar E. Chavez Plaza. Furthermore, Sacramento became the first city in the United States to honor C√©sar Ch√°vez with a holiday.  Legacy  Joe Serna, Jr. and Isabel Hernandez-Serna Center at the Sacramento City Unified School District. Serna died of kidney cancer on 7 November 1999 while in office in Sacramento, California; Jimmie R. Yee presided over the remainder of his term. Serna is buried at East Lawn Cemetery, and his funeral was attended by many of his fellow UFW activists. Serna was honored in 2001 with a brand-new, 25-story skyscraper named after him. The Joe Serna, Jr. EPA Building (near City Hall in downtown Sacramento) has been named the most energy-efficient high rise in the United States by Energy Star. Many California universities and organizations have also established scholarships and grants in Joe Serna's name. Joe Serna, Jr. Charter School, the only Spanish/English dual-immersion school in Lodi, carries out Serna's legacy of giving all people the opportunity to have their voices heard. Sacramento City Unified School District honored Serna by naming their new headquarters, residing on 47th Avenue, after him. Serna is also, to date, the most recent mayor of Sacramento to eulogize a former California governor, delivering the final remarks at the funeral mass of Pat Brown in 1996 at the Blessed Sacrament Cathedral, which was presided over by then-governor Pete Wilson, whose term also ended in 1999, and celebrated by then-Bishop William Weigand. Serna's eulogy was in Spanish and English.

It appeared on their 1979 double album, The Wall. Plot In a brief prologue, a skylark is heard chirping. The sound of approaching bombers catches the attention of a child (voiced by a young Harry Waters), who states, \\"Look mummy, there's an aeroplane up in the sky\\". The lyrics go on to describe the memory of the Blitz: Did you see the frightened ones? Did you hear the falling bombs? Did you ever wonder why we had to run for shelter when the promise of a brave new world unfurled beneath a clear blue sky? ... The flames are all long gone, but the pain lingers on. Film version In the film version, this segment is animated by Gerald Scarfe. It begins in live-action with a cat trying to catch the white dove but then flies away. It transitions to animation with the dove flying peacefully up only to suddenly be gorily torn apart by a black Nazi eagle ('). This swoops over the countryside, then grabs at the earth with its claws, ripping up a huge section and flying off leaving a trail of blood. It glides over England and it gives birth to a monster in the wake of its shadow, which then transforms into a machine that is an undefeated warlord releasing airplanes. Next, naked, gas-masked people (the frightened ones) are seen running about on all fours and hiding from The Blitz. Finally, a Union Jack that fragments, turning into a bleeding cross, the Nazi eagle crashed and the dove flies right out of it. The blood runs into the gutter and a drain. Unlike the album, this comes in after \\"When the Tigers Broke Free\\" and before \\"The Happiest Days of Our Lives\\". Live versions For the 1990 large-scale concert The Wall ‚Äì Live in Berlin, vocals for this song were provided by Joni Mitchell, with visuals largely reprised from the film version. Roger Waters' 2010‚Äì13 tour The Wall Live uses the song to depict a metaphorical \\"cultural bombing\\". As bomber planes fly in from the distance, they drop not bombs, but dollar signs, euro signs, religious symbols, and corporate logos. This imagery ended up attracting controversy due to the juxtaposition of dollar signs and the Star of David, which was deemed antisemitic by the Anti-Defamation League; Waters later removed the offending iconography and wrote an open letter to The Independent clarifying that the Star was meant to critique the Israeli government.

It is a particular representation of the simple overhand knot, the most basic knot of all. Origins A Staffordshire Fire and Rescue Service firefighter in ceremonial dress, with Stafford knots on his helmet, collars, buttons and sash The knot can be seen on a carved Anglo-Saxon cross in a churchyard in Stoke-upon-Trent, giving its name as the Staffordshire Knot and also on a seventh-century Anglo- Saxon object from the Staffordshire hoard. This strongly suggests it pre-dates the Norman and medieval period, being probably either a heraldic symbol of early Mercia or a Celtic Christian symbol brought to Staffordshire by missionary monks from Lindisfarne. The earliest known appearance of the knot in association with the Stafford family was on the 15th-century seal of Lady Joan de Stafford, Lady Wake (daughter of Hugh de Stafford, 2nd Earl of Stafford), who adapted the Wake knot for her use. The seal, on which four knots appear tied on a string around her coat of arms, is now in the British Museum. After Lady Wake died childless in 1443, her nephew Humphrey de Stafford, 6th Earl of Stafford inherited her personal property. Humphrey, who was made the Duke of Buckingham the following year, incorporated his aunt's adaptation of the Wake knot as a cordon around his seal, although he used three knots and not four. The knot appears on a drawing of the standard of Sir Henry de Stafford, which was flown circa 1475. In a visitation of Stafford in 1583, the town's arms were recorded for the first time as or a chevron gules, a Stafford knot argent. These arms, which represent the traditional Stafford arms with the addition of the knot, is still the flag of Staffordshire (albeit with the knot changed from white to gold). Future earls of Stafford retained the knot for use on heraldic badges, although the exact date of use is unknown. Early heraldic badges are poorly recorded, however, and many had multiple badges. In 1720, the Earl of Stafford used 18 badges, including the Stafford knot, all enclosed in a circle of Stafford knots. One legend of its origin, generally considered mythical, is that three convicted criminals who had committed a crime together were due to be executed in Stafford gaol. There was argument over who should be hanged first but the hangman solved the problem by devising this knot and hanging the three simultaneously. The design closely matches the early design of the pretzel, which was made to represent arms crossed in prayer. In the 19th century, it became a symbol of Staffordshire pottery. This \\"Staffordshire knot\\" was also used as a surgical suture in the 19th century. It was discarded by some as too dangerous, as the knot could slip if not tied correctly, and indeed, its use led to multiple deaths by hemorrhage. Usage The knot appears prominently on the flag of the historic county of Staffordshire, as well as on the banner of Staffordshire County Council. The motto of the county council ‚Äî \\"the knot unites\\" ‚Äî refers to the Stafford knot. It also appears on the coat of arms of the Borough of Stafford. The Stafford knot was the badge of the 38th (1st Staffordshire) Regiment of Foot in which Sir Thomas Brisbane entered the British Army as an Ensign in 1789 ‚Äì and thus the eponymous city of Brisbane in Queensland, Australia, has the Stafford knot on its arms. The knot formed part of the insignia of the North Staffordshire Regiment, South Staffordshire Regiment, Staffordshire Regiment and currently is the arm badge of the Mercian Regiment. It is also used as the badge of the Staffordshire Police force and Staffordshire fire and rescue service. Staffordshire wing of the Air Training Corps also uses the knot on its crest. The knot appears on the logos of both Staffordshire University and Keele University, as well as on many school badges. Stoke-on-Trent based football team Port Vale use the knot on their club badge, as do fellow Staffordshire clubs Tamworth and Stafford Rangers. West Bromwich Albion and Stoke City have also used the knot on their respective badges. Derived references The North Staffordshire Railway, an independent railway company in the county from 1845 until the compulsory grouping of the railways in 1923, was colloquially referred to as The Knotty after the knot. The knot symbol appeared in the railway company's badge. The Smiler, a roller coaster at Alton Towers, has a combined section of track known as the \\"Stafford/Staffordshire Knot\\", consisting of a cobra roll entwined with a batwing. It is given this nickname due to the resemblance to the original knot shape. In an article published in the Birmingham Evening Mail on 1 June 1965, journalist Roy Smith described plans for the Gravelly Hill Interchange as \\"like a cross between a plate of spaghetti and an unsuccessful attempt at a Staffordshire knot\\", with the headline above the article on the newspaper's front page, written by sub-editor Alan Eaglesfield, reading \\"Spaghetti Junction\\".

It appeared on The Wall album in 1979. Composition \\"Young Lust\\" is a blues-inflected hard rock number in E minor, approximately three minutes, 25 seconds in length. Lead vocals are sung by David Gilmour, with background vocals from Roger Waters during the chorus. The lyrics are about a \\"rock-and-roll refugee\\" seeking casual sex to relieve the tedium of touring. It's one of few Pink Floyd songs in which Gilmour plays bass guitar in the original studio version and one of three songs Gilmour co- wrote for The Wall. On the album, the preceding song, \\"Empty Spaces,\\" ends with an abrupt transition into \\"Young Lust.\\" An extended 7\\" single version was released in Italy, South Africa and Rhodesia. It was 3:58 in length and included a 12-bar instrumental intro with a simple 16-beat drum rhythm that leads into an 8-bar guitar intro. The final 32-bar outro is unobscured by the phone call that is on the album version. Plot The Wall tells the story of Pink, an embittered and alienated rock star. At this point in the album's narrative, Pink has achieved wealth and fame, and is usually away from home, due to the demands of his career as a touring performer. He is having casual sex with groupies to relieve the tedium of the road, and is living a separate life from his wife. The end of the song is a segment of dialogue between Pink and a telephone operator, as Pink twice attempts to place a transatlantic collect call to his wife. A man answers, and when the operator asks if he will accept the charges, the man simply hangs up. This is how Pink learns that his wife is cheating on him. (\\"See, he keeps hanging up,\\" says the operator. \\"And it's a man answering!\\") With this betrayal, his mental breakdown accelerates. The dialogue with the operator was the result of an arrangement co-producer James Guthrie made with a neighbour in London, Chris Fitzmorris, while the album was being recorded in Los Angeles. He wanted realism, for the operator to actually believe they had caught his wife having an affair, and so didn't inform her she was being recorded. The operator heard in the recording is the second operator they tried the routine with, after the first operator's reaction was deemed unsatisfactory.Pink Floyd: Through The Eyes Of . . . The Band, Its Fans, Friends, and Foes, edited by Bruno MacDonald. London: Sidgwick & Jackson, 1996. Film version In the film, the scene with the attempted phone call, in which Pink learns his wife is cheating on him, occurs at the very beginning of the song \\"What Shall We Do Now\\", which is the extended version of \\"Empty Spaces\\", before the \\"Young Lust\\" song rather than at the end of the \\"Young Lust\\" song. The implications of the song are therefore slightly different. On the album, he is already unfaithful to his wife while on tour, making him a hypocrite when he is appalled at her own unfaithfulness. In the film, he is only seen with a groupie after he learns of his wife's affair, which shows the character in a more sympathetic light. In the film, several groupies (including a young Joanne Whalley, in her film debut) seduce security guards and roadies to get backstage passes, where one of them (Jenny Wright) ends up going with Pink (Bob Geldof) to his room.

The documentary follows the life of Dominique, who ran Haiti's first independent radio station, Radio Haiti-Inter, during multiple repressive regimes. The documentary starts with an interview where Jean Dominique recounts a day when he was able to broadcast gunfire outside Radio Haiti- Inter.  Summary  The titular Agronomist is Jean Leopold Dominique, owner of Radio Haiti-Inter, Haiti's first independent radio station. Jonathan Demme assembles this documentary with historical footage and personal interviews he conducted years earlier with Jean Dominique. The result is the portrait of a seriously ethical individual who refuses to submit to power (and corruption) even unto death. The result is a highly emotional documentary of a unique individual who refused to submit to injustice. Radio Haiti was founded in 1960, but in 1969 it became Radio Haiti-Inter. Jean Dominique's broadcasts focused on injustice from the perspective of pro-democracy for the masses. He was able to approach and present problems from the perspective of the poor Haitians, but especially the rural agriculturalists with whom he identified closely. The most remarkable fact of Jean Dominique's radio career is that it lasted as long as it did in the face of powerful opposition from elites. While the powerful attempted to silence all critics (Jean Dominique survived torture and attempted assassinations, as did some of his staff), the radio host had captured the support, often covert but sometime daringly overt, of the Haitian people within broadcast range. As a result of outright courage and solidarity among the righteous (those compelled to act justly), Radio Haiti-Inter wasn't silenced for decades. Even after the assassination of Jean Dominique, his wife and fellow journalist, Mich√®le Montas, courageously broadcast from the station for another three years. Radio Haiti-Inter ceased operations in 2003. Although The Agronomist himself would call this documentary the story of a \\"human being,\\" by the film's end, most viewers will have been forced by the sheer rhetorical power of its subject, and the director, to elevate Jean Dominique to the status of hero. Reception The Agronomist was shown on May 3, 2004 at the UN Headquarters in NYC while observing World Press Freedom Day. There were no seats vacant for the showing at noon.The Life and Work of Jean Dominique UN Chronicle. The film received favorable reviews by critics.

Also spelled oy vay, oy veh, or oi vey, and often abbreviated to oy, the expression may be translated as, \\"oh, woe!\\" or \\"woe is me!\\" Its Hebrew equivalent is oy vavoy (◊ê◊ï◊ô ◊ï◊ê◊ë◊ï◊ô, √≥j vav√≥j).See Proverbs 23:29, where King Solomon asks, \\"To whom is oy and to whom is avoy?\\" Derivation According to etymologist Douglas Harper, the phrase is derived from Yiddish and is of Germanic origin. It is cognate with the German expression o weh, or auweh, combining the German and Dutch exclamation au! meaning \\"ouch/oh\\" and the German word weh, a cognate of the English word woe (as well as the Dutch wee meaning pain). The expression is also related to oh ve, an older expression in Danish and Swedish, and oy wah, an expression used with a similar meaning in the Montb√©liard region in France. The Latin equivalent is heu, vae!; a more standard expression would be o, me miserum, or heu, me miserum. According to Chabad.org, an alternative theory for the origin of the Yiddish expression is that \\"oy\\" stems from Biblical Hebrew, and that \\"vey\\" is its Aramaic equivalent. Significance The expression is often abbreviated to simply oy, or elongated to oy vey ist mir (\\"Oh, woe is me\\").Rozakis, Laurie.

The fuller lament may also be spelled as Oy vey iz mir.Stevens, Payson et al. Meshuggenary: Celebrating the World of Yiddish, p. 34 (Simon and Schuster 2002). The main purpose or effect of elongating it is often dramatic, something like a \\"cosmic ouch\\".Jacobs, Meredith. The Modern Jewish Mom's Guide to Shabbat, p. 229 (HarperCollins 2007). Oy is not merely an ordinary word, but rather expresses an entire world view, according to visual anthropologist Penny Wolin.Wolin, Penny.

Design A Metro II converted for cargo with a large freight door on the left side at the rear. The Metroliner was an evolution of the Swearingen Merlin turboprop-powered business aircraft. Ed Swearingen, a Texas fixed-base operator (FBO), started the developments that led to the Metro through gradual modifications to the Beechcraft Twin Bonanza and Queen Air business aircraft, which he dubbed Excalibur. A new fuselage (but with a similar nose) and vertical fin were then developed, married to salvaged and rebuilt (wet) Queen Air wings and horizontal tails, and Twin Bonanza landing gear; this became the SA26 Merlin, more or less a pressurized Excalibur. Through successive models (the SA26-T Merlin IIA and SA26-AT Merlin IIB) the engines were changed to Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6, then Garrett TPE331 turboprops. These were marketed as business aircraft seating eight to ten passengers. An all-new aircraft was built and named the SA226-T Merlin III with a new nose, wings, landing gear, cruciform horizontal tail This and subsequent Merlin and Metro models have a trimmable horizontal stabilizer (THS) usually used on jet aircraft, one of only a small number of turboprop aircraft to have this design feature (the competing Beechcraft Model 99 being another). and inverted inlet Garrett engines. Ultimately a stretch of the Merlin III was designed, sized to seat 22 passengers and called the SA226-TC Metro. Because FAA regulations limited an airliner to no more than 19 seats if no flight attendant was to be carried, the aircraft was optimized for that number of passengers. The standard engines offered were two TPE331-3UW turboprops driving three-bladed propellers. A corporate version called the SA226-AT Merlin IVA was also marketed and initially sales of this version were roughly double that of the Metro.\\"Metro production dates.\\" fortunecity.com. Retrieved: August 21, 2011.  Development  The Garrett TPE331 installation Prototype construction of the Metro began in 1968 and the first flight was on August 26, 1969. Swearingen Aircraft encountered financial difficulties at this stage, and late in 1971 Fairchild (which was marketing the Metro and building its wings and engine nacelles), bought 90% of Swearingen and the company was renamed Swearingen Aviation Corporation. It was at this point that the previously cash-strapped company was able to put the Metro into production.\\"Fairchild to Acquire Swearingen\\", \\"World News\\" (online archive version).

In 1974, the original Metro models were replaced by the SA226-TC Metro II after about 20 Metros and about 30 Merlin IVAs had been built.The article \\"Final Metro Delivery\\" in Airways magazine Issue 64 states that Metro deliveries totalled 18. The Metro production list shows that by the end of 1974, 22 Merlins had been built. Among the changes made were larger, squared- oval windows and optional provision for a small Rocket-Assisted Take Off (RATO) rocket in the tail cone, this being offered to improve takeoff performance out of \\"hot & high\\" airfields in the event of an engine failure. The Metro and Metro II were limited to a maximum weight of 12,500 pounds (5,670 kg) in the US and countries using imperial units, and 5,700 kg in countries using SI units. When this restriction was lifted the Metro II was re-certified as the Metro IIA in 1980 with a maximum weight of 13,100 pounds (5,941 kg) and the Metro II's TPE331-3 engines replaced by -10 engines of increased power. The SA227-AC Metro III followed, also initially certified in 1980 for up to 14,000 pounds (6,350 kg), this increasing to 14,500 pounds (6,577 kg) as engines and structures were upgraded. An option to go as high as 16,000 pounds (7,257 kg) was offered. Externally, improvements incorporated into the Metro III were a 10 ft (3.05 m) increase in wing span, four-bladed props, redesigned \\"quick-access\\" engine cowlings and numerous drag-reducing airframe modifications, including landing gear doors that closed after the gear was extended. A purpose-built SA227-AT Expediter freighter without cabin windows Once again a corporate version was offered as the Merlin IVC (the model name was chosen to align with the contemporaneous short-fuselage Merlin IIIC). A version with strengthened floors and the high gross weight option was offered as a cargo aircraft known as the Expediter. Both the Expediter and the Merlin IVC were designated the SA227-AT. Finally, due to reliability problems with Garrett engines in the second half of the 1980s, the Metro IIIA was offered with two Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-45R turboprops in place of the Garrett units; however none were actually delivered. A special model was the SA227-BC Metro III built for Mexican airline AeroLitoral, which took delivery of 15 of the 18 of this model that were produced. Improvements beyond the Metro III provided better systems, more power and a further increase in takeoff weight. This design effort resulted in the SA227 CC (for Commuter Category) and SA227-DC models, initially called the Metro IV\\"Metro IV & V\\", Commuter Aircraft Directory,(online archive version).

In service with Perimeter Aviation in Canada, this long-term operator of the Metro II and III made a number of modifications to suit its use in northern and remote Canadian sites where rudimentary gravel \\"strips\\" were common. Some of the many innovative changes to the design of the Metro allowed the aircraft to fly more efficiently as well as cutting down on the \\"noise factor\\" that was attributed to the early models. The airline installed Garrett engines with quieter and more efficient four-bladed Hartzell propellers. More recently in 2016, 5 blade composite propellers are being installed, further enhancing performance and reducing noise levels.

The goal of the game is to guide the main character, Porky Pig from the Warner Bros. cartoons, through his nightmares. The game received mixed to positive reviews by critics; its graphics and animations were received well while its length and easy difficulty were not. Gameplay Porky Pig's Haunted Holiday is a side- scrolling platform game where the main character, Porky Pig, can move left and right and jump. Also, the main character can swing in chains, climb, enter doorways and ride bubbles under the water. Some platforms, if stepped on by Porky, makes Daffy The Count Duck appear and scare Porky so he propels up into the air to reach high places. Enemies in a level can be defeated in two different ways; by jumping on them or by throwing fruit at them, but fruit can only be thrown by Porky when a fruit bowl power-up is collected. At the beginning of the game, Porky starts with five lives and the goal is to make it to the end of all levels. Porky loses a life if all of his hearts are lost, which happens if Porky is hit by an enemy. Checkpoints that look like a red X mark are scattered throughout the levels. Going past a checkpoint makes Porky stick a flag into the ground and that's where he'll start from if a life is lost later in the level. If all lives are lost, there is an unlimited continue to feature that restarts the player in the same level. Gameplay in the first level of Porky Pig's Haunted Holiday. The player is introduced to the story of the game with one in-game cutscene. The story goes as following: On the night before Porky Pig's vacation starts, he goes to bed. Asleep, he starts having nightmares where he meets different scary characters. In order to wake up, he must travel through all of the levels in the game. There are several different types of power-ups and items in the game. Collecting the fruit bowl mentioned earlier supplies Porky with unlimited fruit to throw at enemies until he loses a life. Heart items found scattered in the levels refills one of his hearts. Picking up 100 cupcake power-ups, which an on-screen counter keeps track of, rewards the player with an extra life. There is also a cake power-up to collect, which increases the in-game score. A potion power-up will, if collected by Porky, inflate him for a limited time. He then starts to float and can be moved up, down and as always left and right. There are six levels and at the end of each level is a boss. Between levels, a world map displays the player's progress. The first level, The Haunted Woods, takes Porky through a forest with goblins, ghosts, magical walking cauldrons, spiders, leprechauns and bats. Notable is also a tree with a rotating 3D-effect. In the end of the level a boss named Spooky Sid is fought. The second level is Dry Gulch Town, and it takes Porky through a western type of town, including tumbleweed and caged hooligans while foes with moose trophies with rifle barrels showing from their mouths, where Six Shootin' Sheriff Sam is the boss in the end of the level. The third level first takes place on a small raft and later on under the sea in the Ruins of Atlantis. Diving turkeys and barracudas are enemies found there, and Porky can ride on bubbles exhaled from a special kind of sea creature. And Willie Great White is the boss foe. In the fourth level, an abandoned mine, Hyde Tweety is the boss. The fifth level is in the Snowy Alps, which will eventually transcend into a delusional landscape where it literally rains cats and dogs as well as fish skeletons Monster Max is the boss of that level. In the sixth and final level, Porky goes through the castle of Daffy The Count Duck and clashes with Herman the robot boss in his chamber as the final boss. In the options screen, three different difficulty levels can be selected. A sound test feature and a controller configuration setting is also available. Development Porky Pig's Haunted Holiday was developed by Phoenix Interactive Entertainment. Darren Melbourne designed the core elements of the game while Kev Bruce composed the music and sound effects. The Merry- Go-Round Broke Down song, also known as the Looney Tunes theme, was added to the game. Notable graphical effects include parallax scrolling and a weather effect which means that every time the game is played the weather can be different. For example: sometimes it may be snowing and sometimes it may be raining. The game's publisher was originally Hudson Soft, who owned the license to publish games with Warner Bros. characters at the time, but it sold the rights to Porky Pig's Haunted Holiday on to Acclaim Entertainment in 1995. The game was ultimately published by Sunsoft. Some versions of the game were distributed by Acclaim and some by Sunsoft, both under license of Warner Bros. Reception Porky Pig's Haunted Holiday received mixed to positive reviews. The graphics and animations received praise as well as the weather system, about which a reviewer from Electronic Gaming Monthly commented: \\"It's a great idea; it should be used more often\\". Generally well received was also the music and sound effects, although some reviewers found the music loops to be too short. In addition, the controls in the game were considered by some critics to be easy to use. On the other hand, some critics thought the challenge of the game was too easy and the levels too short and/or too few. Also, some reviewers thought the game was unoriginal and just reused many gameplay elements popularized by other games in the same genre. Most of the critics recommended the game for younger children. See also *List of Looney Tunes video games Notes Credited as \\"Kev B\\".

The song was also released as a B-side on the single of \\"Another Brick in the Wall (Part 2)\\". Composition The song is split into distinct segments: a groupie (Trudy Young) performs a monologue (\\"Oh my God, what a fabulous room!\\") while a television plays, under which a synthesizer makes atonal noises, which eventually resolve into a quiet song in C major in 3/4 time (\\"Day after day / Love turns gray / Like the skin of a dying man.\\"). Finally, the song abruptly leaps into a hard rock song in B-flat major in 4/4 time. The song features some of Waters' most strenuous recorded vocal workouts, with him ending at a relatively high A above middle C.Pink Floyd: The Wall (1980 Pink Floyd Music Publishers Ltd., London, England, [USA ]) Plot The Wall is the story of Pink, an embittered and alienated rock star, whose sanity is failing as he isolates himself behind a psychological barrier. \\"One of My Turns\\" finds Pink inviting a groupie into his room after learning of his wife's affair. While the groupie tries to get his attention, he ignores her, and muses on his failed relationship with his wife. A TV can be heard in the background, the dialogue mixed in with the groupie's attempts at conversation. While the hapless groupie continues trying to get his attention, Pink feels \\"Cold as a razor blade / Tight as a tourniquet / Dry as a funeral drum,\\" before exploding into a fit of violence, destroying his room, and frightening the young woman away. When his hotel room is finally in complete shambles, and the groupie is gone, Pink feels something more: Self-pity, and a lack of empathy for others, as he screams \\"Why are you running away?\\" The show that is on the television during the beginning of the song is from September 24‚Äì26, 1979, Another World episodes 3864‚Äì3866. Kirk Laverty brings Iris Bancroft and her maid, Vivan Gorrow, to his lodge in the Adirondacks. Dobbs was the caretaker of the lodge. Laverty is the man talking to Dobbs, not Mr. Bancroft. Laverty was played by Charles Cioffi. Film version Pink enters his hotel room with an American groupie, played by actress Jenny Wright. The groupie tries to be friendly to Pink (Wright performs nearly the same monologue as Trudy Young did on the album). Pink is oblivious to the groupie as he watches the film The Dam Busters on television. When the groupie tries to make contact with Pink saying \\"Are you feeling okay?\\", he explodes into a violent fit of rage and begins to destroy his hotel room. Pink then chases the groupie around the room throwing various objects at her, cutting his own hand after he throws a television set out his window onto the street below, shouting \\"Next time, fuckers!\\", his only non-lyrical line spoken in the film. The scene where Pink hurts his hand while destroying the Venetian blinds was not faked. Bob Geldof did indeed cut his hand and he can be seen looking at it for a brief second, but director Alan Parker decided not to stop filming until the scene was over, despite Geldof's injury. In the next scene, the viewer can see a towel or shirt wrapped around Geldof's injured hand. Also, according to Parker's DVD commentary, Wright was informed that Geldof (as Pink) would yell at her and chase her during the scene; however the director, in order to get an authentic reaction from the actress, did not tell her that Geldof would also throw a wine bottle at her (albeit an easily breakable, prop-made bottle) at the start of his enraged outburst.

Biography Born in Usseglio, in what is now the province of Turin, Cibrario was descended from a noble but impoverished Piedmontese family. He won a scholarship at the age of sixteen, and was teaching literature at eighteen. His verses to future king Charles Albert, then prince of Savoy-Carignano, on the birth of his son Victor Emmanuel, attracted the prince's attention and proved the beginning of a long intimacy. He entered the Sardinian civil service, and in 1824 was appointed lecturer on canon and civil law. His chief interest was the study of ancient documents, and he was sent to search the archives of Switzerland, France and Germany for charters relating to the history of Savoy. During the Revolutions of 1848, after the expulsion of the Austrians from Venice, Cibrario was sent to that city with Colli to negotiate its union with Piedmont. But the proposal fell through when news arrived of the armistice between King Charles Albert and Austria, and the two delegates were made the objects of a hostile demonstration. In October 1848 Cibrario was made senator, and after the Battle of Novara (March 1849), when Charles Albert abdicated and retired to a monastery near Porto, Cibrario and Count Giacinto di Collegno were sent as representatives of the Senate to express the sympathy of that body with the fallen king. He reached Oporto on May 28, and after staying there for a month returned to Turin, which he reached just before the news of Charles Albert's death. In May 1852 he became minister of finance in the reconstructed d'Azeglio cabinet, and was later minister of education in that of Cavour. In the same year he was appointed secretary to the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus. It was he who in 1853 dictated the vigorous memorandum of protest against the confiscation by Austria of the property of Lombard exiles who had been naturalized in Piedmont. He strongly supported Cavour's Crimean policy (1855), and when General la Marmora departed in command of the expeditionary force and Cavour took the war office, Cibrario was made Minister for Foreign Affairs. He conducted the business of the department with great skill, and ably seconded Cavour in bringing about the admission of Piedmont to the Congress of Paris on an equal footing with the great powers. On retiring from the foreign office Cibrario was created count. In 1860 he acted as mediator between Victor Emmanuel's government and the republic of San Marino, and arranged a treaty by which the latter's liberties were guaranteed. After the war of 1866 by which Austria lost Venetia, Cibrario negotiated with that government for the restitution of state papers and art treasures removed by it from Lombardy and Venetia to Vienna. Count Cibrario died near Sal√≤ on Lake Garda in the fall of 1870. Works As a writer and historian, his most important work during his lifetime was his Economia politica del medio evo (Turin, 1839), which enjoyed great popularity at the time, but is now of little value. His Della schiavit√π e del servaggio (Milan, 1868‚Äì1869) gave an account of the development and abolition of slavery and serfdom. His historical writings include: * Delle artiglierie dal 1300 al 1700 (1847) * Origini e progresso della monarchia di Savoia (1854) * Degli ordini cavallereschi (1846) * Degli ordini religiosi (1845) * Memorie segrete of Charles Albert, written by order of Victor Emmanuel but afterwards withdrawn.

Formed in 1987 as a group of friends who got together to play their favorite songs, most of them by The Ramones, their favorite band and the one that influenced them the most. They started writing songs in the same punk rock style, with lyrics with proletarian content (about exploited factory workers, etc.), and wore denim jackets, which became one of their hallmarks in their beginnings. Currently, only three members continue performing and recording. History = 1987‚Äì1992: Early career and first commercial success = When they were just starting, they played the more traditional punk rock style of seminal bands like the aforementioned Ramones, the Sex Pistols or the early The Clash. In those years, the band became more popular by virtue of a more melodic style. High points in the band's history include the album El Cielo Puede Esperar in 1990, with the first band's big-hit \\"Hacelo Por M√≠\\" and performing their first gigs at the Estadio Obras in October 1991. In 1992, Attaque 77 released their third studio album √Ångeles caidos, which first made their name widely recognizable, and the last with Adri√°n Vera, replaced by Luciano Scaglione. = 1993‚Äì1999: Breakthrough and change in musical style = In 1993, with their new label RCA, Attaque released Todo Est√° al Rev√©sto some success in Argentina, touring the country in support of the album. Other high points include the high-selling album Am√©n! in 1995 and performing a new gig at the Estadio Obras in 1996. An alternative rock/punk album Un D√≠a Perfecto (U.D.P.), was released in 1997 and peaked on FM radio charts with the songs \\"Cambios\\", \\"Crecer\\" and \\"Angel\\". To commemorate their 12th anniversary the band released Otras Canciones, a covers album with the Attaque 77 members' favorite songs, signed with Ariola Records. = 2000‚Äì2008: Radio Insomnio, Antihumano and more success = In 2000, Attaque 77 traveled to Spain and recorded Radio Insomnio, later touring Europe. The 2003 album Antihumano marked the band's biggest mainstream success in Argentina and other countries, led to the alternative rock hit \\"Arrancacorazones\\" and melodic-hardcore \\"Ojos de perro\\" and \\"Los Buenos Deseos\\". Almost three years later, the band edited Karmagedon, in 2007, the last album with Ciro Pertusi. = 2009‚Äì2011: Pertusi's departure and Estallar = Mariano Mart√≠nez, the leader of Attaque 77 since 2009. In early 2009, Ciro Pertusi left the group for personal reasons, leaving only Martinez, De Cecco and Scaglione as current members. Pertusi recently formed a new group called \\"Jaur√≠a\\" in 2010, with Esteban '22' Serniotti on guitar and vocals, Mauro Ambesi on bass and Ray Fajardo (ex-El Otro Yo) on drums. In 2009 came the album Estallar devised largely by Mariano Martinez, with relative commercial success. That same year, Attaque 77 performed a gig at the Luna Park Stadium with Adri√°n Vera as guest. = 2012‚Äìpresent: Acoustic tour and new album = In 2012, the band release the first acoustic live album Acustico Teatro Opera Bs As, with special guests. In 2014, the present day line-up released a new album Nuevas Versiones, with some reworking songs of the band. In March 2015, a documentary movie about the band \\"Mas de un Millon\\" was selected to be premiered mid-April at the Buenos Aires International Festival of Independent Cinema  Attaque 77 background  Mariano Mart√≠nez and Ciro Pertusi are vegetarians and so they have composed many songs promoting animal rights, including Espiral de Silencio (Spiral of Silence), San Ferm√≠n and Ojos de Perro (Dog‚Äôs Eyes). According to polls by their fan club Regimiento de Pecadores (Sinners Regiment), their most famous song is \\"Hacelo por M√≠\\" (Do it for me) and their best lyrics are in the song Donde las √°guilas se Atreven (Where the eagles dare) from which the fan club gets its name.

A 12\\" single of \\"Run Like Hell,\\" \\"Don't Leave Me Now\\" and \\"Another Brick in the Wall (Part 2)\\" peaked at #57 on the Disco Top 100 chart in the U.S. Composition The main section of \\"Don't Leave Me Now\\", recorded with synthesizer bass, organ, piano, and a delay-treated guitar, does not adhere to one single key, but rather cycles slowly through four dissonant and seemingly-unrelated chords, for two measures of each: An E augmented chord, followed by a D flat major seventh chord, a B flat dominant seventh chord with a suspended second, followed by a G Major chord, which, after one bar, augments its fifth, before returning to the beginning of the progression. The first three chords all sustain the notes G‚ôØ/A‚ô≠ and C, and this interval is then lowered chromatically by one semitone for the conclusion on G Major. Furthermore, the roots of this chord progression (E, D‚ô≠, B‚ô≠, and G) outline the intervals of a diminished seventh chord. The roots relate to each other as a pair of tritones - the E and B‚ô≠ form one tritone, and the D‚ô≠ and G form the other. Musicologist and author Phil Rose described this section of the song as \\"entirely non- functional harmonically\\" and stated that \\"[M]ost of the time when a phrase ends, Waters is either singing one of the most dissonant notes in the accompanying chord, or a non-chord tone.\\"Pink Floyd: The Wall (1980 Pink Floyd Music Publishers Ltd., London, England, [USA ])Rose, Phil. Which One's Pink? An Analysis of the Concept Albums of Roger Waters and Pink Floyd. Collector's Guide Publishing Inc. [US ] There is no percussion, and the tempo is very slow. In the second section, drums, bass, and guitar enter, and the music becomes more consonant, resolving to the key of A minor through the use of D and A suspended second chords, as David Gilmour sings a refrain of \\"Ooh, babe\\". Plot The Wall tells the story of Pink, an alienated and embittered rock star. At this point in the album's narrative, Pink has discovered his wife's infidelity. He invites a groupie to his hotel room in L.A., during his American tour and destroys the hotel room in a fit of rage, scaring the groupie away. Pink falls into a depression. Despite the dysfunctionality of the marriage, he listlessly pleads with his wife not to leave him, stating \\"I need you, babe / To put through the shredder in front of my friends\\". Waters, in a 1980 interview with Jim Ladd, described this song as being about \\"two people who have treated each other very badly\\", yet are devastated at the prospect of their relationship ending. He also stated during the 1992 US radio special Pink Floyd: The 25th Anniversary Special that the lyrics had nothing to do with his personal life, as he had a more cordial relationship with his wife in real life than Pink did. =Film version= The song begins with a close-up of the debris in Pink's hotel room, then switches over to the hotel's pool, where Pink is seen floating in a crucifix position. Having cut open his right hand during his violent outburst, his blood stains the pool water. What follows is a fantasy sequence in which Pink watches The Dam Busters on TV in a much larger, and entirely empty, hotel room. The shadow of Pink's wife emerges on the back wall before materialising into a praying mantis-like monster, which then transforms into the vulva-shaped flower from \\"What Shall We Do Now?\\". The song ends with Pink cowering in the corner of the room, tortured by both the imaginary mantis in front of him, and thoughts of his wife's adultery.

More specifically, this song expresses Pink's recognition of the completion of his mental wall, and acknowledgement of his thorough isolation from society. Live versions In all performances of The Wall, both by Pink Floyd and in Roger Waters' solo career, the song represents the end of the first half of the show. The wall is built, apart from one brick. Waters appears in this small gap and as he sings the final word, \\"goodbye\\", the last brick is put into place, ending the first half of the show.

It has spawned three sequels and by any measure (profit, box office or attendance) is the most successful Quebec made film series of all time, and one of the most successful Canadian-made film series of all time. Plot The plot revolves around the players on a hockey team (\\"Les Boys\\") that play in a low level amateur hockey league. They are made up of a wide variety of professions and personalities, including a police officer, a barely competent doctor, a mechanic, an unemployed hockey trivia buff who has lost his confidence as a goaltender, a shifty real estate salesman and a closeted gay lawyer. The team is sponsored by a pub owner, whose son desperately wants to play hockey with the older men. The film starts at the time of the league championship, at which time the team is soundly thrashed in the final. Meanwhile, the pub owner is losing at poker to the head of the local organized crime syndicate, to the tune of $50,000. Given the opportunity to pay him back, the owner can only raise $25,000. After threatening to break his leg, the crime boss proposes another wager - a game between Les Boys and his own team. If Les Boys win, the debt is settled, but if they lose, the crime boss gets the pub. In the week leading up to the big game, a number of sub plots emerge. Chief among them is the fact that most of the partners of the hockey players are starved for affection and intimacy, including the effeminate partner of the gay lawyer. Their primary complaint is that their men are either consumed by work or hockey to the exclusion of their relationships. Meanwhile, the doctor is attempting to get the pub's attractive waitress to notice him, but she only has eyes for the team's best player, the hunky, but married, mechanic. When game day arrives, the waitress has waylaid the mechanic on the pretext that her car needs work. The rest of the players show up (including the goalie, who has previously vowed retirement) to find themselves faced with a team of ringers, including players they recognize from various minor leagues. Bewildered by the competition and handicapped by the lack of their best player, they quickly fall behind until the pub owner finally discloses the wager, and the mechanic shows up when he learns from his teammates that his wife is looking for him at the rink. Naturally, they overcome all obstacles and triumph, the gay lawyer is outed by his reunion with his lover, and the waitress finally sees the doctor without his cheap toupee and likes what she sees. English translation of title Translating \\"Les Boys\\" to English poses obvious difficulties as the word \\"Boys\\" is borrowed directly from English. As with most examples of English words borrowed into Quebec French, it is treated grammatically as a French noun, and given the proper masculine, plural, definite article. Literally, the title could be translated as \\"The 'Boys'\\", and this is the title used for English versions on videotape or DVD. Film as part of Quebec culture Surprisingly, this is one of very few Quebec made feature films to deal with ice hockey, a near obsession for many in Quebec since the beginning of the 20th century. Outsiders often underestimate the importance of hockey to Canadian culture, and particularly to Quebec culture. A film about aging immature men pursuing their sport on a serious amateur level is not a new one (see The Longest Yard, Mystery, Alaska, etc.), but it struck a responsive chord with Quebec audiences, many of whom obviously saw a piece of themselves in the characters. Box office success Les Boys cost about $3,300,000 (Cdn). to make, and took in domestic box office of over $6,000,000 CAD and another $4,000,000 USD in the United States. Given the size of the Quebec market (the film saw limited release in English Canada), a $6 million box office is the approximate equivalent of over $250 million for a domestic U.S. release. Its three sequels were also the best performing films at the Quebec box office in the years they were released. Reception French audiences generally enjoy the film far more than English audiences. This is no doubt partially because most English versions of the film have a badly dubbed dialogue, whereas the French dialogue is far more realistic. Sequels Due to the success of the movie at the Quebec box office, Louis Sa√Øa made two additional sequels, Les Boys II and Les Boys III. The third sequel, Les Boys IV, was made by George Mihalka. The second movie is about the team playing in a tournament in Chamonix, France. During the movie, the team's equipment is stolen in Chamonix. They manage to get their equipment back and to win the tournament in a shootout. Daniel Russo join the cast of the movie. The third one is more complex, as Stan's team members are demoted to a team managed by one of Stan's friends. During a matchup between the remaining Boys members and former Boys members, it is revealed that Stan's friend wants to use land around Stan's bar to build condos. The former Boys turn against their new team and Stan takes over his friend's bar. In this movie, the Boys play a game against the Canada women's Olympic team consisting mainly of players from Quebec (Kim St-Pierre, Caroline Ouellette, Danielle Goyette, Gina Kingsbury and others). The Boys are easily defeated by the girls. The fourth movie is again a tournament in which the Boys' team ends up in a game against the French Legends Team (les L√©gendes du Hockey). Some of the legends in the movie include Guy Lafleur, Mike Bossy, Ray Bourque and Martin Brodeur. Also during the movie, after a bad game, Stan takes his Boys into a wooded location and nearly gets them lost in the area. Television series A spin-off TV series named Les Boys: La s√©rie debuted on October 1, 2007 on Radio-Canada. Most of the regulars have returned to reprise their original roles, including R√©my Girard, Marc Messier, Paul Houde, Michel Charette, Yvan Ponton, Patrick Labb√© and Pierre Lebeau. A second season debuted in January 2009. Pierre Verville and Patrice Belanger joined Les Boys as new players. Paul Houde will not be back as the Boys goalie Fernand Rivest, as he is killed off in the season premiere. The show ran a total of 5 seasons and ended its run in 2012.

D. Mills, 2003, A Dictionary of British Place-Names, Oxford University Press is a village in County Laois, Ireland. It had a population of 145 as of the 2002 census, and forms part of the Borris-in-Ossory electoral area. It is best known for the Ballybrophy railway station, which is at a junction on the country's main Dublin-Cork railway line. Transport Ballybrophy railway station is a connection point between the Dublin-Cork railway line and the Limerick‚ÄìBallybrophy railway line. Trains wishing to cross from the Limerick to the Dublin line must perform time-consuming reversals. The line is lightly travelled, because an alternative routing via Limerick Junction is quicker and more comfortable owing to newer track and fewer speed restrictions. The station opened on 1 September 1847. Owing to the branch line's turn south to meet the line at Ballybrophy, some of those who favour retaining the line have theorised that continuing the line east with a stop at the more populated Borris-in-Ossory, joining the line nearer Portlaoise would be better for Dublin connections. However, in addition to the substantial capital cost of this work, substantial parts of the line would still need to be relaid nearer Limerick in order to eliminate severe speed restrictions. Upgrades to the N7 road (now M7 motorway) also dissuade people from railway usage. A report published in November 2016 suggested that the Limerick-Ballybrophy line was likely likely to close in 2018 to save money as the route was very lighty used.https://www.nationaltransport.ie/wp- content/uploads/2016/11/151116_2016_Rail_Review_Report_Complete_Online.pdf See also * List of towns and villages in Ireland References Category:Towns and villages in County Laois ","title":"Ballybrophy"},{"id":"2367005","text":"Isla de Janitzio is the main island of Lake P√°tzcuaro in the state of Michoac√°n, Mexico. The town of Janitzio, which means \\"where it rains\\", is located atop the hill. Janitzio can only be reached by boats which run regularly back and forth from about 7:30 am to 6 pm, accessible from P√°tzcuaro's pier (embarcadero). It is the largest of five islands in Lake P√°tczuaro.These boats can be hired to take visitors around other parts of the lake. The boats are pretty regular and takes approximately 25 minutes to reach the island.The town is known for the butterfly fishermen who are skilled at lowering their butterfly-shaped nets to catch the local cuisine \\"pescado blanco\\". The butterfly fisherman were also located on the back of the 50 peso Mexican banknote. The island is the subject of Silvestre Revueltas's 1933 composition Janitzio.  Statue of Jos√© Maria Morelos  A 40-meter statue of Jos√© Mar√≠a Morelos, a great hero of Mexico's independence, started in 1933, is found on the island's highest point. You can see the statue of Morelos from the boat, when arriving.Visitors can climb to the top of the statue by way of a staircase that spirals up the inside. Along the interior walls, the life of Morelos is depicted in murals painted by Ram√≥n Alba de la Canal and other Mexican muralists. At the top, visitors can look through peepholes in the giant raised fist of Morelos, with views of the island, lake and surroundings.  People  Some of the people of Janitzio and the towns surrounding Lake P√°tzcuaro are of indigenous descent and are known as Pur√©pecha. Available in Janitzio are regional handicrafts. A variety of handmade textiles and artwork are sold. Its main festivity is \\"El D√≠a de los Muertos\\" or Day of the Dead. As part of this festivity, candle-lit boat processions make their way to the island and then to Janitzio's Church and graveyard, remaining there for the night for a large festive vigil with much imbibing involved.  Climate  Mild, spring-like temperatures prevail most of the year in the North Central Highlands of central Mexico. The highlands have a climate that is described as a \\"mild, dry climate.\\" The area around Janitzio rarely sees temperatures that go above 80 degrees, even in summer. Daytime temperatures remain fairly consistent year round, however, it can become quite cold at night from November through March. The rainy season runs from May through October, with July and August generally being the wettest months. Quick moving thunderstorms can be expected over the summer months, June to September.

The song, along with \\"The Show Must Go On\\", was edited out of the film for fear on the part of the filmmakers that the film was running too long; however, a rough version is available as an extra on the 25th Anniversary Edition DVD. Composition The song starts off with an acoustic guitar, restrung in a fashion similar to Nashville tuning, but with the low E string replaced by a high E tuned two full octaves higher than normal. It plays arpeggios over E and D minor added ninth chords. The alternate stringing allows for adjacent pitches (such as the E, F‚ôØ, and G of the Em9 chord) to ring out separately on separate strings throughout the arpeggio. A fretless bass enters, also played by guitarist David Gilmour rather than usual bassist Roger Waters. Next to join in is the Fender Rhodes electric piano by Rick Wright, Gilmour's vocals, singing in the first person, as the character \\"Pink\\" (\\"Can you feel me?\\"), and overdubbed acoustic guitar and drums at the start of the second verse. In the middle is a guitar solo which is played over the album's leitmotif of the melody to \\"Another Brick in the Wall\\" (in E minor and A minor, rather than D minor). After the solo, Roger Waters sings the lead vocal for the rest of the song, in a narrative role, referring to \\"Pink\\" in the third person (\\"No matter how he tried\\") and then as Pink (\\"don't tell me there's no hope at all\\"). The bridge is a chord sequence later heard on the album as \\"Bring the Boys Back Home\\", ending on an E minor chord, leading to a reprise of the instrumental introduction, augmented by prominent ARP Quadra riffs and a faintly audible sound of a drill. At this point, there is a piece of indecipherable whispering from the left channel. Drums and vocals then join in. At about 3:23 into the song, a sonar-like sound, similar to the ping in \\"Echoes\\", is heard. When Waters sings the final verse, he does so one octave higher than Gilmour, with the highest note being the first C above middle C.Pink Floyd: The Wall (1980 Pink Floyd Music Publishers Ltd., London, England, [USA ]) Plot The Wall tells the story of Pink, an alienated young rock star who is retreating from society and isolating himself. In \\"Hey You\\", Pink realizes his mistake of shunning society and attempts to regain contact with the outside world. However, he cannot see or hear beyond the wall. Pink's call becomes more and more desperate as he begins to realize there is no escape. =Film version= \\"Hey You\\" was shot for the film Pink Floyd‚ÄîThe Wall, but the sequence (also known as Reel 13) was ultimately not included. A workprint appears on the special edition DVD, in black and white. Most of the footage was used in other sequences (most notably \\"Another Brick in the Wall (Part III)\\"). The scene begins with Pink trying to claw out of his freshly completed wall. The scene then switches to Pink's concert-goers, all of them with a blank and vacant look on their faces. These are the people \\"Standing in the aisles with itchy feet and fading smiles\\" that Pink is trying to reach out to. Next is a shot of empty infirmary beds followed by a view of two empty chairs in a white room. A motionless Pink fades into the chair on the left, with his nude wife fading into the right chair a short time later. After turning her head to look at her unresponsive husband, she fades out of the scene, which shifts to a montage of rioting scenes, with people tipping over cars and throwing Molotov cocktails at riot police. After the montage, a hand is shown clawing at a window (the colour version of this is actually shown at the end of \\"The Trial\\") followed by a large group of maggots (the \\"worms\\" eating into Pink's brain). After a shot of Pink in an infirmary bed and his screaming wife superimposed over the image, the scene takes back to the riot, where a long line of police officers hold back a mob of rioters who have barricaded themselves behind a pile of desks and mattresses. The scene ends with Pink against his wall, having given up on finding a way out.

(Compare Godgifu which was modified to Godiva in Latin texts.) was the first wife of King Harold Godwinson. \\"Swanneck\\" (or Swan-Neck) comes from the folk etymology which made her in Old English as swann hnecca, \\"swan neck\\", which was actually most likely a corrupted form of swann hnesce, \\"Gentle Swan\\" . She is sometimes confused with Ealdgyth, daughter of Earl √Ülfgar of Mercia, who was queen during Harold's reign. She may be identical with Eadgifu the Fair, who was one of the wealthiest magnates in England on the eve of the Norman conquest. Marriage The children of Edith and Harold II included Gunhild of Wessex, who became the mistress of Alan Rufus, and Gytha of Wessex, who was taken by her grandmother to Denmark in 1068. Gytha was addressed as \\"princess\\" and married the Grand Duke of Kiev, Vladimir II Monomakh. In a 2015 monograph, historian Bill Flint claims that Edith Swanneshals and Harold were legitimately married. Flint overturns many previous assumptions made about Edith's relationship with Harold, including the fidelity of the couple's marital union and Christian devotion. Flint argues that Edith and Harold were almost certainly married more danico: the Danish hand-fast marriage custom. As evidence for this, he cites a number of dowry bequests that were made at the time of Edith's union to Harold. Flint notes that the bequests made included Walsingham Manor, making Edith in all probability \\"the lady of the manor\\" during the year of 1061, which was identified by Tudor historian Richard Pynson as the year of the foundation of the shrine of Our Lady of Walsingham. Flint claims that the union more danico of Edith and Harold is legitimate from a Catholic perspective, arguing: \\"The changes confirming the Sacramental nature of Christian marriage had only recently been promulgated from Rome. Throughout the Danelaw and widespread among the nobility of England who now had many such Scandinavian bloodlines, the hand-fast marriage, which was customary and widely accepted throughout northern Europe, should not be referred to as an illegitimate union.\\" (p. 9). In fact, the Anglo-Saxons had practiced hand-fast marriage long before Danish conquest. Though Harold is said to have lawfully married Ealdgyth, the daughter of Earl √Ülfgar, the widow of the Welsh ruler Gruffydd ap Llywelyn whom he had defeated in battle, that marriage in spring 1066 is seen by most modern scholars as one of political convenience. Mercia and Wales were allied against England, and the marriage gave the English claim in two very troublesome regions, and also gave Harold Godwinesson a marriage deemed \\"legitimate\\" by the clergy, unlike his longtime common law marriage with Edith the Fair. Walsingham visionary Flint identifies Edith as the visionary known colloquially as \\"Rychold\\" or \\"Richeldis de Faverches\\", who authored Our Lady of Walsingham. The identification of Edith as the Walsingham visionary is rooted in his belief that the earlier date of shrine's foundation, given by Richard Pynson as 1061, is credible. Pynson's history, which is given in a narrative poem known as the Pynson Ballad, had been previously thrown out by historians on the grounds it was unreliable as an oral narrative, but Flint defends the ballad on the grounds that Pynson was a respected historian, employed by King Henry VII, who also collaborated with John Leland. Flint contests the theories of J.C. Dickinson (1959) on the grounds that the 1131 Norfolk Roll, which Dickinson claims refers to the foundation of the shrine, actually refers to the foundation of the Priory of the Austin Friars, which preceded the foundation of the Walsingham Shrine (see p.xxii). He also notes that Edith Swanneshals was known within the court as \\"Rychold\\", meaning \\"fair and rich\\", and the appellatory title given by Pynson could therefore refer to the Anglo-Saxon Queen‚Äîa reference which is consistent with the original date given in the Pynson Ballad as 1061, for Edith Swaneshals was the Lady of the Walsingham Manor in this period (p.xxvii). Flint therefore establishes Edith Swaneshals as a Christian queen and the legitimate spouse of Harold Godwinson; as well as defending her Christian character as the probable visionary of the Shrine of Walsingham. In defending Edith's Christian character Flint cites her friendship with Wulfstan of Worcester. Folklore According to folklore, Edith identified Harold's body after the Battle of Hastings. The body was horribly mutilated after the battle by the Norman army of William the Conqueror, and, despite pleas by Harold's mother, Gytha Thorkelsd√≥ttir, for William to surrender Harold's body for burial, the Norman army refused, even though Harold's mother offered Harold's weight in gold. It was then that Edith the Fair walked through the carnage of the battle so that she might identify Harold by markings on his chest known only to her. It was because of Edith the Fair's identification of Harold's body that Harold was given a Christian burial by the monks at Waltham Abbey. This legend is recounted in the well- known poem by Heinrich Heine, \\"The Battlefield of Hastings\\" (1855), which features Edith the Fair (as Edith Swan-Neck) as the main character and claims that the \\"marks known only to her\\" were love bites.

The noise was originally used as a sort of whale call for the deep-water-based \\"Echoes\\", and is created by David Gilmour using a wah-wah pedal with the cables reversed. The second half of the song is an instrumental classical guitar solo. In interviews, David Gilmour has said that he tried to perform it, and was not satisfied with the final result (\\"I could play it with a leather pick but couldn't play it properly fingerstyle\\").\\"Careful With That Axe\\", interview with David Gilmour by Matt Resnicoff, Musician magazine, August 1992. Accordingly, session musician Joe DiBlasiFitch, Vernon, The Pink Floyd Encyclopedia, p. 155. was brought in by Michael Kamen to play with the rest of the orchestra. He was wrongly credited as \\"Ron DiBlasi\\" on the album sleeve and Pink Floyd website because Roger Waters only remembered that it was a three-letter name; Ron was the closest name he could remember to Joe when creating the record. Plot At this point in the plot, the bitter and alienated Pink is attempting to reach anybody outside of his self-built wall. The repeated question \\"Is there anybody out there?\\" suggests that no response is heard. On the other hand, Comfortably Numb, some songs later in the album, starts with the sentence \\"Hello, Is there anybody in there?\\" addressed to Pink. Film Version In the film, during the ominous opening to the song, Pink is standing in front of the completed wall, and throws himself against it several times as if trying to escape. Then, during the acoustic guitar section, it cuts to Pink laying out all his possessions on the floor of the hotel room in neat piles. At the end of the song, it cuts to the bathroom where Pink shaves off his eyebrows and body hair, and tries to cut off his nipples with the razor, severing them.

He has released four albums. Career =Career beginnings and the Fugees= Fort√© studied classical violin; he especially enjoyed the work of Vivaldi. Eventually he matriculated to Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire, where he graduated in 1993. After high school, Fort√© returned to New York City, enrolling in NYU as a music business major, where he roomed with rapper Talib Kweli, before dropping out to work as an artist & repertoire executive at Rawkus Records. Fort√© began his professional music career when he was introduced to The Fugees by Lauryn Hill in the early 1990s. He co-wrote and produced several songs on their multi-platinum and Grammy-winning 1996 album, The Score. At 21 years of age, Fort√© was nominated for a Grammy for his work on the album. He went on to tour all over the world with The Fugees, and lent production and vocal performances to 1997's Wyclef Jean Presents the Carnival Featuring the Refugee All-Stars. Fort√© partnered with former Fugee member, Pras, for the Top 40 hit single, \\"Avenues\\", from the Money Talks soundtrack. Fort√© released his debut solo album, Poly Sci in 1998, which was produced by Wyclef Jean. The album featured performances by Fat Joe, DMX, 20 Grand Pikasoe and Jeni Fujita, and exhibited the same intriguing mix of street and mainstream culture that helped The Fugees break new ground. It was met with critical acclaim but commercial disappointment, selling just under 100,000 copies, blamed in part on the fact that \\"the record's project manager quit Sony Music a week before the album was released, and Columbia Records put little cash behind its promotional tour.\\" Spin called it \\"a crush between academia and street life that's utterly absorbing.\\" =2000-2010= In 2000, Fort√© was arrested at Newark International Airport after accepting a briefcase containing $1.4 million worth of liquid cocaine; he was charged with possession with intent to distribute cocaine and conspiracy to distribute. He was convicted and sentenced to the mandatory minimum 14 years after being found guilty, and incarcerated at FCI Loretto, a low-security federal prison in central Pennsylvania. In 2001, Fort√© released the well-received I, John, which was recorded while awaiting trial for the drug offense. Unlike his debut, this album takes a more serious approach to music-making. The second album featured guest appearances by Herbie Hancock, Esthero and Tricky, and included a duet with Carly Simon. Carly Simon and her son Ben Taylor were advocates on Fort√©'s behalf, believing he did not receive a fair trial; they fought for an appeal of the mandatory minimum drug laws that remove a judge's discretion in a case. They met Fort√© through Taylor's cousin who was a classmate of Fort√©'s at Phillips Exeter. \\"Carly is a mentor to me, a guide, absolutely my spiritual godmother,\\" Fort√© has said. With the help of Senator Orrin Hatch, Fort√©'s prison sentence was commuted by President George W. Bush on November 24, 2008.Staff. \\"Bush pardons 14 individuals\\" , Associated Press, November 24, 2008. Accessed January 30, 2013. \\"Bush also commuted the prison sentences of John Edward Forte of North Brunswick, N.J., and James Russell Harris of Detroit, Mich. Both were convicted of cocaine offenses.\\" He was released from prison four weeks later, on December 22, 2008. Since leaving the Federal Correctional Institution, Fort Dix on December 22, 2008, Fort√© has recorded over 50 songs and played over 100 shows. Soon after his release from prison, Fort√© recorded a cover of Kanye West's \\"Homecoming\\" with Talib Kweli. In the song, he discusses the issues surrounding his jail time. The music video was posted on Okayplayer.com on January 17, 2009. In 2009 he wrote various articles on TheDailyBeast.com, and Okayplayer.com interviewed him as he began his teaching job at the City College of New York in late March 2009. In July 2009, Fort√© released StyleFree, the EP, a body of work that provided social commentary combined with hope and inspiration. It allowed his audience to bear witness to the remaking of a man. The single off the EP, \\"Play my Cards For Me,\\" an audible reflection of his hip hop and R&B; roots, was placed in the Queen Latifah/Common film Just Wright and the song \\"Nervous\\" was used in the film Stomp the Yard 2: Homecoming. =2010s: Later career= In January 2010, Fort√©'s work was featured throughout the Sundance Film Festival, where, in addition to performing at the ASCAP Music Caf√©, he scored all of the opening festival trailers, had the end credit song in the film Night Catches Us, and participated in a unique audio and visual collaborative effort with Joe Gordon-Levitt at hitrecord.org. In the spring of 2010, Fort√© and his band participated in a successful 15-city tour with K'Naan, Wale and Tabi Bonney. Fort√© founded a production company called Le Castle in 2011 to manage the various projects that he has undertaken in music, film and other fields. In February 2011, Le Castle produced a 9-week tour through Russia. Titled \\"From Brooklyn to Russia with Love!\\", the tour took Fort√© and his band ‚Äì including bassist Brian Satz, percussionist Ryan Vaughn and keyboardist Patrick Firth ‚Äì across Russia, from Moscow and St. Petersburg to Nizhny Novgorod, Kazan and Ekaterinburg, and other smaller locales along the Trans-Siberia Railway. Among the artists with whom Fort√© collaborated in Russia were Sunsay, Natasha Bedingfield, Evgeny Margulis, Alina Orlova, Billy's Band, Zero People, uma2rman, Emch Subatomic, Sergei Skrypka's State Symphony Cinema Orchestra, Romario, and more. All proceeds from the tour were donated to local orphanages and the international foundations Operation Smile and Petra Nemcova's Happy Hearts Fund. In September, Fort√©'s begin releasing his first full-length album in 10 years, Water Light Sound. The album features collaborations with international stars John Legend, Natasha Bedingfield, Talib Kweli, HD Fre, AZ, Colin Munroe, and Valerie June. One of the tracks called \\"Your Side\\" (produced by Dallas Austin) was placed in EA FIFA World Cup 2010. Water Light Sound will be launched in three vignettes. The first vignette \\"The Water Suite\\" will be made available to the public after an exclusive performance in Moscow on 27 September 2011, with Sunsay, an acclaimed artist from Ukraine with whom Fort√© collaborated on the hit single \\"Windsong.\\" From Moscow, Fort√© will continue his promotional tour to such cities as Stockholm, London, Paris, and Casablanca. The two remaining vignettes will be launched over the following months. Fort√© also appeared on an episode of \\"NY Ink\\" January 2012. Fort√© composed the theme song for the CBS News television documentary series Brooklyn DA. =Upcoming projects= Le Castle is currently finalizing a full- length documentary film about the \\"From Brooklyn to Russia with Love!\\" tour, and an album of his collaborations with Russian artists. The film and album are scheduled for release in early 2012. Le Castle is also producing a number of collaborations for Fort√© with international artists. These projects will be released in the coming months. Fort√© is also writing his memoir with Simon & Schuster. The book will be published along with a body of original music. A documentary is currently in production that chronicles the uncanny and unique life of Fort√© from his urban plight out of one of New York's most impoverished ghettos, to the alabaster halls of New England Prep School Phillips Exeter Academy. From worldwide stardom with multi-platinum hip-hop group The Fugees, to an unlikely seven-year incarceration for a drug offense and later to a miraculous commutation by former President George Bush, the documentary specifically explores Fort√©'s return to society as a honed instrument for teaching and song and the acclimation process. The film is being directed by Darryl Phillips and produced by Aarti Tandon and Darryl Phillips. Charitable work Fort√© frequently seeks to team up with charitable causes when performing on tour. In the spring of 2011, Fort√© undertook a 9-week performance tour through Russia. All proceeds from the tour were donated to local orphanages and the international foundations Operation Smile and Petra Nemcova's Happy Hearts Fund. Fort√© has been working with at-risk youth to deter them from drugs and crime. He has taught a music course to 12- to 15-year-old students with In Arms Reach, a Harlem-based initiative for children of incarcerated parents. In addition to using his musical abilities to help spread a positive message to children, he has been working with a New York-based charity called Music Unites to promote the arts in under served communities, where he educates students on his version of life, lessons learned, and the pursuit of happiness through music. Fort√© has also been involved with various organizations dedicated to prison reform, mitigating prisoner recidivism, and reforming federal and state drug laws. He currently serves on the Board of Directors of The Fortune Society - a New York City- based non-profit which services formerly-incarcerated individuals reentering society.

They achieve considerable vertical development in areas of deep, moist convection. They are an intermediate stage between cumulus mediocris and cumulonimbus.  Description  Cahokia Mounds Museum, Collinsville, Illinois Cumulus congestus clouds are characteristic of unstable areas of the atmosphere which are undergoing convection. They are often characterized by sharp outlines and great vertical development. Because they are produced by (and primarily composed of) strong updrafts, they are typically taller than they are wide, and cloud tops can reach ,See or higher in the tropics. Cumulus congestus clouds are formed by the development of cumulus mediocris generally, though they can also be formed from altocumulus castellanus or stratocumulus castellanus as well. The congestus species of cloud can only be found in the genus cumulus and is designated as towering cumulus (Tcu) by the International Civil Aviation Organization. Congestus clouds are capable of producing severe turbulence and showers of moderate to heavy intensity. This species is classified as vertical or multi-√©tage and is coded CL2 in the synop report. These clouds are usually too large and opaque to have any opacity or pattern- based varieties. Pyrocumulus (No official abbreviation) is a free convective cloud associated with volcanic eruptions and large-scale fires. Pyrocumulus isn't recognized by the WMO as a distinct genus or species, but is, in essence, cumulus congestus formed under special circumstances that can also cause severe turbulence. Cumulus congestus will mature into cumulonimbus calvus under conditions of sufficient instability. This transformation can be seen by the presence of smooth, fibrous, or striated aspects assumed by the cloud's upper part. This cloud type produces precipitation, often in abundance. These clouds also produce fair weather waterspouts forming from mesocyclones. These waterspouts tend to perish after precipitation or strong downdrafts form, by which time the congestus may have advanced to cumulonimbus. Cumulus congestus clouds can produce precipitation and even lightning. An approaching weather front often brings mid level clouds such as altostratus or altocumulus which usually stop any cumulus from reaching the congestus stage by reducing the Sun's heat or acting as a layer of stable air through which the cumulus cannot rise through. Occasionally, however, particularly if the air below the mid level cloud is very warm or unstable, some of the cumuli may become congestus and the tops of them may rise above the mid level cloud layer, sometimes resulting in showers ahead of the main rainband. This is often a sign the approaching front contains at least a few cumulonimbi amongst the nimbostratus rain clouds and therefore any rain may be accompanied by thunderstorms. Turkey tower  An example of a Turkey tower in the distance Turkey tower is a slang term for a narrow, individual towering cloud from a small cumulus cloud which develops and suddenly falls apart. Sudden development of turkey towers could signify the breaking or weakening of a capping inversion.

This song was one of several to be considered for the band's \\"best of\\" album, Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd. Background \\"Nobody Home\\" was written late into the development of The Wall after an argument between the band and Roger Waters. David Gilmour said that the song \\"came along when we were well into the thing [The Wall] and he‚Äôd [Waters] gone off in a sulk the night before and came in the next day with something fantastic.\\" Lyrics In the song, the character Pink describes his lonely life of isolation behind his self-created mental wall. He has no one to talk to, and all he has are his possessions. The song describes what Roger Waters says he experienced during the band's 1977 tour, the band's first major stadium tour. Additionally, the song contains some references to founding Pink Floyd member, Syd Barrett. The song was written after an argument between Gilmour, Waters, and co-producer Bob Ezrin during production of The Wall in which Gilmour and Ezrin challenged Waters to come up with one more song for the album. Waters then wrote \\"Nobody Home\\" and returned to the studio two days later to present it to the band. It was the last song written for The Wall. On the 30th anniversary of The Wall episode of the US radio show In the Studio with Redbeard, Gilmour revealed that \\"Nobody Home\\" was one of his favorite songs from the album. A television playing in the background is frequently heard, including the line, \\"Surprise! Surprise, Surprise!\\" from Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C. This recalls the line: I got thirteen channels of shit on the TV to choose from Much of the song describes Syd Barrett's fragile mental state during 1967. In the documentary \\"Behind The Wall\\", Gilmour states that it describes the state of mind of many rockstars while on tour. However, the lyrics: I got nicotine stains on my fingers I got a silver spoon on a chain Got a grand piano to prop up my mortal remains are said to have been written specifically about Floyd's pianist Richard Wright, who was allegedly struggling with cocaine addiction at the time.

At the , Mollymook had a population of 1,083 while the adjacent locality of Mollymook Beach was home to a further 2,447 people. Geographically, Mollymook is considered part of the Milton-Ulladulla district, a coastal corridor of urban development stretching from Burrill Lake, south of Ulladulla to Mollymook's northern neighbour, Narrawallee and the historic town of Milton a few kilometres inland. The area collectively referred to as Mollymook is formed by two distinct localities; Mollymook Beach ‚Äì a mostly residential area incorporating Bannister Headland adjoining Narrawallee, and Mollymook ‚Äì containing the Mollymook golf and surf lifesaving clubs, motels and serviced apartments. The name \\"Mollymook\\" is believed to derive from mollymawk, the name given by sailors to small species of albatross. History Mollymook was first settled as a rural area of Ulladulla. In 1859, the Mitchell family established a property named \\"Molly Moke\\" in the vicinity of Garside Road. \\"Mollymook\\" is possibly a reference to the black-browed mollymawk. A cemetery overlooking the sea was in use by 1893. Some time around 1900, John Coller allowed public access to the beach and rock pools on his family estate (present day Collers Beach), and Mollymook began to earn a reputation as a popular retreat. Silica mining operations were commenced on Mollymook's southern headland by the Illawarra brick company prior to 1920 and brought an influx of workers to the quarries. Bannister Headland at the northern end of Mollymook beach was the site of a silica crushing facility and loading jetty in the early 20th century. In 1924, a tramway was constructed across Narrawallee Inlet to transport silica from mining leases near Conjola for preparation and shipping. The industry declined during World War II. During the 1990s, many of Mollymook's older homes began to be redeveloped with medium density apartments and resort style hotels. Like much of the south coast, the town is popular with retirees. Facilities and infrastructure Today Mollymook has an economy largely based on tourism relying on nearby Ulladulla with a larger population base for many services and employment opportunities. A small shopping centre with a supermarket, pharmacy and several specialty shops is located at the northern end of Mollymook, as well as a public sportsground ‚Äì the Bill Andriski Mollymook Oval, medical centre and bowling club. A range of beachside accommodation options are popular during the summer holiday seasons including motels, holiday rental homes, serviced apartments as well as the upmarket Bannister Head Lodge. In peak holiday times South Mollymook Beach, North Mollymook Beach and Narrawallee are all patrolled by members of the Mollymook Surf Lifesaving Club. The Sandridge Memorial Gardens Cemetery has been in use since 1893 and is the largest in the district, located at the corner of Ocean Street and Mitchell Parade, overlooking Mollymook Beach. Ulladulla Bus Lines route 740 provides public transport services six days per week toward Ulladulla and Milton, with several stops in Mollymook up to five times per day. Sport and recreation Mollymook Golf Club, located on the southern end of Mollymook Beach The Mollymook Golf Club maintains two golf courses; the Hilltop course is an 18-hole Championship course, renowned as a challenging and picturesque layout. Designed in 1977, the March 2006 edition of Australian Golf Digest rated this course as number 97 in the top 100 Australian golf courses. The smaller 9 hole, Par 33 Beachside course is aimed mainly at social golfers. The Hilltop course features a lounge bar, pro-shop and locker room, offering cart hire, conference and practice facilities. The main clubhouse is located next to Mollymook Beach, adjacent to the Beachside course and offers gaming and dining options and a large function room with panoramic views of the beach. The smaller Mollymook Beach Bowling Club also offers bistro style dining and a range of recreational activities including lawn bowls and poker tournaments. The Mollymook Surf Lifesaving Club hosts many competitions and surf carnivals throughout the year. Events include surf boat races and ocean swims. The club encourages the participation of \\"Nippers\\", junior club members aged between 5 and 14 who learn skills in water safety and surf lifesaving many of whom go on to patrol the local beaches. The club also maintains a kiosk and function rooms at their clubhouse at the southern end of the beach. The Bill Andriski Oval is the home ground of the Milton-Ulladulla Bulldogs, a rugby league team which competes in the Group 7 competition of the Country Rugby League. In July 2004, the Nine Network broadcast an episode of The Footy Show live from the oval, including several pre-recorded segments featuring Mollymook Beach and the Surf Lifesaving Club. Collers Beach Surfing is a common sport in the area and Mollymook contains numerous popular breaks, including Colliers, Golfies, Kamakazes, and more along Mollymook beach. Diving and spear fishing is also popular around the rocks, and Bannister Head to the north of Mollymook beach contains the well known jumprock and run-and-jump. Tourism and attractions Bogey Hole In addition to the surf beach, Mollymook also boasts a large natural rock pool known as the \\"Bogey Hole\\". This sheltered pool is protected from the sea, making it popular with families due to the calm waters. Nearby Collers Beach offers opportunities for snorkelling and has been designated by the Shoalhaven City Council as an off-leash area where dog owners can allow their pets to exercise freely. Additional amenities are provided at the northern end of Mollymook Beach which is popular with surfers due to it being more exposed to the open sea. In October 2009, English celebrity chef and restaurateur Rick Stein opened his first Australian restaurant in Mollymook ‚Äì 'Rick Stein at Bannisters'.Rick Stein at Bannisters Located at 'Bannisters' a Boutique Hotel on the cliff tops of Bannisters Point, the opening of 'Rick Stein at Bannisters' increased media attention and public awareness of the town of Mollymook.The Daily Telegraph References External links * Travel South Mollymook visitors guide * Mollymook quick guide *VISITNSW.com ‚Äì Mollymook Category:City of Shoalhaven Category:Towns in New South Wales Category:Towns in the South Coast (New South Wales) Category:Coastal towns in New South Wales ","title":"Mollymook"},{"id":"2367084","text":"\\"Vera\\" is a song by Pink Floyd which appears on their 1979 album, The Wall.

Explanation It is a special case of the configuration interaction method in which all Slater determinants (or configuration state functions, CSFs) of the proper symmetry are included in the variational procedure (i.e., all Slater determinants obtained by exciting all possible electrons to all possible virtual orbitals, orbitals which are unoccupied in the electronic ground state configuration). This method is equivalent to computing the eigenvalues of the electronic molecular Hamiltonian within the basis set of the above-mentioned configuration state functions. In a minimal basis set a full CI computation is very easy. But in larger basis sets this is usually just a limiting case which is not often attained. This is because exact solution of the full CI determinant is NP- complete, so the existence of a polynomial time algorithm is unlikely. The Davidson correction is a simple correction which allows one to estimate the value of the full CI energy from a limited configuration interaction expansion result. Because the number of determinants required in the full CI expansion grows factorially with the number of electrons and orbitals, full CI is only possible for atoms or very small molecules with about a dozen or fewer electrons. Full CI problems including several million up to a few billion determinants are possible using current algorithms. Because full CI results are exact within the space spanned by the orbital basis set, they are invaluable in benchmarking approximate quantum chemical methods. This is particularly important in cases such as bond-breaking reactions, diradicals, and first-row transition metals, where electronic near-degeneracies can invalidate the approximations inherent in many standard methods such as Hartree-Fock theory, multireference configuration interaction, finite-order M√∏ller-Plesset perturbation theory, and coupled cluster theory. Although fewer N-electron functions are required if one employs a basis of spin-adapted functions (≈ú2 eigenfunctions), the most efficient full CI programs employ a Slater determinant basis because this allows for the very rapid evaluation of coupling coefficients using string-based techniques advanced by Nicholas C. Handy in 1980. In the 1980s and 1990s, full CI programs were adapted to provide arbitrary-order M√∏ller-Plesset perturbation theory wave functions, and in the 2000s they have been adapted to provide coupled cluster wave functions to arbitrary orders, greatly simplifying the task of programming these complex methods.

The song was released as a B-side on the single, \\"When the Tigers Broke Free\\". Composition As the final notes of the previous song \\"Vera\\" decay, the listener hears several snare drums articulating a march beat in time, fading in like approaching soldiers. The song proves to be polyrhythmic, as this beat continues unchanged while the orchestra, choir, and lead vocals begin in . Roger Waters sings the simple and direct lyric in his upper register, stridently, supported by a choir. A IV-V-I chord progression in G major repeats, providing a sense of satisfaction. This is followed by a reversal, from G to D major with F-sharp in the bass, to C major, which features a tritone movement in the bassline, going from F‚ôØ to C, introducing a sense of instability. This progression is a recurring Pink Floyd theme, appearing throughout the album in \\"Hey You\\", \\"Vera\\", and others, as well as several songs on Waters and company's follow-up concept album on the losses of war, The Final Cut. Waters and choir exhort, \\"Bring the boys back home / Don't leave the children on their own\\". On the final iteration, the song climaxes on the relative minor of E minor. The choir abruptly drops away, leaving Waters' voice alone, agonised and struggling to sustain the high note (the first B above middle C). A lone snare drum also remains, continuing its now- threatening march beat, as insane laughter and voices from Pink's past and present mingle while his manager pounds on his hotel-room door.Pink Floyd: The Wall (1980 Pink Floyd Music Publishers Ltd., London, England, [USA ])Pink Floyd: The Final Cut (1983 Pink Floyd Music Publishers Ltd., London, England.)Phil Rose, Which One's Pink? An Analysis of the Concept Albums of Roger Waters & Pink Floyd (Collector's Guide Publishing, Inc., Box 62034, Burlington, Ontario, Canada, L7R 4K2, http://www.cgpublishing.com ) According to songwriter Roger Waters, \\"Bring the Boys Back Home\\" is the central, unifying song on The Wall: Performances The original Pink Floyd concerts of The Wall were so expensive that, ultimately, the band lost money staging them. They were also, at that time, the most elaborate stage productions a rock band had ever mounted. For these reasons, and others, it is understandable that the band chose to use the original recordings of Michael Kamen's orchestral arrangements, rather than hire and rehearse a live orchestra, for what was then considered a rock and roll concert. Recordings of the original sound effects (televisions, helicopters, various atmospheric effects) were also used (as were the specific echo effects in several songs, such as \\"Hey You\\" or \\"Stop\\"). With the use of click tracks, the musicians were able to play in sync with the recordings (with the additional result that they reproduced nearly every song at its precise original tempo). As \\"Bring the Boys Back Home\\" is performed by an orchestra, with a large number of drummers, and none of the typical rock and roll instruments, Roger Waters would simply sing along to a remix of the studio recording. This is demonstrated on Is There Anybody Out There? The Wall Live 1980‚Äì81, paying special attention to the ending, when the \\"live\\" Roger Waters drops out, and his recorded lead vocal remains, sustaining the last note with the unique wavering heard on the studio album. Ten years later, when Roger Waters‚Äîby then a solo artist‚Äîdecided to stage a massive re-production of The Wall at the site of the recently dismantled Berlin Wall, he had the personnel and the finances for a full-scale arrangement (Particularly because it was understood to be a charity concert for the Memorial For Disaster Relief). Using the extended arrangement from the film, Waters sang (in his most strident, histrionic style) while backed by the Rundfunk Orchestra and Choir, band of the Combined Soviet Forces in Germany and the Red Army Chorus. When Waters resurrected the concept of The Wall for his 2010-2012 tour, The Wall Live, the song was again central to the show's political message. Throughout the song, the projections on the fully built wall slowly gave a 1953 quote from U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower: > Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired, > signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not > fed, those who are cold and not clothed. Film appearance In the film, the song is sung by a large choir, without Waters' lead vocal. It is also expanded, with an extended vamp on the subdominant before repetition of the full four-line lyric. \\"Bring the Boys Back Home\\" is about not letting war, or careers, overshadow family relationships or leave children neglected. This is symbolised in the film, in which the protagonist, Pink, is seen as a young boy at a train station. The station is filled with soldiers returning from war, their loved ones happy to greet them. But though he wanders around in vain, there is no one for Pink to embrace, as his father did not make it home alive. The happy crowd sings an exultant tune, \\"Bring the Boys Back Home\\", but the song ends abruptly on a minor chord as Pink suddenly realises he is alone. The crowd of reunited families then vanish. As the last notes die away, we see his embittered and alienated adulthood. Memories of events that drove Pink to isolation begin to recur in a loop: The teacher from \\"Another Brick in the Wall\\", the operator from \\"Young Lust\\", and the groupie from \\"One of My Turns\\", Pink's manager yelling, \\"Time to go!\\" (to play a concert) and insane laughter are also mixed into the closing seconds, concluding with the ominous voice from \\"Is There Anybody Out There?\\", reverberating slowly into silence, and segueing into \\"Comfortably Numb\\" as Pink‚Äôs manager bursts through the door finding Pink unconscious from an overdose.

The authority manages various airports including Portugal's largest airport, Lisbon Airport.ANA The authority has its head office in Building 120 on the grounds of the airport.\\"Contacts .\\" ANA ‚Äì Aeroportos de Portugal. Retrieved on 9 September 2010. \\"Rua D - Edif√≠cio 120 - Aeroporto de Lisboa 1700-008 Lisboa - Portugal\\" History Porto Airport At the end of the 1980s, a major expansion in both the economy and air traffic was witnessed at the global and national level. For ANA, it was a period of investment in basic infrastructures, with the renewal of the Air Traffic Control systems and the Lisbon, Oporto and Faro airports. Airport activities also grew: free shops, rent-a-car offices, parking. During this period the company's head office was built, in addition to buildings for the Airports' partners: forwarding agents, concessionaires and airlines. It was also a period when the Airports joined several international bodies, such as Eurocontrol, ICAA (International Civil Airports Association) and AOCI (Airport Operators Council International). Faro Airport The 1990s began with the Gulf crisis, which affected both aviation and the world economy. Other sources of instability were the war in Yugoslavia, German reunification and the slowdown in the US economy. These circumstances meant the end of a cycle of self-financing investments for ANA, and the company was forced to seek credit to support its development. Despite these difficulties, infrastructures continued to be strengthened, especially the Lisbon, Faro and Ponta Delgada airports and, in air navigation, the Atl√¢ntico project. In 1991 the liberalization of the European market was extended, with the end of monopolies and tariff controls. These measures brought with them great challenges. In order to confront these, in 1992 ANA carried out a thorough analysis, the keywords of which ‚Äì Client and Effectiveness ‚Äì guided the company's growth in the following years. The result of this analysis was a new direction for the company towards competitiveness. Decentralized management was adopted, which transferred decision-making capacity to the different business areas: Airports, Air Traffic Control Centres, the Commercial Activities Area and the Aeronautical Infrastructures Studies and Projects Area. The structure of the organization became more simplified and effective. A new tariff policy was set up, capable of attracting large clients with a greater cost/benefit relationship. The commercial profitability of the airports was expanded with the awarding of various concessions. During this period ANA demonstrated its capacity to provide services to third parties, within Portugal and beyond. The Funchal and Macau airports were the first to entrust us with their management. Investment in infrastructures continued, with improvements in the different airports and in the management of air traffic. In a period of expansion in the economy and in air traffic, with intense competition between destinations and airports, ANA's response was continued growth, topped with record performance levels in the year of Expo98, equally in terms of turnover, net profits and investments. At the end of 1998, ANA Aeroportos, EP, split into two new companies, leaving these a legacy of infrastructures, positive economic and corporate indicators and a culture of competitiveness. ANA ‚Äì Aeroportos de Portugal, SA, focused on airport management, and NAV, EP, focused on air navigation, were thus born. Lisbon Airport with ANA signage Cristiano Ronaldo International Airport ANA, SA appeared within a context of accelerated globalization, with the increasingly more intense movement of people and goods. Its competitiveness and that of the country was dependent on its responses to this new situation. One of these responses was a new strategic vision, which defined ANA as a benchmark group in airport services. The group included, amongst other companies, Portway, a handling operator since 2000, and NAER, set up in 1998 to move forward with the new Lisbon airport. The government's decision to build the new airport was not only a response to the reported saturation at the Portela airport, but was also to give the country a hub connecting the Atlantic to Europe. The location of the new airport was decided in 1999, followed by its model in 2000: a public-private partnership to be combined with the privatization of ANA itself. Meanwhile, expansion continued at Portela, aiming the achievement of its full potential, and a new development plan was created for the S√° Carneiro Airport, aimed at allowing it to serve the whole of the North East of Iberia. Cristiano Ronaldo International Airport, then known as Madeira Airport, an example of engineering prowess, opened the archipelago up to large aircraft, and Faro Airport was renovated, with a view to making it the best tourist airport in the Iberian Peninsula. TAP Air Portugal, the biggest client for ANA This focus on expansion and competitiveness suffered a serious setback with the 9/11 attacks. The crisis in the economy and in aviation led to a heavy loss of income, compounded by increased security costs. International instability and Portugal's economic difficulties called into question large projects such as the new Lisbon airport, which the Government suspended in 2004. In this context, it became even more important to adopt a lighter structure with fewer costs, in which resources and procedures could be shared throughout the group. This restructuring, which took place between 2002 and 2004, was another step in creating the conditions necessary for privatization. 2004, which did not bring the expected takeover, was the year in which ANA's airport traffic began to grow once again.

He was a brother of Emperor Alexander III and uncle of Nicholas II, Russia's last monarch. He entered the Russian Army, was a general in the Cavalry and adjutant general to his brother Emperor Alexander III, and a Knight of the Order of St. Andrew. In 1889, he married Princess Alexandra of Greece, his paternal first cousin once removed. The couple had a daughter and a son, but Alexandra died after the birth of their second child. In his widowhood, Grand Duke Paul began a relationship with Olga Valerianovna Karnovich, a married woman with three children. After obtaining a divorce for Olga and in defiance of strong family opposition, Grand Duke Paul married her in October 1902. As he contracted a morganatic marriage with a divorc√©e in defiance of the Tsar's prohibition, Grand Duke Paul was banished from living in Russia and deprived of his titles and privileges. Between 1902 and 1914, he lived in exile in Paris with his second wife, who gave him three children. In the spring of 1914, he settled back in Russia with his second family. With the outbreak of World War I, Grand Duke Paul was appointed in command of the first corps of the Imperial Guard. Afflicted with ill health, he served only intermittently. During the last days of the Tsarist period, he was one of the few members of the Romanov family who remained close to Tsar Nicholas II and his wife, Alexandra Feodorovna. It fell upon Grand Duke Paul to inform Alexandra of Nicholas II's abdication. After the fall of the Russian monarchy, Grand Duke Paul initially remained at his palace in Tsarskoe Selo during the period of the provisional government. With the Bolsheviks ascending to power, his palace was expropriated, and eventually he was arrested and sent to prison. In declining health, he was shot by the Bolsheviks with other Romanov relatives in the courtyard of the Peter and Paul Fortress in January 1919, and his remains were thrown into a common grave. Early life Tsar Alexander II of Russia with his wife and their three youngest children: Sergei, Paul and Maria Grand Duke Paul was born on at the Catherine Palace, in Tsarskoye Selo.Lee & Davidson, Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich, p. 149.Zeepvat, Romanov Autumn, p. 195. He was the eighth and youngest child of Tsar Alexander II of Russia and his first wife, Empress Maria Alexandrovna of Russia, n√©e Princess Marie of Hesse and by Rhine. As the youngest child in a large family, he was much loved by his parents and siblings. His early years were spent with his two siblings closest in age: his sister Marie, and his brother Sergei, from whom he was inseparable.Zeepvat, Romanov Autumn, p. 196. By the time of Paul's birth, his mother was afflicted with tuberculosis and the doctors advised her not to have more children. Relations between Paul's parents ceased.Van der Kiste, The Romanovs 1818‚Äì1959, p. 42.Lee & Davidson, Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich, p. 153. The family was struck by tragedy in 1865 with the death of Paul's eldest brother, Tsarevich Nicholas Alexandrovich, when Paul was four years old.Lee & Davidson, Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich, p. 152. The following year, his father, Alexander II, started an affair with Princess Princess Catherine Dolgurokova, who gave him three children. Grand Duke Paul's early years were spent at Tsarskoye Selo and at the Winter Palace in Saint Petersburg, with vacations at Livadia, the family‚Äôs Crimean retreat. As time passed and the Empress‚Äô health dictated her to avoid the harsh Russian climate, the Tsarina spent long sojourns abroad with her three youngest children in Jugenheim outside Darmstadt, and the winters in the south of France. Paul was a protected delicate child; he never had a robust constitution.Zeepvat, Dear, Unforgettable Alix, p. 7. Education Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich and his brother Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich Grand Duke Paul was educated at home by private tutors. From the 1870s, Paul and his brother Sergei were kept in Russia by their studies. They were destined to follow a military career. From 1864 to 1885, their tutor was Admiral Dmitri Arsenyev (1832-1915), who encouraged his pupils to have a broad artistic education as well. Grand Duke Paul became a good amateur actor and an excellent dancer.Chavchavadze, The Grand Dukes, p. 127. He was widely liked due to his gentle character, very different from his boisterous eldest brothers.Alexander, Once a Grand Duke, p. 140. He was from birth a Guard cornet in an Infantry Regiment. However, his career advanced more slowly than that of his elder brothers. He became a Lieutenant in January 1874, but as he was still too young, he was the only one of Tsar Alexander II's sons not to take part in the Russo-Turkish War (1877‚Äì78). Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich was known as a gentle person, religious and accessible to people. In June 1880, he was afflicted by the death of his mother, whose slim figure and delicate health he inherited. Shortly after, his father married his mistress Catherine Dolgorukova.Lee & Davidson, Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich, p. 154. Grand Duke Paul, overprotected by his brother Sergei, did not know of the affair. Emotionally distraught by the news, he had to travel abroad to recuperate. Grand Duke Paul was on a trip to Italy with his brother Sergei when their father Alexander II was assassinated on 13 March [O.S. 1 March] 1881. Paul's eldest surviving brother, Alexander III, ascended to the Russian throne.Lee & Davidson, Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich, p. 155. Since childhood, Paul was very attached to his brother Sergei, their closeness remaining even after Sergei's engagement and later marriage to Princess Elisabeth of Hesse and by Rhine (1864‚Äì1918). Paul accompanied the couple to England to meet Elisabeth's British grandmother, Queen Victoria, who was favorably impressed by Paul. After Sergei's marriage, Paul moved in with his brother and his new sister-in-law, who also became very close to him. The trio shared the same household for some time, and they made a trip together to Jerusalem in 1888.Zeepvat, Romanov Autumn, p. 197. Grand Duke Paul suffered from weak lungs and spent periods abroad to recuperate. On medical advice, he visited Greece in 1887.Van der Kiste, The Romanovs 1818‚Äì1959, p. 126. First marriage Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich and Princess Alexandra of Greece. Engagement photograph. 1888Lee & Davidson, Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich, p. 157. During his visits to Greece, in the family atmosphere of his first cousin Queen Olga of Greece, Grand Duke Paul grew closer with Olga's eldest daughter, Princess Alexandra of Greece and Denmark.Zeepvat, The Camera and the Tsars, p. 49. Alexandra's father, King George I of Greece, was a brother of Tsarina Maria Feodorovna, Paul's sister-in-law. During the silver wedding anniversary of King George and Queen Olga, Paul asked for Alexandra's hand and he was accepted. Alexandra had come to Russia several times during visits to her maternal relatives. She was lively and mischievous, while he was reserved.Zeepvat, Dear, Unforgettable Alix, p. 8. Their engagement was announced on 10 November 1888. The wedding took place on in St. Petersburg, at the chapel of the Winter Palace. Grand Duke Paul was twenty-nine years old and his wife ten years younger.Van der Kiste, The Romanovs 1818‚Äì1959, p. 140. Paul settled with his wife in his own palace in St. Petersburg on the English Embankment, No. 68.Belyakova, Grand Duchess Maria Nikolayevna and her palace in St Peterburg , p. 14. The mansion was located behind the Church of the Annunciation and faced the Corps de la Marine in the very center of Saint Petersburg. It was built in the Florentine renaissance revival style by the architect Alexander Krakau between 1859‚Äì1862 for Baron Alexander von Stieglitz, a prominent financier and the first Governor of the Bank of Russia. After Stieglitz's death in 1884, the mansion was inherited by his adopted daughter, Nadezhda Polovtsova. She sold the property to the Treasury in 1887, and Grand Duke Paul bought it the same year. In 1889, he had the architect Maximilian Messmacher redesign some of the interiors, creating a Moorish Hall. The treasures of the house included the white marble staircase, the sitting room decorated with caryatids, the oak-paneled library, and the concert hall with portraits of great composers and panels depicting The Four Seasons. Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich; Sergei's wife, Grand Duchess Elizaberth Feodorovna holding Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna; Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich with his son, Dmitri, on his lap Grand Duke Paul's marriage was happy, but brief. Alexandra, after a difficult first pregnancy, gave birth to a daughter on , Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna of Russia (1890‚Äì1958). Alexandra was of a frail constitution and she was also homesick for her native Greece. In autumn of that same year, Grand Duke Paul took his wife for a holiday in Greece. At their return to Russia, he was appointed commander of the imperial house guards at Krasnoye Selo and, therefore, he was usually away fulfilling his military duties. Paul and his wife were given rooms at the Catherine Palace in Tsarskoye Selo, but they saw each other only on weekends. Although Grand Duke Sergei and his wife Elizabeth moved to Moscow in May 1891, the two couples remained very close.Lee & Davidson, Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich, p. 156. In the summer of 1891, Paul and Alexandra decided to spend some time with them at Ilinskoie, Sergei's country estate outside Moscow. While there, Alexandra, seven months pregnant with her second child, carelessly stepped into a waiting boat, causing premature labor and the following day gave birth prematurely to a son, Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich of Russia (1891‚Äì1942). Alexandra did not recover consciousness and died six days later on . Grand Duke Paul was deeply affected by Alexandra's death.Zeepvat, Romanov Autumn, p. 198. It took him a long time to overcome his depression. During this period, his brother Sergei and Sergei's wife took care of Paul's motherless children in a pattern of behavior that it would be repeated in the years to follow.Perry & Pleshakov, The Flight of the Romanovs, p. 43.Van der Kiste, The Romanovs 1818‚Äì1959, p. 141. In his widowhood, the grieving grand duke moved to Tsarskoye Selo, leaving his palace in St Peterburg that had been his home with Alexandra to never return. For a long time, the palace stood vacant. After that, the building changed many hands over time. When the revolution ended, the mansion was sold to the Russian Society for the Production of Equipment and Military Supplies. Eventually it became home to various Soviet institutions. The palace has survived to the present and today it is at the disposal of Saint Petersburg State University. Grand Duke Paul's brother, Tsar Alexander III, died on and Paul's nephew, Nicholas II, became the new Tsar. There was only an eight-year gap between uncle and nephew and Paul had known Nicholas II's wife, Alexandra Feodorovna, since she was a little girl, when in his youth he made many visits to his mother's native Darmstadt. Therefore, Grand Duke Paul was well-liked by the new Tsar and Tsarina.Lee & Davidson, Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich, p. 162. Second marriage Grand Duke Paul and his second wife, Olga Valerianovna Karnovich In 1895, the young widower began an affair with a commoner, Olga Valerianovna Karnovich.Zeepvat, Romanov Autumn, p. 199. Olga was married with three young children, a son and two daughters. Her husband, Eric von Pistohlkors, was an aide de camp of Paul's brother, Grand Duke Vladimir, and a captain in Paul's regiment.Van der Kiste, The Romanovs 1818‚Äì1959, p. 165. The affair initially remained secret, but it became public knowledge at court when Olga, during a court ball, wore a diamond necklace that had belonged to Paul's mother, Empress Maria Alexandrovna, and that he had given to Olga as a present.Perry & Pleshakov, The Flight of the Romanovs, p. 71.Van der Kiste, The Romanovs 1818‚Äì1959, p. 166. The Dowager Tsarina Maria Feodorovna recognized the jewels and had Olga removed from the ball.Papi, Jewels of the Romanovs: Family & Court, p. 162. In the subsequent scandal, Paul was moved to a different regimental command and Eric von Pistohlkors was sent away, but it was already too late. Olga was pregnant with Paul's child. She gave birth to a son, Vladimir, in January 1897, and Eric von Pistohlkors asked for a divorce.Lee & Davidson, Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich, p. 158. Grand Duke Paul wanted to recognize the child, who had been born legally as Eric von Pistohlkors' son, and to marry Olga, but Tsar Nicholas II and Grand Duke Vladimir vehemently opposed their union. Grand Duke Paul turned his back on his family; he lost interest in Maria and Dmitri and instead spent long periods abroad with his mistress. In 1900, he bought a mansion in Bois de Boulogne, that previously belonged to Princess Zenaida Ivanovna Yusupova, intending to settle there and marry Olga once she would obtain a divorce. Paul's brother, Grand Duke Vladimir, made him swear a solemn oath that he would not marry Olga.Zeepvat, Romanov Autumn, p. 200. With this assurance, Olga's divorce was granted in 1902. Things complicated further when, in August that same year, Paul's niece, Grand Duchess Elena Vladimirovna, married Prince Nicholas of Greece, Paul's former brother-in-law. It was the first time that Paul's former father-in-law, King George of Greece, came to Russia since the death of his daughter Alexandra. Their meeting was very uncomfortable. After the wedding celebrations were over, Paul left for Italy where Olga awaited him. Paul was determined to marry Olga, defying the strong family opposition, particularly of his brother Sergei and his sister-in-law, Elisabeth, who begged him to reconsider and think about his children and his responsibilities in Russia. The relationship with his brother Sergei and his sister-in-law Elisabeth, so close before, never recovered. On 10 October 1902, Grand Duke Paul married Olga in a Greek Orthodox church in Livorno, Italy. Because he married morganatically and without the Tsar's permission, Grand Duke Paul was banished from Russia; he was dismissed from his military commissions; all his properties were seized, and his brother Grand Duke Sergei was appointed as guardian of Maria and Dmitri.Perry & Pleshakov, The Flight of the Romanovs, p. 72.Zeepvat, Romanov Autumn, p. 201. Exile Grand Duke Paul with his children by his first marriage: Dimitri and Maria Pavlovna. Paris, 1914 Grand Duke Paul and his second wife were still vacationing in Italy when they were banished from Russia.Vassiliev, Beauty in Exile, p. 435. They settled in Boulogne-sur-Seine where a daughter, Irina, was born on .Van der Kiste, The Romanovs 1818‚Äì1959, p. 168.Vassiliev, Beauty in Exile, p. 437. In 1904, Grand Duke Paul arranged, through Luitpold, Prince Regent of Bavaria, for his wife and their children to be granted the hereditary title of Count and Countesses de Hohenfelsen with a coat of arms. With the assassination of his brother Sergei in February 1905, Grand Duke Paul was allowed to return to Russia for the funeral, but Olga was denied entrance that April to attend the promotion of her son Alexander Pistohlkors as an army officer. Paul claimed the custody of Marie and Dmitri, but the Tsar made Elizabeth their guardian. From then on, Grand Duke Paul was allowed to visit his children from his first marriage, but not to return to Russia permanently with his second wife. On 5 December that same year, Grand Duke Paul and Olga had another daughter, Natalia, completing their family. Although an outcast to the Romanovs, Grand Duke Paul had a happy life in Paris with Olga and their three children. They lived in style employing a household staff of sixteen maids, gardeners, cooks, and tutors and they were avid art and old porcelain collectors. At their mansion in Boulogne- sur-Seine, they had a hectic social life offering dinners and lavish receptions entertaining writers, artist and Russian abroad. The couple was very close to their three children, and on Sundays, the whole family attended private mass at the Russian church on rue Daru. Although he was not consulted in the engagement of his daughter Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna to Prince Wilhem of Sweden, Paul attended the wedding on . That same year, Grand Duke Paul, Olga and their three children visited Russia together for the first time. Shortly after, they returned to Paris but their son, Vladimir, stayed in Russia and became a student in the Corps des Pages.Van der Kiste, The Romanovs 1818‚Äì1959, p. 182.Zeepvat, Romanov Autumn, p. 202. In 1912, on the occasion of Dmitri reaching his majority, Tsar Nicholas II, finally relented and pardoned his only surviving uncle, restoring Grand Duke Paul titles and privileges. He also recognized as valid Paul's second marriage.Lee & Davidson, Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich, p. 160. However, Grand Duke Paul decided to remain living in France. In 1913, Paul visited Russia, once again, to take part in the celebration for the 300th anniversary of the Romanov family on the Russian throne. Grand Duke Paul moved back permanently to Russia only when he finished a house for himself and his family at Tsarskoe Selo in May 1914.Van der Kiste, The Romanovs 1818‚Äì1959, p. 183. World War I Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich and his second family. From left to right: Princess Olga Paley, Princess Irina Paley, Prince Vladimir Paley, Princess Natalia Paley, and Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich, 1916. At the out break of World War I, Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich's two sons, Dmitri and Vladimir, joined the war effort and his daughter, Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna, became an army nurse. In August 1915, the Tsar granted Paul's wife, Olga, the title of Princess Paley with the style of Serene Highness, and their children also became Prince Vladimir Pavlovich Paley and Princesses Irina Pavlovna and Natalia Pavlovna Paley.Papi, Jewels of the Romanovs: Family & Court, p. 174.Zeepvat, Romanov Autumn, p. 203. In the same month, Prince Vladimir Paley joined a regiment. Although he had been away from active service for many years and his health was frail, Grand Duke Paul begged his nephew, Tsar Nicholas II, to give him an active military appointment in the battle fields. By that time, Paul was, once again, one of the few members of the extended Romanov family on good terms with the Empress Alexandra Feodorovna. Through her intervention, Nicholas II placed Paul in command of the First Corps of the Imperial Guard in 1915.Lee & Davidson, Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich, p. 161. However, before he could assume his military appointment, Paul felt gravely ill with gall bladder troubled. It was feared that he had cancer and he spent the fall and the winter of 1915-1916 sick. It was only after he recovered many months later, in May 1916, that Grand Duke Paul, ignoring his doctor's advice, left to take command of the 1st Guards Corps. He served with the rank of General of Cavalry.Chavchavadze, The Grand Dukes, p. 129. After a difficult spell at the front under heavy enemy bombardment at the village of Sokoul, he was awarded a St George's Cross 4th class, one of the most coveted military decorations.Lee & Davidson, Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich, p. 163. Due to his bad health, the grand duke was moved, in September 1916, to a new appointment as inspector general of the Guard at the Tsar's headquarters and his son, Vladimir, was placed under his orders.Princess Paley, Memories of Russia. Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich (the tallest man in the group) and his son, Vladimir (the young man without mustache), during the war In the autumn of 1916, Paul took a three-week holiday in Crimea with his wife and children. On his way back north, in November, he visited the Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna in Kiev. Maria Feodorovna and her son-in-law, Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich, enlisted Paul's help in order to persuade Nicholas II and his wife of the need for change and to get rid of Rasputin's damaging influence.Van der Kiste, The Romanovs 1818‚Äì1959, p. 188. Grand Duke Paul had an audience with the Tsar and Tsarina in December. He handled the issue with tact, but without success.Van der Kiste, The Romanovs 1818‚Äì1959, p. 189. Nevertheless, he was able to retain Nicholas II and Alexandra's confidence even after it was shaken with Paul's son Dmitri's involvement in Rasputin's murder in the early hours of . Paul, who was at Stavka with Nicholas II when both received news of the event, was horrified of his son's participation in the murder.Van der Kiste, The Romanovs 1818‚Äì1959, p. 190. The Grand Duke supported his son and wrote a letter to the Tsar asking for clemency for Dmitri. Nevertheless, after spending some time under house arrest, Dmitri was sent to the Persian front as a form of exile. On , Alexandra summoned Paul and asked him to go to the front and gather some troops to save the throne. He declined, convinced that it was going to be a fruitless endeavor. Instead, with the assistance of Prince Michael Putiatin and the lawyer Nicholas Ivanov, Grand Duke Paul drafted a manifesto introducing the idea of a constitutional monarchy with Nicholas II remaining as an Emperor.Perry & Pleshakov, The Flight of the Romanovs, p. 148. It was signed by Paul, Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich and Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich, the three most senior grand dukes in the last period of Imperial Russia. The manifesto was then delivered to the Duma to be presented for the Tsar's signature on March 1, at Nicholas II's return from headquarters. However, before that, the Tsar's train was held up and Nicholas II abdicated on 2 March. It fell upon Grand Duke Paul to inform Alexandra of Nicholas II's abdication on 3 March.Van der Kiste, The Romanovs 1818‚Äì1959, p. 194. Revolution  Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich At the fall of the Russian monarchy in March 1917, Grand Duke Paul, his wife, and their children remained united living at their luxurious estate in Tsarkoe Selo amid the upheaval.Lee & Davidson, Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich, p. 164. As Tsar Nicholas II and his family were sent to internal exile in Siberia, the Provisional Government, led by Alexander Kerensky, placed Paul under house arrest on .Van der Kiste, The Romanovs 1818‚Äì1959, p. 197. His telephone line was cut and a squad of soldiers guarded all the exits to his home.Van der Kiste, The Romanovs 1818‚Äì1959, p. 196. Through the intervention of his daughter, Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna of Russia, whose second wedding he was not able to attend, the guards in charge of overseeing his house were removed. The lives of the Romanovs deteriorated sharply after the Bolsheviks rose to power in October 1917. On , Grand Duke Paul's house was ransacked and his firearms collection was taken away.Zeepvat, Romanov Autumn, p. 204. Paul was arrested and held for two weeks at the Bolsheviks' headquarters in the Smolny Institute. He was going to be incarcerated at the Peter and Paul Fortress, but the Grand Duke protested. He was treated well by his captors, who addressed him as \\"Comrade Highness\\". Due to his frail health, he was released and returned to live in Tsarskoe Selo with his family.Zeepvat, The Camera and the Tsars, p. 207. The Bolshevik Government confiscated all property held by the banks on 27 December. Grand Duke Paul, who had deposited all the jewelry he had inherited from his parents in the banks, under his wife's name, lost all his fortune.Papi, Jewels of the Romanovs: Family & Court, p. 175. By early January 1918, Grand Duke Paul and his family could no longer afford to heat their large Tsarskoe Selo palace and they were forced to move to a nearby English dacha that belonged to his nephew, Grand Duke Boris Vladimirovich.Van der Kiste, The Romanovs 1818‚Äì1959, p. 199. Shortly after they moved out, their home was expropriated and turned into a museum, while Lenin himself rode in their car.Hall, The English Dacha at Tsarkoe Selo, p. 28. In March 1918, all male members of the Romanov family, including Paul's son, Vladimir, were ordered to register at Cheka headquarters and shortly after they were sent away into internal Russian exile.Perry & Pleshakov, The Flight of the Romanovs, pp. 207‚Äì208. They never saw Vladimir again. He was murdered by the Bolsheviks, along with several other Romanov relatives, on 18 July 1918 in a mine shaft near Alapayevsk, one day after the murder of Tsar Nicholas II and his immediate family at Yekaterinburg.Van der Kiste, The Romanovs 1818‚Äì1959, p. 198. Grand Duke Paul, who was too ill to travel, initially escaped the fate of his son. Although under constant harassment, Grand Duke Paul continued living a simple life with his wife and their two daughters at Grand Duke Boris's dacha.Hall, The English Dacha at Tsarkoe Selo, p. 27. It was difficult to find provisions, but as the Grand Duke suffered from a stomach ulcer, he was kept on a strict diet. On , Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna came to say farewell to her father. She and her husband, Prince Sergei Putiatin, fled Russia through Ukraine. A week later, Grand Duke Paul was offered, through the Danish Ambassador, Harald Scavenius, to be smuggled out of the country and taken to Vienna wearing an Austrian uniform with a convoy of returning prisoners of war. The Grand Duke flatly refused, preferring to die rather than put on an enemy uniform. Murder Determined to round up the last Grand Dukes remaining on Russian soil, the Bolsheviks arrested Grand Duke Paul at 3 a.m. on .Van der Kiste, The Romanovs 1818‚Äì1959, p. 200. He was taken to the local Soviet, housed in Grand Duke Vladimir's Tsarkoe Selo villa. The next morning, he was sent to Spalernaia prison, where he would remain for most of his incarceration. His cousins, Grand Dukes Dimitri Konstantinovich, Nicholas Mikhailovich and George Mikhailovich, were already imprisoned there.Zeepvat, Romanov Autumn, p. 218. Trubetskoy bastion, St. Peter and St. Paul Fortress, outside courtyard, 1920 The four Grand Dukes, all men in their fifties, each had their own cell, by .Marie Georgievna, A Romanov Diary, p. 218. Their days began at 7 a.m., when they were awakened by the steps in the hall of their jailers and the clank of their keys in the door. Lunch was served at noon, which consisted of dirty hot water with a few fish bones in it and black bread.Marie Georgievna, A Romanov Diary, p. 230. The lights were turned on in the cells at 7 p.m., although as the winter approached, the prisoners had to sit in darkness until that time. During the short time they were given to exercise, the Grand Dukes were able to exchange a few words. Paul's wife was allowed to visit him twice a week, staying from 1 p.m. to 6 p.m. She did all she could to have him released. Queen Alexandrine of Denmark, a niece of Grand Dukes Nicholas and George Mikahilovich, tried unsuccessfully to obtain the release of her Romanov relatives through the intervention of Harald Scavenius, the Danish Minister in Petrograd.Hall, Danish efforts to Help the Imprisoned Romanovs, pp. 38‚Äì40. On 6 December, as the Grand Duke's health, already bad, declined sharply, he was transferred to the prison hospital on the island of Goloday.Hall, Danish efforts to Help the Imprisoned Romanovs, p. 39. Before he left, he was allowed to say goodbye to his young daughters, Irina and Natalia. Shortly afterwards, Princess Paley arranged for the two girls to be smuggled into Finland. They never saw their father again. On Christmas Day, according to the old calendar, Princess Paley arrived at the hospital as usual to see her husband and bring him food. There was a new director, and the Princess was treated roughly. She was allowed to see her husband only briefly. It was their last time together.Van der Kiste, The Romanovs 1818‚Äì1959, p. 201. Princess Paley continued making desperate attempts to have her husband released through the intervention of Maxim Gorky.Perry & Pleshakov, The Flight of the Romanovs, p. 208. On 27 January 1919, Grand Duke Paul was taken to Cheka headquarters and then transferred to another prison, Gorochovaia.Van der Kiste, The Romanovs 1818‚Äì1959, p. 202. He was kept there until 10 p.m., when he was driven to the St. Peter and St. Paul Fortress. Paul's three cousins, Grand Dukes Nicholas Michailovich, George Michailovich and Dimitri Constantinovich, were taken there directly from Spalernaia prison. The four Grand Dukes were then locked up in the dungeons of Troubetskoy Bastion. At 3 a.m. on the following day, the four Grand Dukes were taken outside the fortress and stripped to the waist, despite the fact that it was almost .Lee & Davidson, Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich, p. 165. His three cousins were each escorted, with a soldier on each side, towards a trench that had been dug in the courtyard.Cockfield, White Crow, p. 245. The fusillade of shots sent them reeling into the trench, joining thirteen other bodies in the mass grave. Grand Duke Paul, who was too emaciated and too sick to stand, was carried on a stretcher. Before he was murdered, he was heard saying ¬´Lord, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing¬ª. He was killed shortly afterwards. Grand Dukes Paul, Michael, George and Dmitri were buried in a mass grave in the Fortress, the Bolsheviks having refused the distraught Princess Paley the right to bury her husband. On 31 January 1919, The Petrograd Pravda published the news about the execution of the four Grand Dukes. In 1981, Grand Duke Paul was canonized by the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad as a holy martyr. In 1999, he was rehabilitated by the Prosecutor General's Office of Russia. Ancestry Notes References * Alexander, Grand Duke of Russia. Once a Grand Duke.

It was nominated for two Academy Awards, winning Best Original Song for Michel Legrand's \\"The Windmills of Your Mind\\". A remake was released in 1999, and a second remake was in development stages . Plot Millionaire businessman- sportsman Thomas Crown (Steve McQueen) accomplishes a perfect crime by orchestrating four men to steal $2,660,527.62 from a Boston bank, along with a fifth man who drives the getaway car with the money and dumps it in a cemetery trash can. None of the men ever meets Crown face to face, nor do they know or meet each other before the robbery. Crown retrieves the money from the trash can after secretly following the driver of the getaway car. He deposits the money into an anonymous Swiss bank account in Geneva, making several trips, never depositing the money all at once so as to not draw undue attention to his actions. Independent insurance investigator Vicki Anderson (Faye Dunaway) is contracted to investigate the heist; she will receive 10% of the stolen money if she recovers it. When Thomas first comes to her attention as a possible suspect, she intuitively recognizes him as the mastermind behind the robbery, and shortly thereafter guesses that he organized the robbers so none of the men knew him or met each other. Thomas does not need the money, and in fact masterminded the robbery as a game. Vicki makes it clear to him that she knows that he is the thief and that she intends to prove it. They start a game of cat and mouse, with the attraction between them evident. Their relationship soon evolves into an affair, complicated by Vicki's vow to find the money and help Detective Eddie Malone (Paul Burke) bring the guilty party to justice. A reward offer entices the wife of the bank robbery's getaway driver, Erwin Weaver (Jack Weston), to \\"fink\\" on him. Vicki finds out that he was hired by a man he never saw, but whose voice he heard (via a microphone). She tries putting Erwin in the same room as Thomas, but there is no hint of recognition on either one's part. However, while Vicki is clearly closing in on Thomas, using the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) as leverage against his liquid assets, he forces her to realize she is also becoming hemmed-in by her emotions. When she seemingly persuades him to negotiate an end, his point is proven when Eddie stubbornly refuses to make any deal. Thomas organizes another robbery exactly like the first with different accomplices and tells Vicki where the \\"drop\\" will be, because he has to know for sure that she is on his side. The robbery is successful, but there are gunshots and the viewer is left with the impression that people might have been killed, raising the stakes for Vicki's decision. Vicki and the police stake out the cemetery, where they watch one of the robbers make the drop, and they wait for Thomas to arrive so they can arrest him. When his Rolls Royce arrives, however, she sees that Thomas has sent a messenger in his place, with a telegram asking her to bring the money and join him‚Äîor else keep the Rolls Royce. She tears the telegram to bits and throws the pieces to the wind, looking up at the sky with tears in her eyes. Crown flies away in a jet.

The use of split screens to show simultaneous actions was inspired by the breakthrough Expo 67 films In the Labyrinth and A Place to Stand, the latter of which pioneered the use of Christopher Chapman's \\"multi-dynamic image technique\\", images shifting on moving panes. Steve McQueen was on hand for an advance screening of A Place to Stand in Hollywood and personally told Chapman he was highly impressed; the following year, Norman Jewison had incorporated the technique into the film, inserting the scenes into the already finished product. The film also features a chess scene, with McQueen and Dunaway playing a game of chess, silently flirting with each other. The game depicted is based on a game played in Vienna in 1898 between Gustav Zeissl and Walter von Walthoffen. McQueen undertook his own stunts, which include playing polo and driving a dune buggy at high speed along the Massachusetts coastline. This was similar to his starring role in the movie Bullitt, released a few months afterwards, in which he drove a Ford Mustang through San Francisco at more than . In an interview, McQueen would later say this was his favorite film. The car driven by Dunaway, referred to as \\"one of those red Italian things,\\" is the first of only ten Ferrari 275 GTB/4S NART Spiders built. Today, this model is one of the most valuable Ferrari road cars of all time. McQueen liked the car very much, and eventually managed to acquire one for himself. The dune buggy was a Meyers Manx, built in California on a VW beetle floor pan with a hopped-up Chevrolet Corvair engine. McQueen owned one, and the Manx, the original dune buggy, was often copied. Crown's two-door Rolls-Royce Silver Shadow carried Massachusetts vanity license tag \\"TC 100\\" for the film. Sean Connery had been the original choice for the title role, but turned it down‚Äîa decision he later regretted. In the 1999 remake, the title role was portrayed by another actor who had portrayed James Bond, Pierce Brosnan. A second remake is underway with Michael B. Jordan in the title role. Filming locations The movie was filmed primarily on location in Boston and surrounding areas in Massachusetts and New Hampshire: * Second Harrison Gray Otis House at 85 Mt. Vernon St. on Beacon Hill, designed by Massachusetts State House architect Charles Bulfinch in 1800 for Congressman Harrison Gray Otis, was Thomas Crown's residence. * The robbery occurred in what was then the Beverly National Bank (fictitiously renamed Boston Mercantile Bank for the film), at the North Beverly Plaza, Beverly, Massachusetts, and 55 Congress St., Boston. The current location is noted as 44 Water Street, the offices of private investment firm Brown Brothers. The interiors were renovated and partially restored in 1999 by the firm GHK, Malcolm Higbee-Glace, Project Manager * A scene of the car theft was filmed in downtown Beverly across from City Hall * The money-dumpings were shot in Cambridge Cemetery, Coolidge Ave., Cambridge * The polo sequences were filmed at the Myopia Hunt Club, 435 Bay Road, South Hamilton * The golf sequences were filmed at the Belmont Country Club, 181 Winter St., Belmont * The auctions took place in the St. James Ballroom at the Eben Jordan Mansion, 46 Beacon St., Beacon Hill * Thomas drove his dune buggy on Crane Beach in Ipswich, Massachusetts * The Schweizer SGS 1-23H glider was flown at Salem, New Hampshire. by Roy McMaster (not Steve McQueen) * The meat shop scene took place at Blackstone and North streets in Boston's North End * Thomas and Vicki walked in the rain in Copp's Hill Cemetery in Boston's North End * Thomas and Vicki kissed (wearing formal dress) at the top of Acorn Street on Beacon Hill, a narrow, cobblestoned lane often called \\"the most photographed street in America\\" Other locations included: * the Allston-Brighton tollbooths (demolished in 2016) on the Massachusetts Turnpike * Anthony's Pier 4 restaurant at 140 Northern Ave. in South Boston's Seaport District * the Boston Common * the old Boston Police Headquarters on Berkeley Street (since renovated as the Loews Boston Hotel) * Cambridge Street and Linden Avenue, Allston * Copp's Hill Terrace in Boston's North End * the North End Greenmarket * South Station, 700 Atlantic Ave., Boston * the Tobin Bridge * the Prudential Tunnel portion of the Massachusetts Turnpike going under Huntington Avenue (then-future Massachusetts Route 9)‚Äîyears before the Westin Hotel in Copley Square and the parking garage on Clarendon Street were built over the toll highway in a scene where McQueen was driving the getaway car * the then-Dewey Square Tunnel (future Interstate 93) where McQueen emerged onto the Massachusetts Turnpike‚Äîa feat technically impossible since McQueen drove into the Prudential Tunnel one scene earlier * the Marliave Restaurant rooftop dining area, Bosworth Street, Boston where Dunaway is shown surveillance photos by Burke of McQueen kissing another woman * the footpath on the Cambridge side of the Charles River, between the Weeks Footbridge and the Anderson Bridge * Dulles International Airport, Virginia, with signage making it look as though it were in Boston Release The Thomas Crown Affair had its world premiere in Boston on June 19, 1968, with openings in Los Angeles and New York on June 26, 1968 and a nationwide release in August 1968. =Home media= The film was released on DVD by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in the United States in February 1999 with two special features, an audio commentary by director Norman Jewison and theatrical trailer. It was first released on Blu- ray Disc on February 1, 2011 with the same extra supplements. On February 13, 2018 Kino Lorber released a Blu-ray 50th anniversary edition with six extra features including an original featurette with cast and crew interviews, audio commentary by Film Historian Lem Dobbs and Nick Redman and an interview with the director. Reception =Box office= The film was successful at the box office, grossing $14 million on a $4.3 million budget. =Critical response= Reviews at the time were mixed. Critics praised the chemistry between McQueen and Dunaway and Norman Jewison's stylish direction, but considered the plotting and writing rather thin. Roger Ebert gave it 2 stars out of four and called it \\"possibly the most under-plotted, underwritten, over-photographed film of the year. Which is not to say it isn't great to look at. It is.\\" The film won the Academy Award for Best Original Song for \\"The Windmills of Your Mind\\" by Michel Legrand (music), Marilyn Bergman and Alan Bergman (lyrics). It was also nominated for Original Music Score. The Thomas Crown Affair made its US television premiere on NBC Saturday Night at the Movies in September 1972. Soundtrack The music was composed and conducted by Michel Legrand, scoring his first major American film. Director Norman Jewison had hoped to hire Henry Mancini for the project, but he was unavailable and recommended Legrand; he wrote his music as long pieces rather than specifically to scene timings, with the film later edited to the music by Legrand, Jewison and editor Hal Ashby. In addition, Legrand also had to prepare an original song to replace \\"Strawberry Fields Forever,\\" used as the temporary track for the glider scene. Taking Quincy Jones' advice, Legrand worked with the Bergmans to compose \\"The Windmills of Your Mind\\" and a second song, \\"His Eyes, Her Eyes\\"; Noel Harrison recorded \\"The Windmills of Your Mind\\" after Jewison failed to get his friend Andy Williams to do it, while Legrand performed \\"His Eyes, Her Eyes\\". While the film's score was recorded in Hollywood, featuring Vincent DeRosa, Bud Shank, Ray Brown and Shelly Manne, the album re-recording issued by United Artists Records on LP was done in France under the composer's baton; Jewison said it was the favourite score for any of his films.St√©phane Lerouge, \\"Michel Legrand: The Windmills of His Mind,\\" liner notes, expanded MGM motion picture soundtrack, Quartet QR 158 The original album was later reissued by Rykodisc in 1998 on compact disc, with five dialogue excerpts and the inclusion of \\"Moments Of Love\\" and \\"Doubting Thomas.\\" Var√®se Sarabande re-released the album in 2004 (without the dialogue excerpts).

The original film's co-star Faye Dunaway also appears as Crown's therapist. This version is different from the original in that it is set in New York rather than Boston and the robbery is of a priceless painting instead of cash, amongst other story line differences, including the complete lack of violence in Thomas Crown's crimes. In 2016, The Hollywood Reporter announced that MGM is remaking the film for the second time. Michael B. Jordan will star. The Russo brothers will produce the film.

It is preceded by \\"Run Like Hell\\" and followed by \\"Stop\\". Composition and plot At this point in the album, protagonist Pink has lost hope (\\"You cannot reach me now\\") and his thinking has decayed, bringing to mind the \\"worms\\". In his hallucination, he is a fascist dictator, fomenting racist outrage and violence, as begun in the preceding song, \\"Run Like Hell\\". The count-in is ‚ÄîGerman for \\"one, two, three, everybody\\". In the beginning and end the crowd chants, \\"Hammer\\", a recurring representation of fascism and violence in The Wall. The song is a slow, leaden march in G Major, begun with David Gilmour and Roger Waters alternating calm and strident voices, respectively. Waters takes over with an extended vamp on A minor, musically similar to the album's earlier \\"The Happiest Days of Our Lives\\". Through a megaphone, he barks forceful invectives (\\"Waiting to put on a black shirt ... for the queers and the coons and the reds and the Jews\\"). After an extended rant, Gilmour's calmer voice returns, with the promise that his followers will \\"see Britannia rule again\\" and \\"send our coloured cousins home again,\\" with Waters concluding \\"All you need to do is follow the worms!\\" Finally, the song changes into a minor-key musical theme: root, major second, minor third, major second‚Äîthat has recurred throughout the album, as the main theme to \\"Another Brick in the Wall\\", the instrumental section of \\"Hey You\\", and will be heard in the album's climax, \\"The Trial\\". The riff is repeated in E minor, with E minor and D Major chords played atop it on keyboards. From the megaphone, Waters's rant lapses into incomprehensibility, while the music and the crowd's chanting grows louder. Finally, the song abruptly halts with a shout of \\"Stop!\\" Film version The imagery features a live action segment with some teenagers (the same ones from \\"In the Flesh?\\") running over a rag doll replica of Pink. He then shouts through a megaphone while his followers march through the street. Following the images of the fascist crowd, the screaming face and a fascist breaking a man's skull from \\"What Shall We Do Now?\\", a dog biting meat off a hook then consumed by a larger one (from the Animals tour), and the famous goose-stepping hammer sequence, we see Pink yell \\"Stop\\". Concerts In the concerts of The Wall, a member of Pink Floyd, often Waters, would wear a leather trenchcoat. Gilmour would provide the high pitched \\"Ooooh, you cannot reach me now, ooooooh!\\" The song would build up until the lights extinguish in preparation to introduce the \\"Pink puppet\\" that sings \\"Stop\\". The marching hammers animation would be displayed on a circular screen above the stage during concerts. Later concerts, performed by Waters after his departure from the band, featured a similar scene. Backing singers provided Gilmour's lines, and, in the 2010-2013 tour of The Wall, ending with the marching hammers filling the entire wall. =Animation= The full, uncut animation shown at the concert begins with a cartoon image of a hill. On top of the hill are indistinct objects, moving. Suddenly, as the guitar leitmotif plays briefly, the sky goes dark grey, a symbol of evil. The scene scrolls down to reveal London being enveloped in darkness as \\"Would you like to see...\\" and the rest of the verse is sung. Then, an abandoned tricycle is shown, as \\"Would you like to send...\\" and the rest of that verse is sung. An abandoned playground is shown as the final verse is sung. Then a viaduct appears, where something is goose-stepping. At long last it is revealed that the objects on the hill, what possibly scared the children and what was under the viaduct, are marching hammers. As the fascist dictator shows increasing desperation, louder and angrier, there is a whip pan in to the hammers, and as the camera pans there is a sudden, loud, abrupt instrumental sound, which is quickly replaced by a piano. The animation stops, as the song \\"Stop\\" begins. Reaction * Jorge Sacido Romero and Luis Miguel Varela Cabo opined that \\"Waiting for the Worms\\" represented Waters' fears of a \\"potential ideological drift towards an ultranationalist, imperialist and racist stand that calls for the resurrection of a Britannia that is both pure and almighty.\\" * In 2010, Dublin band Twinkranes covered the song for a Mojo magazine tribute album.

Every country, even those not party to the Chicago Convention, has an NAA whose functions include the registration of civil aircraft. An aircraft can only be registered once, in one jurisdiction, at a time. The NAA allocates a unique alphanumeric string to identify the aircraft, which also indicates the nationality (i.e., country of registrationArticle 17 of the Chicago Convention) of the aircraft, and provides a legal document called a Certificate of Registration, one of the documents which must be carried when the aircraft is in operation.Article 29 of the Chicago Convention The registration identifier must be displayed prominently on the aircraft.Article 20 of the Chicago Convention Most countries also require the registration identifier to be imprinted on a permanent fireproof plate mounted on the fuselage in case of a post-fire/post-crash aircraft accident investigation. Most nations' military aircraft typically use tail codes and serial numbers. Military aircraft most often are not assigned civil registration codes. However, government-owned non-military civil aircraft (for example, aircraft of the United States Department of Homeland Security) are assigned civil registrations. Although each aircraft registration identifier is unique, some countries allow it to be re-used when the aircraft has been sold, destroyed or retired. For example, N3794N is assigned to a Mooney M20F. It had been previously assigned to a Beechcraft Bonanza (specifically, the aircraft in which Buddy Holly was killed). An individual aircraft may be assigned different registrations during its existence. This can be because the aircraft changes ownership, jurisdiction of registration, or in some cases for vanity reasons. Choice of aircraft registry Most often, aircraft are registered in the jurisdiction in which the carrier is resident or based, and may enjoy preferential rights or privileges as a flag carrier for international operations. Carriers in emerging markets may be required to register aircraft in an offshore jurisdiction where they are leased or purchased but financed by banks in major onshore financial centres. The financing institution may be reluctant to allow the aircraft to be registered in the carrier's home country (either because it does not have sufficient regulation governing civil aviation, or because it feels the courts in that country would not cooperate fully if it needed to enforce any security interest over the aircraft), and the carrier is reluctant to have the aircraft registered in the financier's jurisdiction (often the United States or the United Kingdom) either because of personal or political reasons, or because they fear spurious lawsuits and potential arrest of the aircraft. International standards Registration JA8089 on a Japan Airlines Boeing 747-400 The first use of aircraft registrations was based on the radio callsigns allocated at the London International Radiotelegraphic Conference in 1913. The format was a single letter prefix followed by four other letters (like A-BCDE). The major nations operating aircraft were allocated a single letter prefix. Smaller countries had to share a single letter prefix, but were allocated exclusive use of the first letter of the suffix. This was modified by agreement by the International Bureau at Berne and published on April 23, 1913. Although initial allocations were not specifically for aircraft but for any radio user, the International Air Navigation Convention held in Paris in 1919 (Paris Convention of 1919) made allocations specifically for aircraft registrations, based on the 1913 callsign list. The agreement stipulated that the nationality marks were to be followed by a hyphen then a group of four letters that must include a vowel (and for the convention Y was considered to be a vowel). This system operated until the adoption of the revised system in 1928. The International Radiotelegraph Convention at Washington in 1927 revised the list of markings. These were adopted from 1928 and are the basis of the currently used registrations. The markings have been amended and added to over the years, and the allocations and standards have since 1947 been managed by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). Article 20 of the Convention on International Civil Aviation (Chicago Convention), signed in 1944, requires that all aircraft engaged in international air navigation bears its appropriate nationality and registration marks. Upon the completion of the necessary procedures, the aircraft receives its unique \\"registration\\", which must be displayed prominently on the aircraft. Annex 7 to the Chicago Convention describes the definitions, location, and measurement of nationality and registration marks. The aircraft registration is made up of a prefix selected from the country's callsign prefix allocated by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) (making the registration a quick way of determining the country of origin) and the registration suffix. Depending on the country of registration, this suffix is a numeric or alphanumeric code, and consists of one to five characters. A supplement to Annex 7 provides an updated list of approved nationality and common marks used by various countries. Country-specific usage Air France Airbus A318 displaying registration F-GUGJ on the wing undersurface and the last two letters of the registration, GJ, on the nose wheel doors A Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner displaying Air India registration VT-ANG on the wing undersurface, on the nose wheel doors and on the rear fuselage While the Chicago convention sets out the country-specific prefixes used in registration marks, and makes provision for the ways they are used in international civil aviation and displayed on aircraft, individual countries also make further provision for their formats and the use of registration marks for intranational flight. When painted on the aircraft's fuselage, the prefix and suffix are usually separated by a dash (for example, YR-BMA). When entered in a flight plan, the dash is omitted (for example, YRBMA). In some countries that use a number suffix rather than letters, like the United States (N), South Korea (HL), and Japan (JA), the prefix and suffix are connected without a dash. Aircraft flying privately usually use their registration as their radio callsign, but many aircraft flying in commercial operations (especially charter, cargo, and airlines) use the ICAO airline designator or a company callsign. Some countries will permit an aircraft that will not be flown into the airspace of another country to display the registration with the country prefix omitted - for example, gliders registered in Australia commonly display only the three-letter unique mark, without the \\"VH-\\" national prefix. Some countries also operate a separate registry system, or use a separate group of unique marks, for gliders, ultralights, and/or other less-common types of aircraft. For example, Germany and Switzerland both use lettered suffixes (in the form D-xxxx and HB- xxx respectively) for most forms of flight-craft but numbers (D-nnnn and HB- nnn) for unpowered gliders. Many other nations register gliders in subgroups beginning with the letter G, such as Norway with LN-Gxx and New Zealand with ZK-Gxx. =United States= In the United States, the registration number is commonly referred to as an \\"N\\" number, because all aircraft registered there have a number starting with the letter N. An alphanumeric system is used because of the large numbers of aircraft registered in the United States. An N-number begins with a run of one or more numeric digits, may end with one or two alphabetic letters, may only consist of one to five characters in total, and must start with a digit other than zero. In addition, N-numbers may not contain the letters I or O, due to their similarities with the numerals 1 and 0. Each alphabetic letter in the suffix can have one of 24 discrete values, while each numeric digit can be one of 10, except the first, which can take on only one of nine values. This yields a total of 915,399 possible registration numbers in the namespace, though certain combinations are reserved either for government use or for other special purposes. With so many possible calls, radio shortcuts are used. Normally when flying entirely within the United States, an aircraft would not identify itself starting with \\"N\\", since that is assumed. Also, after initial contact is made with an aircraft control site, only the last two or three characters are typically used. The following are the combinations that could be used: * N1 to N9: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) internal use only * N10 to N99: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) internal use only * N100 to N999 * N1000 to N9999 * N10000 to N99999 * N1A to N9Z * N10A to N99Z * N100A to N999Z * N1000A to N9999Z * N1AA to N9ZZ * N10AA to N99ZZ * N100AA to N999ZZ U.S. \\"N-number\\" An older aircraft (registered before 31 December 1948) may have a second letter in its identifier, identifying the category of aircraft. This additional letter is not actually part of the aircraft identification (e.g. NC12345 is the same registration as N12345). Aircraft category letters have not been included on any registration numbers issued since 1 January 1949, but they still appear on antique aircraft for authenticity purposes. The categories were: *C = airline, commercial and private *G = glider *L = limited *R = restricted (such as cropdusters and racing aircraft) *S = state *X = experimental For example, N-X-211, the Ryan NYP aircraft flown by Charles Lindbergh as the Spirit of St. Louis was registered in the experimental category. There is a unique overlap in the United States with aircraft having a single number followed by two letters and radio call signs issued by the Federal Communications Commission to Amateur Radio operators holding the Amateur Extra class license. For example, N4YZ is, on the one hand, a Cessna 206 registered to a private individual in California, while, on the other hand, is also issued to an Amateur Radio operator in North Carolina.  Decolonisation and independence The impact of decolonisation and independence on aircraft registration schemes has varied from place to place. Most countries, upon independence, have had a new allocation granted ‚Äì in most cases this is from the new country's new ITU allocation, but neither is it uncommon for the new country to be allocated a subset of their former colonial power's allocation. For example, after partition in 1947, India retained the VT designation it had received as part of the British Empire's Vx series allocation, while Pakistan adopted the AP designation from the newly allocated ITU callsigns APA-ASZ. When this happens it is usually the case that aircraft will be re-registered into the new series retaining as much of the suffix as is possible. For example, when in 1929 the British Dominions at the time established their own aircraft registers, marks were reallocated as follows: * Canada: G-Cxxx to CF-xxx, then expanded to C-Fxxx, C-Gxxx, and then C-Ixxx in 1974. * Australia: G-AUxx to VH-Uxx, then immediately expanded to all VH-xxx marks. * New Zealand: G-NZxx to ZK-Zxx, then immediately expanded to all ZK- xxx marks. * Newfoundland: G-Cxxx (with Canada) to VO-xxx, then re-merged with the Canadian register in 1949 to CF-xxx. * South Africa: G-UAxx to ZU-Axx, then expanded to all ZU-xxx marks, then again to current ZS-xxx, ZT-Rxx, and ZU-xxx allocations. Two oddities created by this reallocation process are the current formats used by the Special Administrative Regions of the People's Republic of China, Hong Kong and Macau, both of which were returned to PRC control from Britain in 1997 and Portugal in 1999 respectively. Hong Kong's prefix of VR-H and Macau's of CS-M, both subdivisions of their colonial powers' allocations, were replaced by China's B- prefix without the registration mark being extended, leaving aircraft from both SARs with registration marks of only four characters, as opposed to the norm of five.

Music was a central part of his youth, as his parents were also musicians, and Taggart learned to play drums at an early age. He has said the loss of R.J. Logan was a driving force to take his drumming to the next level. He auditioned for the then up- and-coming Our Lady Peace in April 1993. Career =Our Lady Peace= In 1993, Jim Newell, Our Lady Peace's previous drummer, left the band due to commitment issues. The remaining members and their management held open auditions for his replacement. They auditioned over a hundred drummers, ultimately choosing Taggart, who was 17 at the time. The band offered him the drumming position which Taggart accepted. Our Lady Peace had also recently been given a record deal with Sony Music Canada and were playing some small club shows. Taggart's age created a legal issue for the band; he was only seventeen and performers have to be legal drinking age, nineteen in Ontario, to perform in bars and clubs. In June 2014, Taggart announced that he had left Our Lady Peace. =Other projects= In addition to drumming for Our Lady Peace, Taggart has worked on various side projects, including providing the drums on Chantal Kreviazuk's song \\"Blue\\", Geddy Lee's song \\"Home on the Strange\\", and The Beautiful Unknown's song \\"Riot in the House of Ruin\\".

He was described by contemporaries as a gentle, religious person, nicknamed \\"Ioannchik\\" by his relatives. Early life Imperial Monogram of Prince Ioann Konstantinovich Ioann Konstantinovich was born as a Grand Duke of Russia with the style Imperial Highness, but at the age of 9 days, a Ukaz of his cousin Emperor Alexander III of Russia stripped him of that title, as the Ukaz amended the House Law by limiting the grand-ducal title to grandsons of a reigning emperor. As a result, he received the title Prince of the Imperial Blood (Prince of Russia) with the style Highness. He once entertained the possibility of becoming an Orthodox monk, but eventually fell in love with Princess Helen of Serbia. They married on 2 September 1911, and Helen took the name Princess Yelena Petrovna of Russia. They had a son, Prince Vsevolod Ivanovich (20 January 1914 - 18 June 1973), and a daughter, Princess Yekaterina Ivanovna (12 July 1915 - 13 March 2007), who was the last member of the Imperial Family to be born before the fall of the dynasty, and was ultimately to become the last surviving uncontested dynast of the Imperial House of Russia. Revolution and death Prince Ioann fought in the First World War, was decorated as a war hero, and was at the front when the Russian Revolution of 1917 started. In April 1918 he was exiled to the Urals by the Bolsheviks, and later murdered in July the same year in a mineshaft near Alapayevsk, along with his brothers Prince Konstantin Konstantinovich and Prince Igor Konstantinovich, his cousin Prince Vladimir Pavlovich Paley, and other relatives and friends. His body was eventually buried in Beijing, in the cemetery of the Russian Orthodox Mission, which was destroyed in 1986 to build a park. His sister Princess Vera Konstantinovna, mother Grand Duchess Yelizaveta Mavrikievna and wife Princess Yelena Petrovna left Russia in April 1919 with help from the King of Norway. His daughter Princess Yekaterina married Ruggero, Marquis Farace di Villaforesta (a descendant of the Medici family of Florence). Yekaterina lived in Buenos Aires and later in Montevideo, Uruguay where she died in 2007. His sister Princess Vera Konstantinovna, the youngest daughter of Grand Duke Konstantin Konstantinovich, died in New York in 2001, aged 94.

Under the tropical zodiac, the Sun transits this sign from approximately March 20 to April 21 each year. This time duration is exactly the first month of the Solar Hijri calendar (Arabic Hamal/Persian Farvardin/Wray). According to the tropical system of astrology, the Sun enters the sign of Aries when it reaches the March equinox, which occurs on average on March 21 (by design). Because the Earth takes approximately 365.24 days to go around the Sun, the precise time of the equinox is not the same each year, and generally will occur about six hours later from one year to the next until reset by a leap year. February 29 of a leap year causes that year's vernal equinox to fall about eighteen hours earlier‚Äîaccording to the calendar‚Äîcompared with the previous year. From 1800 to 2050 inclusive the vernal equinox date has (or will) range(d) from March 19 at 22:34 UT1 in 2048 to March 21 at 19:15 UT1 in 1903. Under the sidereal zodiac, the sun currently transits Aries from April 15 to 14 May (approximately).  Background  Aries is the first fire sign in the zodiac, the other fire signs being Leo and Sagittarius. Individuals born between these dates, depending on which system of astrology they subscribe to, may be called Arians or Ariens. The color for Aries is red. In astrology, Aries is the cardinal sign of the fire trigon. It is one of the six positive signs. The equivalent in the Hindu solar calendar is Me·π£a.  Mythology  In Greek Mythology, the symbol of the ram is based on the Chrysomallus, the flying ram that rescued Phrixus and Helle, the children of the Boeotian king Athamas and provided the Golden Fleece.

The term either pertains to semantic cues, state-dependent cues or context-dependent cues. Upon performing a search for files in a computer, its memory is scanned for words. Relevant files containing this word or string of words are displayed. This is not how memory in the human mind works. Instead, information stored in the memory is retrieved by way of association with other memories. Some memories can not be recalled by simply thinking about them. Rather, one must think about something associated with it. For example, if someone tries and fails to recollect the memories he had about a vacation he went on, and someone mentions the fact that he hired a classic car during this vacation, this may make him remember all sorts of things from that trip, such as what he ate there, where he went and what books he read. Cues =Semantic cues= An experiment from 1966 showed that people remember a group of words better if they are within the same theme category. Such words that generate recall by association are known as semantic cues. If the sound of the word is emphasized during the encoding process, a cue that could be used could also put emphasis on the phonetic quality of the word. =State-dependent cues= State-dependent cues are governed by the state of mind and being at the time of encoding. The emotional or mental state of the person, such as being inebriated, drugged, upset, anxious or happy are key cues. =Context-dependent cues= Research suggests there are also context-dependent cues which are dependent on environment and situation. In an experiment conducted in 1975, deep sea divers were divided into two groups. Each group had the same list of 36 unrelated words to learn. However, one of the groups learned these words 15 feet underwater, while the second group learned the words on land. Both groups then attempted to recall the same words underwater as well as on land. The participants who had learned the words on land recalled 38% of the words when tested on land, but only 21% of the words when underwater. The divers who had learned the words underwater recalled 21% on the beach and 32% when underwater. Memory retrieval can be facilitated or triggered by replication of the context in which the memory was encoded. Such conditions include weather, company, location, smell of a particular odor, hearing a certain song, even taste can sometimes act as a cue. For example, students sometimes fail to recall diligently studied material when an examination room's environmental conditions differ significantly from the room or place where initial learning occurred. Students may consider studying under conditions that resemble an examination center which could boost their recall during actual exams. Psychologists that have researched context dependent recall include Abernethy (1940).

According to some scholars it owes its origin to the same Order of Christ of the Knights Templar, from which came the Order of Christ that was awarded by the kings of Portugal and the emperors of Brazil. The Portuguese order had originally both a secular and religious component; by the 18th century, the religious component had died out. Dispute The papacy insisted that the right of the Portuguese monarchs to award the honour had been granted by a pope in the Papal Bull Ad ea ex quibus issued in Avignon on 14/15 March 1319. While the bull in itself does not explicitly grant to the pope the right to issue the order, successive popes since John XXII have done so. For many years the Portuguese monarchy disputed the right of the papacy to award the order, and in one famous case arrested someone for wearing the papal order. The position of the Crown of Portugal was that the only legitimate fount of honour was the Crown.Jos√© Vicente de Bragan√ßa, The Military Order of Christ and the Papal Croce di Cristo The position of the Catholic Church is that the pope is the head of every religious order and may appoint, at his discretion without the permission of its superior general, any individual he deems worthy. Senior papal order As part of the general re-organisation of papal honours in 1905 by Pope Pius X, the papal Order of Christ was made the most senior papal honour. It was traditionally awarded to Catholic heads of state, notably President √âamon de Valera of Ireland by Pope John XXIII. Restriction The usage of the order was restricted by Pope Paul VI in his 15 April 1966 Papal Bull Equestres Ordinis to Catholic heads of state to whom it might be given only to commemorate very special occasions at which the pope himself was present. It has rarely been awarded since; the last award was made by Pope John Paul II in 1987 to Fr√† Angelo de Mojana, 77th prince and grand master of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta. With the death of King Baudouin of Belgium in 1993 there are no living members of the Order of Christ.

Cape Alava is a cape in the Pacific Northwest. It is located in Clallam County, Washington, U.S., and is the westernmost point in the contiguous 48 states. It is located in Olympic National Park and the Makah Indian Reservation. Cape Alava is accessible via a 3-mile boardwalk hike from a ranger station in the park. Cape Alava Trail was designated a National Recreation Trail in 1981.  Name  The cape was named after the Spaniard Don Jos√© Manuel de √Ålava (born in Vitoria, January 1, 1743) for his role as commissioner during the solution of the conflict of Nootka in 1794.  Westernmost location Cape Alava is the westernmost point in the contiguous United States, with a longitude of (during low tide and walking out to the west side of Tskawahyah Island). Nearby Cape Flattery and Cape Blanco in southern Oregon are also very close longitudinally to being the westernmost points in the contiguous 48 states, which are at and respectively.  History  Petroglyphs at Wedding Rocks, approximately south of Cape Alava, Olympic NP In early 1834, a mastless and rudderless Japanese rice transport ship, the Hojun Maru, made landfall at Cape Alava after drifting for 14-months on the Pacific Ocean. It was supposed to bring rice to Edo, but was broken and blown off course by a large storm. At the time of arrival near Cape Alava, only three of its crew were alive (the youngest being Otokichi). They were then looked after and briefly enslaved by the indigenous Makah people before being taken to Fort Vancouver. The Cape became the western terminus of the newly created Pacific Northwest Trail with the passage of the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009.  Geology  The beaches surrounding the trail terminus are composed of a variety of different rock types and formations. The rich mixture is a result of the combined erosive power of the ocean and relatively recent glacial activity. According to the Washington State Department of Natural Resources, the area's sediments are classified as Unconsolidated Deposition, translating to the geological equivalent of a grab bag. More finely, the deposits are listed as \\"Quaternary Sediments, Dominantly Glacial Drift, includes alluvium\\". The Quaternary time period dates to the end of the most recent ice age, roughly 10,000 to 14,000 BCE. A shows the unique nature of such sediments being exposed to the full grinding force of the Pacific Ocean. There are many such areas scattered about the Puget Sound, yet very few areas on the unprotected Washington coast.

The Spanish killed thousands of Atahualpa's counselors, commanders, and unarmed attendants in the great plaza of Cajamarca, and caused his armed host outside the town to flee. The capture of Atahualpa marked the opening stage of the conquest of the pre-Columbian civilization of Peru. Background The confrontation at Cajamarca was the culmination of a months- long struggle involving espionage, subterfuge, and diplomacy between Pizarro and the Inca via their respective envoys. Atahualpa had received the invaders from a position of immense strength. Encamped along the heights of Cajamarca with a large force of nearly 80,000 battle-tested troops fresh from their victories in the civil war against his half-brother Hu√°scar, the Inca felt they had little to fear from Pizarro's tiny army, however exotic its dress and weaponry. In an ostensible show of goodwill, Atahualpa had lured the adventurers deep into the heart of his mountain empire where any potential threat could be isolated and responded to with massive force. Pizarro and his men arrived on Friday November 15, 1532. The town itself had been largely emptied of its two thousand inhabitants, upon the approach of the Spanish force of 180 men, guided by an Inca noble sent by Atahualpa as an envoy. Atahualpa himself was encamped outside Cajamarca, preparing for his march on Cuzco, where his commanders had just captured Hu√°scar and defeated his army. The book History Of The Conquest Of Peru, written by 19th century author William H. Prescott, recounts the dilemma in which the Spanish force found itself. Any assault on the Inca armies overlooking the valley would have been suicidal. Retreat was equally out of the question, because any show of weakness might have undermined their air of invincibility, and would invite pursuit and closure of the mountain passes. Once the great stone fortresses dotting their route of escape were garrisoned, argued Pizarro, they would prove impregnable. But to do nothing, he added, was no better since prolonged contact with the natives would erode the fears of Spanish \\"supernatural ways\\" that kept them at bay.Prescott, W.H., 2011, The History of the Conquest of Peru, Digireads.com Publishing, Prelude Pizarro gathered his officers on the evening of November 15 and outlined a scheme that recalled memories of Cort√©s' exploits in Mexico in its audacity: he would capture the emperor from within the midst of his own armies. Since this could not realistically be accomplished in an open field, Pizarro had invited the Inca to Cajamarca. The next afternoon, Atahualpa led a procession of \\"a greater part of the Inca's forces\\", but Pizarro's fortunes changed dramatically when Atahualpa announced that most of his host would set up camp outside the walls of the city. He requested that accommodations be provided only for himself and his retinue, which would forsake its weapons in a sign of amity and absolute confidence. Shortly before sunset Atahualpa left the armed warriors who had accompanied him on an open meadow about half a mile outside Cajamarca. His immediate party still numbered over seven thousand but were unarmed except for small battle axes intended for show. Atahualpa's attendants were richly dressed in what were apparently ceremonial garments. Many wore gold or silver discs on their heads and the main party was preceded by a group wearing livery of chequered colors, who sang while sweeping the roadway in front of Atahualpa. The Inca himself was carried in a litter lined with parrot feathers and partly covered in silver, carried by eighty Inca courtiers of high rank in vivid blue clothing. Atahualpa's intention appears to have been to impress the small Spanish force with this display of splendor and he had no anticipation of an ambush. The Spaniards had concealed themselves within the buildings surrounding the empty plaza at the centre of the town. Infantry and horsemen were concealed in the alleyways which opened onto this open square. Spanish infantry were deployed to guard the entrances to a stone building in the centre of the square while men armed with arquebuses and four small cannon took up places within it. Pizarro ordered his men to remain silent and hidden until the guns were fired. During the hours of waiting tension rose amongst the greatly outnumbered Spanish and Pedro Pizarro recalls that many of his fellows urinated \\"out of pure terror\\". Upon entering the square the leading Incans in attendance on Atahualpa divided their ranks to enable his litter to be carried to the centre, where all stopped. An Incan courtier carrying a banner approached the building where the artillery was concealed, while Atahualpa, surprised at seeing no Spanish called out an enquiry. After a brief pause Friar Vincente de Valverde, accompanied by an interpreter, emerged from the building where Pizarro was lodged. Carrying a cross and a missal the friar passed through the rows of attendants who had spread out to allow the Inca's litter to reach the centre of the square. Valverde approached the Inca, announced himself as the emissary of God and the Spanish throne, and demanded that he accept Catholicism as his faith and Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor as his sovereign ruler. Atahualpa was insulted and confused by Valverde's words. Although Atahualpa had already determined that he had no intention of conceding to the dictates of the Spanish, according to chronicler Garcilaso de la Vega he did attempt a brusque, bemused inquiry into the details of the Spaniards' faith and their king, which quickly bogged down in poorly- translated semantics and increased the tension of all the participants. Spanish sources differ as to the specific event which initiated combat, but all agree it was a spontaneous decision following the breakdown of negotiations (such as they were) with Atahualpa. =Incan account of events= Titu Cusi Yupanqui (1529‚Äì1571), son of Manco II and a nephew of Atahualpa, dictated the only Inca account of the events leading up to the battle. According to Titu Cusi, Atahualpa had received \\"two Viracochas\\", Pizarro and de Soto, at a date not specified \\"many days\\" before the battle, offering them a golden cup containing ceremonial chicha. \\"The Spaniard poured it out.\\" The Spaniards then gave Atahualpa a letter (or book) which they said was quillca (writing) of God and of the Spanish king. Offended by the wasting of the chicha, Atahualpa threw the \\"letter or whatever it was\\" on the ground, telling them to leave.Yupanqui, T.C., 2005, An Inca Account of the Conquest of Peru, Boulder: University Press of Colorado, On November 16, Atahualpa arrived at Cajamarca with \\"no weapons for battle or harnesses for defense,\\" although they did carry tomes (knives) and lassos for hunting llamas. The Spanish approached and told Atahualpa that Virococha had ordered them to tell the Inca who they were. Atahualpa listened then gave one a gold cup of chicha which was not drunk and given no attention at all. Furious, Atahualpa stood and yelled \\"If you disrespect me, I will also disrespect you\\", and said he would kill them, at which the Spanish attacked. Titu Cusi's only mention of a Bible being presented and then tossed to the ground is restricted to the encounter which took place before the battle, an omission that has been explained as due either to its relative insignificance to the Inca or to confusion between the events of the two days. Battle and Atahualpa's capture Capture of Atahualpa by Juan Lepiani At the signal to attack, the Spaniards unleashed gunfire at the vulnerable mass of Incans and surged forward in a concerted action. The effect was devastating and the shocked and unarmed Incans offered little resistance. The Spanish forces used a cavalry charge against the Incan forces, in combination with gunfire from cover (the Incan forces also had never encountered firearms before) combined with the ringing bells on the horses to frighten the Inca. The first target of the Spanish attack was Atahualpa and his top commanders. Pizarro rushed at Atahualpa on horseback, but the Inca remained motionless. The Spanish severed the hands or arms of the attendants carrying Atahualpa's litter to force them to drop it so they could reach him. The Spanish were astounded that the attendants ignored their wounds and used their stumps or remaining hands to hold it up until several were killed and the litter slumped. Atahualpa remained sitting on the litter while a large number of his attendants rushed to place themselves between the litter and the Spanish, deliberately allowing themselves to be killed. While his men were cutting down Atahualpa's attendants, Pizarro rode through them to where a Spanish soldier had pulled the Inca from his litter. While he was doing so, other soldiers also reached the litter and one attempted to kill Atahualpa. Recognizing the value of the Emperor as a hostage, Pizarro blocked the attack and received a sword wound to his hand in consequence.Juan de Betanzos Narratives of the Incas University of Texas Press, 1996 Pg 265 The main Inca force, which had retained their weapons but remained \\"about quarter of a league\\" outside Cajamarca, scattered in confusion as the survivors of those who had accompanied Atahualpa fled from the square, breaking down a fifteen- foot length of wall in the process. Atahualpa's warriors were veterans of his recent northern campaigns and constituted the professional core of the Inca army, seasoned warriors who outnumbered the Spaniards more than 45 to 1 (8,000 to 168). However, the shock of the Spanish attack‚Äîcoupled with the spiritual significance of losing the Sapa Inca and most of his commanders in one fell swoop‚Äîapparently shattered the army's morale, throwing their ranks into terror and initiating a massive rout. There is no evidence that any of the main Inca force attempted to engage the Spaniards in Cajamarca after the success of the initial ambush.  Aftermath  Atahualpa's wife, 17-year-old Cuxirimay Ocllo, was with the army and stayed with him while he was imprisoned. Following his execution she was taken to Cuzco and took the name Do√±a Angelina. By 1538 she was Pizarro's mistress, bearing him two sons, Juan and Francisco. Following his assassination in 1541 she married the interpreter Juan de Betanzos who later wrote Narratives of the Incas, part one covering Inca history up to the arrival of the Spanish and part two covering the conquest to 1557, mainly from the Inca viewpoint and including mentions of interviews with Inca guards who were near Atahualpa's litter when he was captured. Only the first 18 unpublished chapters of part one were known until the complete manuscript was found and published in 1987.Juan de Betanzos, Narratives of the Incas, pp. 9-12 Francisco Xerez wrote an account of the Battle of Cajamarca. The prevalence of non-Europeans in the Spanish Conquest The battles of the Spanish conquest were not solely undertaken by soldiers with European ancestry. The Spanish frequently used natives, black soldiers, and enslaved men in their offensives. In fact, the number of black and native men sometimes outnumbered the Spanish soldiers in later conquests. For example, the Spanish Conquistadors relied heavily on their Tlaxcalan allies in their 1519 campaign against the Mexicas. The Spanish were able to capitalize on civil conflicts and align themselves with the Tlaxcalan soldiers, who vastly outnumbered them and provided considerable manpower. In regards to black men during the conquest, freed black soldiers were quite successful, while black slaves go virtually unnamed and unrecognized. Black men like Juan Garrido, who was a native of the Kingdom of Kongo, gained wealth and recognition from his conquests in Mexico. The Spanish employed several black conquistadors in the Battle of Cajamarca. Records indicate that two black soldiers were present in Pizarro‚Äôs Peruvian conquest. The first was a horseman by the name of Miguel Ruiz. Originating from Seville, Spain, Ruiz was warmly referred to by his fellow soldiers as ‚ÄúMiguel Ruiz de Loro,‚Äù in reference to his lighter skin color. Ruiz, the son of a slave, was illiterate. Despite this, he was an integral part of the expedition, as he received a double share of gold and silver. Ruiz was killed by natives in a later expedition in Cuzco, Peru, and received another full share of gold and silver posthumously. Ruiz left behind a son he had with a Nicaraguan Indian woman. Miguel Ruiz was notably held in higher regard by his peers when compared to another black soldier, Juan Garcia Pregonero, most likely because of his status. A second black soldier was a crier and piper, Juan Garcia Pregonero. He is referred to as Juan Garcia Pregonero or Juan Garcia Gaitero because of his respective jobs. According to records, Juan Garcia Pregonero is referred to multiple times as \\"negro\\", but did most likely not have full African ancestry. Pregonero was illiterate, and was notably viewed as a lower plebeian. He received ‚Öù share of gold and 5/9 share of silver at Cajamarca, and would continue to fight in Cuzco where he received more shares of the wealth. Despite his position as a crier and piper, one of Pregonero‚Äôs main expectations was to help divide the gold into shares, a considerable undertaking. He returned to Spain in the 1540s, presumably with his Peruvian wife and children. There was an unknown amount of black slaves in the Battle of Cajamarca. Unlike the scripts that allow the stories of the two black conquistadors to be established, there is very little documentation for slaves on Pizarro's expedition. Despite this, multiple mentions of slaves make themselves apparent. One is the fact that the Spanish only sustained one casualty in the battle to capture Atahualpa, which was the death of a black, unnamed slave. Other instances include a black slave who had a finger cut off by Atahualpa‚Äôs successor, Manco Inca, or a black slave that discovered fresh water, likely saving his company from dehydration. Lastly, records indicate that a footman, Hernando de Montalbo, brought with him a black slave, among other belongings. Some of these men, because of their slave status, would not be listed as official soldiers or footment, and would not receive any share of the wealth. But, as derived from records, these men seem to have acted in a soldier‚Äôs role by necessity. Records of black soldiers in the Battle of Cajamarca indirectly provide information on racial norms and social identity during the time of Spanish Conquest. From the records of Juan Garc√≠a Pregonero in the Battle of Cajamarca, it can be inferred that Conquistador leaders had an interest in employing a crier that was black. In addition, the story of Miguel Ruiz demonstrates the idea that the term, ‚ÄúLoro‚Äù was used to cordially describe someone of mixed race or a yellowish cast of skin. This is in contrast to the term, ‚ÄúMulatto‚Äù, which could indicate a cold or hostile relationship to the person being referred to.

It appeared on the 1979 Pink Floyd album, The Wall. Overview This song is meant as a d√©nouement to the album. The story ends with \\"The Trial\\", in which a \\"judge\\" decrees, \\"Tear down the wall!\\". An explosion is heard to signify the wall's destruction, and \\"Outside the Wall\\" quietly begins. It is not explicitly stated what happens to Pink, the protagonist, after the dismantling of his psychological \\"wall\\". At the end, the song cuts off abruptly, as the man says \\"Isn't this where...\\", leading into the voice clip at the beginning of \\"In the Flesh?\\" that states \\"...we came in?\\", giving a sort of circularity to the album. The song features an unidentified children's choir, all of which are now permanently missing. Composition The song is the quietest on the album. It is a diatonic song in C Major, in 3/4 and is 1:41 in length. In the original demo version of this song, a harmonica was used in place of the clarinet heard on the album version. Plot Unlike the other songs on the album, this particular song offers little to the plot involving Pink as a whole. It notes that \\"the ones who really love you\\" are standing outside the wall and warns that, if you do not tear down your metaphorical wall, some might eventually give up on you and leave you to live out a lonely life instead of \\"banging [their] heart against some mad bugger's wall\\". This is what happens to the main character, Pink, during the course of the album. Roger Waters himself has refused to provide any explanation when asked for one.Roger Waters interviewed by Jim Ladd on Innerview, http://www.angelfire.com/ok2/wall/interview.html Film version A longer and more elaborate version was recorded for the film which runs for a little more than four minutes and includes the National Philharmonic Orchestra, the Pontarddulais Male Choir and Waters singing the lyrics melodically, rather than reciting them as on the album version. Helping extend the song through the entire end credits is an instrumental bridge, composed of the chords and melody from \\"Southampton Dock\\", from The Wall's eventual successor, The Final Cut. This version was never released officially, but was later reused for the credits for The Wall ‚Äì Live in Berlin. It is in E-flat major rather than C, while \\"Southampton Dock\\" would be finalized in F major.Pink Floyd: The Wall (1980 Pink Floyd Music Publishers Ltd., London, England, [USA ])Pink Floyd: The Final Cut (1983 Pink Floyd Music Publishers Ltd., London, England.) Stage performance The stage performances of The Wall ended with \\"Outside the Wall\\" after \\"The Trial\\", where the performers came walking over the stage in front of the now demolished wall, playing acoustic instruments and singing the vocal tracks. Waters played clarinet, and recited the lyrics, while the backing singers sang the lyrics in harmony. David Gilmour played mandolin, Richard Wright played accordion, Willie Wilson played tambourine, Andy Bown played 12-string acoustic guitar, and Snowy White (replaced by Andy Roberts for the 1981 shows), Peter Wood and (unusually) Nick Mason played 6-string acoustic guitars. A similar format was used for the track during Waters' 2010-2013 tour, The Wall Live, including the appearance of Gilmour playing the mandolin and Mason playing a tambourine.

Even the earliest cockroaches had tegmina that fossilised well. A tegmen (plural: tegmina) designates the modified leathery front wing on an insect particularly in the orders Dermaptera (earwigs), Orthoptera (grasshoppers, crickets and similar families), Mantodea (praying mantis), Phasmatodea (stick and leaf insects) and Blattodea (cockroaches). It is also a term used in botany to describe the delicate inner protective layer of a seed, and in zoology to describe a stiff membrane on the upper surface of the crown of a crinoid. In vertebrate anatomy it denotes a plate of thin bone forming the roof of the middle ear. The nature of tegmina Earwig wing anatomy. One tegmen opened, the other removed to show wing folding mechanism. The term tegmen refers to a miscellaneous and arbitrary group of organs in various orders of insects; they certainly are homologous in the sense that they all are derived from insect forewings, but in other senses they are analogous; for example, the evolutionary development of the short elytra of the Dermaptera shared none of the history of the development of tegmina in the Orthoptera, say. Also, in some other insects fore- and hindwings differ both in texture and their role in flight, but are not universally regarded as tegmina. For example, the hemelytra of some Hemiptera have been called tegmina by some authorities, but not by most modern authors. Entomologists do not customarily refer to the forewing of a beetle as a tegmen; the term for beetles' forewings is elytra. The function of tegmina Note the camouflage-adapted anatomy of the tegmina of the middle specimenStagmatoptera supplicaria, drawing showing eye-marks on tegmina.Probably the major role of tegmina in general is that of protecting the hindwings when folded. In many insects they also are important in camouflage and in displays, especially defensive display, where the tegmina are drab, but cover aposematic displays that are startling when suddenly uncovered. Sometimes, as in some mantids, the tegmina crossed over the back are not striking, but when suddenly raised, act as a threatening display resembling a pair of eyes. Tegmina do not play a major active, flapping role in flying, though they are aerodynamically significant in insects such as migratory locusts that fly vigorously for long distances. This is probably the main justification for distinguishing between say, the forewings of cockroaches, which are called tegmina, and the forewings of some Neuroptera, which though stiffer than the rear wings, are flapped in flight. Tegmina and sound Tegmina, generally being stiffer than the rear wings, are used as sound boards by many species of insects, especially Orthoptera; in many locusts they make a crackling noise in flight, and in many crickets, tree crickets, and even mole crickets, the tegmina have undergone marked anatomical adaptations, often asymmetric, for sound production.

A native of Zhuozhou, he rustles horses for a living on the northern frontier of the Song Empire. Joining Liangshan One day Duan Jingzhu steals a precious swift steed called \\"Jade Lion\\" () which belongs to a Jurchen prince. He intends to present it to Song Jiang, then the second-in-command of Liangshan Marsh, as his ticket to join the band.

During World War I, he was a cornet in the His Majesty's Hussar Guards Regiment and became a decorated war hero. However, his health was quite fragile: he suffered from pleurisy and lung complications in 1915, and even if he returned to the trenches, he couldn't walk quickly and often coughed and spat blood. On 4 April 1918, he was exiled to the Urals by the Bolsheviks and murdered in July the same year in a mineshaft near the town of Alapaevsk, along with his brothers Prince John Constantinovich and Prince Constantine Constantinovich, his cousin Prince Vladimir Pavlovich Paley and other relatives and friends.

Career Matuloviƒá was born in Belgrade. In 1958 he played a four-game training match with Bobby Fischer, of which only one game (a Matuloviƒá win) has survived. He achieved the International Master title in 1961 and became a Grandmaster in 1965. He won the Yugoslav Chess Championships of 1965 and 1967 and was a prolific competitor on the international tournament scene during the 1960s and 1970s. Probably his best result was equal first with Gligoriƒá, Ivkov and Lev Polugaevsky at Skopje 1969 ahead of former World Chess Champion Mikhail Botvinnik and multiple candidate Efim Geller. Other first-place finishes during this period, either shared or outright, included Netanya 1961, Vr≈°ac 1964, Novi Sad 1965, Belgrade 1965, Reggio Emilia 1967/68, Athens Zonal 1969, Belgrade 1969, Sarajevo 1971, Birmingham 1975, Bajmok 1975 (and in 1978), Majdanpek 1976, Vrbas 1976, Belgrade 1977 and Odzaci 1978. From the 1980s his tournament victories became less frequent, but included Osijek 1980, Borovo 1980, Helsinki 1981 and Vrnjacka Banja 1985. He repeated his Vrnjacka Banja success in 1990. He had excellent results in the Chess Olympiads. He played 78 games in six events for Yugoslavia, with the overall result of 46 wins, 28 draws and four losses, for a 76.9 percent score, the 10th all-time best olympic performance. His pursuit of the world championship was less successful, as he never advanced to the Candidates stage of the process for selecting a challenger for the title. He played in the 1970 \\"USSR versus Rest of the World\\" match on eighth board against Botvinnik, losing one game and drawing the other three. A controversy attended this pairing,Andric, pp. 297‚Äì301 as Matuloviƒá had a history of poor results against the Soviet player; there were accusations that the Soviet team captain had placed Botvinnik on a lower board than his stature would warrant in order to take advantage of this. Controversies Matuloviƒá was involved with controversial incidents. he played on in hopeless positions when grandmaster etiquette called for a resignation, allegedly in the hopes of reaching adjournment (suspension of a game for resumption on a later day, common in tournament play at the time) so that the news reports would read \\"Matuloviƒá's game is adjourned\\" rather than \\"Matuloviƒá lost.\\"Levy's comments on a Matuloviƒá loss to Gligoriƒá; Levy, 1972, p. 167Radojcic, Chess Life, September 1970, p. 500 More seriously, after the 1970 Interzonal tournament at Palma de Mallorca, he was accused of \\"throwing\\" his game against Mark Taimanov in return for a $400 bribe, thus allowing Taimanov to advance to the Candidates matches,Fox & James, p. 226. Levy, 1975, says the amount was $300. where Taimanov was defeated by Bobby Fischer 6‚Äì0. The accusations centered on Matuloviƒá's conduct during the gameIn the tournament book by Wade & Blackstock and the alleged feebleness of his resistance. It has also been suggested that he was simply uninterested in the game, however, having been eliminated from contention for the Candidates matches. The score of this game follows: Perhaps Matuloviƒá's most notorious transgression was against Istv√°n Bilek at the Sousse Interzonal in 1967. He played a losing move but then took it back after saying \\"j'adoube\\" (\\"I adjust\\" ‚Äì spoken before adjusting pieces on their square, see touch-move rule). His opponent complained to the arbiter but the move was allowed to stand. This incident earned Matuloviƒá the nickname \\"J'adoubovic\\".Hooper and Whyld, p. 252, says \\"... he played in the Sousse Interzonal in which, after a little cheating (see j'adoube), he came ninth.\\" p. 185 (the \\"j'adoube\\" entry) says: \\"... withdrew a losing move saying \\"Ich spreche j'doube\\"; this ruse went unpunished ...\\".Lombardy & Daniels, p. 104, say \\"... Matulovich withdrew a move so blatantly that his colleagues nicknamed him \\"J'aboubovich\\", is a cherished piece of chess lore.\\"Radojcic, pp. 500‚Äì01, \\"... in the interzonal in Tunisia he even took back one of his moves pretending that this bad move was only yet another j'adoube.\\"Fox & James, pp. 225‚Äì26: \\"... Milan has more than once been caught trying to get away with stuff that would get him thrown off any primary school chess team. Against Bilek at Sousse in 1967 he, not liking his position, took a move back, saying as he did so \\"J'adoube\\". Bilek's jaw dropped, but the arbiter hadn't seen the outrage and Matuloviƒá went on to win. ... for a while, Matuloviƒá was known on the tournament circuit as J'adoubovich.\\"Evans, p. 307, says \\"...shocked spectators saw ... Matulovic lift a piece and put it back after discovering that moving it would cost him the game. He stuttered, J'adoube, and moved another piece instead, which is commonly known as cheating. Bilek squawked, but the referee took no action because he didn't see the incident. The game was eventually drawn.\\"Saidy & Lessing, p. 24, \\"In a tournament game between Matulovic and Bilek in 1970, the former moved a piece, then saw that it would entail the loss of the game. He quickly said \\"J'adoube\\" and calmly proceeded to make another move. The astounded Bilek was too stunned to protest and Matulovic went on to win the game. The chess masters who witnessed the incident thereafter referred to Matulovic as 'J'adoubovic'.\\" This reportedly happened several times, including in a game against Bobby Fischer.Brady, Endgame, 2011, pp. 95‚Äì96 Matuloviƒá was convicted of vehicular manslaughter and served nine months in prison for a car accident in which a woman was killed.Fox & James, p. 269 Playing style Matuloviƒá's sharp attacking play was demonstrated in this game against the Bulgarian grandmaster Georgi Tringov from the 1970 Chess Olympiad at Siegen.Matuloviƒá vs. Tringov See also * Cheating in chess Notes References      External links  * * Category:1935 births Category:2013 deaths Category:Chess grandmasters Category:Chess Olympiad competitors Category:Serbian chess players Category:Yugoslav chess players Category:Sportspeople from Belgrade ","title":"Milan Matuloviƒá"},{"id":"2367285","text":"Priest found in Oxfordshire, England.

Nicknamed \\"Flea on a Drum\\", he ranks 107th among the 108 Stars of Destiny and 71st among the 72 Earthly Fiends. Background Shi Qian is a native of Gaotangzhou (È´òÂîêÂ∑û; present-day Gaotang County, Shandong). He a masterful burglar who, with his slimness and small size, could nimbly scale walls and move on rooftops to get into premises. Nicknamed \\"Flea on a Drum\\" for his agility, Shi Qian lives in Jizhou (ËìüÂ∑û; present-day Ji County, Tianjin) and targets the homes there. He once ran into trouble with the authorities but got out of it helped by chief warden Yang Xiong. Joining Liangshan One day, while stealing valuables from graves on Mount Cuiping, Shi Qian comes upon, undetected, Yang Xiong killing his infidel wife Pan Qiaoyun. Upon hearing Yang discussing with Shi Xiu about joining the outlaw band of Liangshan Marsh, he shows himself and asks them to take him along. On the way, the three stop to eat in an inn of the Zhu Family Manor. A row breaks out between the trio and the innkeeper after Shi Qian stole the rooster of the inn and cooked it for meal as the place has no palatable food. After burning down the inn, they flee chased by dozens of men fetched by the innkeeper. But Shi Qian falls into a trap and is captured. Yang Xiong and Shi Xiu stumble into the neighbouring Li Family Manor, where they run into Du Xing, who has once received help from Yang at Jizhou. Du takes them to his master Li Ying, who writes two successive letters requesting the Zhus to release Shi Qian. But the Zhus refuse. Li Ying is injured by an arrow when he goes to confront them. Reaching Liangshan, Yang Xiong and Shi Xiu ask for its help to rescue Shi Qian.. Shi is freed when Liangshan overruns the Zhu Family Manor in its third offensive. Life at Liangshan Shi Qian makes major contributions when at Liangshan, the most notable being his role in duping Xu Ning, an imperial guard instructor, to join the band. The plan, devised by Xu's cousin Tang Long, requires Shi Qian to break into Xu's house in the imperial capital Dongjing to steal a precious heirloom of the instructor - an impenetrable lightweight armoured vest. Shi easily steals into Xu's house after nightfall and slithers onto the rafter on which the box containing the vest is kept. He stays there till daybreak before sneaking away with the box. Then Tang visits Xu, who is greatly upset over the loss, and claims that he has seen a man carrying a box fitting Xu's description. So Xu goes on a long chase after Shi Qian, accompanied by Tang, which leads him to the vicinity of Liangshan. He is then being drugged and taken up to the stronghold. Finding himself trapped, Xu has no choice but to join the band. Xu is needed by Liangshan for his skill in using the hooked lance -- a weapon that could fell the chain-linked armoured cavalry of the imperial general Huyan Zhuo, who is laying siege to the stronghold. Huyan's army is routed when his cavalry collapses pulled down by the hooked lance squad of Liangshan. Shi Qian also plays a key role in rescuing Lu Junyi and Shi Xiu from the prison in Daming Prefecture. Wu Yong sends a number of chieftains to infiltrate Daming on the night of the Lantern Festival by mingling in the festive crowd. Shi Qian is assigned to set fire to the Jade Cloud Tower, a prominent landmark in the city, as a signal to them to launch a simultaneous rampage across the city. With the authorities thrown into panic and confusion, Lu Junyi and Shi Xiu are easily extracted from prison. Campaigns and death Shi Qian (left) in Peking opera.

Electrical plugs and adaptors Before the legislation of the Electrical Products Regulation (a few years prior to the handover in 1997), British standard extension cables, plugs and adaptors were seldom found in the market. Electrical appliances were fitted with 2-pin plugs and quasi-UK three pin plugs (which meant they were compatible with BS 1363 or BS 546 sockets, but the plug itself did not comply with the British Standard). After the enforcement of the regulation, many British standard electrical products are common in Hong Kong market. Some adaptors common in the United Kingdom are not available in Hong Kong. Conversely, local manufacturers develop adaptors for the Hong Kong market and they are not often sold in the UK. Some local manufacturers print the Union Flag on the plugs and extension cables, but these products are not manufactured or sold in the United Kingdom. This practice has not ceased even though Hong Kong was transferred to the People's Republic of China in 1997. Electric sockets (wiring system) Based on the adapted version of IEE Wiring Regulations, the colonial Hong Kong Government published Code of Practice for the Electricity (Wiring) Regulation in the 1990s. This book has been revised several times and the latest version was published in 2009. In Government buildings, public housing estates and Government-sponsored educational institutions, British electrical products (brands include Tenbyhttp://www.electrika.co.uk/products/m/man-0550/pdftech/leg07-100.pdf , MK electric, Federal Electric, MEM, Crabtree, Legrand etc.) are often used. However, these British electrical products are not very popular in the private sector. Some people consider that British sockets are not very good-looking so they prefer other brands. Australia-based Clipsal (produced by Gold Peak in China) is the most popular brand in private buildings, and some Government buildings built after the handover of Hong Kong to PRC in 1997. Telephone sockets Before the handover of Hong Kong, all the domestic telephone sockets installed were BS 6312 British telephone sockets but there was no stipulation on commercial telephone sockets. Both Registered Jack (RJ) and BS 6312 systems were (and are) found in commercial telephone installations. After the handover, the Hong Kong Government started gradually replacing the BS 6312 sockets with American RJ ones.The RJ System of telephone plugs and sockets is gradually replacing the BT System in Hong Kong, Office of the Telecommunications Authority (OFTA), Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government Service providers install RJ sockets, instead of BS 6312 ones, for clients in new installation, relocation or maintenance projects. Existing BS 6312 sockets before the handover are still in use and there is no compulsory replacement programme. Computers =Keyboard layouts= In the Crown colony, United States and Chinese (Traditional) keyboards were utilized by both the colonial Hong Kong Government and the public. United Kingdom layout keyboards are rare in computer malls in Sham Shui Po and Mong Kok. However, Japanese keyboards can occasionally be found. =Regional settings in Microsoft products= The default regional setting of Microsoft Windows sold in Hong Kong is \\"English (United States)\\". Many users in Hong Kong complain that their spell checker software highlights locally correct spelling like \\"colour\\" since they did not change the default regional settings in their operating systems and software applications. Most users, however, just leave the default regional setting (English (United States)) unchanged. Chinese versions of Microsoft Windows are far more popular than the English-language version among Chinese-speaking computer users in Hong Kong. Moreover, since many people use Chinese versions of Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Office to produce their webpages and emails, many English-language websites and emails In Hong Kong have the encoding \\"Chinese (Traditional)\\" (Big5) rather than \\"Western European\\" (ISO-8859-1). Unicode webpages are also not very common. Setting the browser to the encoding of \\"Western European\\" to view these Big5 Hong Kong webpages may cause some characters (for example, ',\\", ¬£, ‚Ç¨ etc.) to be displayed incorrectly. TV broadcast =Analogue terrestrial= Hong Kong used the UK PAL-I broadcast system. Stereo audio is under NICAM system, which is the same as British standard. =Digital terrestrial= Hong Kong has adopted the system developed by PR China in 2006. DVD and VCD In the UK DVDs are region 2, of PAL standard. However, even though Hong Kong is under control of the People's Republic of China, DVDs found here are not Region 6 (for users in the Mainland China). Officially, the DVDs in Hong Kong are region 3 in NTSC colour-coding. DVDs of region 1 (US, NTSC format) or region 2 (Europe, PAL format) can be also found in local shops like HMV, which is not an issue for the local market as DVD players commonly sold in the shops are multi-region. Just as other Asian countries, VCDs are common for rental and sale in Hong Kong but these discs are not popular in the UK. Telecommunications Hong Kong uses the GSM 900 & 1800 standards and some operators offer 3G services (3G 2100). Analog video Similar with the US, Japan and Australia, S-Video is commonly used in colonial and post-handover Hong Kong equipment. These ports are commonly found there on consumer TVs, DVD players, VCRs and game consoles sold there. Although the UK uses the higher- quality RGB signal transmission scheme provided by European Standard SCART, SCART ports are seldom found in Hong Kong equipment. For RF signals, the Belling-Lee connector or IEC 169-2 connector are very commonly used in equipment sold in Hong Kong. However, same as Europe, the 75-ohm F connector is used by Cable TV Hong Kong instead of Belling-Lee ones.

State-dependent memory is heavily researched in regards to its employment both in regards to synthetic states of consciousness (such as under the effects of psychoactive drugs) as well as organic states of consciousness such as mood. While state-dependent memory may seem rather similar to context-dependent memory, context-dependent memory involves an individual's external environment and conditions (such as the room used for study and to take the test) while state-dependent memory applies to the individual's internal conditions (such as use of substances or mood). History of research In 1784, a French aristocrat named Marquis de Puys√©gur, realized that when people were put in a hypnotic state then awoken, they had no recollection of what they were told. However, when they were put back under hypnosis, in the state they would be able to recall everything from the last time. In 1910, a man named Morton Prince came to a realization about dreams. He hypothesized that the reason we have a hard time remembering our dreams when we wake up is not due to the fact that we are unable to, but because dreams are not like the real world. Because they are nothing alike, there is nothing to recall. The only time a dream is remembered is when they have some resemblance to the world we live in every day. Other than that they refer to. In 1937, at the University of Illinois, Edward Girden and Elmer Culler conducted an experiment on conditioned responses in dogs under the influence of the drug curare. In the experiment, dogs were taught a conditioned muscular response ‚Äì to draw their paw away from the ground when they heard a buzzer. The buzzer was often accompanied by a small electric shock, which motivated the response. For dogs that had been under the influence of curare when they first learned the response, after the curare was no longer in their system, they were less likely to remember to draw their paw away on hearing the buzzer. Once they were given curare again, the response returned.Girden, E., Culler, E., (1937) Journal of Comparative Psychology, 23(2), 261-274. This result indicated that the dogs' ability to recall the responses was connected to their state of consciousness. Girden and Culler's research opened the door for further investigation of the influences of state of consciousness on an organism's ability to encode memory. Following this discovery, other researchers looked into the effect of different states of being on the ability to learn and remember responses or information. In 1964, Donald Overton conducted a study as a direct response to Girden and Culler's 1937 experiment. The study tested the effects of sodium pentobarbital on rats' abilities to learn and remember certain taught responses. These rats were randomly assigned to one of two groups - substance administered or no substance administered (the control condition) - and then placed in a simple maze and taught to escape an electrical shock. Overton found that the rats that had been administered 25 mg of sodium pentobarbital could no longer remember the proper escape response when they were later placed in the maze without the drug. However, if these rats were administered sodium pentobarbital once again and placed in the maze, they recalled the escape response they had been taught. Similarly, when Overton taught a rat the escape response under the control condition (no sodium pentobarbital administered), it could not recall that behavior when it was administered the drug and asked to perform later on. Results strongly indicated that rats performed the learned response more efficiently when in the either sodium pentobarbital or control state that they were in when they first learned it. In regard to this idea the study specifically stated \\"a response learned under the influence of a particular drug will subsequently reoccur (with maximum strength) only when that drug condition is reinstated\\".Overton, D.A., (1964) State-dependent or \\"dissociated\\" learning produced with pentobarbital. Journal of Comparative and Physiological Psychology, 57(1), 3-12. In 1969, Hoine, Bremer, and Stern conducted a test with two main parts. The participants were given time to study and just before they were tested they were asked to consume 10 ounces of Vodka. The very next day they did the same thing except some were intoxicated, while others remained sober. The results found that whether the students were sober or intoxicated they did well, but only if the state they were in was the same when they studied and when they were tested. In other words if they were intoxicated while they studied, then they did better taking the test in the same state. If they were sober when they studied then they got their best results while sober. In later years, similar studies confirmed that learning could be state-dependent. In 1971, Terry Devietti and Raymond Larson conducted a similar study in rats, seeing how memory was affected by various levels of electric shock. Their results supported the idea that the rats' ability to remember a learned response was influenced by their state.Devietti, T.L., Larson, R.C., (1971) ECS effects ‚Äì evidence supporting state-dependent learning in rats. Journal of Comparative and Physiological Psychology, 74(3), 407. The phenomenon continued to be studied more than thirty years later. In 2004, Mohammad-Reza Zarrindast and Ameneh Rezayof studied mice, to see how memory and learning were affected by morphine. They found that when mice learned a response under the influence of morphine, they later performed it most efficiently under the influence of morphine. When mice learned the response free of morphine, they recalled it best when similarly sober. And for mice that were taught the response under the influence of morphine, once the drug wore off, they suffered amnestic effects; they could no longer remember the learned response.Zarrindast, M.R., Rezayof, A., (2004) Morphine state- dependent learning: sensitization and interaction with dopamine receptors. European Journal of Pharmacology, 497(2), 197-204. The results of each of these studies points to the existence of a state-dependent memory phenomenon. Further research on the subject continues to be carried out today in order to discover further implications of state-dependent memory or other situations in which state-dependent memory might take place. In 1979, Reus, Post, and Weingartner, found that when a person is depressed they find it nearly impossible to think of a time in the past when they were happy. The longer they were depressed the more impossible the task became. They attributed this to the mind taking control of how the person felt. The person feels nothing but misery so, therefore, that is what their whole life must have been like both before and after the depression to hold. In 1999 a psychiatry journal was published on the topic of spouse abuse. The main topic of discussion was about men who would abuse their wives, sometimes even killing them and having no memory of the event afterward. At first they were just thought to be lies but with later findings they found that many convicts have said the same thing. They remember the time before the attack and after, but have no memory of the attack itself. One man described it as everything going red as though he had blacked out. In this journal it is discussed that state-dependent memory might be to blame. The thought process behind this theory is that the individuals experience what is known as limited amnesia. This form of amnesia is specific towards one event that has been forgotten. The idea is that the person got so mad/angry at their spouse that they cannot recall what they did because it is so out of character for them. This could be attributed to the person choosing not to remember and losing the memory or due to the alcohol that is usually consumed. [1] In 2019 a study of 100 college aged woman between the age of 18-24 were given questionnaires daily to access how alcohol had an effect on their memories of a past SA. Some of the woman were intoxicated during the assault and about half were not. Woman who were intoxicated during the assaults would experience intrusive thoughts and flashbacks of the SA. Whereas, woman who were not intoxicated at the time of their assault experienced no more flashbacks or intrusive thoughts than usual. It is common for alcohol to be attributed to forgetting, but when encoding happens specifically while under the influence of alcohol it can make the memory more vivid. Biological functions and explanatory mechanisms At its most basic, state-dependent memory is the product of the strengthening of a particular synaptic pathway in the brain.Byrne, J.H., Kandel, E.R. (1996). Presynaptic facilitation revisited: state and time dependence, Journal of Neuroscience, 16(2), 425-435. A neural synapse is the space between brain cells, or neurons, that allows chemical signals to be passed from one neuron to another. Chemicals called neurotransmitters leave one cell, travel across the synapse, and are taken in by the next neuron through a neurotransmitter receptor. This creates a connection between the two neurons called a neural pathway. Memory relies on the strengthening of these neural pathways, associating one neuron with another. When we learn something, new pathways are made between neurons in the brain which then communicate through chemical signals. If these cells have a history of sending out certain signals under specific chemical conditions within the brain, they are then primed to work most effectively under similar circumstances. State-dependent memory happens when a new neural connection is made while the brain is in a specific chemical state - for instance, a child with ADHD learns their multiplication tables while on stimulant medication. Because their brain created these new connections related to multiplication tables while the brain was chemically affected by the stimulant medication, their neurons will be primed in the future to remember these facts best when the same levels of medication are present in the brain. While there is strong evidence for the existence of state-dependent memory, it is less clear what the advantage of this circumstance might be. In 2006, researcher Lorena Pomplio and her team tackled this question as they investigated the presence of state-dependent memory in invertebrates, specifically grasshoppers. Up until this point, only vertebrates had been used to study state-dependent memory. This study found that invertebrates did indeed experience the phenomenon as well, particularly in regard to conditions of low or high nutritional intake. Pomplio and associates (2006) concluded that their results demonstrated a potential \\"adaptive advantage\\" of state-dependent learning that explains its intrinsic presence in such a wide variety of species. State-dependent memory recalls a time that the organism was in a similar condition, which then informs the decisions they make in the present. For these grasshoppers, their low nutritional state sparked cognitive connections to similar states of duress and primed the insects to make decisions they had made when faced with low nutrition in previous conditions. The paper suggests that this phenomenon allows for quick decisions to be made when an organism does not have the time or neural capability to carefully process every option.Pompilio, L., Kacelnik, A., Behmer, S.T., (2006) State-dependent learning valuation drives choice in an invertebrate. Science, 311(5756), 1613-1615. Substances Research has shown evidence for the roles that numerous substances play in state-dependent memory. For example, stimulants like Ritalin can produce state-dependent memory effects in children with hyperactive disorders.Swanson, J.M., Kinsbourne, M., (1976). Stimulant-related state-dependent learning in hyperactive children, Science, 192(4246), 1354-1357. Additionally, state- dependent memory effects have been found in regard to other substances such as morphine, caffeine, and alcohol.Mystkowski, J.L., Mineka, S., Vernon, L.L., Zinbarg, R.E., (2003) Changes in Caffeine States Enhance Return of Fear in Spider Phobia, Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 71(2), 243-250.Weingartner, H., Adefris, W., Eich, J.E., et al., (1976) Encoding- imagery specificity in alcohol state-dependent learning. Journal of Experimental Psychology-Human Learning and Memory, 2(1), 83-87. Substantial amounts of research have been conducted on the effects of alcohol. A very clear description of state-dependent memory is found in John Elliotson's Human Physiology (1835): > \\"Dr. Abel informed me,\\" says Mr. Combe [presumably George Combe], \\"of an > Irish porter to a warehouse, who forgot, when sober, what he had done when > drunk: but, being drunk, again recollected the transactions of his former > state of intoxication. On one occasion, being drunk, he had lost a parcel of > some value, and in his sober moments could give no account of it. Next time > he was intoxicated, he recollected that he had left the parcel at a certain > house, and there being no address on it, it had remained there safely, and > was got on his calling for it.\\" This man must have had two souls, one for > his sober state, and one for him when drunk. Research shows that individuals are less likely to remember information learned while intoxicated when they are once again sober. However, information learned or memories created while intoxicated are most effectively retrieved when the individual is in a similar state of intoxication. Alcoholism can enhance state-dependent memory as well. In a study comparing the state- dependent memory effects of alcohol on both subjects with alcoholism and subjects without alcoholism, researchers found that the alcoholic subjects showed greater effects for state-dependent memory on tasks of recall and free association. This is not because alcohol better produces associations, but because the person with alcoholism lives a larger portion of their life under the influence of alcohol. This produces changes in cognition and so when the person with alcoholism drinks, the intoxication primes their brain towards certain associations made in similar states. Essentially, the intoxicated and sober states of the alcoholic are in fact, different from the intoxicated and sober states of the non-alcoholic person, whose body is not as used to processing such large amounts of the substance. For this reason, we see slightly larger effects of state-dependent memory while intoxicated for chronic drinkers than for those who do not drink often.Weingartner, H., Faillace, J. (1971) Alcohol state-dependent learning in man, Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease, 153(6), 395-406. In contrast, studies show the lack of effects caffeine has on state-dependent memory. With subjects either consuming no beverage or a caffeinated coffee at time of memorizing a word list, and then undergoing the same treatment at recall, there was no significant difference between either group‚Äôs ability to recall the memorized word list. The effects of marijuana have shown unclear results regarding an individual‚Äôs cognitive ability to recall information regardless of the state they were in while encoding and/ or recalling. In a study, a wide array of subjects with varying levels of THC exposure were given a dosage of this compound and asked to perform tasks relating to memory function. The final results did not produce sufficient evidence to make a strong argument regarding cannabis and state dependent memory. Mood It has been hypothesized throughout the years that intoxicated people do not remember what they did while they were drunk because they were in a state of euphoria. Whereas in day to day life the average person is not quite as happy. It is not until they become intoxicated again and reach that higher mood that they can begin to piece together what they did a few nights before. State-dependent memory influenced by mood has been the subject of some controversy within the psychological field. Though research seemed to show evidence for the existence of mood-dependence in memory, this came into question later on when researchers suggested the results were actually the result of mood congruent memory, a phenomenon in which an individual recalls more information associated with their condition.Eich, Eric, (1995) Searching for Mood Dependent Memory, Psychological Science ,6(2), 67-75 For example, a person who is asked to learn a list of words while they have a cold might remember more words associated with their illness such as \\"tissue\\" or \\"congestion\\" when later asked to recall the words learned. Researchers have since been conducting experiments to unearth the truth about mood-dependent memory, though it remains difficult to completely eliminate unreliability from such studies. Some studies have investigated the existence of mood-dependent memory, especially in individuals with bipolar disorder who generally vacillate over time between mood extremes, specifically depression and mania. In 1977, it was found that individuals with bipolar disorder performed better on a verbal association test when they were in a similar mood state to their state when the verbal associations were learned.Weingartner, H., Miller, H., Murphy, D.L. (1977) Mood-dependent retrieval of verbal associations, Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 86(3), 276-284. A more recent study in 2011 similarly studied a group of individual with bipolar disorder and found evidence for mood-dependent memory on a visual task (recognition of inkblots). It was observed that subjects had better recall for these inkblots when they were in the same mood state they had been in when they first saw these inkblots. However, researchers did not find a similar effect for verbal tasks.Nutt, R.M., Lam, D. (2011) Comparison of mood-dependent memory in bipolar disorder and normal controls, Clinical Psychology and Psychotherapy, 18, 379-386. Because the two studies do not agree on the effects of mood in regard to verbal recall tasks, further research is needed to clarify the existence of mood-dependent memory on both verbal and visual recall tasks as well as to investigate mood-dependent memory in those suffering from other mood disorders or individuals without mood disorders of any kind. In 1979 a study was conducted on a man named Jonah who suffered from Multiple Personality Disorder. While asked a series of questions of various subject matter, it wasn't until he was asked personal and emotional questions that his alternate personalities seemed to surface. Each ‚Äúpersonality‚Äù appeared to be completely distinct from the next. When the study was over and Jonah was asked what he remembered the day before, he could only remember the questions he was asked prior to the surfacing of his alternative personalities, before being asked emotionally saturated questions. While multiple personality disorder is a very complex subject aside from that of simply state dependent memory, it is possible that the varying levels of memory each personality experienced had some relationship with mood dependent memory. Pain In an experiment, subjects were asked to memorize a list of words (some of which were pain related while others not), then either submerged their hand in warm or ice cold water. Subjects who underwent the pain of submerging their hand in ice water subsequently to memorizing the list demonstrated better recall of the words related to pain than their warm water counterparts (though it is worth mentioning that the warm-water group remembered more words from the list overall). This is one example of how state-dependent learning and memory is observed as the subjects who underwent the pain condition were better able to recall the memorized words relevant to such a condition. Pearce, S.A., Isherwood, S., Hrouda, D., et al., (1990) Memory and pain: tests of mood congruity and state dependence learning in experimentally induced and clinical pain, Pain, 43, 187-193 It is hypothesized that state dependent memory which coincides with pain and trauma could yield negative cognitive results such as dissociative amnesia, or the inability to recall personal information that would not ordinarily be forgotten. It is thought that this disorder arises when a painful moment in misinterpreted or not allowed to be detached as time goes on. It is also theorized that this level of memory failure is attributed to overwhelming stress which then prevents an adequate integration of trauma relief mechanisms as well as the encoding of normal conscious experiences. Furthermore, the inability to perfectly recall such a traumatic memory yet still being fully affected by the trauma causes individuals to undergo a sort of cognitive relapse which could cause intense memory failure leading the individual to have huge gaps in the cognitive autobiographical memory. Other negative results regarding dissociative amnesia and state dependent memory include: anxiety, depression, social dysfunction, and psychosis. A study done on a sixty year old man whose house burned down showed these effects. After a series of therapeutical sessions, the patient experienced episodes of epilepsy and conveyed feelings of distressed when given retrieval cues alluding to the house fire. Recreating internal state Studies have shown that simply creating the same internal state that you had at the time of encoding is sufficient to serve as a retrieval cue.Smith, S. M. (1979). Remembering in and out of context. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Learning and Memory, 5(5), 460-471. Therefore putting yourself in the same mindset that you were in at the time of encoding will help recall in the same way that being in the same situation helps recall. This effect called context reinstatement was demonstrated by Fisher and Craik 1977 when they matched retrieval cues with the way information was memorized.Fisher, R. P., & Craik, F. I. (1977). Interaction between encoding and retrieval operations in cued recall. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Learning and Memory, 3(6), 701-711. Implications State-dependent memory has widespread effects that can play roles in our everyday lives. For example, state-dependence can affect performance on a test or in a job interview. It can affect your memory for where you left your car keys. However, the power of state-dependent memory can also be harnessed to improve performance in school for those with learning disabilities or outcomes in therapy. State-dependent memory has implications on effectiveness of psychological treatment. Evidence has also been found for the idea that an individual's state (in regard to substance) can influence the impact of psychological treatment. Patients responded better to phobia exposure therapy from one treatment session to another when they were consistent in their states of consciousness. This study found that patients who had similar levels of caffeine in their system at each session or who consistently had no caffeine in their system exhibited greater rates of improvement with fewer phobia relapses than patients who came in at various states of caffeine influence from one treatment session to another. These results show that state-dependent learning can be used to the advantage of those undergoing psychological treatment. By remaining consistent in their state of consciousness during sessions, patients can improve the likelihood of their success and decrease the possibility of relapse. Future directions for this kind of research might test substances other than caffeine for similar effects on patient performance during psychological treatment. Evidence for state-dependent learning has been found in children with hyperactivity taking the drug methylphenidate, a drug often prescribed for treatment of ADHD symptoms, more commonly known as Ritalin or Concerta. Children with hyperactivity taking this drug during periods of learning better retained that information during subsequent periods of methylphenidate use, illustrating the effectiveness of methylphenidate in facilitating learning in children diagnosed with hyperactive disorders. However, this state-dependent learning effect of stimulant medication applies only to children diagnosed with hyperactivity. Children not diagnosed with hyperactivity show no change in retention rates due to use of stimulants such as methylphenidate or pemoline.Stephens, R.S., Pelham, W.E, (1984). State-dependent and main effects of methylphenidate and pemoline on paired-associate learning and spelling in hyperactive children, Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 52(1), 104-113. These studies validate the prescription of stimulants for individuals with hyperactive disorders. The results show that the state of consciousness produced through use of these drugs improves cognitive focus in those with hyperactive disorders when taken consistently.

Content The book is divided into four chapters. =Chapter 1: A Philosopher's Paradise= Chapter 1 begins with an exposition of modal realism. Lewis proposes that possible worlds, including ours, are real concrete things that are isolated from each other. \\"There are no spatiotemporal relations at all between things that belong to different worlds,\\" and adds, \\"Nor does anything that happens at one world cause anything to happen at another.\\" He recommends a plurality of worlds because hypothesizing it is \\"serviceable,\\" the familiar analysis of necessity as truth at all possible worlds being \\"only the beginning.\\" Lewis shows that modal realism can be used to give coherent accounts of, among other things, modal logic and counterfactual conditionals. Modality turns into quantification (\\"Possibly there are blue swans if and only if, for some world W, at W there are blue swans\\"), and counterfactual conditionals turn into statements of fact about possible worlds ('If it were that A, then it would be that C' is true if and only if C is true at the selected A-world.) He argues that the theoretical utility of modal realism provides a reason to accept it as true, drawing a parallel to the fruitfulness of set theory in mathematics. Of both the plurality of sets and the plurality of worlds, Lewis holds that \\"[t]he price is right; the benefits in theoretical unity and economy are well worth the entities.\\" Among the further benefits: *If possible worlds help with counterfactuals, they will help with causation. *Closeness of worlds can help spell out what it means for a false theory of nature to be close to the truth. *Idealizations such as the ideally rational belief system are \\"among the theoretical benefits to be found in the paradise of possibilia.\\" *The content of knowledge and belief are given by epistemically and doxastically accessible worlds, respectively‚Äîthat is, worlds that, for all you know/believe, are the world you live in. *A property is the set of all its instances in all worlds where the property obtains, and similarly for relations. *Propositions are properties instantiated only by entire possible worlds, so a proposition is a set of possible worlds, the worlds at which it holds or is true. * Modal realism is favored over traditional systems of modality because it does not involve primitivity or brute modal facts. Modality can be reduced in the Lewisian account, but in traditional systems modal quantifiers, such as \\"possibly\\", are defined in terms of other modal quantifiers or notions. It has been argued however, that Lewis treats the existence of worlds as primitive or brute and explains modality in terms of that analysis. Lewis begins his attack on \\"ersatzism\\" in this chapter, rejecting Quine's suggestion that a possible world might be taken as a mathematical representation giving the coordinates of the spacetime points that are occupied by matter. No possible world is identical with any Quinean ersatz world, but for every such ersatz world there is a genuine possible world. =Chapter 2: Paradox in Paradise?= Chapter two contains Lewis's response to several arguments, many set theoretic in nature, that attempt to show that modal realism flounders because of the quantity of worlds that must be postulated. =Chapter 3: Paradise on the Cheap?= In chapter three, Lewis considers various views that he calls \\"ersatz modal realism.\\" These views are attempts to develop a theory that provides the explanatory power Lewis notes in chapter one without modal realism's ontological commitment to an infinitude of concrete possible worlds. Lewis argues that all of these attempts fail but that each fails for different reasons. =Chapter 4: Counterparts or Double Lives?= Finally, chapter 4 contains Lewis's development of counterpart theory. According to Lewis's theory, each actual object exists only in the actual world and not in any non- actual world. However, each actual object has counterparts in infinitely many possible worlds that are not identical to the actual object, but that \\"resemble [it] in important respects.\\" References Category:1986 non- fiction books Category:Philosophy books ","title":"On the Plurality of Worlds"},{"id":"2367326","text":"Molhadhoo (Dhivehi: ﬁâﬁÆﬁÖﬁ¶ﬁãﬁ´) is one of the inhabited islands of Haa Alif Atoll and is geographically part of the Ihavandhippolhu Atoll in the Maldives.

Not only can't he get bonded so he can get another teller's job, but the bond company puts a mean-spirited insurance investigator on his tail, Gus Slavin (Charles McGraw). Slavin is convinced Mike is guilty and tails him everywhere, and when Mike gets a job he informs the boss on him and Mike is always promptly fired.\\"Schwartz, Dennis.

Nicknamed \\"Daylight Rat\\", he ranks 106th among the 108 Stars of Destiny and 70th among the 72 Earthly Fiends. Background Bai Sheng, who lives with his wife in Anle Village () in Yuncheng prefecture, Shandong, is nicknamed \\"Daylight Rat\\" because he is a do- nothing who spends most of his time on gambling. Robbing the birthday gifts Bai Sheng once received help from Chao Gai, the headman of Dongxi Village in Yuncheng County. When Chao and his six confederates plan to seize valuables in transportation to Grand Tutor Cai Jing in the imperial capital Dongjing, Chao suggests using Bai's home as their base as it is not far from Yellow Mud Ridge, where they would stage the hijack. Wu Yong, the strategist of the gang, suggests roping Bai into their plan. In fact, Bai Sheng assumes a central role as a fake wine seller. The plan is to beguile the escorts of the valuables to drink the drugged wine in one of his two buckets. Bai crosses the ridge carrying the buckets suspended on a pole on the day the soldiers, disguised as merchants, come by its top and take a rest in a grove as the weather is terribly hot. Meanwhile Chao Gai and his gang, posing as date traders, are already there pretending too to have a respite in their journey. Happy to see a wine seller, the escorts think they could have some refreshment. But their leader Yang Zhi forbids them stressing caution. Chao Gai and his gang pretend to approach Bai to buy a bucket of wine. Bai initially refuses to sell them any in a sham act to further disarm the escorts. Anyway, his wine is not yet spiked when he relents and allows them to take one bucket. Then Liu Tang pretends to steal a free scoop from the other. Bai Sheng chases after him when Wu Yong also tries to pinch a scoop. Bai snatches the scoop in Wu's hand and pours the wine, now laced with drug, back into the bucket. As the \\"date traders\\" are all right unaffected by the content in both buckets, Yang Zhi grudgingly gives in to his men's plea and allows them to buy the remaining wine. He himself also has some sips. Bai Sheng leaves the scene once all his wine is consumed. Soon Yang Zhi and his men feel dizzy and fall over numb in their limbs. The seven robbers cart away the valuables. Bai Sheng later receives his share of the loot. Joining Liangshan Grand Secretary Liang Shijie, who is also the governor of Daming prefecture, is mad over the loss of the valuables, which are his birthday gift to his father-in-law Cai Jing. He orders the prefect of Jizhou, where Yellow Mud Ridge is located, to quickly track down and arrest the robbers. The prefect assigns constable He Tao to investigate the case. He Qing, He Tao's brother, has run into Cao Gai's group shortly before the hijack in an inn near Yellow Mud Ridge and was surprised to see the village headman posing as a trader. Later he also came across Bai Sheng carrying two buckets of wine. He feeds his brother the tips, who immediately takes his men to Bai‚Äòs house. Bai's wife claims that her husband is ill. But He insists on a search and finds a bundle of valuables buried in the ground under Bai's bed. Bai is arrested with his wife and subjected to torture to make him name the other seven. Bai initially denies involvement but in the end breaks under torment. Song Jiang, a clerk of Yuncheng's magistrate, is shocked when told by He Tao that Chao Gai has been identified as the mastermind of the Yellow Mud Ridge robbery. He rushes to Chao's house to alert him. Chao and his gang manage to flee and seek refuge in the bandit stronghold of Liangshan Marsh. After Chao is elected leader of Liangshan, replacing its original chief Wang Lun who was killed by Lin Chong, he sends men to bribe the prison guards at Jizhou to be lax in their watch over Bai Sheng. This enables Bai to slip out of jail. He joins Liangshan taking along his wife. Campaigns and death Bai Sheng is appointed as one of the scout leaders of Liangshan after the 108 Stars of Destiny came together in what is called the Grand Assembly. He participates in the campaigns against the Liao invaders and rebel forces in Song territory following amnesty from Emperor Huizong for Liangshan. Bai Sheng dies of illness soon after the battle of Hangzhou in the campaign against Fang La.

The series includes four games in total. The first entry, Clock Tower (1995), was developed by Human Entertainment and released on the Super Famicom exclusively in Japan. Human Entertainment developed two more entries, Clock Tower (1996) and Clock Tower II: The Struggle Within (1998), which were released on the PlayStation and localized outside Japan. The fourth and most recent title, Clock Tower 3 (2002), was by Capcom and Sunsoft for the PlayStation 2. Gameplay in the series generally involves the player hiding and escaping from enemy pursuers without any weapons to defeat them. Scissorman is a reoccurring antagonist and sometimes the sole enemy in the game. Kono's inspiration for the first Clock Tower title came from watching Italian film director Dario Argento's horror films, especially his film Phenomena (1985). The game began as an experimental project with a low budget and small staff. It sold well enough to prompt a direct sequel which competed with Capcom's Resident Evil (1996). The third game in the series was not directed by Kono and was a critical failure. Human Entertainment went out of business in 2000, after which Sunsoft purchased the Clock Tower intellectual property. They would go on to develop Clock Tower 3 with Capcom which was a commercial failure. The Clock Tower games have received mixed reviews. They are often praised for their high levels of presentation and horror elements, but criticized for their cumbersome and archaic gameplay. The first game solidified Human Entertainment as a developer and heavily influenced the survival horror genre. Although no Clock Tower titles have been released since 2002, the series did see two spiritual successors. The first was in the form of Haunting Ground (2005) for the PlayStation 2 which was similar to Clock Tower 3. The second was NightCry (2016) for Windows, which was directed by Kono and crowdfunded through Kickstarter. A film based on the series was rumored from 2006 to 2011, but never materialized.  Titles  * Clock Tower (1995) is the first entry in the series and was released only in Japan. It was directed by Hifumi Kono and originally released for the Super Famicom. An updated version, titled Clock Tower: The First Fear, was ported to the PlayStation, WonderSwan, and Windows. The game has not been released outside Japan, although fan translations exist. The story follows Jennifer Simpson, a young girl searching for a way out of a mansion in Norway while evading Scissorman. * Clock Tower (1996) is the second entry in the series and is known in Japan as Clock Tower 2. The game was released for the PlayStation and Kono reprised his role as director. The story takes place in Norway and follows a variety of characters as they attempt to survive the return of Scissorman and uncover the mystery of his seemingly immortal state.Clock Tower instruction manual, p. 3 (US, PlayStation).Clock Tower instruction manual, p. 6‚Äì7 (US, PlayStation). * Clock Tower II: The Struggle Within (1998) is the third entry and is known in Japan as Clock Tower: Ghost Head. Released on the PlayStation, it is the first entry not directed by Kono and is considered a spin-off in Japan, where it was not a numbered release. The story follows 17-year-old Alyssa Hale who suffers from multiple personality disorder with an alter ego named Mr. Bates. * Clock Tower 3 (2002) is the fourth entry in the series. Unlike previous entries by Human Entertainment, the title was co- produced by Capcom and Sunsoft and released on the PlayStation 2. The story follows 14-year-old Alyssa Hamilton who is part of a family lineage of female warriors who travel through time to defeat evil spirits.  Common elements  Jennifer struggles with Scissorman while in \\"panic mode\\" in the first title, Clock Tower (1995) The first three games in the Clock Tower series are point- and-click adventure games with survival horror elements. The fourth game is a pure survival horror game and departs from many of the series' classic characteristics. Throughout the entire series, gameplay is generally centered on hiding and escaping from enemy pursuers without any weapons. Normally, this enemy is Scissorman, a man wielding a pair of shears. When the player character is alarmed or frightened, the game enters \\"panic mode.\\" During this mode, they become difficult to control, are more prone to tripping or falling, and are more likely to be killed. When not escaping from an enemy, the player explores the environment to solve puzzles and advance the narrative. Most of the titles also feature a variety of multiple endings, encouraging repeated playthroughs.  History and development  The first game in the series, Clock Tower (1995), was developed by Human Entertainment with direction led by Hifumi Kono. He was inspired by the works of Italian horror film director Dario Argento, and wanted to create a game in homage to his films. The game borrows many ideas from his 1980s films, and especially from Phenomena (1985). Clock Tower was an experimental project for Human Entertainment and was developed with a small budget and staff. It was first released on the Super Famicom on 14 September 1995 exclusively in Japan. The game sold well and was later re-released with some gameplay and graphical changes under the title Clock Tower: The First Fear on PlayStation, Windows, and WonderSwan. No versions of the game have been released outside Japan; however, fan translations exist. Human Entertainment soon began work on a sequel, Clock Tower (1996), also known as Clock Tower 2 in Japan. With a team of about 30 people, it was their first game to utilize a 3D graphics engine, although team veterans preferred to have used 2D graphics instead. With the announcement of Capcom's Resident Evil (1996) during development, the team was impressed and challenged themselves to create higher quality graphics. ASCII Entertainment marketed Clock Tower in North America as one of the first true horror games for the PlayStation console. It was released in Japan on 13 December 1996, North America on 1 October 1997, and finally in Europe in February 1998. The game sold close to half a million copies. Kono attributed some of this success to Resident Evil generating interest in horror games. The third game, Clock Tower II: The Struggle Within, known in Japan as Clock Tower: Ghost Head, was released in Japan in 1998 and North America in 1999. It was the first game in the series not directed by Kono, and released to critical failure. In Japan, the title is considered a spin-off. Human Entertainment went out of business in 2000, and Sunsoft became the sole owner of the Clock Tower intellectual property. A new game in the series, Clock Tower 3, was officially announced on 11 April 2001, with Capcom revealing they would be co-producing it with Sunsoft. They also revealed that acclaimed Japanese film director Kinji Fukasaku would be directing the cutscenes. The game was first shown at E3 in May 2002, where a non-playable demo was on show at the Capcom booth. Released in December later that year, Clock Tower 3 was a commercial failure. Capcom had projected sales of at least 450,000, but by the end of 2003, it had only sold 122,022 units. Clock Tower 3's commercial failure is speculated as the reason why Capcom and Sunsoft have not revisited the series since. Kono tried speaking to a publisher to run a reboot or rerelease of the series, but they did not agree because they felt horror games were difficult to market. = Related games = Capcom's 2005 survival horror title, Haunting Ground, has been called a spiritual successor to the Clock Tower series by fans and critics. The gameplay has been compared heavily to Clock Tower 3, but distinguishes itself by providing the player character with a dog companion which can attack enemies and solve puzzles. Haunting Ground was generally found to be average survival horror fare for the era, but the sexual objectification of the main character, Fiona, has been repeatedly highlighted as one of the game's strongest elements. Critics felt that the game's voyeuristic presentation and gameplay make Fiona appear more fragile, building a disturbing atmosphere.* * Hifumi Kono also created his own interpretation of a spiritual successor in the form of NightCry (2016), which features similar gameplay to the original Clock Tower games that Kono had directed. The game was crowdfunded through Kickstarter with a $300,000 budget. It received mixed reviews, being cited for bugs and dated gameplay.  Reception  The Clock Tower series has received mixed critical reception across its history. In retrospective reviews, the first title, Clock Tower (1995), received praise for its haunting atmosphere but was criticized for tedious puzzles and exploration. Despite these criticisms, it is considered instrumental in establishing the survival horror genre and a creating a model for future horror games to follow. Its sequel, Clock Tower (1996), was met with mixed reception as well. The horror themes and atmosphere were well-received, but the game's point-and-click gameplay and slow pace were found to be inferior to the growing landscape of action games on the PlayStation, especially Capcom's first Resident Evil title, which was released the same year. The third title, Clock Tower II, was met with unfavorable reviews. Critics heavily criticized the slow point-and-click interface and the flawed trial-and-error gameplay. Clock Tower 3 received similar reviews to the first two titles. The graphics, atmosphere and storyline received positive reviews, but again, the gameplay was a point of criticism. Critics believed the boss fights and repetitive hiding and chasing gameplay mechanics were weak. * Scissorman is often compared to Nemesis from Resident Evil 3 because he stalks his victims and disappears and reappears at various intervals throughout the games. He is also often identified as one of the scariest characters in video games because of his unrelenting nature and the difficulty to escape him.  Film adaptation  A film adaption of the Clock Tower series was first announced in June 2006. The film was to be directed by Chilean director Jorge Olguin. Todd Farmer, Jake Wade Wall, and David Coggeshall were set to write the script. In the pitched story, Alyssa Hamilton is called by her mother and told not to return home. After investigating, Alyssa uncovers that she possess a secret power enabling her to destroy evil servants that live off murdered victim's souls. She learns how to wield a weapon to defeat these evil forces. Production was set to begin in December 2006. Two years later, it was announced the film was now set to begin production in November 2008 in Los Angeles by another studio. Martin Weisz was set to direct the film, and Brittany Snow would star in it. In November 2011, David R. Ellis announced that he was now directing the film. No news has been announced of the film since, and Ellis died in 2013.

Leading a bandit gang of about 200 men, he robs travellers on roads in Qingzhou (in present-day Shandong). Joining Liangshan Duan Jingzhu steals a rare swift steed called \\"Jade Lion\\" at the northern frontier of the Song Empire, which he intends to present to Song Jiang, then second-in-command of the bandit stronghold of Liangshan Marsh. But while on his way, the horse is seized by the Zeng Family Fortress, which also verbally insults Liangshan. Mad over the humilitation, Chao Gai, the chief of Liangshan, personally leads a military attack on the fortress. But he is shot dead by Shi Wengong, the martial arts instructor of the fortress. After some distractions, Liangshan decides to avenge Chao Gai‚Äòs death. Song Jiang's determination is further strengthened after Yu Baosi seized more than 200 horses his men have purchased and were driving back to Liangshan, and took them to present to the Zengs. This time the Zengs find the Liangshan force that comes to its gate hard to beat. After losing two of his sons and fearing the fortress would fall, Zeng Nong, the patriarch of the Zeng family, sues for peace. Song Jiang sets the conditions that Yu Baosi as well as the \\"Jade Lion\\" and the other horses of Liangshan be handed over. Zeng Nong could meet all the demands except turning over the ‚ÄúJade Lion\\", which is possessed by Shi Wengong. Yu Baosi is sent over to the Liangshan camp as hostage in exchange for five chieftains from the Liangshan side. Wu Yong coaxes Yu to surrender, warning him that the Zengs are on their last leg. He also instructs him to dupe the Zengs to come out of the fortress to raid the Liangshan camp. Lastly he is to liaise with the Liangshan hostages, who would create havoc inside the fortress in coordination with the exterior attack. Yu returns to lie to the Zengs that Song Jiang is in panic as government troops are arriving to lend them assistance. He suggests this is the time to attack the Liangshan force. The Zengs take the bait. Their leaders are killed in the ambush while the fortress falls. Shi Wengoang is captured by Lu Junyi some distance away as he flees. The outlaws slaughter him in their revenge for Chao. When Song Jiang leads a military force toward Dongping Prefecture (Êù±Âπ≥Â∫ú; present-day Dongping County, Shandong) to seize its grain stock, Yu Baosi volunteers to go ahead first to persuade the prefect and Dong Ping, the place's military commander and an old pal of his, not to resist. Wang Dingliu goes along with him. However, Dong Ping disregards his acquaintance with Yu and suggests executing the two to strike fear among the outlaws. Not wanting to overly provoke Liangshan, the prefect only has them beaten and thrown out. Liangshan captures Dongping and wins over Dong Ping. Campaigns and death Yu Baosi is appointed as the chief flag bearer of Liangshan because of his striking height after the 108 Stars of Destiny came together in what is called the Grand Assembly.

Her' parents, George Joseph Hughes and Mary Frances Hughes, separated when she was an infant and divorced in 1923. After the divorce, Hughes's mother moved with her only child to Washington, D.C. Hughes' grandmother, Flora Fosdick, was described as a \\"star of grand opera and drama [who] played with Ethel Barrymore on the stage.\\" As a child Hughes began acting in stage productions. While acting in a school play in the early 1930s, her performance caught the attention of Clifford Brown, a repertory theatre company owner, who offered her a part in a touring production of Alice in Wonderland. While touring with another production in Brown's company, she was offered a contract from a talent scout with Gaumont-British Studios but declined the offer to finish high school. After graduating from high school in 1937 she returned to Brown's theatre company, where she continued to appear in various stage productions until the summer of 1938, when she relocated to Los Angeles with her mother to pursue a film career. After six months of failing to land movie roles, Hughes and her mother made plans to return to Washington, D.C., until Hughes met an agent, Wally Ross. Ross introduced Hughes to powerful William Morris agent Johnny Hyde. Hyde landed Hughes a contract with MGM, and she soon landed a small, uncredited role in the 1939 film Broadway Serenade. Film career After Broadway Serenade, Hughes appeared in other bit parts in films including The Women with Norma Shearer, Dancing Co-Ed with Lana Turner, and the Busby Berkeley film Fast and Furious.Allmovieguide.com: Filmography of Mary Beth Hughes In 1940 Hughes was offered a contract with 20th Century-Fox.

Bennett, which spawned several hits for Elvis Presley. Between 1945 and 1970, Tepper and Bennett published over 300 songs. Biography As a youth, Tepper's family moved to Brooklyn, where Tepper met his future musical collaborator, Roy C. Bennett. Their first hit was \\"Red Roses for a Blue Lady\\" (1948), recorded by Guy Lombardo and his Royal Canadians. Over the next 22 years, the songwriting team wrote for Tony Bennett, Rosemary Clooney, Peggy Lee, Frank Sinatra, Sarah Vaughan, Dean Martin, and many more. Tepper and Bennett adjusted well to the advent of rock 'n roll. In 1961 their song \\"The Young Ones\\" was instrumental in boosting the career of Cliff Richard, for whom they wrote 21 compositions. They went on to write 43 songs for Elvis Presley, the most of any songwriter, or song writing team (all related to his movies). In the 1970s Tepper suffered a heart attack, which necessitated the end of his songwriting partnership with Bennett. Tepper retired in Surfside, Florida. In 2002 he and Bennett were honored in Memphis for their part in Elvis Presley's career. Tepper lived in Surfside until 2004, when he moved to Williams Island in Aventura just north of the Miami area. He was honored by the town of Surfside for his works in 2008 as Sid Tepper Day. Tepper died on April 24, 2015, in Miami Beach, Florida, aged 96.

River is portrayed by actress Summer Glau in the 2002 TV series Firefly and the 2005 film Serenity. The nature of the character and her role in the franchise has garnered praise. In 2005, Summer Glau won the SFX Magazine award for Best Actress for her role as River in Serenity. Glau later won a Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress, again for her role as River in Serenity in May 2006. Glau was also runner up for Best Actress/Movie in the SyFy Genre Awards for 2006. Production details Joss Whedon selected Summer Glau for the role after having previously worked with her on another of his shows, Angel. River Tam was Glau's first major role. Glau's inexperience assisted her in playing the character: she likened River's emotional withdrawal to her own initial apprehension on the set. In many of the hand-to-hand combat scenes featuring the character, particularly those in Serenity, Glau's own experience in ballet dancing was incorporated into her fight choreography. Depiction During River's early childhood, she grew up alongside her brother, Simon, part of the wealthy Tam family on the \\"core\\" planet of Osiris. She was graceful and intellectually gifted. She is described as having a strong thirst for knowledge and a love for and intuitive grasp of dance. By the time she was fourteen years old, she had grown \\"bored\\" with her studies and enrolled in a graduate program for physics. It was at this point that she was sent to a government learning facility known as \\"The Academy\\".Serenity While her parents and Simon believed the Academy was a private school meant to nurture the gifts of talented children, it was in fact a cover for a government experiment in creating assassins. While in the hands of Alliance doctors and scientists, River was secretly experimented on, including surgery that damaged her amygdala.\\"Ariel (Firefly episode)\\" According to Simon, the Alliance attempted to isolate River from her family, though she managed to send a call for help by putting a coded message in a letter to her brother. Simon decoded the message and set out to rescue his then sixteen-year-old sister, despite his parents' insistence that he was being paranoid. In his quest to locate and free River, Simon enlisted the aid of anti-governmental groups, exhausting his personal fortune and sacrificing a promising medical career. The R. Tam sessions depict her descent into insanity and portray hints of her psychic abilities. She references the \\"G-23 Paxilon Hydrochlorate\\", which would later be a plot point in the film Serenity, and mentions the Academy's first subject \\"dying on the table.\\" The first session clip indicates she has strong \\"intuitive\\" abilities and can easily understand complex subjects. River is seen mostly barefoot throughout the series. Reception In 2005, Summer Glau won the SFX Magazine award for Best Actress for her role as River in Serenity. Glau later won a Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress, again for her role as River in Serenity in May 2006. Glau was also runner up for Best Actress/Movie in the SyFy Genre Awards for 2006. The nature of the character and her role in the franchise has garnered both praise and criticism from various reviewers. Some have positively likened the character's erratic behavior to autism. Dr. Karin Beeler of the University of Northern British Columbia compared and contrasted River to Buffy Summers, protagonist of the Buffy the Vampire Slayer franchise (also created by Joss Whedon), in her book Seers, Witches and Psychics on Screen: An Analysis of Women Visionary Characters in Recent Television and Film. Beeler labeled the character an anti-heroine, in comparison to the more heroic role of Buffy Summers. Film critic and horror author Michael Marano also compared the character to Buffy, citing the two characters' combat prowess as similarities and describing River as the apotheosis of Joss Whedon's strong female characters.

It featured twelve tropical cyclones, eleven of which became storms, six became hurricanes and three became major hurricanes. The first storm of the season, a tropical storm in the northern Caribbean Sea, formed on June 8; although it struck the United States, no major impacts were recorded. July saw a period of inactivity, with no known storms. However, in August, the streak of inactivity ended with two storms, including a powerful hurricane. September brought three storms, including a deadly hurricane, with catastrophic impacts in Pensacola and Mobile. October included three storms, with a powerful hurricane that killed over 200 people. The final storm of the season impacted Cuba in early November and dissipated on November 9. The season was quite deadly, with at least with 381 total recorded deaths. __TOC__  Methodology  Prior to the advent of modern tropical cyclone tracking technology, notably satellite imagery, many hurricanes that did not affect land directly went unnoticed, and storms that did affect land were not recognized until their onslaught. As a result, information on older hurricane seasons was often incomplete. Modern-day efforts have been made and are still ongoing to reconstruct the tracks of known hurricanes and to identify initially undetected storms. In many cases, the only evidence that a hurricane existed was reports from ships in its path, and judging by the direction of winds experienced by ships, and their location in relation to the storm, it is possible to roughly pinpoint the storm's center of circulation for a given point in time. This is the manner in which all of the eleven known storms in the 1906 season were identified by hurricane expert Jos√© Fern√°ndez-Partag√°s's reanalysis of hurricane seasons between 1851 and 1910. Partag√°s also extended the known tracks of three other hurricanes previously identified by scholars. The information Partag√°s and his colleague uncovered was largely adopted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Atlantic hurricane reanalysis in their updates to the Atlantic hurricane database (HURDAT), with some slight adjustments. HURDAT is the official source for such hurricane data as track and intensity, although due to a sparsity of available records at the time the storms existed, listings on some storms are incomplete.

On June 10, a weather station in Havana reported a minimum air pressure of 1002 mbar (hPa; 29.59 inHg); however, the minimum pressure of the system itself is unknown. On June 12, the system caused the sinking of a schooner; however, all on board the schooner were rescued. The system continued traveling north-northwestward, making landfall near Panama City on June 13, quickly weakening to a tropical depression as it moved inland. The system became extratropical by June 14, dissipating shortly thereafter; no deaths and injuries are known to have been caused by the storm. = Hurricane Two = This first hurricane of the season's effects were first noted in Santa Clara, Cuba, where rainy and windy conditions were observed on the afternoon of June 14. Several vessels sank during the hurricane during the early morning hours of June 15. The system was thought to have entered the Florida Straits during the evening. The system began to travel towards the west-northwest, steadily strengthening into a hurricane by the afternoon. On June 17, a minimum pressure of 979 mbar (hPa; 28.91 inHg) was recorded, as the hurricane passed over southern Florida. The hurricane slowly intensified as it traveled offshore, continuing to strengthen throughout the day on June 17, eventually reaching Category 2 status by June 18. As the storm headed northeastward, the hurricane began to weaken, becoming a tropical storm by June 21. The system turned toward the east-southeast on June 21, later recurving towards the east-northeast on June 22. It weakened to a tropical depression by June 23, transitioning into an extratropical cyclone later that day. Impacts caused by the hurricane were minimal‚Äîa boat was partially dismantled at Key West, and a wharf at Coconut Grove was also damaged. In addition, the schooner Hidie Feroe sank, although her crew was later rescued. = Tropical Storm Three = This tropical storm was previously unidentified until modern research by Jos√© Fern√°ndez-Partag√°s revealed the storm in 1997. The tropical storm is believed to have originated as a tropical depression in the North Atlantic on August 22. By August 23, the depression had intensified into a tropical storm, with winds of 40 mph (65 km/h). The system further intensified into a powerful tropical storm on August 24, with winds of 70 mph (110 km/h). However, the storm began to weaken, and it transitioned into an extratropical storm on August 25, with winds of 60 mph (95 km/h). = Hurricane Four = The fourth storm of the season was believed to have originated as a tropical storm off the coast of Africa on August 25. The storm slowly intensified, eventually reaching hurricane status on August 28. As the storm headed west-northwestward on August 31, it passed by the Lesser Antilles as a Category 2 hurricane. The storm became a Category 3 hurricane on September 2 as it passed north of the Dominican Republic. The storm further intensified into a Category 4 hurricane on September 5, located east of the Bahamas. Throughout the day on September 6, the hurricane began to curve northward. During the evening, it weakened to Category 3 status and began to travel northeastward on September 7. The hurricane maintained its intensity and passed northwest of Bermuda on September 9, where winds reached 70 mph (110 km/h) and air pressures fell to 988 mbar (hPa; 29.18 inHg). The storm continued to weaken, eventually becoming a Category 2 hurricane on September 11; at this time, the Koenigin Luise measured an air pressure of 950 mbar (hPa; 28.06 inHg). The system became extratropical later during the day, and lost its identity on September 12 in the North Atlantic near the British Isles. As a result of warnings in advance, little damage was caused by the hurricane. = Hurricane Five = The fifth storm of the season formed on September 3 in the western Atlantic. It drifted west-northwestward, slowly gaining intensity, and turned northwest on September 8. However, the tropical storm then changed course and began to head west-northwest on September 11 as it slowly intensified. By September 12, the tropical storm had intensified to a minimal hurricane, and began to turn towards the north-northwest on September 13. It attained its peak winds of 90 mph (150 km/h) on September 14. As it maintained its intensity on September 15, the hurricane began to turn westward while it continued to approach the coast of South Carolina on September 17. The hurricane made landfall near Myrtle Beach later on September 17, and quickly weakened to a tropical storm as it moved inland. The storm dissipated as a tropical depression on September 18 over Tennessee. The hurricane caused moderate impacts ‚Äî two hundred people were stranded at Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina. At Charleston, South Carolina, winds of 46 mph (74 km/h) were recorded, in addition to a barometric pressure of 997 mbar (hPa; 29.44 inHg). Many small buildings were damaged in Charleston; damage in the city totaled to $1,000, while at the town of Georgetown, damage was estimated to be around $15,000. The Laura encountered the hurricane, and three of the crew of four were killed. A schooner called the Seguranca and its crew were also impacted by the hurricane; the crew on board survived without food for two days. Overall damage to shipping and crops in the Carolinas was moderate; seven people were killed, and at least $2,016,000 (1906 USD) in damage was recorded. = Hurricane Six = The Mississippi Hurricane of 1906 The sixth hurricane of the season originated as a tropical depression on September 19 in the southwestern Caribbean Sea. The following day, the depression intensified into a tropical storm. It continued to intensify steadily, eventually reaching hurricane status on September 24 as it exited the Yucat√°n Channel. The hurricane continued to intensify as it moved north- northwest and attained Category 2 intensity in the Gulf of Mexico. During the afternoon, the storm intensified further into a major hurricane. At this time, the hurricane was 300 miles (480 km) west-northwest of Cuba. The hurricane maintained intensity and continued to drift north-northwest, and weakened to a Category 2 hurricane as it made landfall near Pascagoula, Mississippi, on September 27. The hurricane weakened as it moved inland, quickly weakening to a tropical storm by September 28. The storm became extratropical on September 29. The hurricane caused severe damage along the Gulf Coast. Many marine vessels were blown ashore or sunken in Pensacola, and railroads in the city were severely damaged. Numerous wharfs were damaged or destroyed, and many roofs were torn off buildings. Three forts in the vicinity of Pensacola suffered damage. Electricity in the city was shut off. A total of 35 people were killed in Pensacola. Mobile and surrounding areas suffered similar damage, including destroyed timber, smashed windows, and sunken watercraft. In Mississippi, over 300,000 cotton bales were ruined during the hurricane, amounting to $12,000,000 in damage. Damage in New Orleans was minimal; however, Lake Pontchartrain overflowed, flooding the city. The hurricane killed a total of 134 people. = Tropical Storm Seven = This tropical storm was previously unidentified and was not considered a tropical storm until research by Jos√© Fern√°ndez-Partag√°s in 1997. The storm is believed to have originated west of the Canary Islands in the northeastern Atlantic on September 22. The tropical storm moved west-southwestward for several days, maintaining its peak winds of 70 mph (110 km/h); however, the storm began to curve early on September 26 and traveled directly westward before curving northward during the afternoon. The tropical storm continued to change course, turning west-northwestward by September 28. The transitioned to an extratropical system on October 1, and reached England on October 3. = Hurricane Eight = The Florida Keys and Miami Hurricane of 1906 This hurricane originated on October 4 near Barbados as a \\"cyclonic perturbation\\"; however, no closed circulation was evidently associated with the system. Barometric pressures began sinking in Panama as the system drifted westward, and it was considered a tropical storm by October 8. As the storm headed west, it rapidly strengthened; the storm became a hurricane on October 9 and intensified into a major hurricane on October 10. As it began to curve northwestward, the hurricane made landfall in Nicaragua, and weakened to a tropical storm on October 11. It began to drift north-northwestward later that day, intensifying into a minimal hurricane as it drifted into the Gulf of Honduras. However, the hurricane weakened to a tropical storm again on October 14 as it moved overland, and began to curve north-northwest, restrengthening to a major hurricane by October 17 while it was west-southwest of Cuba. The hurricane made landfall over Cuba on the evening of October 17. The hurricane passed over southern Florida near Pigeon Key and Downtown Miami on October 18. The hurricane continued traveling north-northwest; however, it was forced to re-curve south-southwest, as a result of a high-pressure area. The hurricane weakened to a tropical storm overland, eventually becoming a tropical depression. The system meandered into the Gulf of Mexico, making a final landfall in Central America on October 23. The hurricane wreaked havoc throughout its path ‚Äî crops in Central America suffered severe damage, and rainfall destroyed many roads and bridges in Nicaragua. In Cuba, at least 29 people were killed, and tobacco crops in the country were ruined. The most severe damage was caused in Florida ‚Äî the state suffered more than $420,000 in damage and more than two hundred people were killed. Of the people killed in Florida, 135 were workers on the Florida East Coast Railway, and more than 70 people were drowned near Elliott Key after two steamers sank. Throughout its path, damage caused by the hurricane totaled to at least $4,135,000 and at least 240 deaths were recorded. = Tropical Storm Nine = A tropical storm was believed to have formed from a low-pressure area, possibly on the tail end of a cold front on October 14. The storm moved westward; however, it began to curve west-southwestward on October 15, as it reached its peak winds of 50 mph (85 km/h). The storm continued to trek towards the west-southwest on October 16, later making landfall in eastern Florida on October 17 as a tropical depression. No damage is known to have been caused by the tropical storm. = Tropical Storm Ten = The tenth storm of the season formed on October 15 as a tropical storm east of the Bahamas and north of Hispaniola. The tropical storm moved northwest, but changed direction and began to curve northeastward on October 17. As the storm moved eastward, it slowly strengthened; the storm attained its peak winds of 50 mph (85 km/h) on October 18. The tropical storm headed directly eastward on October 19, and dissipated in the open Atlantic on October 20. = Hurricane Eleven = The final storm of the season started as a tropical depression on November 5, located in the Caribbean, south of Cuba. It strengthened into a tropical storm later during the day as it curved northward, and the storm turned towards the northeast on November 6. As it approached Cuba, the storm briefly attained hurricane status; however, as the hurricane made landfall over Cuba, it weakened to a tropical storm. The storm drifted over the Bahamas as a minimal tropical storm on November 8 while it traced east-northeast. It continued to weaken, and transitioned into an extratropical storm on November 10. No damage is known to have been caused by the hurricane. Its path, its intensity, and the time of the year in which it formed are very similar to those of Hurricane Katrina of 1981.

This auk breeds on islands off California and Mexico. It is threatened by predators introduced to its breeding colonies and by oil spills. This species together with the Scripps's murrelet were considered conspecific and were known collectively as Xantus's murrelet until 2012. Enough evidence was collected to consider both species distinct based on a lack of evidence of interbreeding where the both species nest together on the San Benito Islands, differences in facial pattern and bill shape, vocalizatons and genetics. Description and range This species is a small black and white auk with a small head and thin sharp bill. It resembles the closely related Scripps's and Craveri's murrelet, with which it shares the distinction of being the most southerly living of all the auk species. It breeds from Guadalupe Island south to the San Benito Islands. After the breeding season it disperses locally at sea northward up to southern California in the United States. Behavior Guadalupe murrelet feeds far out at sea, often in association with large pelagic predatory fish like tuna, on larval fish like anchovies, sardines and Sebastes rockfish. Like all auks it is a wing-propelled diver, chasing down prey under the water with powerful wingbeats. There is some speculation that it may feed cooperatively in pairs, as it is almost always observed in pairs, even during the non-breeding season. It flies well, and can take off without taxiing. It nests in small crevices, caves and under dense bushes on arid islands in loose scattered colonies. It returns to the colony only at night, laying two eggs which are incubated for about a month. Like other synthliboramphine murrelets (e.g. the ancient murrelet) the chicks are highly precocial, leaving the nest within two days of hatching and running actively towards the sea, where the parents call to them. Once at sea the family swims to offshore waters. Little is known about the time at sea due to difficulties in studying them. Status and conservation By the end of the 20th century, the Xantus's murrelet complex was considered to be among the most endangered group of auk.IUCN Redlist (1988, 1994, 2000) This has changed since, but not because the present species' status has improved, but because other auks have become rarer. Guadalupe murrelet is mainly threatened by oil spills, as much of its population lives near the busy shipping lanes connecting Los Angeles to other ports. Because a large part of its small population nests in such a small area a single catastrophic oil spill could have far reaching implications. It is also threatened by introduced species such as rats and feral cats; this threat has been lessened lately by efforts to restore its habitat by removing introduced predators.

Background Tall and strong with shiny eyes, Sun Xin is the younger brother of Sun Li, garrison commandant of Dengzhou (ÁôªÂ∑û; in present-day eastern Shandong). Sun Li is nicknamed \\"Sick Yuchi\\" as he resembles the Tang dynasty general Yuchi Gong in looks although they definitely differ in complexion as Sun's is pale, and also in that one of his favourite weapons is a steel club. That nickname spilled over to Sun Xin, who is called \\"Little Yuchi\\", The Sun brothers' ancestral home is in Qiongzhou (ÁìäÂ∑û; present-day Hainan). Sun Xin's wife is Gu Dasao, a cousin of the hunter brothers Xie Zhen and Xie Bao. The couple run an inn in Dengzhou (ÁôªÂ∑û; in present-day eastern Shandong), not far from the rural home of the Xies. Prison raid in Dengzhou Gu Dasao receives news from the jailer Yue He of Dengzhou prison, whose sister is married to Sun Li, that Xie Zhen and Xie Bao have been jailed and might be murdered. The Xies have smashed up the house of one Squire Mao after failing to find a tiger they shot that had fallen into the old man's garden. In fact, the squire had sent the tiger to the prefecture office to claim reward. Gu consults with Sun Xin, who enlists the help of the outlaws Zou Yuan and Zou Run. Gu is worried that her brother-in-law Sun Li would stand in their way. So she pretends to be ill and gets Sun Li to visit her. When Sun appears, the couple threaten him to decide either to join them or fight them. Sun reluctantly signs on to their plan. With the help of Yue He, the group break into the prison and free the Xie brothers. They then flee to join the outlaws of Liangshan Marsh. Battle against the Zhu Family Village Before going up to the stronghold, Sun Li volunteers to infiltrate the Zhu Family Manor, which Liangshan has failed to take in two offensives. As Sun Li has learnt combat from the same teacher as Luan Tingyu, the martial arts instructor of the village, he wins the confidence of the Zhus. Sun Xin, together with his wife, Zou Yuan, Zou Run, the Xie brothers and Yue He, goes on a rampage inside the manor, taking it by surprise, when Sun Li gives his signal. The fall of the Zhu Family Manor is a huge contribution of the group before their acceptance into Liangshan. Campaigns and later life Sun Xin and his wife are put in charge of an inn which acts as a lookout of Liangshan after 108 Stars of Destiny came together in what is called the Grand Assembly. The couple participate in the campaigns against the Liao invaders and rebel forces in Song territory following amnesty from Emperor Huizong for Liangshan. Sun Xin and Gu Dasao survive the campaigns. Although conferred the title Martial Gentleman of Grace (), he does not want to serve the government and returns to Dengzhou with his wife and his brother, where he lives as a commoner.

A daughter of Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich of Russia, she was a first cousin of the last Russian emperor, Nicholas II. After the Russian Revolution, she emigrated first to France and later to the United States. She became a fashion model, socialite, vendeuse, and briefly pursued a career as a film actress.  Early life  She was born as Countess Natalia Pavlovna von Hohenfelsen at her parents' home, 2 Avenue Victor Hugo (now 4 Avenue Robert Schuman), in Boulogne-sur-Seine, close to Paris, France, on 5 December 1905.Vassiliev, Beauty in Exile, p. 435 She was the youngest child of Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich of Russia and his morganatic second wife, Olga Valerianovna Karnovich, who was of Hungarian descent. Her parents had met in St. Petersburg in 1895, when Olga Karnovich was married to an officer, by whom she had three children. Grand Duke Paul already was the father of two; his first wife, Princess Alexandra of Greece, had died in childbirth. On 9 January 1897, Olga gave birth to a son, Vladimir, by Grand Duke Paul. Olga was granted a divorce from her husband and soon left Russia to marry Paul in Livorno, Italy, on 10 October 1902. Grand Duke Paul and Olga were still vacationing in Rome when they were forbidden to return to Russia by Paul's nephew, the reigning Tsar Nicholas II. Their daughter Irina was born on 21 December 1903.Vassiliev, Beauty in Exile, p. 437 In 1904, Grand Duke Paul arranged through Prince Regent Leopold of Bavaria for his wife and their children to be granted the hereditary title of Count/Countess von Hohenfelsen, with a coat of arms. They settled in Paris and bought a house in Boulogne-sur-Seine that previously belonged to Princess Zenaide Ivanovna Youssoupoff. It was there that Natalia was born in 1905, completing their family. Paul and Olga employed a household staff of sixteen maids, gardeners, cooks, and tutors and were avid art and old porcelain collectors. Vladimir, Irina and Natalia had a happy and privileged upbringing and, for a time, were utterly protected from the outside world. Though their parents had a busy social life, the children were very close to them and they ate their meals together, an unusual custom for children of their time and station. On Sundays, the whole family would enter the Russian church on rue Daru, but they would only attend private mass with the priest who had christened Natalia.  Life in Russia  From left to right: Princess Olga Paley, her eldest son Alexander Erikovich von Pistohlkors, Olga Erikovna von Pistohlkors, Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich of Russia, Princess Irina Paley, Princess Natalia Paley, Prince Vladimir Paley, and Marianne Pistohlkors. In January 1912, Tsar Nicholas II forgave his only living uncle for marrying morganatically, and Grand Duke Paul returned to Russia on the occasion of the tercentenary of the Romanov family. He was followed later by his wife and their three children. In May 1914, the family settled in Tsarskoe Selo, in a luxurious palace filled with antiques and objects of art. In Russia, Natalia became close to her maternal grandmother, her half-sisters and half-brothers. Three months after they had settled into their new life, World War I began. During the war, the German title of Count/Countess von Hohenfelsen was deemed inappropriate due to anti German sentiment, so in August 1915, Nicholas II created the title of Prince/Princess Paley.Vassiliev, Beauty in Exile, p. 439 This was the name by which Natalia, her full siblings and their mother would be known from then on. In the same month, Natalia's brother, Prince Vladimir Paley, joined a regiment. Though he was in poor health, Natalia's father, Grand Duke Paul, ignoring his doctor's advice, left to take command of a Guards regiment in 1916. At the fall of the Russian monarchy in March 1917, instead of leaving the country, Grand Duke Paul and his wife, not seeing the dangers ahead, decided to stay in their luxurious estate amid the upheaval. As Tsar Nicholas II and his family were sent to internal exile in Siberia, Natalia and her family remained in their palace under increasingly deteriorating conditions after the Bolsheviks rise to power in October 1917. By early January 1918, they could no longer afford to heat their large Tsarkoe Selo palace, and they were forced to move to an English dacha at Tsarkoe Selo that belonged to Grand Duke Boris Vladimirovich.Hall, The English Dacha at Tsarkoe Selo, p. 27 Their former home was expropriated and turned into a museum, while Lenin himself rode in their car. Princesses Natalia and Irina Paley In March 1918, the revolution tightened its grip. All male members of the Romanov family, including Natalia's brother Vladimir, were ordered to register at Cheka headquarters, and shortly after they were sent away into internal Russian exile. They never saw Vladimir again. He was executed by the Bolsheviks, along with several other Romanovs relatives, on 18 July 1918, one day after the murder of Tsar Nicholas II and his immediate family at Yekaterinburg. Grand Duke Paul, who was too ill to travel, initially escaped the fate of his son. He was arrested on 30 July and sent to Spalernaia prison, where he would remain for most of his incarceration.Hall, The English Dacha at Tsarkoe Selo, p. 28 In desperation, Olga left her two youngest daughters, Irina and Natalia, aged 14 and 12, under the care of their English governess, moving with her daughter Marianne Pistohlkors to be closer to her husband's prison. Irina and Natalia, accompanied by their governess, were allowed to pay two visits to their father. The sisters lived alone with the servants until October, when Grand Duke Boris's dacha was expropriated, and the sisters were evicted. Natalia and Irina were forced to move to Petrograd with their mother and their half-sister, Marianne. Worried about her daughters, Olga, with the help of a few remaining friends, organized Irina and Natalia' escape. In early December, the girls left their mother and took a streetcar to the train station of Ochta. After a four-hour trip in a cattle wagon, they jumped into the snow and took a horse-drawn sleigh. Finally, they walked for miles in the frigid night air. After thirty-two hours of traveling, they reached Terijoki, the Finnish frontier. On arriving there, they continued their journey to Vyborg. Taken to a sanatorium in Ranha, they anxiously awaited their parents' arrival. Their father never made it. Grand Duke Paul was killed in January 1919, and tossed into a heap along with the bodies of other victims. The following month, Princess Olga joined her daughters in Finland.  Life in France  Princesses Irina, Olga and Natalia Paley Once in exile, Princess Paley and her daughters moved to Sweden, where they stayed until the spring of 1920. They eventually settled in exile in France. They sold their townhouse at Boulogne-sur-Seine and bought another in one of the upper-class neighborhoods of Paris in the 16th district. With her few remaining jewels, Princess Olga bought a villa in Biarritz, on the Atlantic coast, where the family would often gather in the future. Later, she would sell her house and buy a smaller one in Neuilly. Princess Natalia and her sister were sent to a boarding school in Switzerland, but Natalia was unable to mix with the other pupils. As she confessed later in a fashion magazine interview, she felt, > ...so different from the others. At twelve, French girls were still reading > Robinson Crusoe and watching Douglas Fairbanks movies. At twelve, I was > taking some bread to my father in jail. How could I have been like them? I > was mute, I would not play. But I was reading a lot. I had faced death, so > close. My father, my brother, my cousins, my uncles, executed, all Romanov's > blood splashed on my adolescence. This gave me a taste for sad things, > poetry, the icy and lightning antechamber of death. Soon, my classmates > understood me. And respected the way I was, as strange as it may have > seemed. The sisters came back to Paris, where Irina married Prince Feodor Alexandrovich of Russia, a nephew of Tsar Nicholas II, on 31 May 1923. Natalia Paley with her first husband, Lucien Lelong During one of the Charity Bazaars her mother gave every year, Princess Natalia, age 21, met Lucien Lelong, a prominent French couturier who offered her a job in his fashion house. She began to work initially in the perfume department, moving soon to model the house's designs. Lelong had inherited his famous fashion house from his father. A hero of World War I, he was then married and the father of a little girl. With her aristocratic background and her delicate features, Natalia was an asset for Lelong's business. Lucien Lelong divorced his wife, Anne-Marie Audoy, on 16 July 1927. Lelong was known for his homosexual affairs, but he offered her wealth and security. Against her family's opinion, who considered the union a misalliance, Princess Natalia and Lucien Lelong married in a civil ceremony on 9 August 1927. A religious ceremony took place the next day at the Orthodox church Saint Alexander Nevsky. Theirs was a white marriage, a union without intimacy. Lelong's reputation grew with the help of his wife, whose taste was exquisite. Ethereal and glamorous, Princess Natalia would not follow any fashion trend, but would dictate her own. Hats and gloves were her signature. With deep-set gray eyes and pale blond hair, she became a sought- after model, establishing an image for herself in the Parisian elite and becoming a well-known socialite. As a model, she appeared in many magazines, including Vogue.Coudert, Cafe Society, p.58 She was a favorite model for the great photographers of her time: Edward Steichen, Cecil Beaton, Horst P. Horst, Andr√© Durst and George Hoyningen-Huene. Natalia Paley worked as a model during the late 1920s and early 1930s Though they shared the same infatuation for the arts and fashion, the marriage of Princess Natalia and Lelong was not a success. Too involved with his work and in love with one of his famous models who was doomed to die of tuberculosis, Lelong never grew to understand his wife's languor, or her frequent outbursts of temper when she was out of the limelight. On her part, Natalia began a two-year affair with dancer Serge Lifar.Coudert, Cafe Society, p.62 Their relationship ended when she began a passionate but platonic relationship with Jean Cocteau, who, like Lifar and most men she was attracted to, was homosexual. Cocteau wanted to marry her and have a child with her, but Princess Natalia declined the offer. Their affair ended in the fall of 1932. She bought an apartment on the Esplanade des Invalides, where she entertained society and prominent artists. She continued to work as a photographic model in connection with Lelong's fashion house. In the spring of 1933, she began to pursue a film careerVassiliev, Beauty in Exile, p. 440 and studied acting with Belgian actress Eve Francis, the former wife of director Louis Delluc. Her first film was L'epervier (1933), directed by Marcel L'Herbier, her husband's cousin. It was the beginning of her career as a movie actress, taking parts in several European movies, including Sir Alexander Korda's The Private Life of Don Juan (1934). She eventually moved to the United States, where she had a small role in George Cukor's Sylvia Scarlett (1935), a film starring Katharine Hepburn, who became a lifelong friend. Princess Paley's acting skills were modest. Her name and her beauty were her main assets, and her film career never took off. In 1936, she returned briefly to France to film The New Men (Les Hommes nouveaux) with Jean Marais, under the direction of Marcel L'Herbier. Les Hommes nouveaux was a success in Europe, but marked the end of Princess Paley's acting career.  Life in the United States  Natalia Paley with her second husband, John C. Wilson Upon her return to the United States, Princess Natalia settled permanently in New York City. There, she met John C. \\"Jack\\" Wilson, a theater producer and director, who had previously been the lover of No√´l Coward. After divorcing Lelong on 24 May 1937, Princess Natalia married Wilson on 8 September 1937 in Fairfield, Connecticut.\\"Princess Paley Wed in Fairfield\\", The New York Times, 9 September 1937 It was a marriage of convenience. Wilson was intelligent, rich and a good companion. Princess Natalia's name and social skills were assets to his business as a Broadway producer. Princess Natalia liked her husband's humor, and his homosexuality suited her distaste for physical love. The couple, who would not have children, settled in an apartment in Manhattan overlooking Central Park. They traveled extensively: Saint Moritz, London, and Venice were favorite vacation spots. World War II affected Princess Natalia only because her family and friends were living abroad. Though she went back to France in 1947, she spaced out her trips to Europe and spent more time in her luxurious residence: an apartment on East 57th Street in Manhattan. Later, she moved to another one on Park Avenue. She also had a cottage in Montego Bay, Jamaica, and a large property in Fairfield, Connecticut.Vassiliev, Beauty in Exile, p. 441 On 5 February 1941, Princess Natalia became a naturalized American citizen.\\"Ex-Princess Becomes Citizen\\", The New York Times, 9 February 1941 She was a well-known socialite in New York City and was popular at fashionable events for her beauty and glamor. For many years, Princess Natalia worked in public relations as a promoter of the fashion house Mainbocher. She was a friend of Elsa Maxwell and became a confidante of Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry. In the 1940s and early 1950s, Princess Natalia had a lengthy romantic relationship with writer Erich Maria Remarque, who fictionalized her as \\"Natascha\\" in his posthumous novel, Shadows in Paradise.Hilton Tims, Erich Maria Remarque: The Last Romantic (Da Capo Press, 2004), pages 125+Julie Goldsmith Gilbert, Opposite Attraction: The Lives of Erich Maria Remarque and Paulette Goddard (Pantheon Books, 1995) During the 1950s, Wilson's career declined. He was a heavy drinker and became mentally imbalanced. Natalia tried to help him, but he was self-destructive. Confined to a wheelchair, often violent, and in a state of increasing dementia, he died in November 1961, at age 62.  Final years  After the death of her husband, Princess Natalia withdrew from society. In the last two decades of her life, she lived as a recluse, surrounded by her pets in her Manhattan apartment.Vassiliev, Beauty in Exile, p. 443 Her only hobbies were watching television and crosswords. She developed diabetes and progressively lost her vision. Her blindness isolated her further. Letters and phone calls to her sister Irina were rare. In the 1970s, her nephew Prince Michel Feodorovich Romanoff went to visit her at her Manhattan apartment. She declined to see him, to prevent him from seeing her sad condition. In December 1981, Princess Natalia suffered a fall in her bathroom. Doctors diagnosed a fracture of the femoral neck. She was transported to Roosevelt Hospital where, against the advice of her last two friends who feared a fatal outcome, surgeons decided to operate on the same night. Princess Natalia died at dawn on 27 December 1981, at Roosevelt Hospital in New York. She was buried in the churchyard of the First Presbyterian Church in Ewing, New Jersey.

Established in 1999, its intake of students comes from three surrounding high schools, namely Quakers Hill High School, Riverstone High School, and Seven Hills High School. They, with Wyndham College, make the Nirimba Collegiate Group of Schools. The Collegiate group operates in such a way that each school maintains its independence yet they are closely related through the collaborative leadership of the four principals involved and through sharing at all levels including staffing and resources. The College is situated on the Nirimba Education Precinct co- located with: the University of Western Sydney, Blacktown; Western Sydney Institute of TAFE-Nirimba College and St John Paul II Catholic College, Senior Campus. Set in a bushland environment, Wyndham College has native award- winning gardens and a tributary of Eastern Creek flows through the campus. The College provides an academic and vocational subject offering for students with a range of learning experiences. Students have the opportunity to access courses offered by the College, University and TAFE. The HSC Life Skills Program is provided for support students identified with mild or moderate disabilities. Visual artworks completed by students from the college are regularly nominated and featured in Art Express. History Wyndham College was named after the previous NSW Director General of Education, Harold Wyndham who was visionary in implementing the HSC for Year 12 students and the School Certificate for Year 10 students. Wyndham College is built on the former site of the naval training base , and the campus derives its name, \\"Nirimba Education Precinct\\", from this historical connection. School Crest Wyndham College's crest was designed by the school's founding principal, Ian Wing, in 1998. The crest features Wyndhams's motto of \\"Working Together to Widen Horizons\\", with a representation of a book. Traditionally the book is associated with learning and the motto refers to the broad curriculum that the students have access to through the school's links with the precinct partners - TAFE, Western Sydney University and St John Paul II Catholic College. Wyndham College Clock Tower Admissions and Enrolment Students who attend the Collegiate Year 7-10 schools of Riverstone High School, Quakers Hill High School, and Seven Hills High School have automatic right of entry into Wyndham College for their senior years of schooling. As such, the College serves a large and diverse community from established areas in Seven Hills and Kings Langley, newly developed urban areas in Quakers Hill, Acacia Gardens, Stanhope Gardens, Rouse Hill and Schofields to the more semi-rural communities of Riverstone and Marsden Park. Outside of the collegiate schools, acceptance to Wyndham College is highly competitive with many students applying for limited enrolment places each year. The school's enrolment committee conducts interviews with prospective students and their parents when making their decisions about entry for applicants.

His career is a history of associations with bandleader Glenn Miller and former musicians and singers who worked with Miller. His band is also associated with the careers of Eydie Gorm√©, Henry Mancini and Ronnie Deauville. Beneke also solos on the recording the Glenn Miller Orchestra made of their popular song \\"In The Mood\\" and sings on another popular Glenn Miller recording, \\"Chattanooga Choo Choo\\". Jazz critic Will Friedwald considers Beneke to be one of the major blues singers who sang with the big bands of the early 1940s.Will Friedwald singles out the cover of \\"What's Your Story, Morning Glory?\\" by Mary Lou Williams that Beneke did with the Miller band, as one of Beneke's major artistic achievements. Friedwald, p. 613 Early life Beneke was born in Fort Worth, Texas. He started playing saxophone when he was nine, going from soprano to alto to tenor saxophones and staying with the latter. His first professional work was with bandleader Ben Young in 1935, but it was when he joined the Glenn Miller Orchestra three years later that his career hit its stride. Beneke said: \\"It seems that Gene Krupa had left the Goodman band and was forming his own first band. He was flying all over the country looking for new talent and he stopped at our ballroom one night [to listen to the Ben Young band]. [...] Gene wound up taking two or three of our boys with him back to New York. [Krupa] wanted to take [Beneke] but his sax section was already filled.\\" Krupa knew that Glenn Miller was forming a band and recommended Beneke to Miller. Whatever concerns Miller might have had about Beneke's playing were quickly dismissed; Miller immediately made Beneke his primary tenor sax soloist and Beneke played all but a few of the tenor solos on all of the records and personal appearances made by the Miller band until it disbanded in 1942. On the August 1, 1939, recording made of the Joe Garland composition \\"In The Mood\\", Beneke trades two-measure tenor solo exchanges with his fellow section-mate Al Klink.(Lyrics were later added to \\"In the Mood\\" by lyricist Andy Razaf.) Miller's 1941 recording of \\"A String of Pearls\\" (composed by the band's arranger, Jerry Gray) also has Beneke and Klink trading two-measure tenor solo phrases. Beneke appears with Miller and his band in the films Sun Valley Serenade (1941) and Orchestra Wives (1942), both of which helped propel the singer/saxophonist to the top of the Metronome polls. Tex Beneke is listed in the personnel of the 1941 Metronome All-Star Band led by Benny Goodman.The songs Beneke and the ensemble played were \\"Bugle Call Rag\\" and \\"One O'Clock Jump\\". Beneke has a small solo on \\"Bugle Call Rag\\". Both songs from recording session at RCA Studio 2, New York City, January 16, 1941. All information taken from annotation to the 1988 Bluebird/RCA compact disc, The Metronome All-Star Bands, 7636-2-RB, liner notes by Peter Keepnews. In 1942, Glenn Miller's orchestra won the first Gold Record ever awarded for \\"Chattanooga Choo Choo\\"; the song was written by Harry Warren and Mack Gordon as part of the score for the 1941 Twentieth Century Fox movie Sun Valley Serenade which was primarily made for the purpose of putting the Miller band in a motion picture.Simon. ‚Äì p.289. Tex Beneke was the featured singer in the movie and on the Victor/Bluebird recording that also featured band vocalist Paula Kelly and the Modernaires, a vocal group of four male singers, who were also regular members of the Miller entourage. \\"Chattanooga Choo Choo\\", catalogue number Bluebird 11230-B, was recorded by the Miller band at the Victor recording studios in Hollywood, May 7, 1941.Moonlight Serenade. p.303. Hoping to repeat the success of \\"Chattanooga\\" the following year, songwriters Warren and Gordon composed \\"I've Got a Gal in Kalamazoo\\" for the \\"Orchestra Wives\\" score. That arrangement also featured Beneke, the Modernaires and band vocalist Marion Hutton in a not-too-dissimilar fashion. Not surprisingly, \\"Kalamazoo\\" became another hit record for Miller, Beneke and the band though not to the extent that \\"Chattanooga\\" had been the year before. By then, the U.S. was involved in World War II and \\"Kalamazoo's\\" success was also short-lived partially because Miller disbanded his group only three months after the record was made and four months following the filming of \\"Orchestra Wives\\". When Miller broke up the band in August 1942 to join the Army Air Force, Beneke played very briefly with Horace Heidt before joining the Navy himself, leading a Navy band in Oklahoma. While employed with Miller, Beneke was offered his own band, as Miller had done with colleagues and employees like Hal McIntyre, Claude Thornhill and Charlie Spivak. Beneke wanted to come back to Miller after the war and learn more about leading a band before being given his own band. Beneke led two bands in the navy and kept in touch with Glenn Miller while they were both serving in the military. By 1945, Beneke felt ready to lead his own orchestra.Hall. ‚Äì p.191. Working with the Miller estate Glenn Miller went missing on December 15, 1944, while flying to France from England. After World War Two, the United States Army Air Force decommissioned the Glenn Miller-led Army Air Force band. The Miller estate authorized an official Glenn Miller \\"ghost band\\" in 1946. This band was led by Tex Beneke who as time went on had more prominence in the band's identity. It had a make up similar to Glenn Miller's Army Air Force Band, having a large string section.Simon. ‚Äì pp.437‚Äì439. The orchestra's official public d√©but was at the Capitol Theatre on Broadway where it opened for a three-week engagement on January 24, 1946. Henry Mancini was the band's pianist and one of the arrangers. Another arranger was Norman Leyden, who also previously arranged for the Glenn Miller Army Air Force Band. This ghost band played to very large audiences all across the United States, including a few dates at the Hollywood Palladium in 1947, where the original Miller band played in 1941.Simon. ‚Äì p.258. The movie short Tex Beneke and the Glenn Miller Band was released by RKO pictures in 1947 with Lillian Lane, Artie Malvin and The Crew Chiefs vocal group performing. In a slightly sarcastic article in Time magazine from June 2, 1947,\\"Old Miller fans remembered Tex Beneke best as the whiny-voiced singer of 'Chattanooga Choo Choo' and 'My Melancholy Baby' [...]\\" and \\"[The band's theatrics are] corny, but Glenn was one for commercial corn. If you don't have it you flop.\\" the magazine notes that the Beneke-led Miller orchestra was playing at the same venue the original Miller band played in 1939, the Glen Island Casino. Beneke's quote about the big band business at the time closes the article, \\"I don't know whether Glenn figured that times would be as tough\\". By 1949, economics dictated that the string section be dropped.Butcher. p.263. This band recorded for RCA Victor, just as the original Miller band did. Beneke believed that Miller had promised him his own band in the early 1940s, and this was his chance to have that promise fulfilled. Beneke wanted a band with Beneke's musical identity. Larry Bruff, an announcer for the earlier Glenn Miller radio shows says, \\"Beneke would even set wrong tempos so as not to sound too much like Glenn.\\"Simon. ‚Äì p.438. The Miller estate wanted a band that was primarily associated with Glenn Miller, playing the Glenn Miller songs in the Glenn Miller style. By 1950, Beneke and the Miller estate parted ways.Simon. ‚Äì p.439.George Simon in Glenn Miller and His Orchestra says it happened in Connecticut in December 1950. Simon. ‚Äì p.439. ‚ÄîBeneke says it happened after an engagement at the Hollywood Palladium. ‚Äì Hall. ‚Äì p.191. After Miller Beneke continued to perform under his own name with no official connection to Miller. He enjoyed less success in the early 1950s, partly because he was limited to smaller recording labels such as Coral Records and partly because of competition from other Miller alumni and imitators such as Jerry Gray, Ray Anthony and Ralph Flanagan. Eydie Gorm√© sang with the Beneke band in 1950. Beneke appeared on Cavalcade of Bands, a television show in 1950 on the DuMont Television Network. In the latter part of that decade there was some revived interest in music of the swing era. Beneke joined a number of other leaders such as Larry Clinton and Glen Gray in making new high fidelity recordings of their earlier hits, often featuring many of the original musicians. Beneke and former Miller singers Ray Eberle, Paula Kelly, and The Modernaires first recorded the LP Reunion in Hi-Fi, a 1958 Coral Records album which contained recreations of original Miller material. This was followed by others featuring newer songs, some performed in the Miller style and others done in a more contemporary mode. Among the best- known is Christmas Serenade in the Glenn Miller Style (1965) on Columbia Records, which has been excerpted on a number of holiday compilations. The singer/saxophonist continued working in the coming decades, appearing periodically at Disneyland.Beneke appeared with singers associated with Glenn Miller, Paula Kelly, Ray Eberle and the Modernaires, at Disneyland in Anaheim, California in 1963 and 1965. Popa, Chris. \\"Big Bands At Disneyland\\". He also made the rounds of various talk shows that had musical connections, including those hosted by Merv Griffin and Johnny Carson. His appearances on The Tonight Show sometimes included duos with fellow Miller veteran Al Klink who was by then a key member of The Tonight Show Band. Ray Eberle recovered from his earlier illness and resumed performing with Beneke and the Modernaires for a period in the early 1970s. In 1972, Beneke agreed to re-record some of his Miller vocals for Time-Life Records' set of big band recreations, The Swing Era, produced and conducted by yet another Miller alumnus, Billy May. During the 1970s and 1980s, Beneke had a new band playing a style that resembled the classic Miller sound but with as much newer material as older. At one point he also toured with former Jimmy Dorsey vocalists Helen O'Connell and Bob Eberly. Beneke suffered a stroke in the mid-1990s and was forced to give up the saxophone but continued to conduct and sing. In 1991, Tex Beneke received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame with funds collected by co-leader Gary Tole. He settled in Costa Mesa, California and remained active toward the end of that decade, mostly touring the U.S. West Coast and still playing in something resembling the Miller style. In 1998 he launched yet another tour paying tribute to The Army Air Force Band. Death In 2000 Beneke died from respiratory failure at a nursing home in Costa Mesa, California, aged 86 and was buried in Greenwood Memorial Park in Fort Worth, Texas. He was survived by his wife, Sandra, of Santa Ana, California. His saxophone is currently used by the Arizona Opry.

At their peak in popularity in the first half of the 19th century in the United States, the Shakers had approximately 4,000-6,000 members. , the Shakers currently have at least two active members; little to no extant religious or ethnic groups have fewer members than the Shakers.Adherents.comJeannine Lauber: Exploring the modern-day Shakers The Independent, December 8, 2009The last of the Shakers Busted Halo, April 13, 2010  Issues  Perhaps most significant to the hostility towards Shakers concerned their celibacy, millenarianism, and views on race and gender. The main current writer on anti-Shakerism compares allegations against them as similar to other celibate religious groups like Roman Catholic monks and nuns,Faculty Research and Scholarship Newsletter, Volume 1, n 2 The College of Arts and Sciences, The University of New England, Fall 2001, archived on October 4, 2007 from the original although there are also similarities with hostility to Mormons or Masons. People who formerly resided in Shaker communities even wrote anti-Shaker tracts as some former, or allegedly former, nuns did. Their millenarian views drew ire that in some respects is more understandable. Under Joseph Meachem, beliefs concerning God coming to destroy the Anti-Christ and create a better world grew more pronounced. The Shaker convert Frederick W. Evans in 1888 wrote an essay, based more on his enthusiasm than mainstream Shakerism, called a \\"Shaker reconstruction of the American Government.\\"Joan Kidd, Wainwright Ch 11. The Transformation of Society. In it he exclaimed such a reconstruction event would cause poverty to disappear. Other individual Shakers proclaimed messages of joy or disaster were given to them by God or spirits. Even if none of this had official acceptance some blamed Shakerism and took these events to mean the Shakers had occult aspects that inspired domination or damnation of the lands they settled. The Shakers were also among the first groups to refer to God as Father/Mother or to alternatively refer to God as Mother sometimes while referring to God as Father at other times. They viewed God as a duality containing God the Father and a feminine Holy Spirit. This dualist and half- feminine view of God put them radically out of the mainstream. Also their tendency toward \\"petticoat government\\", a term used by a Shaker named Philemon Stewart, aroused suspicion among local men. In reality Shaker women largely conformed to nineteenth century expectations of domesticated femininity and left much of the financial aspect to Shaker men, but their official equality and leadership roles aroused suspicion. Shakers appeared for the time to be radical on women's issues and the elevation of Mother Ann Lee as a crucial part of the Second Coming outraged mainstream Christians as being blasphemous. They also tended to believe in racial equality and harmony although in ways that sound vaguely condescending today. For example, songs said to be \\"inspired by American Indian spirits\\" tended to involve stereotyped pidgin English like \\"Me love Mother and she love me Quille ose van da wahaw me!\\" (notebook from their Golden Harvest CD) Still these beliefs caused them the most violence as it encouraged them to harbor fugitive slaves or American Indians.  Apostate literature  A strong source of literature hostile to a religion or group comes from former members or apostates. This is as true of Shakerism as it is of other groups. In the case of apostate Shakers there are strong similarities between their tracts and those written by ex-nuns or ex- Mormons. The most significant Shaker apostate writer was likely Mary Marshall Dyer whose anti-Shaker efforts ran from 1815 to 1852. In 1813 she had joined the Shakers of Enfield, New Hampshire, with her husband and family. However two years later she left blaming them for alienating her from her children. Despite that her husband and her family decided to stay. After that she did tours and wrote tracts against the Shakers. The main writings she did were A Brief Statement of the Sufferings of Mary Dyer and A Portraiture of Shakerism in 1822. She also got a mob together to storm the Enfield Shaker Community to take her children back, but this effort failed. For one her husband Joseph remained devout to the community and criticized her in strong terms. Only one of her five children ever left the Shakers and he never became close to her. By the 1850s her anti-Shaker views seemed extreme, in New England at least, and she died as a largely forgotten figure in 1867.  Anti-Shakerism today  During the twentieth century the Shakers went into significant decline, so hostility to Shakerism did as well. Although never a large denomination, their influence had been disproportionate due to their skills at seed businesses and their general productivity. However technology and culture changed so by the 1970s the faith had been reduced to a scattering of elderly women and men. This decline led even ex-Shakers to view them in relatively positive terms. This began in the 1860s as toward the end of her life Mary Dyer had difficulty making friends among apostate Shakers. They viewed her as too harsh and her son never reconnected with her furthering the discomfort with her. As the group declined further most viewed them as being, at worst, sexually repressed eccentrics who at least made nice furniture. A more common view saw them as quaint or even idyllic. There remain small elements of the Christian countercult movement that still use the Shakers as an example of a cult. Robert S. Liichow links it more to real or perceived New-Age cults. Lastly some indicate the term \\"Shaker\\" itself is an abusive one and that the proper term is \\"The United Society of Believers in Christ's Second Appearing,\\" although as with the Quakers, that issue has largely ebbed.

The devices are often called optical disk libraries, robotic drives, or autochangers. Jukebox devices may have up to 2,000 slots for disks, and usually have a picking device that traverses the slots and drives. The arrangement of the slots and picking devices affects performance, depending on the space between a disk and the picking device. Seek times and transfer rates vary depending upon the optical technology used. Jukeboxes are used in high- capacity archive storage environments such as imaging, medical, and video. Hierarchical storage management is a strategy that moves little-used or unused files from fast magnetic storage to optical jukebox devices in a process called migration. If the files are needed, they are migrated back to magnetic disk. Optical disc libraries are also useful for making backups and in disaster recovery situations. Today one of the most important uses for jukeboxes is to archive data. Archiving data is different from backups in that the data is stored on media designed to last up to 100 years. The data is usually written on Write Once Read Many (WORM)-type discs so it cannot be erased or changed.Mesnik, Bob \\"How to comply with the archiving regulations without paying an arm and a leg\\" https://kintronics.com/how-to-comply-with- the-archiving-regulations-without-paying-an-arm-and-a-leg/ Jukeboxes typically contain internal SCSI- or SATA-based recordable drives (CD-ROM, CD-R, DVD-ROM, DVD-R, DVD-RAM, UDO or Blu-ray) that connect directly to a file server and are managed by a third-party jukebox management software. This software controls the movement of media within the jukebox, and the pre-mastering of data prior to the recording process. Before the advent of the modern SAN and much cheaper hard disks, high-volume storage on DVD was more cost-effective than magnetic media. Jukebox capacities have greatly increased with the release of the 50 gigabyte (GB) dual layer Blu-ray (BD) format, with a road-map to increase to eight layers and 200 GB per disc. The current format, used in the DISC7000, allows 35 TB of storage from a single 700-disc jukebox. Optical disc libraries like the TeraStack Solution can store up to 142 TB of online and nearline data with a nominal power draw of 425 watts.Green Data Storage http://www.tmcnet.com/usubmit/2010/01/14/4572041.htm These two units show the wide variance of product attributes.  History  One of the first examples of an optical jukebox was the unit designed and built at the Royal Aerospace Establishment at Farnborough, England. The unit had twin read/write heads, 12\\" WORM disks and the carousels were pneumatically driven. It was produced to replace the 1/2 inch magnetic tape devices that were being used to store satellite data.  Management software  The core functionality of optical library management software can be broken down into four parts: robotic control, filesystem authoring, file tracking, and access control. = Robotic control = All optical libraries comply with the standard SCSI command set. These commands are used for control and library geometry querying. When the management software is run, it will send inquiry requests to the optical library for the status of its contents. Number and type of drives, number and status of slots and other essential information is gathered. Following this, the management software may request data off of a particular piece of media or it may wish to perform some write operations on it. Any of these actions would require specific move commands sent from the management application to the optical library. An example of this would be to move a media from slot 50 to the drive number 3. = Filesystem authoring = Optical library management software handles all of the writing and reading of the filesystem content on the optical media. Once a media has been placed in a drive from its home slot, many operations can be taken. For example: The creation of a UDF filesystem on a blank media, the writing of a single file, or the reading of some data off of the filesystem on the media. Filesystem types available for optical media range from ISO standard technologies like UDF to proprietary formats. = File tracking = Optical library management software will often track the files and folders extant on a piece of optical mediaStorageQuest, File and folder tracking with SAM by means of a database. Any filesystem data pertaining to an individual media would be available in this database. For example: paths and names of files and folders, file sizes, and all of the metadata that a modern filesystem may keep. = Access control = Optical library management software makes itself available to the OS in an assortment of ways. One of these ways in a Windows environment, is by way of virtual drive letters.StorageQuest, Virtual drive letter access to an optical library Essentially, the whole of an optical library can be viewed, read to and written to via a virtual filesystem while the management software handles all of the media movement and I/O requests invisibly in the background. Another way that access to the optical library may be accomplished is by way of CIFS shares (more often seen with Unix-type optical library management applications).StorageQuest, CIFS shares on the Linux-based MSM  Access time issues  All the jukeboxes work best when only a few users need to access the discs at the same time. Small jukeboxes have only one or two CD, DVD, UDO or Blu-ray drives, so only one or two users can share the jukebox at the same time. If additional users want to use a new disc, they have to wait for the disc to be swapped by the robotics in the jukebox. This takes from 4 to 9 seconds. Larger jukeboxes have six or more readers, so more users can simultaneously access the different discs at the same time. A more efficient recommendation is to have a disk cache attached to the jukebox for a higher number of simultaneous users. This way, the configuration operates in a FILO (First In Last Out) Manner. Here, files accessed are only sent back to the optical discs after they have been utilized. Changes may or may not be saved or versioned based on the user configuration and accessibility settings on the storage management software that runs the optical jukebox. The number of drives in the jukebox can be up to six depending on the size of the jukebox. The drives will read and write the data to the RAID / Disc cache and then present to end users. This way the 4‚Äì6 seconds read time only occurs during the initial data read process, then the data is sent to the cache.

Galston is located from the city at 36 kilometres north-west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the Hornsby Shire. Galston is in the NSW state electoral district of Hornsby and Federal division of Berowra. Galston is situated 16 minutes away from the suburb of Hornsby. History The aboriginal inhabitants of the region were from the Dharug language group. The area was originally known as Upper Dural until early settler Alex Hutchinson suggested in 1886 that the new school be named Galston after the town of Galston, East Ayrshire in Scotland. Galston had been an agricultural town since European settlement began, and it was home to a huge number of orchid growers. Galston Public School, Fagan Park and Waddell Cottage are some notable historical places in Galston. In 1973 Galston was proposed as one option for Sydney's second international airport but this proposal did not proceed. Population In the 2016 Census, there were 3,139 people in Galston. 78.2% of people were born in Australia. The next most common country of birth was England at 5.1%. 87.5% of people spoke only English at home. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 26.6%, Catholic 25.1%, Anglican 22.5% and Uniting Church 5.8%. Landmarks  Heritage listings  Galston has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * 161 Main Road: Tunks Creek bridge, Galston * 11 School Road: Galston Congregational Church Pipe Organ =Galston Gorge= Galston Gorge is located between Galston and Hornsby Heights. Galston Gorge is at the bottom of Galston Road, a winding road with a number of hairpin bends. Galston Gorge is the most direct route from Galston to Hornsby, carrying over 5,000 vehicles per day. As seen in the photograph the Galston Gorge road does get extremely wet and occasionally surface flooding occurs during heavy rain. The design of the Galston Gorge road is such it requires heightened care when driving or riding - it was built originally for horse and cart. Serious accidents are common on this stretch of road. Wild chickens inhabit the lower reaches and can often be seen scratching around in the leaf litter beside the road. In January, 2014 a car flipped in the Galston Gorge. Over the years the Gorge has been blocked by oversized vehicles attempting to enter the Gorge. Vehicles over 7.5 metres are not permitted to enter the Gorge. A roundabout at the intersection of Calderwood Road and Galston Road has a barrier to prevent vehicles over 7.5 metres from entering the Gorge. Cameras are positioned next to the roundabout to record over sized vehicles that attempt to enter the Gorge, and significant fines are imposed.Galston Gorge- NSW Roads & Traffic Authority =Waddell Cottage= Historic Waddell Cottage, which is the former family home of one of the original orchard growers in the area, is situated next to Galston High School. The land on which Waddell Cottage sits on was handed over to the NSW Department of Education & Training over 40 years ago. A decision was made to keep the historic Waddell Cottage due to its long history. Waddell Cottage has been repaired numerous times and is well kept. The cottage is surrounded by a small garden which is in excellent condition. The cottage was built in 1866 by James Waddell. =History Cottage= History Cottage, owned by Hornsby Council and located next to Hayes Park (Galston Recreation Reserve), is the home of the Dural & District Historical Society. =Buddhist Temple= The Buddhist Golden Wheel Temple on Galston Road is a modern building with magnificent gardens tended by members of the temple community. The gardens, which feature flowering peach trees, are open to the public in early September each year. =Crusaders= The Crusader Union of Australia runs a Christian education campsite at 8 Crusader Road, Galston. In a bushland location, The Galston Gorge Conference & Recreation Centre is used for church camps, music camps, school camps and community groups and accommodates up to 200 guests in lodges with ensuite bathrooms and lounge areas. =Fagan Park= Fagan Park is a large recreation area located at Arcadia Road opened in 1988. It includes the Gardens of Many Nations and a picnic area at Carrs Bush. Fagan Park was originally owned by the Fagan family as farming land before it was donated to the Department of Lands where then the land was appointed to the Hornsby Shire Council who currently maintain the land. Fagan Park's ecogarden was featured on a Gardening Australia episode which was broadcast on 12 July 2014. alt=Fagan Park Commercial areas  = Galston Shopping Village = The Galston shopping village is on Galston Road. The Galston Community Bendigo Bank branch which is a huge sponsor of the Galston community is also situated on Galston Road next to the Galston Shopping Village. Franklins Supermarket was located there. The Galston Branch Library is situated in the deconsecrated Anglican Church opposite. Swane's Nursery on Galston Road is a regular stop for tour groups from all over Sydney. Until recently, this nursery with its ornamental gardens and magnificent rose displays was owned by the local Swane family. There is no heavy industry in Galston. Many small businesses are run from homes in the area. Agriculture is a significant industry, with a number of orchards growing citrus, persimmons, strawberries and stone fruit. Some properties grow hydroponic produce. Chickens are raised on several properties with Summertime Chickens being one of the largest businesses in the area as well as Game Farm. There are numerous small specialist and larger retail plant nurseries in the Galston area. = New Galston Shopping Village Complex = The new Galston Shopping Village Complex is the new section of Galston Village and is located on the intersection of Galston Rd and Arcadia Rd. The new complex has a capacity of 11 stores and currently has 3 operational stores which are Liquorland, ALDI supermarkets and Galston Village Pharmacy which are all located on the ground level. Following the numerous graffiti attacks on the carpark, the carpark has been repainted and is now closed 15 minutes after the last store closes. ALDI which was recently opened on Wednesday 8 October, owns a fully functioning store although it only makes use of 3/4 of Franklins store space. The Galston ALDI is larger than the Round Corner ALDI.  Housing  There is a variety of housing available in Galston. There are a number of recently built modern brick townhouses and home units close in to the shopping village and several hundred modern brick dwellings in subdivisions near the village. Dwellings on the many lots in the suburb range from older simple fibro and timber cottages to substantial, luxurious brick and tile residences. The Hornsby Shire Council is currently reviewing its planning and development allowances to allow many 5 acre plots close to the centre of Galston to be split into subdivisions allowing growth in the Galston town centre region.  Culture  = Events = Hornsby Shire's largest annual community event, the Bushland Shire Festival, is held at Fagan Park every September and is organised by Hornsby Shire Council. Galston hosted the annual Galston Country Music Festival, which was held on a Sunday in early September. 2008 marked the last one that was held. Past performers at the festival included Troy Cassar- Daley, Kasey Chambers, Pat Drummond, The Bushwackers, Smoky Dawson, Normie Rowe, Nicki Gillis and the pop group Bella. Galston Rotary Club which hosted this event, patronised by the legendary Frank Ifield, now stages Opera by the Lake in Fagan Park on the first Sunday in May. The Galston SpringFest (started in 1982/3 by Galston Rotary as the Galston Spring Festival) is also held in early September each year. The Galston Garden Club holds an Open Gardens Weekend each October where several local gardens are open to public view. Galston also hosts the Rotary Scarecrow festival where families and friends gather to create the best scarecrow.

All the schools participate in Spring Fest which involves marching down Galston Road, Galston on a Saturday in Spring and other local organizations also participate in the festivities. Big banners advertising Spring Fest and schools from the Galston Community of Schools are hoisted on the month of the festival date on Galston Road.  Transport  Galston has limited public transport facilities; the main ways to get around the suburb are by walking, driving and cycling. The nearest train station to Galston is Hornsby Station which is an Opal card activated station. The future North West Rail Link will serve Galston, with the nearest station at Castle Hill providing high speed rail travel to the Sydney Central Business District. The major bus operator in Galston is Hills Bus which operates as public transport for the whole of the Hills District. During mornings and afternoons on school days, a lot of buses pass through Galston to serve for Galston High School's large catchment area and Galston Public School as well as traffic from other local schools. Adults are not however allowed to travel on most of these buses as they are school buses except for bus 637 and bus 638 which are public buses. *Route 637 travels from Glenorie to Castle Hill via Galston Village, Round Corner and Rogans Hill.

Facilities  ;Galston Aquatic and Leisure Centre The Galston Aquatic and Leisure Centre features a 25-metre, six lane indoor heated pool with a squad club. The aquatic centre also features a gymnasium and a learn to swim club as well as many other aquatic activities. ;Galston skate park Next door to the Galston Aquatic Centre is the Galston skate park where many skaters ride. The location opposite Galston High School makes it easily accessible for teenage skaters. The Hornsby Shire Council as a result constantly removes vandalism from graffiti attacks around the area at places such as the swimming pool noticeboard and at the buildings on Hayes Oval. ;Hayes Oval Hayes Oval is the home to the Hills Hawks Soccer team and due to the high usage of the facility coach rooms, a canteen and a spectator area were built. These buildings are situated on the Galston Road side of Hayes Oval. Hayes Oval is used for soccer, softball, cricket and many other sporting activities. ;Galston Library Galston Library is managed by the Hornsby Shire Council. Recently works were undertaken on replacing the roof of the Galston Library. Galston Library is not big and is an old building. Community Galston has a very strong and supportive community made up of many small businesses. Galston's community helps local schools, local businesses and supports local events. There are very few commercial businesses in Galston which makes Galston unique as the small businesses all have their own style and their own expertise. Public schools in the Galston region support each other in the Galston Community of Schools. Galston's local Bendigo Bank Community Branch is a main sponsor to the Galston community and supports the region's schools, events and facilities. Bendigo Bank is the only bank in Galston and is one of the very few in the region meaning that many people in the area have a bank account at the Galston Bendigo Bank Branch which helps the community a lot. Galston and Glenorie has its own magazine which is not even from a commercial business but is from a local business Adelphi Design & Print. The council is a key part of Galston as many of the facilities across the town are owned by the Hornsby Shire Council. Some of these include Fagan Park, Galston Library, Galston Community Centre, Galston Aquatic Centre, Galston Recreation Reserve, Hayes Oval and many more.

Descended from the Pittsburgh Gazette, established in 1786 as the first newspaper published west of the Allegheny Mountains, the paper has existed under its present title since 1927. It ended daily print publication in 2018 and currently puts out print editions only three days a week, going online-only the rest of the week. It has a politically conservative editorial tone, having shifted in recent years from a more liberal-leaning orientation. Early history The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette Building in Downtown Pittsburgh, which housed the paper from 1962 to 2015. =Gazette= The Post-Gazette began its history as a four-page weekly called The Pittsburgh Gazette, first published on July 29, 1786, with the encouragement of Hugh Henry Brackenridge.Andrews, p. 1. It was the first newspaper published west of the Allegheny Mountains. Published by Joseph Hall and John Scull, the paper covered the start of the nation. As one of its first major articles, the Gazette published the newly adopted Constitution of the United States.Andrews, p. 38. In 1820, under publishers Eichbaum and Johnston and editor Morgan Neville, the name changed to Pittsburgh Gazette and Manufacturing and Mercantile Advertiser.Thomas, p. 42. David MacLean bought the paper in 1822, and later reverted to the former title.Thomas, p. 43. Under editor Neville B. Craig, whose service lasted from 1829 to 1841, the Gazette championed the Anti-Masonic movement. Craig turned the Gazette into the city's first daily paper, issued every afternoon except Sunday starting on July 30, 1833.Andrews, pp. 68, 70, 76, 88. In 1844, shortly after absorbing the Advocate, the Gazette switched its daily issue time to morning.Andrews, pp. 122, 135; Pittsburgh Gazette (weekly ed.), March 8, 1844, p. 1, col. 1; Pittsburgh Morning Post, March 4, 1844, p. 2, col. 1. Its editorial stance at the time was conservative and strongly favoring the Whig Party. By the 1850s the Gazette was credited with helping to organize a local chapter of the new Republican Party, and with contributing to the election of Abraham Lincoln. The paper was one of the first to suggest tensions between North and South would erupt in war. After consolidating with the Commercial in 1877, the paper was again renamed and was then known as the Commercial Gazette.Thomas, p. 101. In 1900, George T. Oliver acquired the paper, merging it six years later with The Pittsburg Times to form The Gazette Times.Andrews, p. 245. =Post= The Pittsburgh Post first appeared on September 10, 1842, as the Daily Morning Post. It had its origin in three pro-Democratic weeklies, the Mercury, Allegheny Democrat, and American Manufacturer, which came together through a pair of mergers in the early 1840s. The three papers had for years engaged in bitter editorial battles with the Gazette.Andrews, p. 73. Like its predecessors, the Post advocated the policies of the Democratic Party. Its political opposition to the Whig and later Republican Gazette was so enduring that an eventual combination of the two rivals would have seemed unlikely.Andrews, p. 292. Consolidation timeline Block-Hearst deal The 1920s were a time of consolidation in the long-overcrowded Pittsburgh newspaper market. In 1923, local publishers banded together to acquire and kill off the Dispatch and Leader. Four years later, William Randolph Hearst negotiated with the Olivers to purchase the morning Gazette Times and its evening sister, the Chronicle Telegraph, while Paul Block arranged to buy out the owner of the morning Post and evening Sun. After swapping the Sun in return for Hearst's Gazette Times, Block had both morning papers, which he combined to form the Post-Gazette. Hearst united the evening papers, creating the Sun-Telegraph. Both new papers debuted on August 2, 1927.Andrews, p. 291. Joint operating agreement In 1960, Pittsburgh had three daily papers: the Post-Gazette in the morning, and the Pittsburgh Press and the Pittsburgh Sun- Telegraph in the evening and on Sunday. The Post-Gazette bought the Sun- Telegraph and moved into the Sun-Telegraph's Grant Street offices.Thomas, pp. 227‚Äì228. The Post-Gazette tried to publish a Sunday paper to compete with the Sunday Press but it was not profitable; rising costs in general were challenging the company's bottom line.Thomas, pp. 229‚Äì230. In November 1961, the Post-Gazette entered into an agreement with the Pittsburgh Press Company to combine their production and advertising sales operations.Thomas, p. 231. The Post-Gazette owned and operated its own news and editorial departments, but production and distribution of the paper was handled by the larger Press office. This agreement stayed in place for over 30 years.Thomas, pp. 295‚Äì296. The agreement gave the Post-Gazette a new home in the Press building, a comfortable upgrade from the hated \\"Sun-Telly barn.\\"Thomas, pp. 232, 228. Constructed for the Press in 1927 and expanded with a curtain wall in 1962, the building served as the Post-Gazette headquarters until 2015. Strike, consolidation, new competition The distribution center On May 17, 1992, a strike by workers for the Press shut down publication of the Press; the joint operating agreement meant that the Post-Gazette also ceased to publish.Thomas, pp. 281‚Äì283. During the strike, the Scripps Howard company sold the Press to the Block family, owners of the Post-Gazette. The Blocks did not resume printing the Press, and when the labor issue was resolved and publishing resumed, the Post-Gazette became the city's major paper, under the full masthead name Pittsburgh Post-Gazette Sun-Telegraph/The Pittsburgh Press. The Block ownership did not take this opportunity to address labor costs, which had led to sale of the Press. This would come back to haunt them and lead to financial problems (see \\"Financial Challenges\\" below). During the strike, publisher Richard Mellon Scaife expanded his paper, the Greensburg Tribune- Review, based in the county seat of adjoining Westmoreland County, where it had published for years. While maintaining the original paper in its facilities in Greensburg, he expanded it with a new Pittsburgh edition to serve the city and its suburbs. Scaife named this paper the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review.Thomas, p. 303. Scaife has invested significant amounts of capital into upgraded facilities, separate offices and newsroom on Pittsburgh's North Side and a state of the art production facility in Marshall Township north of Pittsburgh in Allegheny County. Relations between the Post- Gazette and Tribune-Review, during its existence as a local print publication, were often competitive and frequently hostile, given Scaife's longstanding distaste for what he considered the Blocks' liberalism. On November 14, 2011, the Post-Gazette revived the Pittsburgh Press as an afternoon online newspaper. On February 12, 2014, the paper purchased a new distribution facility in suburban Findlay Township, Pennsylvania. In 2015, the paper moved into a new, state-of-the-art office building on the North Shore on a portion of the former site of Three Rivers Stadium, ending 53 years in the former Press building and more than two centuries in Downtown. Block Communications, feeling that the building is being greatly underutilized considering its proximity to Point State Park, still owns the building and plans to have the property redeveloped. Community presence The Post-Gazette building in October 2015. The newspaper sponsored a 23,000 seat outdoor amphitheater in Burgettstown, Pennsylvania, the \\"Post-Gazette Pavilion\\", although it is still often referred to as \\"Star Lake\\", based on the original name, \\"Star Lake Amphitheater\\", and later \\"Coca-Cola Star Lake Amphitheater\\" under the former sponsor. They gave up naming rights in 2010. First Niagara Bank, which had entered the Pittsburgh market the year before after acquiring National City branches from Pittsburgh-based PNC Financial Services, took over the naming rights to the facility and is now known as the KeyBank Pavilion. The newspaper once had ventures in television. In 1957, the Post-Gazette partnered with the H. Kenneth Brennen family, local radio owners, to launch WIIC-TV (now WPXI) as the area's first full-time NBC affiliate.Thomas, pp. 236‚Äì237. The Post-Gazette and the Brennens sold off the station to current owner Cox Enterprises in 1964. Although the Post-Gazette and WPXI have on occasion had some news partnerships, the Post-Gazette's primary news partner is now KDKA-TV. Financial challenges When John Craig handed editorial reign to David Shribman in 2003, Craig told Shribman that the paper was in terrible financial shape. It was around the time of Hanukkah, and Shribman quipped, \\"It seemed there was only enough oil in this newspaper to keep the light on for one year.\\" In September 2006, the paper disclosed that it was experiencing financial challenges, largely related to its labor costs. The paper also disclosed it had not been profitable since printing had resumed in 1993. As a result of these issues, the paper is considering a number of options, including putting the paper up for sale. While deep concern about the paper's future ensued, negotiations proved fruitful and in February, 2007 the paper's unions ratified a new agreement with management mandating job cuts, changes in funding health care benefits and so forth. In August 2018, the Post-Gazette ceased publishing daily. It began publishing online editions on Tuesdays and Saturdays and print editions the rest of the week. In October 2019, the paper eliminated the Monday and Wednesday editions, publishing paper editions three days a week. Shift in editorial stance The Post-Gazettes once liberal editorial tone shifted more conservative following the 2018 consolidation of its editorial department with that of longtime sister newspaper The Blade of Toledo, Ohio, and the appointment of that paper's editorial page editor Keith Burris, a frequent defender of Donald Trump, to direct the editorial pages of both papers. Burris assumed the additional position of executive editor of the Post-Gazette in 2019. = Firing of cartoonist = In June 2018, the Post Gazette fired its long-time editorial cartoonist, Rob Rogers, a previous Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Cartooning finalist who had worked at the paper for 25 years, having joined the paper in 1993 and worked under four supervising editors. The firing came in the context of increasing support for President Donald Trump and political conservatism on the Post-Gazette editorial page. Pittsburgh Mayor William Peduto (who was both a friend of Rogers' and had been lampooned in his cartoons) called the paper's firing of Rogers \\"disappointing\\" and said it sent \\"the wrong message about press freedoms.\\"Statement by Mayor William Peduto on Cartoonist Rob Rogers, Office of the Mayor, City of Pittsburgh (June 14, 2018). The firing was strongly criticized by the Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh and the National Cartoonists Society. The Association of American Editorial Cartoonists said in a statement: \\"It's as simple as this: Rogers was fired for refusing to do cartoons extolling Trump. Let that sink in.\\" The paper said that Rogers' dismissal \\"has little to do with politics, ideology or Donald Trump\\" but did not provide details. Rogers wrote in the New York Times that the paper's new management had decided, in the lead-up to his firing, that his cartoons satirizing Trump \\"were 'too angry.'\\" Rogers said that while editors had previously rejected (or \\"spiked\\") an average of two to three of his cartoons each year, under a new supervisor he had 19 cartoons or cartoon ideas killed in the first six months of 2018. Four months later after Rogers was fired, the Post-Gazette hired conservative editorial cartoonist Steve Kelley as Roger's replacement. After being fired, Rogers' comics continued to be published through Andrews McMeel Syndication. As a freelancer, Rogers was named as a finalist for the 2019 Pulitzer Prize in editorial cartooning, with the committee citing his \\"provocative illustrations that channeled cultural and historical references with expert artistry and an eye for hypocrisy and injustice.\\" = Sanctioning of reporter amid George Floyd protests = In 2020, the Post-Gazette prohibited its reporter Alexis Johnson from covering the George Floyd protests. The Post-Gazette said that Johnson, an African American, had shown bias by making a tweet which highlighted extensive littering from a Kenny Chesney concert tailgate. The pulling of Johnson from the story prompted an outcry from journalists, including the Newspaper Guild of Pittsburgh and many of Johnson's Post-Gazette colleagues. Awards The Post-Gazette won Pulitzer Prizes in 1938, 1998, and 2019. Photographer Morris Berman maintained that the paper would have won a Pulitzer in 1964 but chose not to run his iconic Y. A. Tittle picture that he took at Pitt Stadium. The photo would go on to win awards, hang in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, be used for the back cover of Tittle's autobiography and used in a Miller Beer High-Life commercial in 2005. In 1938, Ray Sprigle won the Pulitzer Prize for Reporting for his investigation revealing that newly appointed Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black had been a member of the Ku Klux Klan. Staff photographer Martha Rial won the 1998 Pulitzer Prize for Spot News Photography for her photographs of Rwandan and Burundian refugees. In 1997 Bill Moushey won the National Press Club‚Äôs Freedom of Information Award on a series investigating the Federal Witness Protection Program and was a finalist for the Pulitzer. Photographer John Kaplan won the 1992 Pulitzer Prize for Feature Photography for a series of photo essays on 21-year-olds, which was published in the Post- Gazette and two other papers of the Block Newspapers group. This award cited Block Newspapers rather than the Post-Gazette specifically. In addition to the Pulitzers mentioned above, the Post-Gazette also won the Wilbur Award from the Religion Communicators Council (RCC) in 2017 for religion editor Peter Smith's work, Silent Sanctuaries. Smith, Stephanie Strasburg, and Shelly Bradbury were finalists for the 2020 Pulitzer Prize for Local Reporting for an investigation into sexual abuse in Pennsylvania's Amish and Mennonite communities. The Post- Gazette won the 2019 Pulitzer for its coverage of the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting. The paper was praised for its \\"immersive, compassionate coverage.\\" See also * Chronicle-Telegraph Cup * Pittsburgh Tribune-Review * Tom Barnes * Al Helfer * Cy Hungerford * James O'Toole * Martha Rial, 1998 Pulitzer Prize winner * Dennis Roddy * Bob Smizik * Y.

A total of 200 cars were built, arranged as single units. Two versions were manufactured: Westinghouse (WH)-powered cars and General Electric (GE)-powered cars. The first R16s entered service on January 10, 1955. Various modifications were made over the years to the R16 fleet. The GE-powered cars were found to be less reliable than the WH-powered cars, so the New York City Transit Authority planned to retire them early in 1977 with R46s. However, problems with R46 cars kept the GE-powered R16s in service until 1983. The WH-powered R16s were retired in 1987 with the delivery of the R68s. Some R16 cars were saved for various purposes, but most were scrapped.  Description  The R16s were numbered 6300‚Äì6499. When delivered, the R16s quickly became the new standard in car design for the New York City Transit Authority. Structurally and mechanically, they were the larger versions of the R15s and the R17s, and basically an improved version of the R10s, sharing the same exact dimensions. The only exception was that the R16s had electrically operated door motors while the R10s had air-powered door motors. When they were new, the R16s could give the R10 some competition when it came to speed ‚Äì both cars were mechanically similar with four 100 horsepower motors and a balancing speed of 55 MPH. The R16s, like the older Arnines, R10s, and R11s, featured three sets of mid-car body passenger windows on each side. One set contained an illuminated rollsign box in lieu of a second window. This sign box had three readings arranged vertically ‚Äì the top two being the train's terminals, and the bottom being the route. This window and signbox pattern became standard for later cars until the R40s in 1967. The R16 would also be the last car class delivered with crosswise seating until the R44 order in 1971. There were two versions of the R16: Westinghouse (WH)-powered cars (6300‚Äì6399) and General Electric (GE)-powered cars (6400‚Äì6499), the latter of which were delivered earlier. The GE-powered cars used forced air to cool the rheostatic resistors used for acceleration and dynamic braking. However, the low voltage rotary converter (motor-generator) used to provide the air proved to be problematic as the enclosure tended to trap dirt and rainwater within. In addition, the master controllers also had a tendency to short out more frequently relative to other classes, leading to high failure rates. Meanwhile, the Westinghouse-powered cars had resistors mounted in the open for slipstream cooling as had been the traditional means; this setup was found to be more reliable and was reused in newer cars up to the R22 order. In theory, both types of R16s could be run together, but in practice, this was found to be less than desirable, so cars would be segregated by electrical running gear to provide better fleet reliability. The R16s were also the heaviest 60-foot subway car built at the time, weighing in at some 85,000 pounds per car, until the 75-foot cars, which weighed around 89,000 pounds per car, eclipsed them.  History  The R16s were delivered between 1954‚Äì1955 in a kale green paint scheme and first placed into passenger service on January 10, 1955, on the BMT #15, (now ). Two cars #s 6318, and 6463 were painted gold for the golden jubilee celebration in 1955. R16s 6300‚Äì6349 were transferred to the in preparation for the opening of the former Long Island Rail Road's IND Rockaway Line on June 28, 1956, as the Transit Authority wished to use its newest equipment available for the line's inaugural.As shown in these pictures: * * After the late 1950s, the cars were returned to the BMT Eastern Division and would remain there until the late 1960s and the early 1970s, when they were transferred to various lines throughout the system. During the 1970s, R16s could be found intermixed with other cars and in far away places from their previous running grounds. Photos of R16s in the Bronx or Queens show them both in complete consists as well as with other fleets. In 1968, many cars were repainted into a bright red scheme. The whole R16 fleet was given the new MTA corporate silver and blue scheme in 1970, and the cars kept that scheme until retirement. During the early 1970s, the R16s had their door motors replaced with door motors similar to those used by the R44s. As the replacement door motors were mounted in the walls rather than under the seats, distinctive sloping wall panels (unique to the R16s) appeared.Before and After In 1979, car 6429 was rebuilt with a new front end, large picture windows, and new doors; it was a prototype car for a complete rebuilding of the fleet, which would add modern interiors and air-conditioning. Part of the rebuild also included the conversion of the cars to four-car sets. The car was eventually scrapped, and the rebuilding never took place with other cars. = Retirement = R16 car 6398 at the Trolley Museum of New York on September 30, 2013, prior to restoration Because of persistent electrical issues with the GE- powered R16s, the Transit Authority planned to retire them early in 1977 with R46s. However, problems with R46 cars due to cracks found in those cars' trucks (as well as a host of other defects) kept the GE-powered R16s in service until 1983. The more reliable WH-powered R16 cars remained in service on the BMT Eastern Division until the spring of 1987, when they were ultimately replaced with the R68s. After retirement, four cars were saved for various purposes. The full list includes: * 6305 and 6339 ‚Äì currently stored at the MTA NYC Transit's Coney Island Complex in Brooklyn. * 6387 ‚Äì preserved by the New York Transit Museum. The car was restored to operating status in 2013‚Äì2014 and has been operating on New York City Transit Museum-sponsored excursions since August 2014, specifically on the Train of Many Metals (TOMM). * 6398 ‚Äì preserved at the Trolley Museum of New York, Kingston, NY,http://www.tmny.org/tmny6398.html restoration in progress. It is occasionally used during special events pulled by other cars or locomotive. 6452 was located at PS 248 (an NYCT training facility) in Brooklyn until July 2004, as a training car. It was painted in the \\"Redbird\\" scheme and was not operational. In July 2004, the car was moved to Linden Yard in Brooklyn and was replaced by R110B 3005, which was moved to the facility. 6452 was moved again to the Coney Island Yard in 2005. Finally, in July 2007, the car was moved to the SBK yard for asbestos abatement and sent to the 207th Street Yard for reefing in early 2008.  In popular culture  Various R16s were featured in the 1981 made-for-TV film We're Fighting Back, including the interior of some R16s. Several of them included 6301, 6302, 6321, 6333, 6355, 6394, 6398, and 6399, signed up as an train. Various stations were renamed in the film, but there are various hints, including the fact it was a solid 8-car set of R16s rather than a 10-car set that it was filmed on the BMT Canarsie Line. A wooden mockup of an R16 was featured in the 1976 remake of King Kong. In the 1959 film Imitation of Life, several trains consisting of R16s can be seen passing outside the studio window in the flea powder ad scene.  References   Further reading  * Sansone, Gene.

He was instrumental in realizing the potential for business and commerce in India. Parry became a household name in Chennai. Parry set up the EID Parry company in 1787 (Parry was in London until late 1788), the corporate headquarters of which stand on the corner. Parry's Corner, a well-known central business district of Chennai was named after him.  Early life  He was the third son of Edward Parry and Anne Vaughan of Leighton Hall near Welshpool. Ross was left fatherless in 1774 at age six, with four siblings under the age of 15. Thomas and one of his sisters, Elizabeth (1759-1825), grew up under the influence of his Aunt Ann Ross (n√©e Parry) and her merchant husband Gilbert Ross; a Scot, a Freeman of the City of London, and a merchant who traded in Billiter Lane, London. Gilbert Ross died on 4 March 1788. His will was probated March 14th, 1788 (Source National Archives) and contains an affidavit signed by Thomas Parry 'of Billiter Lane', suggesting that Thomas was tutored to be a merchant under the guidance of his uncle, alongside his cousin Gilbert Ross Jr. Upon Gilbert Ross's death, the London business was inherited by Gilbert Ross Jr. (1755-1815), who later married Elizabeth Parry, Thomas' sister. Thomas found no role in the London business, so he left London in 1788, most likely as an agreed strategy of the two cousins to expand into India.  Career  Parry undertook the six-month journey around Cape of Good Hope arriving in Chennai (then known as Madras) in 1789. He entered Chennai as a Free Merchant, free from the controls of the East India Company. He established a business on 17 July 1788, selling goods and providing banking services. The business grew. Several partnerships were formed and dissolved in the early years. The Parry and Co business were not formed until 1796.  Death  Parry is buried at C.S.I Christ Church (also called as missionary church) Cuddalore Port, India. He was not recognized until the late 19th century.

In contrast to atypical depression, people with melancholic depression generally do not experience an improved mood in response to normally pleasurable events. Atypical depression also features significant weight gain or an increased appetite, hypersomnia, a heavy sensation in the limbs, and interpersonal rejection sensitivity that results in significant social or occupational impairment.American Psychiatric Association. (2000). Mood Disorders. In Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed., text rev.) Washington, DC: Author. Despite its name, \\"atypical\\" depression does not mean it is uncommon or unusual. The reason for its name is twofold: (1) it was identified with its \\"unique\\" symptoms subsequent to the identification of melancholic depression and (2) its responses to the two different classes of antidepressants that were available at the time were different from melancholic depression (i.e., MAOIs had clinically significant benefits for atypical depression, while tricyclics did not). Atypical depression is four times more common in females than in males.Dorota ≈Åojko, et. al (2017). \\"Atypical depression: current perspectives, Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment Individuals with atypical features tend to report an earlier age of onset (e.g. while in high school) of their depressive episodes, which also tend to be more chronic and only have partial remission between episodes. Younger individuals may be more likely to have atypical features, whereas older individuals may more often have episodes with melancholic features. Atypical depression has high comorbidity of anxiety disorders, carries more risk of suicidal behavior, and has distinct personality psychopathology and biological traits. Atypical depression is more common in individuals with bipolar I, bipolar II, cyclothymia and seasonal affective disorder. Depressive episodes in bipolar disorder tend to have atypical features, as does depression with seasonal patterns. Pathophysiology Significant overlap between atypical and other forms of depression have been observed, though studies suggest there are differentiating factors within the various pathophysiological models of depression. In the endocrine model, evidence suggests the HPA axis is hyperactive in melancholic depression, and hypoactive in atypical depression. Atypical depression can be differentiated from melancholic depression via verbal fluency tests and psychomotor speed tests. Although both show impairment in several areas such as visuospatial memory and verbal fluency, melancholic patients tend to show more impairment than atypical depressed patients. Furthermore, regarding the inflammatory theory of depression, inflammatory blood markers (cytokines) appear to be more elevated in atypical depression when compared to non-atypical depression.  Diagnosis  The diagnosis of atypical depression is based on the criteria stated in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). DSM-5 defines Atypical Depression as a subtype of major depressive disorder that presents with atypical features, characterized by: #Mood reactivity (i.e., mood brightens in response to actual or potential positive events) #At least two of the following: #*Significant weight gain or increase in appetite (hyperphagia); #*Hypersomnia (sleeping too much, as opposed to the insomnia present in melancholic depression); #*Leaden paralysis (i.e., heavy feeling resulting in difficulty moving the arms or legs); #*Long-standing pattern of interpersonal rejection sensitivity (not limited to episodes of mood disturbance) that results in significant social or occupational impairment. #Criteria are not met for With Melancholic Features or With Catatonic Features during the same episode. Treatment Due to the differences in clinical presentation between atypical depression and melancholic depression, studies were conducted in the 1980s and 1990s to assess the therapeutic responsiveness of the available antidepressant pharmacotherapy in this subset of patients. Currently, antidepressants such as SSRIs, SNRIs, NRIs, and mirtazapine are considered the best medications to treat atypical depression due to efficacy and fewer side effects than previous treatments. Bupropion, a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, may be uniquely suited to treat the atypical depression symptoms of lethargy and increased appetite in adults. Before the year 2000, Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) were shown to be of superior efficacy compared to other antidepressants for the treatment of atypical depression, and were used as first-line treatment for atypical depression. Regardless of the demonstrated superiority, treatment with MAOIs requires avoidance of tyramine-containing foods (aged cheese, wine, fava beans) and have many undesirable adverse effects such as hypertensive crisis. Hypertensive crisis is a state of extremely high blood pressure and present with symptoms such as sweating, palpitations, chest pain, shortness of breath. For these reasons, MAOIs are rarely used as the preferred agent in the setting of atypical depression. There is also a newer, selective and reversible MAOI Moclobemide, which doesn't require tyramine diet and has less side effects. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) were also used prior to the year 2000 for atypical depression, but were not as efficacious as MAOIs, and have fallen out of favor with prescribers due to the less tolerable side effects of TCAs and more adequate therapies being available. Some evidence supports that psychotherapy such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has equal efficacy to MAOI. These are talk therapy sessions with psychiatrists to help the individual identify troubling thoughts or experiences that may have affected their mental state, and corresponding develop coping mechanisms for each identified issue. No robust guidelines for the treatment of atypical depression currently exist. Epidemiology True prevalence of atypical depression is difficult to determine. Several studies conducted in patients diagnosed with a depressive disorder show that about 40% exhibit atypical symptoms, with four times more instances found in female patients.Dorota ≈Åojko, et. al (2017). \\"Atypical depression: current perspectives, Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment Research also supports that atypical depression tends to have an earlier onset, with teenagers and young adults more likely to exhibit atypical depression than older patients.Tanvir Singh et. al (2006). \\"Atypical depression, Psychiatry (Edgmont). Patients with atypical depression have shown to have higher rates of neglect and abuse in their childhood as well as alcohol and drug disorders in their family. Overall, rejection sensitivity is the most common symptom, and due to some studies forgoing this criterion, there is concern for underestimation of prevalence. Research In general, atypical depression tends to cause greater functional impairment than other forms of depression. Atypical depression is a chronic syndrome that tends to begin earlier in life than other forms of depression‚Äîusually beginning in the teenage years. Similarly, patients with atypical depression are more likely to suffer from personality disorders and anxiety disorders such as borderline personality disorder, avoidant personality disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and bipolar disorder. Recent research suggests that young people are more likely to suffer from hypersomnia while older people are more likely to suffer from polyphagia. Medication response differs between chronic atypical depression and acute melancholic depression. Some studies suggest that the older class of antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), may be more effective at treating atypical depression. While the more modern SSRIs and SNRIs are usually quite effective in this illness, the tricyclic antidepressants typically are not. The wakefulness-promoting agent modafinil has shown considerable effect in combating atypical depression, maintaining this effect even after discontinuation of treatment. Antidepressant response can often be enhanced with supplemental medications, such as buspirone, bupropion, or aripiprazole. Psychotherapy, whether alone or in combination with medication, is also an effective treatment.

Ivy has been portrayed by original cast member Kim Johnston Ulrich since the soap's premiere episode in July 1999. At that time, Ivy was trapped in a loveless marriage to Julian Crane, son of ruthless billionaire Alistair Crane; her one joy was her son, Ethan Crane, the product of her adulterous affair with teenage love and new chief of police Sam Bennett on her wedding night. When Ethan's paternity was revealed early in 2001, Julian, Ethan, and Sam were all furious with Ivy, and Julian quickly divorced her later that year. Ivy, who had never stopped loving Sam, plotted to win him back from his wife, Grace, eventually blackmailed David Hastings to pretend to be the amnesia Grace's long-lost first husband. The scheme eventually worked, and Ivy and Sam reunited in 2004. However, Sam discovered Ivy's deception late in 2006 and he broke off their engagement, and planned to reunite with Grace; until she was killed in London in January 2007. After a brief dalliance with Julian, Ivy and Sam reunited in September 2007, although their disagreements over his daughter, Kay, and Ethan's relationship with Theresa continue to cause friction between the two. Character history =Early life= The daughter of governor Harrison Winthrop and Helen Revere-Mott-Beaton, Ivy was (originally) born sometime in 1956. She grew up in a state neighboring Maine and was raised in the lap of luxury, her mother a descendant of Paul Revere. It was possibly her advantaged upbringing that led her to an affair with a Harmony lifeguard, Sam Bennett. Although she knew of Sam's intention to be a cop, Ivy was determined that she would marry Sam and make him give up his blue collar roots, and have him become a businessman, running her father's shipping company, Winthrop Marine, even though she knew he never wanted that. When Sam took a job for the summer working for Ivy's father to make enough money to marry Ivy to keep her in the lifestyle to which she was accustomed, Ivy soon began seeing Julian Crane, and they eventually became lovers. Throughout the summer, she heard nothing from Sam, unaware that her father was stopping the letters from getting back and forth. Harrison Winthrop knew his daughter and believed that she would never be happy on a policeman's salary. Ivy proved her father right when she got closer and closer to Julian Crane, accepting his offer of marriage after Ivy believed Sam had begun seeing other women. She wed Julian in 1974 believing that his love for her and his father's money would be enough to make her happy. She moved to Harmony after marrying Julian. On their wedding night, Ivy learned that Julian had been forced into marriage by his father, Alistair, and went to Sam, officially consummating their relationship. The next day she went to her father and told him that she was leaving Julian, and she and Sam would live off her trust fund, and Harrison would just have to accept it. Harrison told her that if she wanted to be with Sam it was her choice, but there was no money‚Äîtheir family was broke, the trust fund was gone, and if she left Julian to be with Sam, Ivy would have to live off whatever Sam could make. Ivy went back to Julian, and left on their honeymoon the next day. Unbeknownst to all, Ivy learned she was with child. She decided to use this to her advantage, and secure a place for Sam's child within the Crane dynasty by passing him/her off as Julian's child. In the spring of 1975, she gave birth to a son, Ethan Crane (later in life he would change his name to Ethan Winthrop). Ivy doted upon her son, so much so she ignored her other three children, sending them off to boarding school as soon as possible. Ivy also resented her husband Julian and kicked him out of their bed after their youngest child, Pretty, was born. She became cold and aloof toward him and, as a result, he nicknamed her \\"Ice Princess\\" and \\"Poison Ivy\\". Ivy was still affected by her memories of Sam; she still kept a locket he gave her with his picture inside, and placed a photo of Ethan on the opposite side. This always reminded her of the love she and Sam once shared. She relied on the locket through the years, and also wrote a letter to Sam explaining the truth to him. At the last minute she decided to keep it. She seemed content being the wife of a Crane, only putting the needs of Ethan before everything else. Eventually, she had three more children by Julian - two daughters, Pretty and Fancy, and a son, Fox. Though Ivy did love her children, she never really showed it - only toward Ethan. By the time Ethan was ten, all of his younger siblings were in boarding school, in part so that Ivy could punish Julian by making sure he never knew his children, and in part because she had no interest in any children that did not belong to Sam. =1999 - 2000= In July 1999, Ivy accidentally met new police chief Sam Bennett for the first time since they last saw each other back in 1974. In the coming months Ivy became obsessed with Sam and his family. The Crane way of life had overtaken and driven her to become power-mad. She did however, have a softer side and wanted to tell Sam several times that he was the father of Crane heir Ethan but changed her mind due to advice from friend and confidant Pilar Lopez- Fitzgerald. Nonetheless, Ivy began inserting herself into several charitable events, always making sure Sam would be there, and she would always try to tell him the truth but fail to do so. Consumed over wanting to tell the truth over and over again, Ivy always stopped herself. She continually made advances toward Sam, and unwillingly was forced to obey her wicked father-in-law Alistair Crane in helping him break up Sheridan Crane and Luis Lopez- Fitzgerald. She also lent a hand in helping her son to follow his heart when he tackled if he would propose to Gwen Hotchkiss or Theresa Lopez-Fitzgerald. When she learned that Dr. Eve Russell had been Julian's love before Julian and Eve's marriages, she used that information to blackmail Eve not only into keeping quiet about her obsession with Sam, but into helping her land Sam and covering up Ethan's conception date so Sam wouldn't think it was possible that Ethan was his son. When the events of the Passions Storm led Ivy to confess who Ethan's true father was, everyone dismissed the idea, believing Ivy to be delusional from a head injury. Manipulating and cunning Ivy tried to infiltrate several romantic interludes Sam shared with his wife Grace, but would always fail miserably at every chance she had. One thorn in Ivy's side was Gwen's meddling mother Rebecca Hotchkiss. She never really liked Ivy, so she wanted to take her place as Mrs. Julian Crane. She tried to come up with a scheme to get rid of her. As luck would have it, Ivy kept mentioning Sam in her presence. One day, Ivy slipped and mentioned how she was worried about Ethan's father. Rebecca knew that it couldn't have been Julian because he was in the mansion with her. Plus, she hated Julian. She finally figured out that Sam was Ethan's father. She didn't have any proof of this so she had to look for it. While she was looking for proof, she found Ivy's locket with Sam and Ethan's picture in it. She also found her daughter's rival Theresa's laptop that contained the proof she needed. Ivy's letter to Sam was on the computer. The letter said that Sam was Ethan's father. Unknown to Ivy, Rebecca told her daughter what she found out, and Rebecca convinced Gwen that exposing the truth was the only way to show Ethan how manipulative Theresa really was. Rebecca hid her own motivations, which involved getting revenge on both Ivy and Theresa. =2001 - 2003= As Ivy celebrated the engagement of Ethan and Theresa, she was unaware of the Rebecca's plan that would destroy her life. The two women had found and sent a letter Ivy wrote to Sam long ago to the tabloids. A tabloid reporter who printed the headline, Mort Chandler, sneaked into the party and showed a stunned Julian the headline, \\"Crane Secret Revealed! Ethan Crane is Sam Bennett's Son!\\" An enraged and grieved Julian exposed Ivy's betrayal to the whole town and denounced Ethan as his son. Ivy suffered emotional turmoil by Sam, Julian, Ethan, and even Grace‚Äîwho miscarried a baby boy, when she learned the shocking truth, and blamed Ivy for it. Alistair quickly turned his back on Ethan as well. Lost without his identity as a Crane, Ethan vowed to destroy whoever ruined his life. So did Ivy, who tried making up for her secrets to everyone. Grace, still upset over her baby's death, cursed Ivy with her Standish powers. Even after the devastating tabloid scandal, Ivy still wanted to be a part of Sam's life. She devised a way to break up the Bennett marriage. She hired a photographer David Hastings to pose as Grace's long-lost husband. Ivy had explosive information on David and blackmailed him into having her way. David hated every minute of it, but was forced to follow her orders. David came to Harmony that July, and began inserting himself into the Bennetts' lives. Ivy watched from afar, preoccupied with helping Ethan (now using her last name Winthrop) and Theresa plan their double wedding with her brother Luis Lopez-Fitzgerald and Sheridan Crane. What Ivy did not know was that a desperate Gwen made an anonymous call to the tabloid, identifying Theresa, Ethan's own fianc√©e, as the person responsible for sending the e-mail. The tabloid reporter ran the story, and on the wedding day, Rebecca made arrangements for a printed copy to be left in Ivy's bedroom. As Ivy dressed for the wedding, she found the tabloid, and believed the false story! She sped away to the church in her car, and crashed right through the church wall! She stopped the ceremony and denounced Theresa in front of all the shocked guests! Theresa admitted she knew Ethan was a Bennett and didn't tell him, but swore she was innocent of sending the e-mail. Gwen also denounced her, stating she was lying. Ethan was devastated Theresa knew, and Ivy encouraged Ethan never to trust Theresa again. Though Ivy tried to talk Ethan out of loving Theresa, he still had feelings for her. That August, he learned Theresa was in Bermuda, and tracked her down. Ivy realized Julian was there finalizing their divorce. Feeling distressed, Ivy managed to seek comfort in the fact that David was succeeding in breaking up the Bennett marriage. Ivy's plan continued, and she continued to masquerade as the devoted friend. When the dispatched hurricane Peggy struck Harmony, Ivy assisted Sam in helping him fix Harmony's lighthouse beacon to save the Harmony teenager's on Warlock Island. However, in the midst of the storm she was struck by lightning, and fell from the lighthouse ladder. Wet and delusional Ivy believed she was dying. Sam managed to send for paramedics. Ivy nearly died on the way to the hospital and was revived. Later, Eve announced Ivy suffered from spinal injuries and had to have intensive surgery. Ivy pulled through the surgery, though now she was wheel-chair bound and could not walk very far. Julian even considered murdering her while she was in her hospital cubicle. She had frequent lapses of pain and for a time became addicted to pain medication. But, Ivy's spirit was not stopped. She continued to instruct David to woo Grace into falling in love with him so that she could have Sam for herself. Unfortunately, Rebecca saw Ivy's extended recovery as the opportunity to bar Ivy completely from the Crane Mansion and have it redecorated in her tastes. Ivy was furious, and even disgusted when she saw what color Rebecca painted the mansion's living room and its tacky furniture. Ivy refused to accept the divorce, and it was only thanks to Eve and Ethan that she was accepted at all. Eve blackmailed Julian so that Ivy was allowed to stay in the mansion, and Ethan planned to fight for his mother's rights in not accepting the Bermuda divorce. Rebecca soon moved into the Crane mansion and wanted Ivy's friend and companion Pilar fired. Ivy refused. Rebecca responded by shooting Ivy's favorite vase! She proceeded to destroy many of Ivy's heirlooms. Even though she was an unwanted guest at the mansion, Ivy stood her ground. She begged Ethan to still not marry Theresa, still believing the girl told her secret to the tabloids. It wasn't long before she found out Julian was married to Theresa! She blamed Theresa not knowing that it was Julian who intoxicated her, and drunk himself were set up by his friend Bruce in a marriage ceremony, later revealed to be a sham. Ivy was going to tell Ethan about the secret, but Theresa-now emotionally unstable after learning that she was expecting a child which she assumed to be Julian's- stopped her, and broke Ivy's wheelchair with a fireplace poker. She then locked Ivy in her room. Ivy was determined to tell Ethan the secret even if it meant crawling to Ethan and telling him the truth and that is what she did! With every ounce of strength Ivy crawled down the Crane Mansion steps interrupting yet another wedding- Julian and Rebecca's. Ivy fell unconscious and was placed in the hospital again. Julian evilly wanted the secret of his marriage to Theresa to stay hidden as well and decide to eliminate his wives. He mercilessly coaxed the unstable Theresa to the idea of killing Ivy by putting his lighter up to the unconscious woman's oxygen tank. Theresa could not murder and stopped at the last second, but the explosion was accidentally caused when Rebecca- who was wearing jewelry which brushed up against the tank and caused the explosion. All three women survived. Ivy eventually awoke. Through circumstances she was able to contact Mort Chandler and make him reveal to Ethan the truth about his bride to be's pregnancy on New Year's Eve. Shaken, Ethan left Theresa, and Ivy was triumphant. Ivy and almost all of Harmony were determined to rid the world of Julian Crane, for all the misery he bestowed upon every body's lives. Ivy was one of the main suspects in his so-called \\"murder\\" investigation. (Julian had faked his death and was in hiding; the real culprit turned out to be Liz Sanbourne). It was not long before Ivy, Theresa, and Rebecca were involved in a court battle to see who really was the rightful Mrs. Julian Crane. When Theresa emerged victorious, Ivy and Rebecca plotted revenge. Rebecca doctored a video cassette of the supposed murder site the Crane Cannery, and showed Ivy video footage of what appeared to be Ethan shooting Julian. Rebecca revealed it was false, and revealed that once Theresa saw it she would turn herself in not wanting her beloved Ethan to be imprisoned for murder. Though reluctant, Ivy agreed to Rebecca's plot. Theresa confessed, and was executed, but it turned out to be staged in order to bring Julian back to town. Ivy was now an unwelcome house guest in a home that just a year before, she had called her own. After Theresa, as Julian's new wife, kicked Ivy out of the Crane mansion, Sam allowed Ivy to move into the Bennett garage, causing a rift between Sam and Grace. Ultimately, tensions over Kay, David, and Ivy led the Bennetts to split; Sam and Ivy kissed at Julian and Rebecca's wedding at the end of December, reuniting the former lovers, and ending Ivy's paralysis. =2004 - 2006= Once Grace left with David for Italy in May, Ivy's future with Sam seemed extremely bright. However, once Liz exposed Eve's past with Julian, Ivy had nothing left with which to blackmail Eve, and Ivy's end seemed near. However, for one reason or another, Eve never told anyone about rigging John's DNA test, and Ivy's secret stayed safe. Fearful that Grace would be lured back to town by Jessica's problems, Ivy allowed Jessica to run rampant and hid the girl's self-mutilation from her father. Sam was furious when he found out and kicked Ivy out of the house. During and after the tsunami, however, they made up, and Ivy moved back into the Bennett home. In November, Sam proposed, and Ivy gleefully accepted. Meanwhile, Ivy's younger son, Fox, slept with Sam's older daughter, Kay, during the tsunami, and they began to date. Ivy opposed their relationship, however, aware of Kay's history as a schemer; fearful that Kay would hurt her son, Ivy hired Valerie Davis to come between the two at work. Displeased with Fox's relationship with Kay Bennett, Ivy schemed to bring Kay's ex-obsession, Miguel Lopez-Fitzgerald, back to Harmony. Unbeknownst to her, Fox also began scheming with his father to keep Kay and Miguel apart, thus foiling Ivy's plans; Fox and Kay became engaged in March. A guilt-ridden Kay finally confessed to the fact that Ivy had blackmailed David Hastings, thus exposing Ivy. Despite her pleas, Sam broke off his engagement with Ivy and began working to reconcile with Grace. Dejected and drunk, Ivy ended up sleeping with her ex-husband, Julian. =2007 - 2008= Despite her schemes, Fox and Kay married on January 10; meanwhile, Grace's death left Sam even more enraged, and he blamed Ivy, swearing to never forgive her. Heartbroken, Ivy turned to Julian, and the two had sex again. Unfortunately, Sam, who had been convinced to forgive Ivy, walked in and blasted her for \\"betraying\\" him with Julian. Sam swore to never go back to Ivy again. Julian and Ivy, realizing that they would never be with their respective loves, decided to try to reunite. Honesty, however put a rift between their relationship. Ivy's relationship with Fox was also damaged when she accidentally revealed that her terminally ill son was not dying at all. She managed to reconnect somewhat with her daughter Fancy, and both were shocked when Pretty Crane returned to Harmony, blaming both her mother and sister for her horribly scarred face. Gradually, Ivy began turning toward her feelings for Sam again when tragedy struck. Fox was murdered in September 2007, the victim of an unseen culprit. A devastated Ivy blamed Fox's widow Kay, and believed that her daughter-in-law was a serial killer. Sam and Ivy become a couple again on September 2007. After seeing that her grandson Jonathan Winthrop pulled through a liver transplant, Ivy encouraged her son to once again break up with Theresa who had been acting out of character, and infuriating Ethan at times (both he and his mother were unaware that Gwen was blackmailing Theresa into distancing herself from Ethan). Pilar confessed the blackmail to Ivy, but she had yet to understand it is Theresa who is also being blackmailed. Ivy, unknowingly nearly became a victim of her son's murderer, Viki, in order to serve as a distraction. Theresa eventually revealed that Little Ethan is Ethan's biological son after he and Gwen renewed their wedding vows, finally helping Ivy to realize that Theresa is truly the love of her son's life, after which she admonished Gwen for having kept them from being together. When Gwen and Rebecca's lies were finally exposed (during which, when Rebecca griped that she had a constitutional right to being strip searched by a handsome arresting officer, she shot at Rebecca, \\"In what country, Rebecca, Slutistan\\"?!) she then made a heartfelt apology to Theresa for not having trusted her, gladly welcomed her to the family, and displayed new-found faith in Theresa; after Theresa promised Ivy that she'd be good to Ethan, Ivy's last words on the show were a tearful \\"I believe you\\". Ivy was more than angry to find out that Rebecca and Gwen were planning on killing the Lopez-Fitzgerald family. This revealed that deep down Ivy was a kind and wonderful person, and didn't want to have anything to do with Rebecca and Gwen ever again, and more likely she went back to being best friends with Pilar.

It has many firsts to its credit, including the manufacturing of fertilizers (1906) for the first time in the Indian subcontinent. The company is currently engaged in the manufacture and marketing of sugar and bio-products. Parry's is the oldest surviving mercantile name in Chennai. Origin and history EID Parry is one of the oldest business entities of the Indian subcontinent and was originated by Thomas Parry, a Welshman who came to India in the late 1780s. On 17 July 1788, he started a business of banking and piece goods.http://www.thehindu.com/thehindu/mp/2002/12/11/stories/2002121100070300.htm By 1819, a partnership firm named \\"Parry and Dare\\" Company was founded by Thomas Parry and John William Dare. Parry's Corner, one of the most prominent central business districts of Chennai, derives its name from Parry. Over a period of time, the business established by Parry continued to grow, and its flagship company EID Parry emerged. In 1908 Parry & Company set-up ‚ÄòThe Pottery‚Äô unit in Ranipettai. Over the years it was named as \\"Parryware\\" Parry & Company Limited and East India Distileries & Sugars Limited were merged to form EID Parry India Limited. In its more than 200-year existence, this house remained active and operated many businesses. The Murugappa Group took over EID Parry in 1981 from financial & public institutions such as Life Insurance Corporation Of India, United Assurance Co, and Unit Trust of India. Businesses =Sugar= EID Parry set up India's first sugar plant at Nellikuppam in 1842. It was India's first private sector company to perform Research & Development. The sugar division contributes to over 65% of EID Parry's turnover, and around 20% of the sugar production in Tamil Nadu is from EID.Analysis report The Nellikuppam Integrated Sugar Complex has a crushing capacity of 6500 metric tonnes per day, its co-generation facilities produce 24.5 MW of power, and its distillery facilities produce 75 kilolitres per day.

The combined crushing capacity of all seven plants is 32,500 (TCD) Metric Tonnes of cane per day. The Pudukottai unit of EID Parry was built at a site that had been rejected as a factory site at the request of the Indian government. It became one of the firm's largest revenue generators. The Pugalur unit was acquired by EID Parry in 1992. The co-generation facilities at Pugalur can produce 22.5 MW of power, and it has a cane crushing capacity of 4000 metric tonnes per day. The Pettavaithalai factory was bought in 1998 and can co-generate 19.6 MW of power. Its cane crushing capacity is 3000 metric tonnes per day. Recently, EID Parry acquired the sugar plants of GMR Group in states like Karnataka and Andhra.

In 1962, following a lengthy dispute between Cambodia and Thailand over ownership, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague ruled that the temple is in Cambodia. Affording a view for many kilometers across a plain, Prasat Preah Vihear has the most spectacular setting of all the temples built during the six-century-long Khmer Empire. As a key edifice of the empire's spiritual life, it was supported and modified by successive kings and so bears elements of several architectural styles. Preah Vihear is unusual among Khmer temples in being constructed along a long north‚Äìsouth axis, rather than having the conventional rectangular plan with orientation toward the east. The temple gives its name to Cambodia's Preah Vihear province, in which it is now located, as well as the Khao Phra Wihan National Park which borders it in Thailand's Sisaket province, though it is no longer accessible from Thailand. On July 7, 2008, Preah Vihear was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Rough map of Cambodia and Thailand, showing the location of the temple being exactly at the border line of Thailand and Cambodia  Location  The temple was built at the top of Poy Tadi, a steep cliff in the D√¢ngr√™k Mountain range which is the natural border between Cambodia and Thailand. The Temple is currently listed by Cambodia as being in Svay Chrum Village, Kan Tout Commune, in Choam Khsant District of Preah Vihear Province of northern Cambodia. The temple is 140 km from Angkor Wat and 418 km from Phnom Penh. The Temple was listed by Thailand as being in Bhumsrol village of Bueng Malu sub-district (now merged with Sao Thong Chai sub-district), in Kantharalak district of the Sisaket Province of eastern Thailand. It is 110 km from the Mueang Sisaket District, the center of Sisaket Province. In 1962 the ICJ ruled that only the temple building belonged to Cambodia, while the direct way to access the temple was from ThailandBunruam Tiemjarn, ‡πÑ‡∏ó‡∏¢‡πÅ‡∏û‡πâ‡∏Ñ‡∏î‡∏µ ‡πÄ‡∏™‡∏µ‡∏¢‡∏î‡∏¥‡∏ô‡πÅ‡∏î‡∏ô‡πÉ‡∏´‡πâ‡πÄ‡∏Ç‡∏°‡∏£ (Thai Lost the Case - Lost territories to Khmer), Animate Group Publishing Limited, Thailand, 2007 , but currently, as of at least 2015, the only access is from inside Cambodia. = The site = The temple complex runs along a north‚Äìsouth axis facing the plains to the north, from which it is now cut off by the international border. It consists essentially of a causeway and steps rising up the hill towards the sanctuary, which sits on the clifftop at the southern end of the complex ( above the northern end of the complex, above the Cambodian plain and above sea level). Although this structure is very different from the temple mountains found at Angkor, it serves the same purpose as a stylised representation of Mount Meru, the home of the gods. The approach to the sanctuary is punctuated by five gopuras (these are conventionally numbered from the sanctuary outwards, so gopura five is the first to be reached by visitors). Each of the gopuras before the courtyards is reached by a set of steps, and so marks a change in height which increases their impact. The gopuras also block a visitor's view of the next part of the temple until they pass through the gateway, making it impossible to see the complex as a whole from any one point. The fifth gopura, in the Koh Ker style, retains traces of the red paint with which it was once decorated, although the tiled roof has now disappeared. The fourth gopura is later, from the Khleang/Baphuon periods, and has on its southern outer pediment, \\"one of the masterpieces of Preah Vihear\\" (Freeman, p. 162) : a depiction of the Churning of the Sea of Milk. The third is the largest, and is also flanked by two halls. The sanctuary is reached via two successive courtyards, in the outer of which are two libraries. Plan of Prasat Preah Vihear  Nomenclature  Prasat Preah Vihear is the compound of words Prasat, Preah and Vihear, which mean the \\"religious offering of sacred shrine\\". In Sanskrit, Prasat (‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§∏‡§æ‡§¶) (·ûî·üí·ûö·û∂·ûü·û∂·ûë) means \\"religious offering\\" which could even be taken as synonym of \\"temple\\" in this context, Preah (·ûñ·üí·ûö·üá) mean \\"sacred\\" or \\"beloved\\", and \\"Vihear\\" (·ûú·û∑·û†·û∂·ûö) from the Sanskrit word Vihara (‡§µ‡§ø‡§π‡§æ‡§∞) means \\"abode\\" or \\"shrine\\" (the central structure of the temple). In Khmer, \\"phnom\\" (·ûó·üí·ûì·üÜ) means mountain, and Cambodians occasionally refer to it as \\"Phnom Preah Vihear\\" (·ûó·üí·ûì·üÜ·ûñ·üí·ûö·üá·ûú·û∑·û†·û∂·ûö). These versions of the name carry significant political and national connotations (see below: New dispute over ownership). Entrance to the temple structure  History  = Ancient history = Construction of the first temple on the site began in the early 9th century; both then and in the following centuries it was dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva in his manifestations as the mountain gods Sikharesvara and Bhadresvara. The earliest surviving parts of the temple, however, date from the Koh Ker period in the early 10th century, when the empire's capital was at the city of that name. Today, elements of the Banteay Srei style of the late 10th century can be seen, but most of the temple was constructed during the reigns of the Khmer kings Suryavarman IHigham, C., 2001, The Civilization of Angkor, London: Weidenfeld & Nicolson, (1006‚Äì1050) and Suryavarman II (1113‚Äì1150). An inscription found at the temple provides a detailed account of Suryavarman II studying sacred rituals, celebrating religious festivals and making gifts, including white parasols, golden bowls and elephants, to his spiritual advisor, the aged Brahmin Divakarapandita. The Brahmin himself took an interest in the temple, according to the inscription, donating to it a golden statue of a dancing Shiva known as Nataraja. In the wake of the decline of Hinduism in the region the site was converted to use by Buddhists. The temple is located on a hill, oriented along a north-south axis and facing the plains to the north in what is now Thailand. = Modern history and ownership dispute = Drawing of temple structures In modern times, Prasat Preah Vihear was rediscovered by the outside world and became subject of an emotional dispute between Thailand and the newly independent Cambodia. In 1904, Siam and the French colonial authorities ruling Cambodia formed a joint commission to demarcate their mutual border to largely follow the watershed line of the D√¢ngr√™k mountain range, which placed nearly all of Preah Vihear temple on Thailand's side. In 1907, after survey work, French officers drew up a map to show the border's location. However, the resulting topographic map, which was sent to Siamese authorities and used in the 1962 (International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruling, showed the line deviating slightly from the watershed without explanation in the Preah Vihear area, placing all of the temple on the Cambodian side. Following the withdrawal of French troops from Cambodia in 1954, Thai forces occupied the temple to enforce their claim. Cambodia protested and in 1959 asked the ICJ to rule that the temple and the surrounding land lay in Cambodian territory. The case became a volatile political issue in both countries. Diplomatic relations were severed, and threats of force were voiced by both governments. The court proceedings focused not on questions of cultural heritage or on which state was the successor to the Khmer Empire, but rather on Siam's supposed long-time acceptance of the 1907 map. Arguing in The Hague for Cambodia was former U.S. Secretary of State Dean Acheson, while Thailand's legal team included a former British attorney general, Sir Frank Soskice. Cambodia contended the map showing the temple as being on Cambodian soil was the authoritative document. Thailand argued that the map was invalid and that it was not an official document of the border commission, and that it clearly violated the commission's working principle that the border would follow the watershed line, which would place most of the temple in Thailand. If Thailand had not protested the map earlier, the Thai side said, it was because Thai authorities had had actual possession of the temple for some period of time, due to the great difficulty of scaling the steep hillside from the Cambodian side, or simply had not understood that the map was wrong. Illustration of temple structures On 15 June 1962, the court ruled 9 to 3 that the temple belonged to Cambodia and, by a vote of 7 to 5, that Thailand must return any antiquities such as sculptures that it had removed from the temple. In its decision, the court noted that in over the five decades after the map was drawn, the Siamese/Thai authorities had not objected in various international forums to its depiction of the temple's location. Nor did they object when a French colonial official received the Siamese scholar and government figure Prince Damrong at the temple in 1930 (possibly before the Thais realised the map was wrong). Thailand had accepted and benefited from other parts of the border treaty, the court ruled. With these and other acts, it said, Thailand had accepted the map and therefore Cambodia was the owner of the temple. Australian judge Sir Percy Spender wrote a scathing dissent for the minority on the court, however, pointing out that the French government had never mentioned Thai \\"acquiescence\\" or acceptance at any time, not even when Thailand stationed military observers at the temple in 1949. On the contrary, France always insisted that their map was correct and the temple was located on their side of the natural watershed (which it clearly is not). Thailand had modified its own maps, which in Spender's opinion was sufficient without having to protest to France. Spender said: Thailand reacted angrily. It announced it would boycott meetings of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, with Thai officials saying this step was to protest a U.S. bias toward Cambodia in the dispute. As evidence, Thai officials cited Acheson's role as Cambodia's advocate; the U.S. government replied that Acheson was merely acting as a private attorney, engaged by Cambodia. Mass demonstrations were staged in Thailand protesting the ruling. Thailand eventually backed down and agreed to turn the site over to Cambodia. Rather than lower the Thai national flag that had been flying at the temple, Thai soldiers dug up and removed the pole with it still flying.Prasat Phra Viharn, truth that Thais need to know, Baan Phra A Thit Publishing. July 2008, Bangkok. . The pole was erected at nearby Mor I Daeng cliff, where it is still in use. In January 1963, Cambodia formally took possession of the site in a ceremony attended by around 1,000 people, many of whom had made the arduous climb up the cliff from the Cambodian side. Prince Sihanouk, Cambodia's leader, walked up the cliff in less than an hour, then made offerings to Buddhist monks. He made a gesture of conciliation in the ceremony, announcing that all Thais would be able to visit the temple without visas, and that Thailand was free to keep any antiquities it may have taken away from the site.The New York Times, Jan. 8, 1963, p. 7. = Civil war = Civil war began in Cambodia in 1970; the temple's location high atop a cliff served to make it readily defensible militarily. Soldiers loyal to the Lon Nol government in Phnom Penh continued to hold it long after the plain below fell to communist forces. Tourists were able to visit from the Thai side during the war. Even though the Khmer Rouge captured Phnom Penh in April 1975, the Khmer National Armed Forces soldiers at Preah Vihear continued to hold out after the collapse of the Khmer Republic government. The Khmer Rouge made several unsuccessful attempts to capture the temple, then finally succeeded on May 22, 1975 by shelling the cliff, scaling it and routing the defenders, Thai officials reported at the time. The defenders simply stepped across the border and surrendered to Thai authorities.United Press International, May 23, 1975 It was said to be the last place in Cambodia to fall to the Khmer Rouge. Full-scale war began again in Cambodia in December 1978 when the Vietnamese army invaded to overthrow the Khmer Rouge. Khmer Rouge troops retreated to border areas. In January, the Vietnamese reportedly attacked Khmer Rouge troops holed up in the temple, but there were no reports of damage to it. Large numbers of Cambodian refugees entered Thailand after the invasion. Guerrilla warfare continued in Cambodia through the 1980s and well into the 1990s, hampering access to Preah Vihear. The temple opened briefly to the public in 1992, only to be re-occupied the following year by Khmer Rouge fighters. In December 1998, the temple was the scene of negotiations by which several hundred Khmer Rouge soldiers, said to be the guerrilla movement's last significant force, agreed to surrender to the Phnom Penh government.The New York Times, Dec. 6, 1998, p. 18. The temple opened again to visitors from the Thai side at the end of 1998; Cambodia completed the construction of a long-awaited access road up the cliff in 2003. = Expulsion of Cambodian refugees = On June 12, 1979, the government of General Kriangsak Chomanan, who had come to power in Thailand by a military coup, informed foreign embassies in Bangkok that it was going to expel a large number of Cambodian refugees. He would allow the governments of the United States, France, and Australia to select 1,200 of the refugees to resettle in their countries. Lionel Rosenblatt, Refugee Coordinator of the American Embassy, Yvette Pierpaoli, a French businesswoman in Bangkok, and representatives of the Australian and French governments rushed to the border to select the refugees that night. In three frantic hours the foreigners picked out 1,200 refugees for resettlement from among the thousands being held by Thai soldiers behind barbed wire in a Buddhist temple at Wat Ko Refugee Camp and loaded them on buses to go to Bangkok. The remaining refugees were then loaded on buses and sent away, their destination unknown. It later became known that Cambodian refugees had been collected from many locations and sent to Preah Vihear. An American Embassy official stood beneath a tree along a dirt road leading to the temple, counted the buses, and estimated that about 42,000 Cambodians were taken to Preah Vihear.Thompson, Larry Clinton. Refugee Workers in the Indochina Exodus, 1975-1982. Jefferson, NC: McFarland & Co, 2010, 175 Preah Vihear is situated at the top of a 2,000 foot high escarpment overlooking the Cambodian plains far below. The refugees were unloaded from the buses and pushed down the steep escarpment. ‚ÄúThere was no path to follow,‚Äù one said. ‚ÄúThe way that we had to go down was only a cliff. Some people hid on top of the mountain and survived. Others were shot or pushed over the cliff. Most of the people began to climb down using vines as ropes. They tied their children on their backs and strapped them across their chests. As the people climbed down, the soldiers threw big rocks over the cliff.‚ÄùThompson, 176 At the foot of the cliffs were minefields, placed by the Khmer Rouge during their rule in Cambodia. The refugees followed a narrow path, the safe route indicated by the bodies of those who had set off land mines. They used the bodies as stepping stones to cross the three miles of mined land to reach the Vietnamese soldiers, occupiers of Cambodia, on the other side. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees later estimated that as many as 3,000 Cambodians had died in the push-back and another 7,000 were unaccounted for. General Kriangsak's objective in this brutal operation apparently was to demonstrate to the international community that his government would not bear alone the burden of hundreds of thousands of Cambodian refugees. If so, it worked. For the next dozen years the UN and Western countries would pay for the upkeep of Cambodian refugees in Thailand, resettling thousands in other countries, and devising means by which Cambodians could return safely to their own country.Thompson, 178 = World Heritage Site = Lintel showing Shiva fighting Arjuna, gopura three On July 8, 2008, the World Heritage Committee decided to add Prasat Preah Vihear, along with 26 other sites, to the World Heritage Site list, despite several protests from Thailand, since the map implied Cambodian ownership of disputed land next to the temple. As the process of Heritage-listing began, Cambodia announced its intention to apply for World Heritage inscription by UNESCO. Thailand protested that it should be a joint-effort and UNESCO deferred debate at its 2007 meeting. Following this, both Cambodia and Thailand were in full agreement that Preah Vihear Temple had \\"Outstanding Universal Value\\" and should be inscribed on the World Heritage List as soon as possible. The two nations agreed that Cambodia should propose the site for formal inscription on the World Heritage List at the 32nd session of the World Heritage Committee in 2008 with the active support of Thailand. This led to a redrawing of the map of the area for proposed inscription, leaving only the temple and its immediate environs. However, Thailand's political opposition launched an attack on this revised plan (see Modern History and Ownership Dispute), claiming the inclusion of Preah Vihear could nevertheless \\"consume\\" the overlapping disputed area near the temple. In response to the political pressure at home, the Thai government withdrew its formal support for the listing of Preah Vihear Temple as a World Heritage site. Cambodia continued with the application for World Heritage status and, despite official Thai protests, on July 7, 2008, Preah Vihear Temple was inscribed on the list of World Heritage sites. The renewed national boundary dispute since 2008 has been a reminder that despite the World Heritage ideals of conservation for all humanity, operating a World Heritage site often requires use of national authority at odds with the local cultures and natural diversity of the landscape. Prior to the listing, Cambodia considered Preah Vihear to be part of a Protected Landscape (IUCN category V), defined as \\"Nationally significant natural and semi-natural landscapes which must be maintained to provide opportunities for recreation.\\" However, Category V is generally defined as \\"Land, with coast and seas as appropriate, where the interaction of people and nature over time has produced an area of distinct character with significant aesthetic, cultural and/or ecological value, and often with high biological diversity. Safeguarding the integrity of this traditional interaction is vital to the protection, maintenance and evolution of such an area.\\" A luxury tour that takes travellers camping on temple sites, crossing the border into Thailand issues a warning to travellers on the possibility of a 're-routing' of the itinerary. During the People's Alliance for Democracy's seizure of Suvarnabhumi Airport, future Thai Foreign Minister Kasit Piromya reportedly called Cambodian Prime Minister in a 2008 television interview \\"crazy\\" and a \\"nak leng\\" (commonly translated as \\"gangster\\").Pavin Chachavalpongpun, \\"Glorifying the Inglorious Past: Historical Overhangs in Thai-Cambodian Relations\\", paper presented at Historical Overhangs in East Asian International Relations Workshop, Jeju Peace Institute, 21‚Äì22 April 2010 Temple structures in 2003 In 1994, Thailand held a World Heritage proposal conference in Srisaket in which local cultural traditions were considered along with monuments such as Preah Vihear that stimulate more nationalistic sentiments. The use of passes in the Dongrak Mountains reportedly tied together cultural communities and practices divided by a militarized (and imperfectly demarcated) modern border line. A Mon-Khmer ethnic minority, the Kui or Suay (the ethnonyms have multiple spellings), used the passes to hunt and capture elephants in the forests below the Dongrak cliff edge, including the Kulen area which is now a Cambodian wildlife sanctuary. Kui in Cambodia were skilled ironsmiths using ore from Phnom Dek.Seidenfaden, Erik (1952) \\"The Kui People of Cambodia and Siam,\\" Journal of the Siam Society 39(2): 144-180. While elephant hunting in the vicinity of Preah Vihear was touched upon in the International Court of Justice proceedings, the World Heritage plans overlook local culture and species protection to facilitate national revenues from tourism. One international law professor has urged that practicality calls for laying aside exclusive sovereignty in favor of an \\"international peace park.\\"Roth, William, Bangkok Post July 22, 2008 A scholarly article concurs in concluding: \\"Since Thailand and Cambodia have brought only blood and bitterness to this place, it might be desirable to preserve it from both. It could be given back to nature and the indigenous peoples, to be managed cooperatively between the two governments in equal partnership with local communities, as a transborder Protected Landscape-Anthropological Reserve (IUCN category V and old category VII).\\"Cuasay, Modern Asian Studies 32, 4 (1998), pp. 849-890. Given the massing troops in 2008, perhaps such a transborder reserve would create not only a demilitarized buffer zone in which any future demarcation can be amicably undertaken, but a recognition of the added ecological and cultural aspects of an area which both Cambodia and Thailand may still save from the destructive and exploitative impacts of rapid development so often suffered in other ASEAN countries. = Disputes over ownership since 2008 = The conflict between Cambodia and Thailand over land adjoining the site has led to periodic outbreaks of violence. A military clash occurred in October 2008. In April 2009, 66 stones at the temple allegedly were damaged by Thai soldiers firing across the border. In February 2010, the Cambodian government filed a formal letter of complaint with Google Maps for depicting the natural watershed as the international border instead of the line shown on the 1907 French map used by the International Court of Justice in 1962.Cambodia Complains of Google Map Mistake at Preah Vihear Temple In February 2011, when Thai officials were in Cambodia negotiating the dispute, Thai and Cambodian troops clashed, resulting in injuries and deaths on both sides. Artillery bombardment in the area occurred during the conflict. The Cambodian government has claimed that damage occurred to the temple.Petzet, Michael (2010). \\"Cambodia: Temple of Preah Vihear\\". In Christoph Machat, Michael Petzet and John Ziesemer (Eds.), Berlin: hendrik B√§√üler verlag, 2010 However, a UNESCO mission to the site to determine the extent of the damage indicates that the destruction is a result of both Cambodian and Thai gunfire. Since February 4, both sides have used artillery against each other, and both blame the other for starting the violence. On February 5, Cambodia had formally complained in a letter to the U.N. \\"The recent Thai military actions violate the 1991 Paris Peace Accord, U.N. Charter and a 1962 judgment from the International Court of Justice\\", the letter claims. On February 6, the Cambodian government claimed that the temple had been damaged. Cambodia's military commander said: \\"A wing of our Preah Vihear temple has collapsed as a direct result of the Thai artillery bombardment\\".\\"Thai-Cambodia clashes 'damage Preah Vihear temple'\\", BBC, February 6, 2011 However, Thai sources spoke only of minor damage, claiming that Cambodian soldiers had fired from within the temple.www.manager.co.th/IndoChina (Thai) ASEAN, to which both states belong, has offered to mediate over the issue. However, Thailand has insisted that bilateral discussions could better solve the issue. On February 5, the rightwing People's Alliance for Democracy called for the resignation of Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva for \\"failing to defend the nation's sovereignty\\". A UNESCO World Heritage convention held in Paris in June 2011 determined to accept Cambodia's management proposal for the temple. As a consequence, Thailand withdrew from the event, with the Thai representative explaining, \\"We withdraw to say we do not accept any decision from this meeting.\\" Following a February 2011 request from Cambodia for Thai military forces to be ordered out of the area, judges of the ICJ by a vote of 11-5 ordered that both countries immediately withdraw their military forces, and further imposed restrictions on their police forces. The court said this order would not prejudice any final ruling on where the border in the area between Thailand and Cambodia should fall. Abhisit Vejjajiva said that Thai soldiers would not pull out from the disputed area until the military of both countries agree on the mutual withdrawal. \\"[I]t depends on the two sides to come together and talk,\\" he said, suggesting that an existing joint border committee would be the appropriate place to plan a coordinated pullback. The ICJ ruled on 11 November 2013 that the land adjacent to the temple on the east and west (south being previously agreed as Cambodian, north as Thai) belongs to Cambodia and that any Thai security forces still in that area should leave.  Architecture  = Plan at a glance = Large stairways and long pillared causeway lead to the gopura of the first three levels of the mountain. The gopura are gateways leading into the sanctuary and probably had statues of guardians or minor deities installed in their rooms. The naga balustrade between the third and fourth and the top level. There, the galleries and colonnades define areas for religious ceremonies and rituals performed in and around the main shrine containing the sacred linga.Vittorio Roveda, Preah Vihear, River books guides, Bongkok in Thailand.pp.33 = Construction materials = The gray and yellow sandstone used for the construction of Preah Vihear was available locally. Wood was used extensively to construct a support for the roof which was covered with terracotta tiles. Bricks, despite their small size, were used instead of large rock slabs to construct the corbelled arches.Bricks were easier to used when building corbelled roofs as they bound together with mortar and were more compact and solid than stone slabs.The sandstone blocks used for the construction of the main tower are exceptionally large, weighing no less than five tons.Several have had holes used for lifting the block drilled in up 24 places.Vittorio Roveda, Preah Vihear, River books guides, Bongkok in Thailand.pp.30 = Elements = The mumbering of the various elements of Khmer temple, its enclosure, courtyards gopura etc., customarily starts from the central sanctuary and works outwards. The gopura nearest the central shrine are given the number 1. In axial temples the last gopura encountered by the visitor will be gopura I and the first, outer gopura the one with the highest number. Here the traditional number is given in brackets. Thus the first gopura encountered is described as the gopura of the first level with its archaeological number given in a brackets( Gopura V). The system is the same one that the archaeologist Parmentier used for his detailed description of Preah Vihear published in 1039.Vittorio Roveda, Preah Vihear, River books guides, Bongkok in Thailand.pp.32  InscriptionVittorio Roveda, Preah Vihear, River books guides, Bongkok in Thailand.pp.20  Several inscriptions have been found at Preah Vihear, the most interesting of which are summarised here. * K.383 Known as the Stele of Preah Vihear or Stele of the Divakara, this inscription was written in Sanskrit and Khmer probably between 1119 and 1121. It narrates, by order of Suryavarman II, the life of royal guru Divakara and how he served under five Khmer king (Udayadiyavarman II, Harshavarman III, Jayavarman VI, Dharanindravarman I and Suryaman II), who entrusted him with many gifts, both for himself and to be donated on their behalf to temples. Between the first and second decade of the 12th century, Divakara was asked by Suryavarman II to go on a pilgrimage to the temples to offer gifts, preside over ritual sacrifices and carry out improvements and repair works. At Preah Vihear temple, Davakara offered precious objects to Shikhareshvara, such as a statue, probably of gold, of the dancing Shiva. He added a gold dais inlaid with precious stones, covered the temple floor with bronze plaques and decorated the walls with plates of precious metal. He ordered that the towers, courts and main entrance be redecorated annually. He also distributed payments to all those who worked at the temple. This inscription is engraved on a stele found inside the mandapa. * K.380 This inscription appears on both sides of the southern door on the gopura of the fourth level. Written in Sanskrit and Khmer probably between 1038 and 1049, it contains important history about Preah Vihear temple. It narrates the story of a local personage, Sukarman, who carried out the duties of Recorder in the Sanctuary and keeper of Archives of the Kingdom. It also tells of a royal decree requiring certain people to swear an oath of allegiance to Shikhareshvara. * K.381 This inscription was sculpted on the southern doorjamb of the eastern palace's portico on the third level. Written in Sanskrit and Khmer during 1024, it narrates the story of Tapasvindra-pandita, head of a hermitage, who was asked to dispose of presentation in favour of Shikhareshvara, the main god of the temple. * K.382 This inscription was carved on a pillar and was found badly damaged in front of the central sanctuary and later taken to the National Museum in Bangkok. Inscribed in 1047 it refers to Suryavarman I who commissioned the inscription but contains little information that is important to Preah Vihear temple.  The mountain stairway  When visitors pass the modern entrance gate they are faced with an impressive and majestic steep stairway. It consists of 163 steps made with large stone slabs, many of which are cut directly into the rock surface. The stairway is 8 meters wide and 78.5 meters long. It was originally flanked by rows of lion statues of which only a few remain, close to the modern entrance gate. In its last 27 meters the stairway narrow to a width of only four meters and is flanked by seven small terraces on either side which were once decorated with the lion statues. The difficulty of climbing the stairway symbolises the laborious path of faith needed to approach the sacred world of the gods.Vittorio Roveda, Preah Vihear, River books guides, Bongkok in Thailand.pp.34  The Lion Head Reservoir  Between Gopura IV and III, some 50 meters to the east of the second pillared avenue, there is a square, stone paved reservoir, 9.4 meters on the each side. Each side of the reservoir has 12 steps, each 20 to 25 centimeters high. Near this small reservoir, there is a re-dented, square brick base six meters on each side. It is supposed that this was used as the pedestal for a statue or a small construction made in perishable materials, suggesting a ritual use of this small reservoir. according to previous reports, on the southern side of this pool there was a stone lion's head with a water outlet from its mouth. It was visible only when the water level of the reservoir was very low. This lion spout is no longer at the site. and its where about are not known.Sachchidanan Sahai, Preah Vihear an Introduction to the world heritage monument, cambodian national commission for UNESCO with support of UNESCO office in Phnom Penh and National Authority for Preah Vihear, September 2009  Windows  In the Preah Vihear complex there is quite a range of window designs. Windows with three or five balusters are common. Those with seven balusters are found only in the palaces at Gopura III. The increased number of balusters at the stage establishes the hierarchy of buildings and those who dwelt therein. Lateral doors are flanked by false windows with balusters.  Access  From Cambodia, go to Preah Vihear Ticket Selling Office on Route 62, where you will park. The ticket office can be approached either by Tbeng Meanchey in Preah Vihear province or from Siem Reap in Siem Reap province via Anlong Veng. Although the highway is paved when it leaves Siem Reap, both roads are (occasionally) graded gravel once they begin to approach the Dangrek escarpment. From Phnom Penh, there are paved roads all the way to the ticket office, about 6-7 hours each way, which can be done round trip in one very long day. At the ticket office, foreigners must buy a ticket, and then arrange a ride up the steep roads to the top either via motorcycle (one person, US$5) or a small truck (up to six people, US$25). Cambodian citizens do not pay for a ticket, but must also arrange a trip to the top. There are two checkpoints along the way where you must present your ticket. , it is still not possible to access Preah Vihear from Thailand.

It was issued just days after Gregory had succeeded Urban III as pope, in response to the defeat of the Kingdom of Jerusalem at the Battle of Hattin on July 4 of 1187. Jerusalem itself had fallen to Saladin on October 2 (see Siege of Jerusalem), but news of that had not yet reached Europe by the time the bull was issued at the end of the month. As with other papal bulls, Audita tremendi takes its common title from the first few words of text, which do not necessarily make any grammatical sense on their own. The first line of the bull reads \\"Audita tremendi severitate judicii, quod super terram Jerusalem divina manus exercuit...\\", in English \\"On hearing with what severe and terrible judgement the land of Jerusalem has been smitten by the divine hand...\\" (the phrase \\"audita severitate\\" is a Latin grammatical construction known as ablative absolute). The text follows the same format as Quantum praedecessores, the bull calling for the Second Crusade in 1145. It focuses specifically on the defeat at Hattin on 4 July 1187 and subsequent devastation of the Kingdom of Jerusalem by Saladin. It points to the sins of the Latin States as the reason for this great loss. As a result, the people of Latin Christendom must repent for their sins. The bull offered a plenary indulgence, and offered church protection for the property of those who undertook the journey; thus through this logic the bull draws the conclusion that, due to the sins of the west, Saladin was able to achieve victory in Hattin and its aftermath, and now the people of the west must repent by going on a crusade to recapture the kingdom. The Bull itself is ambiguous on any stated objective, and this is open to continued debate and interpretation. Full Text \\"Gregory, bishop, servant of the servants of God, to all Christ‚Äôs faithful who receive this letter, greeting and apostolic benediction. When we heard of the severity of the awesome judgment that the hand of God visited on the land of Jerusalem, we and our brothers were disturbed by such a great horror, afflicted by such sorrows, that we scarcely knew what to do or what we should do, save that the psalmist laments and says, ‚Äò‚ÄòO God, the gentiles have invaded your inheritance, they have sullied your holy temple, they have laid waste Jerusalem; they have left the dead bodies of your saints as meat for the beasts of the earth and food the birds of the air . . .‚Äô‚Äô [Ps 78:1‚Äì 2]. In fact, because of the conflict which the malice of [Christian] men has recently brought on the land by the inspiration of the devil, Saladin approached those parts with a host of armed troops. They were confronted by the king and the bishops, the Templars and the Hospitallers, the barons and the knights, with the people of the land, and with the Lord‚Äôs cross (through which from memory and faith of the suffering of Christ, who hung there and redeemed the human race, was believed to be a sure safeguard and a desired defense against the attacks of the pagans), and after the battle was joined, our side was defeated and the Lord‚Äôs cross was captured. The bishops were slaughtered, the king captured, and almost all our men were either put to the sword or taken prisoner. Very few are believed to have escaped. Also, the Templars and Hospitallers were beheaded in his [Saladin‚Äôs] presence. With the army defeated, we do not think our letter can explain how they next invaded and seized every place so that only a few remained outside their power. Still, though we use the words of the prophet: ‚Äò‚ÄòWho will give me water for my head and a font of tears for my eyes, and I will weep night and day for the death of my people‚Äô‚Äô [Jer 9:1], we ought not despair now and decide to mistrust and believe that God is so angry with his people that in his anger with their commission of a multitude of sins he will not quickly pardon when he is pleased by their penance and, after tears and groans, will lead them to exaltation. Indeed, whoever does not mourn at least in his heart in so great a cause for sorrow not only is ignorant of the Christian faith, which teaches us to join in all suffering, but of our very humanity. For from the magnitude of the dangers and their barbarous ferocity thirsting for the blood of Christians, and adding all their power in this cause to profane the holy and erase the name of God from that land, whoever thinks we should be silent should decide. Of course, when the prophets worked previously with total desire, later the apostles and their followers worked so that divine worship should be in that land and should spread from it to every part of the world by every means great and wonderful. God, through whom all things were made, who wished to take on flesh through his divine wisdom and his incomprehensible mercy and desired to achieve our salvation through the weakness of our flesh, hunger, thirst, the cross, death and resurrection, according to the words ‚Äò‚ÄòAnd he has worked salvation in the midst of the land‚Äô‚Äô [Ps 73:12] has himself decided to work for this end. Neither can tongue speak nor the senses understand what that land has now suffered, how much it has suffered for us and for all Christians, that we read it endured under its ancient population. Moreover, we ought not believe that these things happened because of the unjust act of the judge but rather by the iniquity of an unworthy people, since we read that at the time when the people were being converted to the Lord, ‚Äò‚Äòone thousand were persecuted and two were fleeing from ten thousand‚Äô‚Äô [Dt 32:30]. On the contrary, however, the army of Sennacharib was overcome by an angelic force. But ‚Äò‚Äòthat land also devoured its inhabitants‚Äô‚Äô [Nm 13:33] and was not at peace for very long, nor could it restrain those who broke the law. Nor did it give teaching to those who would seek the heavenly Jerusalem, which they could not attain save through the exercise of good works and after many temptations. But they could long ago fear those things, when Arroasia [Edessa] and other land fell into the hands of the pagans [1144], and it was clearly foreseen if the people who remained had again done penance they would have pleased God whom they offended by their sins. For his anger is not quick, but he puts off the punishment, and gives time for repentance. But, finally, he does not lose his judgment in mercy, but exercises his protection for the punishment of sinners and for the surety of those to be saved. We, therefore, should heed and be concerned about the sins not only of the inhabitants of that land but also of our own and those of the whole Christian people so that what is left of that land may not be lost and their power rage in other regions. For we hear from every direction of scandals and conflicts between kings and princes, among cities, so that we lament with the prophet and are able to say: ‚Äò‚ÄòThere is no truth, no knowledge of God in the land: lying, murder and adultery abound, and blood pursues blood‚Äô‚Äô [Hos 4:1‚Äì 2]. For this reason, everyone must understand and act accordingly, so that by atoning for our sins, we may be converted to the Lord by penance and works of piety and we may first alter in our lives the evil that we do. Then we can deal with the savagery and malice of our enemies. And, what they do not fear to try against God, we will not hesitate to do for God. Therefore, sons, consider how you came into this world and how all pass on, and thus you will pass on. Use the time for penitence and doing well insofar as it regards you, with thanks. Give yourselves, give after yourselves, because you, who cannot make even a gnat upon the land, have nothing of your own. We do not say, dismiss, but send us forth in the heavenly harvest which you have and deposit with him ‚Äò‚Äòupon whom the rust does not destroy, nor the worms, nor the thieves dig up and steal‚Äô‚Äô [Mt 6:20]. Work for the recovery of that land in which for our salvation Truth has arisen from the land and did not disdain to carry the forked wood of the cross for us. Pay attention not to earthly profit and glory, but to the will of God who himself taught us to lay down our souls for our brothers. Give your riches to him, which whether willingly or unwillingly, you do not know to which greedy heirs they will be left. It is certainly not new, nor unusual, that that land is persecuted by a divine judgment that, after being beaten and corrected, it may obtain mercy. Of course, the Lord could preserve it by his will alone, but it is not for us to know why he would do this. Perhaps he wished to experience and bring to the notice of others if someone is understanding and seeking God, who having offered himself embraces the time of penance joyfully. He sacrifices himself for his brothers; though he may die young, still he accomplishes much. Heed how the Maccabees, afire with the divine zeal of the law experienced extreme dangers for the freedom of their brothers. They taught that not only riches but their persons should be sacrificed for their brothers, exhorting and saying to each other: ‚Äò‚ÄòGird yourselves and be powerful sons because it is better for us to die in battle than to witness the desecration of our nation and our saints‚Äô‚Äô [1 Mc 3:58‚Äì 59] Indeed, they were subject to one law; you by the incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ have been led to the light of truth and instructed by the many examples of the saints. You should act without trepidation and do not fear to give away earthly possessions, which will last for such a short time, for those goods we are promised that ‚Äò‚Äòneither eye has seen nor ear has heard nor have they entered into the heart of man‚Äô‚Äô [1 Cor 2:9], as the Apostle says: ‚Äò‚ÄòThat the sufferings of this time are not worthy to be compared to the future glory which will be revealed in us‚Äô‚Äô [Rom 8:18]. We promise full remission of their sins and eternal life to those who take up the labor of this journey with a contrite heart and a humble spirit and depart in penitence of their sins and with true faith. Whether they survive or die, they should know that they, after they have made a true confession, will have the relaxation of the penance imposed, by the mercy of almighty God, by the authority of the apostles Peter and Paul, and ours. Their goods, from their reception of the cross, with their families, remain under the protection of the holy Roman Church, as well as the archbishops and bishops and other prelates. They should not face any legal challenge regarding the things they possess legally when they received the cross until their return or their death is known for certain, but they should also keep legally all their goods. Also, they may not be forced to pay interest if they have a loan.

The AK-102, AK-104, and AK-105 are very similar in design, the only difference being the caliber and corresponding magazine type. The AK-105 is chambered to fire 5.45√ó39mm ammunition. Design Compared to the AK-74M, AK-101, and AK-103, which are full-size assault rifles of similar design, the AK-102, 104, and 105 feature shortened barrels that make them a middle ground between a full rifle and the more compact AKS-74U. However, the AK-105 also features a solid, side-folding polymer stock, unlike the shorter, skeleton-stocked AKS-74U. The AK-105 uses an adjustable notched rear tangent iron sight calibrated in increments from . The front sight is a post adjustable for elevation in the field. Horizontal adjustment is done by the armory before issue. The AK-105 has a muzzle booster derived from the AKS-74U. Protective coatings ensure excellent corrosion resistance of metal parts. Forearm, magazine, butt stock and pistol grip are made of high strength plastic. The weapon is equipped with a flash hider. The 100-series AKs are produced by the Izhmash factories in Izhevsk, Russia.

The mineral form of SnO2 is called cassiterite, and this is the main ore of tin. With many other names, this oxide of tin is an important material in tin chemistry. It is a colourless, diamagnetic, amphoteric solid. Structure Tin (IV) oxide fibers (optical microscope) Tin(IV) oxide crystallises with the rutile structure. As such the tin atoms are six coordinate and the oxygen atoms three coordinate. SnO2 is usually regarded as an oxygen-deficient n-type semiconductor.Solid State Chemistry: An Introduction Lesley Smart, Elaine A. Moore (2005) CRC Press Hydrous forms of SnO2 have been described as stannic acid. Such materials appear to be hydrated particles of SnO2 where the composition reflects the particle size. Preparation Tin(IV) oxide occurs naturally. Synthetic tin(IV) oxide is produced by burning tin metal in air. Annual production is in the range of 10 kilotons. SnO2 is reduced industrially to the metal with carbon in a reverberatory furnace at 1200‚Äì1300 ¬∞C.Tin: Inorganic chemistry,J L Wardell, Encyclopedia of Inorganic Chemistry ed R. Bruce King, John Wiley & Son Ltd., (1995) Amphoterism Although SnO2 is insoluble in water, it is amphoteric, dissolving in base and acid.Inorganic & Theoretical chemistry, F. Sherwood Taylor, Heineman, 6th Edition (1942) \\"Stannic acid\\" refers to hydrated tin (IV) oxide, SnO2, which is also called \\"stannic hydroxide.\\" Tin oxides dissolve in acids. Halogen acids attack SnO2 to give hexahalostannates,Donaldson & Grimes in Chemistry of tin ed. P.G. Harrison Blackie (1989) such as [SnI6]2‚àí. One report describes reacting a sample in refluxing HI for many hours. :SnO2 \\\\+ 6 HI ‚Üí H2SnI6 \\\\+ 2 H2O Similarly, SnO2 dissolves in sulfuric acid to give the sulfate: :SnO2 \\\\+ 2 H2SO4 ‚Üí Sn(SO4)2 \\\\+ 2 H2O SnO2 dissolves in strong bases to give \\"stannates,\\" with the nominal formula Na2SnO3. Dissolving the solidified SnO2/NaOH melt in water gives Na2[Sn(OH)6]2, \\"preparing salt,\\" which is used in the dye industry. Uses In conjunction with vanadium oxide, it is used as a catalyst for the oxidation of aromatic compounds in the synthesis of carboxylic acids and acid anhydrides. =Ceramic glazes= Tin(IV) oxide has long been used as an opacifier and as a white colorant in ceramic glazes.‚ÄôThe Glazer‚Äôs Book‚Äô ‚Äì 2nd edition. A.B.Searle.The Technical Press Limited. London. 1935. This has probably led to the discovery of the pigment lead-tin-yellow, which was produced using tin(IV) oxide as a compound.Hermann K√ºhn, 1967, \\"Blei-Zinn-Gelb und seine Verwendung in der Malerei\\", Farbe und Lack 73: 938-949 The use of tin(IV) oxide has been particularly common in glazes for earthenware, sanitaryware and wall tiles; see the articles tin-glazing and Tin-glazed pottery. Tin oxide remains in suspension in vitreous matrix of the fired glazes, and, with its high refractive index being sufficiently different from the matrix, light is scattered, and hence increases the opacity of the glaze. The degree of dissolution increases with the firing temperature, and hence the extent of opacity diminishes.‚ÄôA Treatise On Ceramic Industries.‚Äô E.Bourry. Fourth edition. Scott, Greenwood & son. London. 1926. Although dependent on the other constituents the solubility of tin oxide in glaze melts is generally low. Its solubility is increased by Na2O, K2O and B2O3, and reduced by CaO, BaO, ZnO, Al2O3, and to a limited extent PbO.‚ÄôCeramic Glazes‚Äô Third edition. C.W.Parmelee & C.G.Harman. Cahners Books, Boston, Massachusetts. 1973. SnO2 has been used as pigment in the manufacture of glasses, enamels and ceramic glazes. Pure SnO2 gives a milky white colour; other colours are achieved when mixed with other metallic oxides e.g. V2O5 yellow; Cr2O3 pink; and Sb2O5 grey blue. =Polishing= Tin(IV) oxide can be used as a polishing powder, sometimes in mixtures also with lead oxide, for polishing glass, jewelry, marble and silver. Tin(IV) oxide for this use is sometimes called as \\"putty powder\\" or \\"jeweler's putty\\". =Glass coatings= SnO2 coatings can be applied using chemical vapor deposition, vapour deposition techniques that employ SnCl4 or organotin trihalides e.g. butyltin trichloride as the volatile agent. This technique is used to coat glass bottles with a thin (<0.1 Œºm) layer of SnO2, which helps to adhere a subsequent, protective polymer coating such as polyethylene to the glass. Thicker layers doped with Sb or F ions are electrically conducting and used in electroluminescent devices and photovoltaics. =Gas sensing= SnO2 is used in sensors of combustible gases including carbon monoxide detectors. In these the sensor area is heated to a constant temperature (few hundred ¬∞C) and in the presence of a combustible gas the electrical resistivity drops.Joseph Watson The stannic oxide semiconductor gas sensor in The Electrical engineering Handbook 3d Edition; Sensors Nanoscience Biomedical Engineering and Instruments ed R.C Dorf CRC Press Taylor and Francis Doping with various compounds has been investigated (e.g. with CuO). Doping with cobalt and manganese, gives a material that can be used in e.g. high voltage varistors. Tin(IV) oxide can be doped with the oxides of iron or manganese.

The flight was a C-54 charter flying back to the United States from Shanghai. The aircraft refueled at Anchorage (Merrill Field) and took off at 8:12 P.M. to continue on to its destination, New York City (LaGuardia Airport). Instead of following the published airway, which detoured around Mount Sanford, the aircraft flew a direct line, crashing into the mountain. After the initial impact the wreckage slid down for about 3000 feet before coming to rest. There were no survivors. The passengers were American merchant mariners, crew members of the tanker SS Sunset, being ferried back home.* Many witnesses in the nearby town of Gulkana saw the crash, and the wreckage was initially located from the air, but it was completely inaccessible at the time. Snowstorms quickly buried it in a mountain glacier, and it was lost for over 50 years. Over the years, various individuals, lured by rumors of a secret gold cargo shipment from China, searched the mountain and came home empty-handed. Northwest pilot Marc Millican and Delta pilot Kevin McGregor had been searching the mountain together and on their own since 1995. In 1997 Millican and McGregor located a few pieces of wreckage but were unable to confirm it was from Northwest 4422. Only in 1999, after obtaining permission from the National Park Service and victims' relatives, were they able to remove wreckage confirming it was from Flight 4422. No secret treasure was ever found. At the time of the crash it was determined the pilots were off course and may not have seen the mountain at night. An NTSB investigation in 1999 shows the propellers were spinning at high velocity when they struck the mountain, which supports this theory. In addition to wreckage discovered in 1999, a mummified left hand and arm was found in the Alaska glacier. After nearly a decade, identifiable fingerprints were recovered from the remains by Edward Robinson. The remains were then positively identified by Michael Grimm on September 6, 2007 using fingerprints, making this the world's oldest known identification of post- mortem remains using fingerprint identification. The limb was from Francis Joseph Van Zandt, a 36-year-old merchant marine from Roanoke, Virginia, one of the passengers on Flight 4422. Subsequently, using DNA from a descendant of Van Zandt, Dr. Odile Loreille, an expert in DNA analysis, was also able to identify the remains using mitochondrial and Y-DNA identification. Only the remains of Francis Joseph Van Zandt were ever recovered or identified. The bodies of the remaining 29 individuals still await possible recovery. In popular culture In 2013, Kevin A. McGregor published Flight Of Gold, a non- fiction account of the events of Flight 4422, the multiple previous efforts to locate and explore the crash site, and McGregor and Millican's search for the crash site and its rumored valuable cargo.

It is separated from Kunashir Island of Russia by the Nemuro Strait. The name Shiretoko is derived from the Ainu word sir etok, meaning \\"the end of the Earth\\" or \\"the place where the Earth protrudes\\". The towns of Rausu and Shari are found on the peninsula. The Shiretoko Peninsula was registered as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2005, in recognition of the peninsula being the southernmost point where sea ice usually forms in the Northern Hemisphere. Geography From Shiretoko Cape at the tip of the peninsula, a series of volcanoes run down the peninsula, including Mount Shiretoko, Mount Unabetsu, and Mount I≈ç. It is part of the Chishima volcanic zone. The highest peak is Mount Rausu. The peninsula is long and wide at its base. It covers some The peninsula is bounded on the northwest side by the Sea of Okhotsk and the southeast side by the Pacific Ocean. To the east, Kunashiri Island runs parallel to the peninsula. The Kunashiri can be seen from Shiretoko Peninsula. Kunashiri has been occupied by Russia since September 1, 1945, and disputed by Japan. The cold Oyashio Current flows southwest along east side of the peninsula, and the Soya Current flows southeast from the Sea of Okhotsk until it is redirected north along the west side of the peninsula. In winter, the Soya Current carries sea ice south from the Sea of Okhotsk where it dams along the west side of the Shiretoko Peninsula resulting in the lowest latitude regularly occurring sea ice on earth at 43 degrees north. The volcanic zone has made several onsen possible, including Seseki Onsen and Iwaobetsu Onsen. =List of peaks= Relief Map * Mount Poromoi * Mount Shiretoko * Mount Dokkarimui * Mount Rusha * Mount Higashi * Mount Chienbetsu * Mount Minami * Mount I≈ç * Mount Okkabake * Mount Sashirui * Mount Rausu * Mount Chinnishibetsu * Mount Onnebetsu * Mount Unabetsu * Mount Shari * Mount Samakke Nupuri * Mount Shibetsu Climate The Oyashio Current has a profound impact on the weather of the peninsula. Shiretoko Peninsula has short summers and long winters. The current causes fog on the southeastern coast and sea ice in the winter. Snow covers the peaks from September to June, except the very highest peaks, which retain snow all summer long. Flora and fauna Sika deer Hokkaido brown bear The Shiretoko Peninsula is home to many species of both conifers and broadleaf trees, including the acorn-bearing Quercus mongolica ('). Siberian dwarf pine trees grow above . Red foxes and sika deer also inhabit the area. There are a large number of Ussuri brown bears. The upper reaches of Mount Rausu, Mount Onnebetsu, and Mount Shari are the only known breeding areas of Arctic warblers in Hokkaid≈ç. Sea eagles flourish here, and seals can be often seen on the coast. Whale watching is a popular attraction for tourists. Thirteen or fourteen species of cetaceans have been recorded in the area. Especially for orcas, or killer whales, the waters surrounding the peninsula are regarded as one of the most significant habitat areas in the northwestern Pacific. There was a notable mass stranding of twelve animals in February 2005. Nine animals died.

An unidentified form or subspecies of beaked whale is known to inhabit the waters off Shiretoko Peninsula and Abashiri.Uni Y., Photos from Abashiri Nature Cruise Long-finned pilot whales which once inhabited the waters around Hokkaido are thought to have become extinct in the 12th century, but unconfirmed sighting of short-finned pilot whales have been reported in Nemuro Strait though the area is out of their normal range. Conservation efforts To protect the wild animals and natural environment of the Shiretoko Peninsula, in 1964 a great portion of the peninsula was designated Shiretoko National Park. Since then, the park has been subject to strict regulation as a nature preserve, and entering is prohibited.

As the title indicates, it is written for an ensemble of six: four percussionists and two keyboardists. The percussionists play (at various times) three marimbas, two vibraphones, two bass drums, crotales, sticks, and tam-tam. Two percussionists double on piano during the opening \\"Pulse\\" section. The keyboardists play both pianos and synthesizers set to an electric organ sound. The piece was composed in 1984-1985 and is about 28 minutes in duration. The piece is broken into five movements and, like many other Reich compositions, Sextet has an arch form: A-B-C-B-A. The paired movements share a tempo and a particular cycle of chords. These cycles use dominant chords with added tones to give it a darker, more chromatic sound, much like Reich's previous piece, The Desert Music. Sextet plays with two aspects of music. First, it tries to overcome natural acoustic limitations of percussion instruments. Vibraphones are normally incapable of sustaining pitches at the same volume like wind or string instruments; they act much like a piano, where notes are struck and then allowed to ring, eventually decaying. To counter this limitation, Reich employs the extended technique of bowing of the bars with a bass bow. A similar limitation in the percussion section is countered by the use of the synthesizers. At the time Sextet was written, keyboard percussion instruments capable of reaching into the bass range (5-octave marimbas or bass marimbas) were not widely available. To give the work more depth in the lower pitch ranges, the bass drum is employed with doubling from the pianos or synthesizers. Second, the piece plays with ambiguity. In the third movement, a basic 12-beat pattern is ambiguous between a division into three and into four. In other parts of the piece, the line that was the melody becomes the accompaniment, even though the actual notes do not change. The piece was co- commissioned by the Laura Dean Dancers and Musicians and the French government. An incomplete version premiered in December 1984, in Paris. It was reworked in early 1985 and received its American premiere in New York on October 31, 1985 during the Next Wave Festival at the Brooklyn Academy of Music as the stage music for Laura Dean's Impact. It then was recorded by Steve Reich's ensemble on Nonesuch Records in 1986. Further reading * Reich, Steve. Liner Notes. \\"Sextet/Six Marimbas.\\" CD. Nonesuch Records, 1986.

It is situated on the Bay of Bengal coast and about from Fort St George. The average elevation of the neighbourhood is 14 metres above sea level. Along with Mylapore and the surrounding regions, Triplicane is historically much older than the city of Chennai itself, with a mention in records as early as the Pallava period. Primarily a residential region, it is home to some of the tourist attractions of the city, such as the Marina Beach, Parthasarathy Temple and several commercial establishments. Triplicane is also known for its traditional culture, which is prominent in and around the streets (known as \\"mada veedhi\\" in Tamil) of Parthasarthy Temple. Etymology The name Triplicane is the anglicized version of Thiruvallikeni, which derives from Thiru-Alli-Keni (Sacred Lily Pond, in Tamil), denoting the pond in front of the Parthasarathy temple, which was amidst a big Tulasi forest. The place is also referred as Brindaranyam in Brahmanda Purana, owing to the presence of the tulasi (brinda) plants in the area. It is also referred to as 'Brindaranya kshetra' and 'Southern Brindavana'. Triplicane pond History =Literary mention= The early records of the town are rooted to epic rather than history. Thiruvallikeni finds various mentions in Nalayira Divya prabandham in the hymns of Thirumangai Alvar, Peyalwar and Thirumazhisai Piran - hymn 2416 in Nanmukan Thiruvanthathi forming part of the divine 4000 divya prabhandam. 8th century poet Thirumangai Alvar described Thiruvallikeni as a densely canopied forest with peacocks and koels, where the sun's rays cannot penetrate. Peyalwar describes Thiruvallikeni as a place having a beach, where white waves bring precious gems like red corals and white pearls to the shore that which lights up the area with beautiful colours. =Medieval era= The evidence from stone inscriptions indicates that Parthasarathy temple was built in the 8th century by a Pallava King. The temple was later expanded by the Pallavas, Cholas, Vijayanagara rulers. It has been recorded that a rivulet, Kaivareni, ran across Triplicane and Mylapore.http://www.thehinduimages.com/hindu/photoDetail.do?photoId=4925623 The legend has it that the rivulet connected two water bodies: the temple tank of Parthasarathy temple and a sacred well, Mani Kairavani, in the flower garden of Adi Kesava Perumal temple of Mylapore. It is believed that Peyalvar, one of the 12 alvars, was born on a lily flower in this well and that he sailed through the rivulet to worship Lord Krishna in the Parthasarathy temple. To commemorate this, the idol of Peyalwar in Mylapore is brought, as a procession, to Parthasarathy temple every year in the month of September. Peyalwar temple was built in the 13th century. =British era= Bazzar in Triplicane. Illustration in 1855 Triplicane Pycrofts Road in 1906 In the 1600s, Triplicane was a separate village. After about a century, the British found Triplicane to be a good area for settlement and a large number of people moved there. In 1668, Triplicane was annexed to the Madras City. From that time, Triplicane grew in importance, second only to George Town. In addition, the presence of the Nawab of Arcot increased the economic prosperity of the area, and many Muslims settled in Triplicane. In 1795, the Wallajah Mosque was built. During this period, Chepauk Palace and Amir Mahal were also built. In 1841, Ice House was built to store the ice bars imported from America through ships. Ice bars were imported to provide the English a temporary relief from the blistering heat. This building was renamed Vivekananda house after Swami Vivekananda stayed in the building for a brief while. In the mid-19th century, numerous educational institutions were formed in the area. Hindu Higher Secondary School was started in 1853 and Presidency College in 1864‚Äì65. In 1870, the college was moved to its present location on Beach Road. In 1884, Marina Beach prominade was built. In 1896, Sri Parthasarathy Swami Sabha (SPSS), the oldest sabha in chennai, was founded and operated from the Hindu High School on Big Street The building which currently serves as the Triplicane police station was built around 1891 to guard Madrasapatnam. This building is the city's oldest police station. Triplicane High Road is one of the roads that had a tram line running through it during the British reign. In 1904, Triplicane Urban Co-Operative Society (TUCS) was started. The consumer cooperative society predates even the first Cooperative Credit Societies Act of 1904, which officially ushered in the cooperative movement into India. It runs a super market, self-service department stores, sells automobile fuel and cooking gas, and operates more than 200 rations shops for the Public Distribution System. In 1916, Star Theatre was built on Triplicane High Road. This age old theatre has been set for demolition in March 2012. In 1925, Mahatma Gandhi visited Triplicane to address a huge gathering. In 1933, he revisited the neighbourhood. In 1934, the first cricket match was played at the Chepauk Stadium In the early 20th century, Triplicane became one of the major residential areas of Madras. =Post-Independence= In 1963, Ice house was renamed as Vivekananda House. In 1993, Bharathiyar Illam was converted into a memorial. In October 1997, the first train ran through the Thiruvallikeni MRTS Railway Station. The train was between Chennai Beach and Thirumayilaihttp://www.infobanc.com/india_view/states/tamilnadu.htm On 26 December 2004, Indian Ocean tsunami hit Triplicane. Location Triplicane lies on the banks of the Buckingham Canal which bisects the neighbourhood along the north‚Äìsouth direction. The neighbourhood is bordered by Marina Beach on the east on the shore of the Bay of Bengal, Chepauk on the north, Royapettah on the west and northwest, Mylapore on the southwest, and Santhome on the south. Geography The neighbourhood is classified as a tropical dry forest bio-zone. Being a coastal city, Chennai had many sand ridges. During the 16th century, the sea level rose and inundated lands within the settlements. When the sea withdrew, lagoons and ridges were left behind. One such ridge ran from the mouth of River Cooum to the present site of the Presidency College. On the rear side was a huge depression, where the college grounds have been built now. The ridge is the present Marina beach. Further south, a U-shaped ridge ran along Besant Road and Lloyds Road enclosing the Ice House. Parthasarathy Temple is just by the northern area of this ridge. Mount Road, now Anna Salai, ran along a tank bund and was at a high level. To the east of it, the land fell gradually, where Triplicane High Road and the Luz were formed. Triplicane is succeptable to strong (vi) earthquakes, with occurrences at 5 to 6 Richter. On average, it receives one tremor every 50 years. However, the impact may be low. The neighbourhood is prone to periods of extreme droughts. The risk of flooding is medium-high, and chances of cyclones are low. Neighbourhood Residential developments near the Parthasarathy temple. With an area of around 5 sq km, Triplicane is home to over 100,000 people, in addition to a floating population of 50,000 to 70,000. Average population density of the neighbourhood is 21,329 per square kilometre. Being an old neighbourhood of the city, it is congested with narrow lanes and streets. Housing Known as 'Bachelor's Paradise', Triplicane is home to about 200 boarding houses (locally known as mansions) out of the 700 odd ones in the city, many of them with about 30 to 60 rooms. Soon after independence, boarding houses began to appear in the area to cater to the needs of the individual migrants from various parts of the country. The first four boarding houses, known locally as mansions, were built in the 1950s by farmers from the southern parts of Tamil Nadu after successive droughts had threatened their livelihood. They gave out rooms on rent to traders who came to the city from other parts of the state. These are owned today by their progeny, without much change in their structures. Notable people who have at one time or another lived in the bachelor pads of Triplicane include political figures Periyar, Annadurai and Karunanidhi. Availability of low-cost rentals and different affordable cuisines in the area is said to be the reason behind the constant patronage to these mansions for decades. Recently, these boarding houses have started attracting a more gentrified crowd. Roads Ezhilagam Triplicane High Road The main roads of Triplicane include Beach Road (Kamarajar Salai), Pycrofts Road (Bharathi Salai), Triplicane High Road, and Besant Road. Pycrofts Road, also known as Bharathi Salai, is known for its numerous book shops, including pavement shops selling old and used books. Zam Bazaar is one of the oldest bazaar in the city and was set up in the pre- Independence era. The western end of the market is bordered by an old monument known as the Amir Mahal, the palace of the Nawab of Arcot two centuries ago. The building is currently being renovated by the government. The neighbourhood, however, suffers from drainage issues and other civic problems. Education Triplicane campus of the University of Madras State Council for Higher Secondary Education at the Lady Wellingdon College campus Colleges in the locality include Queen Mary's College, Presidency College and Madras University on the Beach Road. The popular schools in this area include Hindu Senior Secondary School, the Kellett higher secondary school, NKT, Rex, Hindu High School, Lady Wellington school, etc. Some of these schools are very old and even dating back to the British Era, like the latter two schools. =Library= Libraries in this area include Kasthuri Srinivasan Library on Besant Road, one on Peyalwar Koil street, Muhammadan Public Library and one on Big street. The Kasturi Srinivasan library is more than 50 years old.\\"Golden jubilee celebrated\\", The Hindu, Downtown, Chennai, 20 March 2011. Retrieved 3 April 2012 Culture Triplicane has a rich culture. The culture associated with Parthasarathy temple and its mada veethis is a traditional and an age old one.

An annual community even known as the Thiruvallikeni Thiruvizha (literally Triplicane Festival) is celebrated in January. Other festivals include Triplicane Music Festival and Marghazhi (winter) festival. Triplicane is known for the traditional cuisines of Chennai, being based here. =Architecture= Annie Besant Park Fishermen statue at Annie Besant Park Triplicane, similar to few other areas in the city such as Mylapore and West Mambalam, is known for its traditional row houses, known as agraharams. Typically, these can be seen where an entire street is occupied by Brahmins, particularly surrounding a temple. The architecture is distinctive with Madras terraces, country tile roofing, Burma teak rafters and lime plastering. The longish homes consisted of the mudhal kattu (receiving quarters), irandaam kattu (living quarters), moondram kattu (kitchen and backyard) and so on. Most houses had an open to sky space in the centre called the mitham, large platforms lining the outside of the house called the thinnai and a private well in the backyard. The floors were often coated with red oxide and sometimes the roofs had glass tiles to let in light. The agraharam quadrangle seen in Triplicane is around the Parthasarathy Temple and its tank. About 50 families continue to live in the agraharams in Triplicane. However, many of these houses are being replaced with modern multi-storied apartments, resulting in a reduction in their numbers. =Places of worship= Although Parthasarathy Temple remains the most important temple of Triplicane, there exists indeed several other temples in the neighbourhood, including Ellai Amman Temple and nearby Sundaramurthy vinayaka temple, Kulathangarai Anjeneya Temple (on the steps on the Parthasarathy temple tank), Anjeneya Temple on Tank Street, Tula Singa Perumal Temple, Ahobila Mutt Temple on Car Street, Kaamakala Kameshwarar Temple on Raja Hanumantha lala street, Anjaneyar temple on Hanumantha Rayan street, Muthu Vinayakar Temple on Muthu Kallathy Street, Anjeneya Temple on Besant Road, Ettampadai Murugan Temple, Raghavendra Temple and Mutt on T.P Koil Street, Panduranga swami temple on Venkatachalam street, Vinayaka temples on big street and at the market, Temples on Raja Hanumantha Lala Lane, Udupi Sri Krishna Temple and Mutt, Sri Krishna mandiram, Peyalwar Temple built on the 13th century. and Thiruveteeswarar Temple.

Blankenburg was the only son of three children of Johann Heinrich and Ernestine Friederike Koch Blankenburg. He was born with the middle name Louis but changed it to Ludwig later in life perhaps as a connection to Beethoven. Raised on a sheep farm in Thamsbr√ºcke, he was expected to someday manage the farm. However, he showed a propensity for music starting with performing on the piccolo - a favorite instrument his entire life. His family agreed on his studying music as long as he promised to serve in the army for twelve years. Blankenburg taught himself to play various instruments including bassoon, tuba, and violin and he conducted his school orchestra at the age of ten. He served actively in the military for two years 1896-1898, performing tuba in the band of the 6th Field Artillery Regiment in Breslau. After that his only service was prior to and during the early years of World War I in reserve bands. In 1913 he performed tuba in Field Artillery Regiment No. 43 in Wesel until 1915 when he got a medical discharge. He remained in Wesel for the rest of his life. Blankenburg played in and conducted community bands as well as performing in the orchestras in Dortmund, Wuppertal and Duisburg. He also worked as a bricklayer and a policeman for a short time. His personal life was full of turmoil. In 1917 he was arrested by the military police from his former regiment for \\"deserting his family\\". He had married Magdalena Weidmann in Germersheim in 1898. In 1920 he married K√§the Trauthoff and was then arrested for bigamy. Blankenburg's March Compositions A march he wrote when he was eighteen was submitted years later, in 1904, to Hawkes & Son for a march competition. Hawkes selected his march from over 500 submitted as first prize with the proviso the title could be changed from \\"Deutschlands F√ºrsten\\" (Germany's Princes) to \\"Abschied der Gladiatoren\\" (The Gladiators' Farewell). The march became popular, and Hawkes (also Boosey & Hawkes) would publish several more including \\"Adlerflug\\", \\"Festjubel\\", \\"Territorial\\", and \\"Mein Regiment\\" (the latter said to be the composer's own favorite march). In the 1920s and 30s his marches attained European fame. Instead of accepting commissions, he composed marches when inspired. After World War II his compositional efforts dropped off. Despite the presence of military titles for many of his marches and his short military band service, Blankenburg's compositions were never accorded official recognition by Germany's military authorities. Blankenburg is likely the most prolific march composer in history. For twenty years he composed at least one march a week. His one thousandth march was composed in 1928: \\"Der Tausendk√ºnstler\\" (Jack of All Trades), dedicated to fellow composer Paul Lincke. He continued to compose marches for another 20 years after this. Blankenburg numbered his march compositions at 1,328, but he was careless in assigning opus numbers or in completing compositions. He also renamed some older marches with new titles. The highest opus number discovered is 1275 (for the march \\"Semper Paratus\\" likely published in 1936) and the lowest is 9 (for \\"Fliegerhelden Marsch\\"). There are long gaps in the sequence of opus numbers and many marches have no opus number assigned. At least 300 of his marches were published by thirty different publishers, but many more are lost or destroyed. Over 100 of Blankenburg's marches were recorded in the Heritage of the March series. His marches are all in the characteristic German style and he was fond of writing soaring euphonium countermelodies which required a highly competent euphonium section prepared to perform in the upper register of the instrument. His marches also stressed the piccolo, clarinet, and cornet sections. Opinions vary on the quality of his marches. Composer and arranger Gay Corrie has said it is difficult to tell his marches apart but found the euphonium countermelodies and woodwind figures admirable. Commander Charles Brendler of the United States Navy Band 1942-1962 considered him the greatest march writer who ever lived. At the age of 60, he was made an honorary citizen of Thamsbr√ºck. In 1976, Wesel changed the name of the street where he lived from Gartenstrase to Blankenburg-strasse to commemorate the 100th anniversary of his birth. There is also a street in the community of Haldern in Rees, Germany named for the composer. A few months before his 81st birthday, Blankenburg intended to compose another march, but he died in Wesel in 1956 before accomplishing this.

His work in theoretical particle physics exerted great influence on the development of the standard model in the late 20th century, especially on the renormalization of the electro-weak model and gauge theory. He predicted the mass of the Charm quark and contributed to its search. Since his inception as a physicist, he has published 110 papers for about 20 years, of which 77 papers have been published in the journal. There are 69 papers cited more than 10 times and eight papers cited more than 500 times. As of October 2013, all of his papers are cited more than 13,400 times. As a major disciple, Kang Joo-sang, professor emeritus at the Department of Physics at Korea University, is also the motif of the fictional character Lee Yong-hu in Kim Jin-myung's novel, \\"The Rose of Sharon Blooms Again\\".  Biography  Lee was born in Yongsan, Seoul. Both his parents were trained as doctors. Whisoh was the eldest of four siblings. His mother was the wage winner of the household, who was initially employed as a doctor at a hospital and later opened her own practice specializing in pediatrics and obstetrics/gynaecology. Lee took the entrance exam for Kyunggi Middle School and was accepted. He was an excellent pupil. The Korean War broke out on his 4th year. Lee's family evacuated to the Busan Perimeter and Whisoh continued his schooling there. One year before graduating Kyunggi High School, he entered the department of chemical engineering at Seoul National University at the top of his class. While in college he emigrated to the United States through a scholarship program enabled by the association of spouses of the military officers who participated in the Korean War. Lee received his Bachelor of Science degree at Miami University (1956), Master of Science at the University of Pittsburgh (1958), and Ph.D. at the University of Pennsylvania (1961). Lee worked at Institute for Advanced Study and was a professor of physics at University of Pennsylvania, SUNY at Stony Brook, University of Chicago, and head of the theoretical physics department at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1976. On June 16, 1977, he was killed in a car accident not far from Kewanee, Illinois (on the Interstate 80). Lee was regarded by his peers as a world-class elementary particle physicist at the time of his sudden death. He studied gauge theory and weak interactions. Research =Gauge theory= In 1964, Lee published an article about spontaneous symmetry breaking with his advisor Abraham Klein and contributed to the appearance of Higgs mechanism. He is often credited with the naming of the Higgs boson and Higgs mechanism. And in 1969, he succeeded individually the renormalization of the spontaneously breaking global gauge symmetry model. In the meantime, Dutch graduate student Gerardus 't Hooft was working in the case of local gauge symmetry breaking in the Yang‚ÄìMills theory using the Higgs mechanism. He met Lee and Symanzik at the Carg√®se Summer School and consulted them on his work and got an insight. He finally succeeded in the renormalization of non-abelian gauge theory and won the Nobel Prize later for this work. David Politzer said in his 2004 Nobel Lecture that the particle physicists community at that time learned all from Lee who actually combined insights from his own work and from Russian physicists' work and encouraged 't Hooft's paper. =Charm quark= Glashow, Maiani and Iliopoulos predicted charm quarks to match the experimental results. Lee wrote an article with Gaillard and Rosner and predicted the mass of the charm quarks by calculating the quantities which correspond to the mixing and decay of K meson. =Cosmology= In 1977, Lee and Weinberg wrote an article about the lower bound on heavy neutrino mass. In this paper, they revealed that if the heavy and stable particles in the early universe which can only be transferred into other particles through the pair annihilation remain as relics after the universe's expansion, then the strength of the interaction should be bigger than 2 GeV. This calculation can be applied to find the amount of the dark matter. This bound is called the Lee-Weinberg bound. Lee's promotion of gauge theories Weinberg's 1967 paper A Model of Leptons has over 15,000 citations and played a key role in the award of his 1979 Nobel prize. In 1972 at a conference at Fermilab, Lee gave a talk Perspectives on Theory of Weak Interactions that brought Weinberg's 1967 paper out of obscurity and explained many aspects of gauge theories to a large audience. Controversy over death A South Korean fictional novel allegedly based on Lee's death was published in 1993, which presumably suggested that Lee tried to help South Korea's dictatorship develop nuclear weapons, and implied that the U.S.' Central Intelligence Agency had some connection to his death. In actuality, he vigorously opposed the autocratic system of South Korea at that time and he canceled every program he designed for South Korean graduate education about particle physics in opposition to that government. According to a Fermilab memoriam, Lee died in a car accident on Illinois highway I-80 in 1977, at age 42. A semi-trailer crossed the highway divide and collided with his car.

Originating on the southern steppe as an outgrowth of the Yamnaya culture, the Catacomb culture came to cover a large area. It was Indo-European-speaking, perhaps speaking an early form of Indo-Iranian or Thracian. Influences of the Catacomb culture have been detected as far as Mycenaean Greece. It spawned the Multi-cordoned ware culture and was eventually succeeded by the Srubnaya culture. Origins The Catacomb culture emerged on the southern part of the Pontic steppe in 2800 BC as a western descendant of the Yamnaya culture. Influences from the west appears to have had a decisive role on the formation of the Catacomb culture. In addition to the Yamnaya culture, the Catacomb culture displays links with the earlier Sredny Stog culture, the Afanasievo culture and the Poltavka culture. Distribution Distribution of the Catacomb culture in accordance with the Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture The Catacomb culture was distributed on the Pontic steppe, an area that had earlier been occupied by the Yamnaya culture. This was a large area, and on the basis of ceramic styles and burial practices, regional variants have been found. On this basis, the Catacomb culture has by some been designated as a \\"cultural-historical area\\" with the regional variants classified as distinct cultures in their own respect. In the east the Catacomb culture neighbored the Poltavka culture, which was an eastern descendant of the Yamnaya culture. The Catacomb culture influenced the development of the Poltavka culture. Throughout its existence, the Catacomb culture expanded eastward and northward. Elena Efimovna Kuzmina suggests that the Seima-Turbino phenomenon emerged as a result of interaction between the Abashevo culture, the Catacomb culture and the early Andronovo culture. Evidence of Catacomb influence has been discovered far outside of the Pontic steppe. Its burial chambers, metal types and figurines are very similar to those appearing in Italy and the eastern Mediterranean, while the hammer- head pin, a characteristic ornament of the Catacomb culture, has been found in Central Europe and Italy. Based on these similarities, migrations or cultural diffusion from the Catacomb culture to these areas have been suggested. Similarities between the Catacomb culture and Mycenaean Greece are particularly striking. These include types of socketed spear-heads, types of cheekpieces for horses, and the custom of making masks for the dead. Demographics The Catacomb culture is estimated to have included some 50,000-60,000 individuals. Characteristics =Burials= The Catacomb culture is named for its burials. These augmented the shaft grave of the Yamnaya culture with burial niche at its base. This is the so-called catacomb. Such graves have also been found in Mycenaean Greece and parts of Eastern Europe. Deceased Catacomb individuals were typically buried in a flexed position on their right side. They were often accompanied by ornaments such as silver rings, and weapons such as stone and metal axes, arrows, daggers and maces. Animal sacrifies, including head and hooves of goats, sheep, horses and cattle, occur in about 16% of Catacomb graves. Cattle sacrifices in the Catacomb culture are more frequent than in the Yamnaya culture. Similar horse burials also appeared in the earlier Khvalynsk culture, and in the Poltavka culture. Catacomb burials are occasionally covered with Kurgan stelae. This practice was also common in the Yamnaya culture. Some three hundred stelae have been found from the Yamnaya culture and the Catacomb culture. Catacomb burials are sometimes accompanied by wheeled vehicles. Such wagon burials are attested in the earlier Yamnaya culture, and later among Iranian peoples (Scythians), Celts and Italic peoples. Aspects of the burial rite of the Catacomb culture have been detected in the Bishkent culture of southern Tajikistan. In some cases, the skull of deceased Catacomb people was modelled in clay. This involved the filling of the mouth, ears and nasal cavity with clay and modeling the surface features of the face. This practice is associated with high-status burials containing prestige items. The practice was performed on both men, women and children. It has been suggested that these clay masks may have served as a prototype for the later gold masks found in Mycenaean Greece. =Economy= The economy of the Catacomb culture is believed to have been based mostly on stockbreeding. Remains of cattle, sheep, goat, horse and some pigs have been found. Plant remains are exceedingly rare, but traces of wheat, such as einkorn and emmer, have been found. Wooden ploughs have been found at Catacomb burials, indicating that agriculture was practiced. The types of tools used by the Catacomb people suggest that the culture included several craft specialists, including weavers, bronze workers and weapons manufacturers. Similar metal types to those of the Catacomb culture later appears among the Abashevo culture. =Settlements= Little evidence of Catacomb settlements has been found. These are mostly seasonal camp-sites located near sources of water. A larger settlement has been found at Matveyevka on the southern Bug. It has three large structures with foundations of stone. On the island of Bayda in the Dnieper river, a stone- built fortress of the late Catacomb period with a surrounding ditch has been found. =Ceramics= Catacomb culture pottery Catacomb ceramics are more elaborate than those of the Yamnaya culture. Low footed vessels that have been discovered in female burials are believed to have been used in rituals that included the use of narcotic substances such as hemp. Catacomb ceramics appears to have influenced the ceramics of the Abashevo culture and the Sintashta culture. =Weapons= Bronze tools of the Catacomb culture Evidence of early composite bows have been yielded from the Catacomb culture. Quivers with space for ten to twenty arrows have also been found. Its arrowheads may have influenced those of the Sintashta culture. Its hollow-based flint arrowheads are similar to those of the Middle Dnieper culture. Stone battle- axes of the Catacomb culture are similar to those of the Fatyanovo‚ÄìBalanovo culture. A knife from ca. 2500 BC ascribed to the Catacomb culture in the Donets had a handle of arsenical bronze and a blade made of iron. =Other characteristics= Wheeled vehicles have been found in Catacomb burials. Some of these have been suggested as among the earliest chariots that have been found. Bronze warty beads of the Catacomb culture are similar to those of the Sintashta culture. Certain variants of the Catacomb culture, particularly those centered at the Donets, appear to have practiced cranial deformation. This may have been an aesthetic device or an ethnic marker. Around 9% of Catacomb skulls had holes drilled into them. This appears to have been associated with a ritual or medical practice. Remains of bears have been found at Catacomb sites. Physical type The Catacomb people were massively built Europoids. Their skulls are similar to those of the Potapovka culture. Potapovka skulls are less dolichocephalic than those of the Fatyanovo‚ÄìBalanovo culture, Abashevo culture, Sintashta culture, Srubnaya culture and western Andronovo culture. The physical type of the Potapovka appears to have emerged through a mixture between the strongly dolichocephalic type of the Sintashta, and the less dolichocephalic type of the Yamnaya culture and Poltavka culture. Genetics A genetic study published in August 2014 examined the DNA of the remains of 28 Catacomb individuals. Catacomb people were found to have much higher frequencies of the maternal haplogroups U5 and U4 than people of the preceding Yamnaya culture. Haplogroups U5 and U4 are typical of Western Hunter-Gatherers and Eastern Hunter-Gatherers. A generic similarity between Catacomb people and northern hunter-gatherers, particularly the people of the Pitted Ware culture of southern Scandinavia, was detected. It was suggested that the Catacomb people and the Yamnaya people were not as genetically admixed as previously believed. Interestingly, the modern population of Ukraine was found to be more closely related to people of the Yamnaya culture than people of the Catacomb culture. In genetic study published in the Journal of Human Genetics in 2017, the remains of several individuals from the Catacomb culture were analyzed. One individual was found to be carrying haplogroup U5, while another carried U5a. These and other subclades of haplogroup U have been found in high frequencies among early hunter-gatherers of Northern Europe and Eastern Europe. From the Mesolithic they appear among populations of the Pontic steppe, including the Sredny Stog culture, the Yamnaya culture, the Corded Ware culture, the Andronovo culture, the Srubnaya culture and the Scythians. This suggests continuity of mtDNA among populations of the Pontic steppe going back at least to the Bronze Age. In a genetic study published in Scientific Reports in 2018, the remains of two individuals from the Catacomb culture were analyzed. Both were found to belong to haplogroup X4. They are the first ancient individuals that have been identified with this lineage, which is very rare among modern populations. In a February 2019 study published in Nature Communications, the remains of five individuals ascribed to the Catacomb culture were analyzed. Three males were found to be carrying R1b1a2. With regards to mtDNA, all five individuals carried various subclades of haplogroup U (particularly U5 and U4). Linguistics The Catacomb culture was Indo-European-speaking. It has sometimes been considered ancestral to Indo-Iranian or Thracian. More recently, scholars have suggested that the culture provided a common background for Greek, Armenian and Indo-Iranian. Successors The Srubnaya culture was a successor of the Catacomb culture. It has been suggested that the Abashevo culture was partially derived from the Catacomb culture. Parts of the area of the Catacomb culture came to be occupied by the Abashevo culture, and later by the Srubnaya culture. The Multi-cordoned ware culture was an eastern successor of the Catacomb culture. It in turn may have played a role in the emergence of the Potapovka culture and the Sintashta culture, and thus on the formation of the Andronovo culture. Morphological data suggests that the Sintashta culture might have emerged as a result of a mixture of steppe ancestry from the Poltavka culture and Catacomb culture, with ancestry from Neolithic forest hunter-gatherers.

It was established in 1956. The school teams are known as the \\"Rebels\\". Eastwood is known for its Provincially ranked soccer teams, as well as its Integrated Arts Program. Its motto is Ex Oriente Lux. Construction The school was built in 1956, located on what was then the recently extended East Avenue (now Weber Street). The architect for the building was the company of Barnett & Rieder. Most of the school consists of a long classroom block that runs parallel to Weber Street. There is a large entrance stair at the south side of the classroom block, with the school offices to the north and the gymnasium, whose walls are of ribbed brick, to the south. The architecture of the school received international attention when it opened. Exterior view Crest The School's crest was designed by Former Eastwood Student Doug Rickert in 1957. Designed to reveal both the school's name but also the components of its life blood. According to the 1956-1957 Eastwood Yearbook, CHIPS, \\"The rising sun...denotes not only 'East', but also the light given by our leadership to other schools and the community around us. The maple leaves provide the 'wood', and in addition signify our pride in holding a place in the educational system of Canada. The open book signifies the great store of knowledge readily available, and the desire to receive it, both present in our school. The motto...has also been included in the attractive crest which is a suitable emblem of our school\\". The Auditorium and Tech Crew Eastwood Collegiate Institute is currently the only school in the Waterloo Regional District School Board (WRDSB) that boasts an industry-standard auditorium facility. The auditorium seats just under 500 people. It is also equipped with a custom-installed hemp rope system (named for the type of rope once used) with over 20 bars. The lighting inventory is also the largest in the region's school board. The aud is run and maintained by ECI's Tech Crew. Tech Crew is responsible for shows in and outside of the auditorium, totaling over 15 major shows each year. These may include seasonal Dance Shows and Music Shows, the annual arts program Gala, the semiannual Musical Production, the Commencement ceremonies, School Dances and the annual Spring playday ('Spring Thing'). Hours contributed by the ETC gross 5000 annually The Mascot The Rebel Lion The school's original mascot, Johnny Rebel, was chosen to represent Eastwood's original rebellious spirit (many of the original teachers had left KCI to come to Eastwood). In 1998, it was decided that Johnny Rebel no longer personified what it meant to be a Rebel due to the fact that he was perceived to be a symbol of white bigotry (the Confederate flag was a prominent feature of his costume, and a version of the flag could be seen on the previous cafeteria mural, with Canadian Maple-Leaves replacing the stars). This led to a contest being held among the students and staff to design a new mascot. Eventually, it was decided that two lions (one male and one female, wearing a football jersey and a basketball jersey respectively) would be used to reflect the school's \\"Rebel Pride\\". In 2005, another contest was held for another overhaul of the mascot, with students and staff again submitting designs. Ultimately, a design by former Eastwood art teacher David Okum was selected. The \\"Rebel Lion\\" combines both old and new - a lion in an updated soldier's uniform. The name was chosen so that when the words were pushed together, the word \\"Rebellion\\" was formed. Waterloo Region Integrated Arts Program Eastwood is particularly noted for its specialized arts program, known as the \\"Integrated Arts Program\\". The Arts Program offers courses in Drama, Dance, Music: Instrumental, Strings, Vocal, and Visual arts. Talented students come to Eastwood from all over Waterloo Region and beyond to be an Arts Program student. Keeping to its integrated nature, academics are incredibly important and necessary for all students. Success in academics as well as arts to attain a high-school diploma is mandatory. The Specialist High Skills Major: Arts & Culture Specialist High Skills Major logo This new program complements the already successful IAP. This program is newly developed and brings the technical side of the arts to the students. Programs in lighting, sound, stage managing, stage and set design, costume design and creation, are just a few of the offerings. Supported in part by members of Waterloo Region's Arts Community, the program began in the 2008-2009 school year. Renovations In recent years the school has had a number of much needed renovations. A new library, dance studio, front steps, elevator, a re-vitalized woodworking shop, a (recently demolished) costume room, and a brand new sprinkler system completed in 2005 to bring the school up to fire code. Beginning March 2007, a massive renovation began at the school, which includes new windows for the whole building, new ventilation system, new boiler system, and hiding the sprinkler pipes installed 2 years prior. Air conditioning is being installed, but will not be available to the whole school, only certain special parts will have it (such as computer labs) but the average classroom will not.

It became part of the New York Central Railroad system in 1913 although it was under the larger company's possession since the end of 1904. It had started out as the Northern Adirondack Railroad and evolved into the Northern New York Railroad, the New York and Ottawa Railroad and was last known as the New York and Ottawa Railway before being merged into the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad. Other lines that were a part of this route are described below. History =Northern Adirondack Railroad: 1883-1895= The Northern Adirondack Railroad was chartered February 9, 1883 to build from Moira on the Ogdensburg and Lake Champlain Railroad south to St. Regis Falls. The company was owned by Peter MacFarlane, Charles Hotchkiss and John Hurd. Logging businessmen were hoping to use this railroad to ship out their logs from the region. The line opened on September 25, 1883 with a rented locomotive from the Ogdensburg and Lake Champlain Railroad, which derailed when it entered St. Regis Falls. MacFarlane was soon bought out by Hotchkiss and Hurd and eventually John Hurd became the majority owner. In 1885, Hurd had extended his railroad southwards to Santa Clara, but it remained inactive until a new company was created to operate this section and extend it further south, eventually reaching Tupper Lake. This company would merge into the Northern Adirondack Railroad in 1890 (see below). On July 1 of that year, the first train entered Tupper Lake. Hurd's business practices would eventually send him into debt, and before he declared bankruptcy, his railroad went into receivership on January 25, 1894. On May 25, 1895, the railroad was sold to a business syndicate and two days later was renamed to the Northern New York Railroad. =Northern Adirondack Extension Railroad: 1885-1890= The Northern Adirondack Extension Railroad was chartered on February 17, 1886 to take over the existing rails between St. Regis Falls and Santa Clara, as well as to extend the Northern Adirondack Railroad south to Tupper Lake in the Adirondack Mountains, the site of the largest saw mill in the U.S. at the time. The first section of the extension opened on July 6, 1886, south to Brandon. The remaining section to Tupper Lake was completed in 1889, with regular service to the southern terminus starting on July 1, 1890. Prior to that, on April 5, the Northern Adirondack Extension was merged into the Northern Adirondack Railroad. In 1887 Patrick Ducey, whom owned a large tract of land south of Brandon, had built his own logging railroad from his jackworks in Black rapids to a point on the Northern Adirondack Extension Railroad called Black Rapids Junction. Although the John Hurd owned railroad was not completed and officially opened, it could be assumed that some kind of shipments was hauled out from Ducey's operations. This small line would become Northern Adirondack Railroad property approximately in 1889 when the line opened to Tupper Lake. In 1892, the Mohawk and Malone Railway was completed and crossed the northern Adirondacks at Tupper Lake Junction, just north of Tupper Lake. One of the last items that the Northern Adirondack Extension Railroad had done was negotiated for trackage rights over the Saratoga and St. Lawrence Railroad, which was running at that time from Moira to Bombay on the Grand Trunk Railway's United States and Canada Railroad, which was a line that linked Massena to Montreal. John Hurd had plans to add this small rail line to his own company. =Ontario Pacific Railway: 1882‚Äì1897= The Ontario Pacific Railway concept was originally planned out by Cornwall, Ontario, politicians Dr. Darby Bergin (Member of Parliament) and Joseph Kerr (Member of the Legislature) in 1880. Four plans were brought up: Plan #1 ‚Äì line starting at Cornwall and head to Crysler, then end at Perth. A branch from Cornwall to Ottawa was included. The Ottawa terminus was on King Edward Avenue on the University of Ottawa campus. Plan #2 ‚Äì line starting at Cornwall and head to Newington, then run through Smiths Falls, ending at Perth. A branch from Cornwall to Ottawa was included. Plan #3 ‚Äì line starting at Cornwall and head to Newington, then run through Smiths Falls, ending at Perth. A branch from Cornwall to Crysler was included. Plan #4 ‚Äì line starting at Cornwall and head to Newington, then run through Smiths Falls, Perth, Glen Tay and Actinolite, then junction at Madoc to the Grand Junction Railway, where running rights could be granted to Peterborough, more running rights over the Midland Railway of Canada from Peterborough to Orillia, then another granting of running rights over the Northern & North Western Railway from Orillia to Gravenhurst. There, the company would build northwards and end east of the French River settlement. Debate of the four plans continued until it was agreed that the proposal would following a route from Cornwall to Embrun to Richmond to Perth to Lake St. Peter to French River to Sault Ste. Marie, with branches from Pickerel Lake to Parry Sound, Manotick to Ottawa and Cornwall through Malone to Lyon Mountain by means of a bridge over the St. Lawrence River. Bergin & Kerr's company received its charter on May 17, 1882, as the Ontario Pacific Railway. The approved route was from Cornwall to Ottawa, through Arnprior and Eganville to Lake Nipissing to a point at or near French River, with a branch from Cornwall to Smiths Falls or Perth. Also included was the right to build a bridge over the St. Lawrence River at Cornwall to connect to any American railroad. On May 25, 1883, the planned route was extended to Sault Ste. Marie and the branch to Smiths Falls or Perth was to leave the main line at Newington, and go through Carleton Place to end at Almonte. A third branch was to leave the main line between Eganville and Renfrew and end at Pembroke. Although Bergin never stopped his promotion of his railway, Kerr had to bow out to focus on his other businesses. Through the years, the Ontario Pacific Railway lay dormant, although meetings were held often, but work never got underway. It would not be until a fateful train trip in 1896 between Ottawa and Coteau Station that Bergin would meet Charles Hibbard, owner of the Northern New York Railroad, that progress would finally be made. A deal was struck between the two businessmen and their companies were to work together to form one line from Ottawa to New York City. Bergin did not see his dream come true as he died that October. His brother, John, took the reins and the Ontario Pacific Railway changed its name on May 21, 1897, to The Ottawa & New York Railway. =Northern New York Railroad 1895-1897= After the Northern Adirondack Railroad was purchased bought on May 25, 1895, the syndicate (led by Charles Hibbard), reorganized it as the Northern New York Railroad two days later. Although uncertain, it appears that Hibbard managed to acquire trackage rights east of Moira on the Ogdensburg and Lake Champlain Railroad to Malone. Hibbard was not unlike John Hurd. He too envisioned a greater railroad that would expand its reach to new areas. His group had created the Racquette River Railroad on April 25, 1895 for the purpose of building a rail route between Tupper Lake and Axton Landing. From that point, the Delaware & Hudson had planned to extend their Adirondack Railway that terminated at North Creek to Axton landing under the Adirondack Extension Railroad charter. Hibbard's trains was to have running rights to Saratoga Springs and then on to New York City. The second extension was to build northwards into Canada. At first, it was planned to take over the Saratoga & St. Lawrence Railroad and then head to St. Regis in Quebec. From there, Hibbard's line would build to Ottawa. From June 11 to July 30 in 1896, the Northern New York Railroad operated the Saratoga & St. Lawrence Railroad, but for unknown reasons Hibbard was not pleased with it. Instead, he planned to build northwards from Moira himself and a new company was created to do so. After meeting Dr. Darby Bergin from the Ontario Pacific Railway, Hibbard formed a partnership with him and these two railroaders planned to connect Ottawa to the Adirondack line. On October 28, 1897, the Northern New York Railroad merged into this new northern extension company. =Ottawa & New York Railway 1897-1957= When Dr. Darby Bergin and Charles Hibbard finalized their agreements, the Ontario Pacific Railway plans were revised. On May 21, 1897 the company was renamed to The Ottawa & New York Railway and was to build from Cornwall to Ottawa as well as to construct a bridge crossing over the St. Lawrence River at Cornwall. Construction began on August 23 and was quickly completed, opening on July 29, 1898, although the first revenue train operated the year before from Crysler to Finch. Before the opening day, the company was purchased by its American partner on June 13, 1898 and had dropped 'The' from its title. Although the American company had been purchased by the New York Central & Hudson River Railroad, the Ottawa & New York Railway continued to exist as a company and owner of their rail line, but the majority shareholders were New York Central interests. From 1905 to 1957, the Ottawa & New York Railway was operated under a lease by the New York Central until abandonment and the selling of the property. The Ottawa & New York Railway was dissolved on December 20, 1957. =New York & Ottawa Railroad 1897-1905= The New York and Ottawa Railroad was chartered on July 22, 1897 to build an extension north from Moira to the St. Lawrence River, where it would connect to the Ottawa and New York Railway. On October 28 the Northern New York was merged into the New York and Ottawa. The NY&O; acquired the O&NY;'s stock on June 13, 1898. On September 28 of that year, the line in New York was completed, running to the St. Lawrence River at Rooseveltown. By the time the bridge crossing over the St. Lawrence River was completed, the Black Rapids Branch of the line was abandoned. An extension south from Tupper Lake was also planned as part of the new line. On April 25, 1895, the Racquette River Railroad was created to build from Tupper Lake to Axton Landing, where the Adirondack Extension Railroad was to build to North Creek. This company went under the New York and Ottawa Railroad control in November 1898. Construction was begun on the south side of Tupper Lake.Racquette River Railroad (Unfinished Railroads of New York State) This southern extension was not finished due to the refusal of the State Forest Preserve to allow the New York and Ottawa Railroad to build in the state owned park, but was likely influenced by the New York Central Railroad, who had an existing line from Herkimer to Malone. The entire route from Ottawa to Tupper Lake was finally operating on October 1, 1900, which was after the company entered receivership on April 25, 1900. The company was sold to New York Central interests on December 22, 1904 and was renamed to the New York & Ottawa Railway on January 19, 1905. This was followed by the company being leased to the New York Central & Hudson River railroad on February 1. =St. Lawrence River crossing at Cornwall= The crossing of the St. Lawrence River at Cornwall was the single most important part of the construction of the Ottawa to Tupper Lake route. At the time of its opening, there were no other bridge crossings between Queenston and Coteau Landing. The crossing consisted of two bridges, one span over the south channel, most of it being in the United States, made up of three Pratt trusses, and the second over the north channel, all in Canada, being of a cantilever design as well as a swing span over the Cornwall Canal. Company wise, it began on July 28, 1897 with the creation of the Cornwall Bridge Company that was to construct the south channel bridge, as it was decided to cross at Cornwall where the river was split in two by Cornwall Island. The north channel bridge was to be constructed by the Ottawa & New York Railway. Construction was done quickly by Phoenix Bridge Company, but on September 6, 1898 a tragic accident claimed the lives of 15 workers and injured 18 others. Pier 2 of the south channel bridge had suddenly sunk into the river, taking two of the three spans down with it, just as the finishing touches were being completed on it. An investigation ruled that the bridge company and Sooysmith Company, who built the piers, did not test the river bed properly and built the piers on unstable ground. What was thought to have been bedrock was actually of gravel that rested on top of of clay. The rebuilding of the south channel bridge was tendered out and Union Bridge Company won the contract. The bridge was opened for regular traffic on October 1, 1900, with an official opening on December 11. Other companies were involved concerning the bridge throughout its life. On April 18, 1899 the New York & Ottawa Bridge Company was created to operate the crossing and started a lease of it on November 1, 1900. This lasted until September 6, 1917 when this company was dissolved and the Cornwall Bridge Company merged into New York Central Lines. During the 1920s, negotiations with several parties began to find a means to have the Cornwall railway bridge system support automobile traffic as well. Many plans were submitted but it was agreed upon to plank the existing bridges (as well as build a road bridge beside the railway one over the Racquette River), and both trains and cars would share the right-of-way. On November 23, 1931, the Cornwall-Northern New York International Bridge Corporation was created to handle the planking and operate the bridge system. May 17, 1934 was when the first automobile crossed over the bridges, the corporation took control on the 29th and everything was officially opened on June 30 with the bridges being commemorated as the Roosevelt International Bridges. The corporation lasted until 1949 when the Roosevelt International Bridge Company took possession of the bridges, who operated it until 1957. =New York Central Railroad: 1905-1957= On December 22, 1904 the line was bought, and was reorganized January 19, 1905 as the New York and Ottawa Railway. It was leased to the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad on February 1, becoming its Ottawa Division, and merged into the company on March 7, 1913. The line was abandoned from Tupper Lake Junction to Helena on May 6, 1937 and then from Rooseveltown to Ottawa on March 22, 1957. =After 1957= The bridges at Cornwall were removed by the St. Lawrence Seaway, the south span in 1958 and the north span in 1965. Meanwhile, Canadian National Railways purchased the Canadian portion of the route in April 1957 and used the rails to build a new hump yard in Montreal. They left a section from Hawthorne to the Terminal Avenue Yard in Ottawa, and then by the end of 1957 reopened a portion from Hawthorne to Ramsayville. This relaid section was removed in 1972. The remaining track in Ottawa was in service until 2002 when the Ottawa Central Railway removed the tracks opposite the Canada Science and Technology Museum to the yard. On November 1, 2008 the Ottawa Central was purchased by Canadian National Railway. In Cornwall, the track was relaid from the Canadian National Railway main line to what was once Cornwall Junction in 1971 as the Wesco Spur. In the United States, the track from Rooseveltown to Helena has remained in use since the New York Central Railroad years. It has managed to survive Penn Central Transportation, Conrail, and CSX ownership and is still in use presently. The track in Tupper Lake was used until Penn Central abandoned it in 1972, but was put back in service by the Adirondack Railway from 1979 to 1981. Today, the tracks remain on the right-of-way for future use by the Adirondack Scenic Railroad. They have been pulled up at the road crossings, but the connection to the Adirondack Branch is still in place.

Painting by Alexander Stepanovich Yanov Former Prikaz palace in Pskov In Muscovy and in Russia from the 15th to the 18th centuries, a prikaz (, prikaz; , plural: prikazy) was an administrative, judicial, territorial, or executive office functioning on behalf of palace, civil, military, or church authorities. The term usually suggests the functionality of a modern \\"ministry\\", \\"office\\" or \\"department\\". (In modern Russian, prikaz literally means an \\"order\\".) Most of the prikazes were subordinated to the Boyar Duma. Some of them (palace prikazes ()) were subordinated to the taynyi prikaz or pervyi prikaz, which answered directly to the tsar. The patriarch of Moscow and All Russia had his own prikazes. There was a large number (up to 60) of specialized prikazes. The set of prikazes varied over time. List of Russian prikazes *Foreign affairs **Ambassadorial Prikaz (Posolsky Prikaz) - in charge of international affairs, a kind of a Ministry of Foreign Affairs **Captive Prikaz, (Polonyanichy Prikaz from archaic 'polon', 'plen' means \\"captive\\"), for the redemption of Russian captives and prisoners of war **Prikaz of Pans (Panskiy Prikaz) - office of Polish affairs *Administrative **Prikaz of the Seal (Pechatny Prikaz) - placed the tsar's seal on various documents granting various things to private individuals, and collected the corresponding duties **Stone Prikaz (Kamennyi Prikaz) **Coachman Prikaz (Courier Prikaz, Yam Prikaz: Yamskoy Prikaz) **Book Printing Prikaz **Prikaz of Hospice Construction **Pharmaceutical Prikaz (Aptekarskiy prikaz) **Monk Prikaz (Monasheskiy Prikaz) *Judicial Prikazes **Moscow **Vladimir **Dmitrov **Ryazan *Military Prikazes **Prikaz of Riflemen (Streletsky Prikaz) **Artillery Prikaz , (Pushkarsky Prikaz) **Prikaz of Admiral, (Admiralteysky Prikaz) **Prikaz of Cossacks (Kazachy Prikaz) **Armored Prikaz (Bronniy Prikaz) **Conscription Prikaz (Prikaz sbora ratnykh i datochnykh lydei () **Prikaz of Foreign Lands (Inozemsky Prikaz) **Arsenal Prikaz (Oruzheiniy Prikaz) ** Preobrazhensky prikaz (ru), which oversaw Preobrazhensky and Semyonovsky regiments in the 18th century **Prikaz of German feeds: probably, paid a salary to foreigners (known as \\"Germans\\" ( 'niemtsy' means \\"mute people\\")) in Russian military or state service **Ritter Prikaz *Financial Prikazes **Domestic Prikaz (Pomestny Prikaz) **Accounting Prikaz **Prikaz of Grand Treasury **Prikaz of Grand Income *Security **Prikaz of Petitions (Chelobitny Prikaz) - considered complaints or petitions addressed to the Tsar; the adjective chelobitnaya () comes from the expression bit' chelom, \\"to knock with one's forehead (on the ground)\\", meaning a very humble submission of a petition, with an extremely low bow.

In some cases new orders bore the name of this person (Order of dyak Vakhromeyev, where 'Vakhromeyev' is a last name). From 1512 on 'Prikaz' was starting to be used as a name of constant offices. Classification The classification of the various prikazes is a very difficult task. In fact, each major historian tries to build their own system of classification. Major variants include prikazes of a territory, of a class of population, or of an area of affairs. Another method of classification is to rank prikazes by subordination. Abolition The prikazes were abolished by Peter the Great and replaced, beginning in 1717, with administrative organs known as collegiate. This process took a rather long time; the Siberian Prikaz, for example, was restored in 1730 and existed till 1755. At the beginning of the 18th century Peter the Great even established some new prikazes. The system was only fully eliminated by Catherine the Great in 1775.

It was formerly placed in the genus Heterospizias. It breeds from Panama and Trinidad south to Bolivia, Uruguay and central Argentina. Description Flying in Goias, Brazil The savanna hawk is in length and weighs . The adult has a rufous body with grey mottling above and fine black barring below. The flight feathers of the long broad wings are black, and the tail is banded black and white. The legs are yellow. The call is a loud scream keeeeru. Immature birds are similar to the adults but have darker, duller upperparts, paler underparts with coarser barring, and a whitish supercilium. This species perches very vertically, and its legs are strikingly long. Food and feeding The savanna hawk feeds on small mammals, lizards, snakes, crabs and large insects. It usually sits on an open high perch from which it swoops on its prey, but will also hunt on foot, and several birds may gather at grass fires. Reproduction The nest is of sticks lined with grass and built in a palm tree. The clutch is a single white egg, and the young take 6.5 to 7.5 weeks to fledging.

GABAA receptors including those of the œÅ-subclass are ligand-gated ion channels responsible for mediating the effects of gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA), the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. The GABAA-œÅ receptor, like other GABAA receptors, is expressed in many areas of the brain, but in contrast to other GABAA receptors, the GABAA-œÅ receptor has especially high expression in the retina.Qian H. 2000. GABAc receptors in the vertebrate retina . Retrieved on February 14, 2007.  Nomenclature  A second type of ionotropic GABA receptor, insensitive to typical allosteric modulators of GABAA receptor channels such as benzodiazepines and barbiturates, was designated GABA–° receptor. Native responses of the GABAC receptor type occur in retinal bipolar or horizontal cells across vertebrate species. GABA–° receptors are exclusively composed of œÅ (rho) subunits that are related to GABAA receptor subunits. Although the term \\"GABA–° receptor\\" is frequently used, GABA–° may be viewed as a variant within the GABAA receptor family. Others have argued that the differences between GABA–° and GABAA receptors are large enough to justify maintaining the distinction between these two subclasses of GABA receptors. However, since GABA–° receptors are closely related in sequence, structure, and function to GABAA receptors and since other GABAA receptors besides those containing œÅ subunits appear to exhibit GABA–° pharmacology, the Nomenclature Committee of the IUPHAR has recommended that the GABA–° term no longer be used and these œÅ receptors should be designated as the œÅ subfamily of the GABAA receptors (GABAA-œÅ).  Function  In addition to containing a GABA binding site, the GABAA-œÅ receptor complex conducts chloride ions across neuronal membranes. Binding of GABA to the receptor results in opening of this channel. When the reversal potential of chloride is less than the membrane potential, chloride ions flow down their electrochemical gradient into the cell. This influx of chloride ions lowers the membrane potential of the neuron, thus hyperpolarizes it, making it more difficult for these cells to conduct electrical impulses in the form of an action potential. Following stimulation by GABA, the chloride current produced by GABAA-œÅ receptors is slow to initiate but sustained in duration. In contrast, the GABAA receptor current has a rapid onset and short duration. GABA is about 10 times more potent at GABAA-œÅ than it is at most GABAA receptors.  Structure  Like other ligand- gated ion channels, the GABAA-œÅ chloride channel is formed by oligomerization of five subunits arranged about a fivefold symmetry axis to form a central ion conducting pore. To date, three GABAA-œÅ receptor subunits have been identified in humans: * œÅ1 () * œÅ2 () * œÅ3 () The above three subunits coassemble either to form functional homo-pentamers (œÅ15, œÅ25, œÅ35) or hetero-pentamers (œÅ1mœÅ2n, œÅ2mœÅ3n where m + n = 5). There is also evidence that œÅ1 subunits can form hetero-pentameric complexes with GABAA receptor Œ≥2 subunits.  Pharmacology  There are several pharmacological differences that distinguish GABAA-œÅ from GABAA and GABAB receptors. For example, GABAA-œÅ receptors are: * selectively activated by (+)-CAMP [(+)-cis-2-aminomethylcyclopropane-carboxylic acid] and blocked by TPMPA [(1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridin-4-yl)methylphosphinic acid]; * not sensitive to the GABAB agonist baclofen nor the GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline; * not modulated by many GABAA receptor modulators such as barbiturates and benzodiazepines, but are modulated selectively by certain neuroactive steroids.Morris KD, Moorefield CN, Amin J.

It is developed for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution, and is closely integrated with Debian's package management system, dpkg. When packages are being installed, debconf asks the user questions which determine the contents of the system-wide configuration files associated with that package. After package installation, it is possible to go back and change the configuration of a package by using the \`dpkg-reconfigure\` program, or another program such as Synaptic. The design of debconf allows for front-ends for answering configuration questions to be added in a modular way, and there exist several, such as one for dialog, one for readline, one that uses a text editor, one for KDE, one for GNOME,The GNOME Journal: Simplified Package Management in Ubuntu Hoary a Python front-end API, etc. The original implementation of debconf is in Perl. During the development of Debian- Installer, a new implementation in C was developed, which is named cdebconf. The new implementation is currently only used in the installer, but is intended to eventually replace the original entirely. Both implementations make use of the same protocol for communication between the debconf front-end and the client code (\\"confmodule\\"); this is a simple line-based protocol similar to common Internet protocols. Debconf does not physically configure any packages, but asks the user certain configuration questions stored in the .templates file, under the direction of the package's maintainer scripts (.config, .postinst, etc.). Typically, the .config script uses debconf to ask questions, while .postinst applies configuration changes to the unpacked package in reaction to the answers; however, this can vary due to technical requirements.

The eldest son of sculptor Jacob-Sigisbert Adam, he was known as Adam l‚Äôa√Æn√© (\\"the elder\\") to distinguish him from his two sculptor brothers Nicolas-S√©bastien Adam, known as \\"Adam le jeune\\" (\\"the younger\\"), and Fran√ßois Gaspard Balthazar Adam. His sister Anne Adam married Thomas Michel, an undistinguished sculptor, and became the mother of famous sculptor Claude Michel, known as Clodion, who received his early training in the studio of his uncle Lambert-Sigisbert. Life and career In 1723 Adam received the Prix de Rome for study at the French Academy in Rome, which gave him a year scholarship in Rome, where he studied the works of the greats including Bernini and restored with much ability and late-Baroque freedom of interpretation a disparate group of fragmentary Roman sculptures to form a much-admired ensemble depicting Achilles and the Daughters of LycomedesIn the episode, part of the \\"prequel\\" to the Iliad, Odysseus by a ruse discovers young Achilles hidden among the daughters of Lycomedes. that was purchased by the French Ambassador to the Holy See, Cardinal Melchior de Polignac, and was purchased from his estate by Frederick the Great for Potsdam. For the ensemble Adam reworked draped torsos of Apollo Musagetes type for the figures of Odysseus and Achilles. The head of Achilles was modeled on the antiquarian Philipp von Stosch, \\"a notorious spy, homoerotic fop and gem collector\\" Seymour Howard, \\"Some Eighteenth-Century 'Restored' Boxers\\" Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes 56 (1993, pp. 238-255) p. 245. In the nineteenth century, after K. Levezow published the group (Levezow, √úber die Familie des Lykomedes Berlin 1804), the head of Stosch was lost, Howard relates (1993:245:note 35). Adam was elected a member of the Roman artists' guild, the Accademia di San Luca in 1732. His reception piece, a bust expressive of Sorrow, remains in the Accademia's collection. He was a pensionnaire of the Academy in 1732 when he was one of the 16 sculptors and designers who submitted plans for the new Trevi Fountain. His design was unanimously accepted, and the processes by which the decision was reversed in favor of Nicola Salvi and his student Luigi Vanvitelli are not altogether clear. Roman reaction against a foreigner receiving the commission seems to have played a part, as they in the interim selected then rejected Florentine sculptor Alessandro Galileihttp://art-now-and- then.blogspot.com/2014/11/lambert-sigisbert-adam.html, and in a letter of 1741 Adam wrote that not having received prior permission to compete from the director of the French Academy, Charles Wleughels, he was recalled home to Paris in 1733 as punishment.A. Thirion, Les Adams et Clodion, (Paris) 1885:57, noted in Hereward Lester Cooke Jr., \\"The Documents Relating to the Fountain of Trevi\\" The Art Bulletin 38.3 (September 1956, pp. 149-173) p. 155. Adam's competition drawings appear not to have survived. Adam was thirty-seven when, on his election to the Acad√©mie royale de peinture et de sculpture, he exhibited at the Paris Salon of 1737 the model of the colossal group of The Triumph of Neptune and Amphitrite that was afterwards (1740) cast in lead for the central fountain in the Bassin de Neptune at Versailles, and it made his reputation;His brother Nicolas-S√©bastien collaborated with him in the project. thereafter he found much employment in the decoration of the royal residences and in garden sculpture and fountains. He also restored with much ability the 12 statues (Lycomedes) found in the so-called Villa of Marius in Rome, and was elected a member of the Academy of St Luke. The dramatic realization of his figure of Neptune (illustration, below right) might lead one to expect that he would have been in demand for portrait busts; in fact, aside from the bust of the portraitist Hyacinthe Rigaud (1726), and two versions of the young Louis XV as Apollo,Terence Hodgkinson, \\"A Bust of Louis XV by Lambert Sigisbert Adam\\" The Burlington Magazine 94 No. 587 (February 1952), pp. 37-41, describes the terracotta bust (now in the Victoria and Albert Museum) that was exhibited in a plaster cast at the Salon of 1741 and the marble exhibited in 1745 and retouched and dated 1749, in the collection of Baron Maurice de Rothschild. none have been identified. The work of the brothers Adam was too boldly Berniniesque in style to win the approval of the sculptors and critics of the following generation, that found its principal protagonists in Edm√© Bouchardon and Jean-Baptiste Pigalle. Pierre-Jean Mariette expressed the new taste in his severe criticism of the eldest of the Adam brothers: :\\"This artist put into everything that he did a savage and barbarous taste and only rendered himself noted because one imagined that no one knew how to carve out marble as he did, and, to demonstrate it, he worked in such manner that everything formed hollows in his works. Thus do his figures have more the air of rockwork than of anything else at all.\\"Cet artiste mettoit dans tout ce qu'il faisoit un gout sauvage et barbare et ne se faisoit regarder que parcequ'on imaginoit que personne ne scavoit fouiller le marbre comme lui, et, pour le persuader, il faisoit en sorte que tout formait trous dans son ouvrages. Aussi ses figures ont-elles plutost l'air de rochers que de tout autre chose. (Mariette's Abecedario, quoted Hodgkinson 1952:40 Two works Two of his most important works were executed for Frederick the Great in Prussia. Mariette remarked of Adam's Hunting and Fishing, being sent to Frederick, that they \\"will not have lacked for admirers in a country where one does not yet completely know the value of beautiful and noble simplicity.\\"\\"...n'auront pas manqu√© d'admirateurs dans un pays ou l'on ne connoit pas encore tout a fait le prix de la belle et noble simplicit√©\\" (Quoted by Hodginson 1952:40). The volume of a suite of etchings by various hands, after Adam's drawings, titled Recueil de sculptures antiques Grecques et Romaines\\"Collection of Antique sculpture, Greek and Roman\\". (Paris, 1754) represented a group of antiquities as broadly restored by Adam that he hoped to be able to sell. They remained in his possession and appear in the inventory of his atelier at No 4, rue Basse du Rempart, which was compiled at his death.Hodgkinson 1952:38.

Azzopardi is married to Therese and has three children; Lara, Kyra and Yari. Early life and emigration Azzopardi was born in Siggiewi, Malta, and was educated at St Aloysius' College (Birkirkara, Malta), and the Royal University of Malta. In 1971, while still a student at the University, he directed Il-Gaƒ°ƒ°a, based on Frans Sammut's novel Il-Gaƒ°ƒ°a, presumed to be the first full-length feature filmed entirely in Maltese. Transferred to digital format and enhanced, the film was re-released in Malta in March 2007. Around the same time he assisted Cecil Satariano during the making of \\"Giuseppi.\\" He left his native country for Canada in 1978, following a dispute with local censors and theatre authorities who, in 1977, had cancelled his play, Sulari Fuq Strada Stretta, on the grounds that it was too offensive; the play was eventually presented at the Manoel Theatre in January 2008. He has worked on such shows as The Outer Limits, Stargate SG-1 (including its two-hour pilot), and Stargate Atlantis. In 2008 he directed all eight episodes of the HBO Canada/TMN miniseries ZOS: Zone of Separation, which he co-created and produced. Return to Malta In 2013 Azzopardi returned to his native country, Malta and established the theatrical company Stagun Teatru Malti. The company has produced a wide array of original work in Maltese, including In-Nisa Maltin Jafu Kif; Jiena Nhobb, Inti Thobb; Il-Kappillan Ta Malta (based on the book by Nicholas Monsarrat) and Sibna z-Zejt; among others. Azzopardi was also appointed as Artistic Director of Valletta 2018. He also has produced and directed a number of films, such as Dangerous Arrangement; A Red Dress; and Saul: A Journey To Damascus. Controversy Azzopardi courted controversy following comments made on his Facebook page in August 2014, agreeing with the 2001 decision taken by the European Court of Human Rights which had found that Sharia Law was incompatible with Democracy and basic human rights. The V18 foundation issued a press release in which Mr Azzopardi was quoted as having apologized for the possible offence he could have caused by his personal views, expressed on 28 November, more than a year prior to his appointment as Artistic Director, after journalists from The Times of Malta publicised those views while interviewing Owen Bonnici, the Minister of Culture, the previous day.Times of Malta, V18 director apologises for rant on Islam, accessed on 28/11/14 Partial filmography * Gagga (1971) * Deadline (1981) * State of Survival (1986) * Nowhere to Hide (1987) * Divided Loyalties (1990) * Palmer's Bones (1998) * Bone Daddy (1998) * Total Recall 2070 (television series) (1999) * Thrill Seekers (2000) * On Hostile Ground (2000) * Stiletto Dance (2001) * Wiseguy * The Stork Derby (2002) * Savage Messiah (2002) * The Wives He Forgot (2006) * Still Small Voices (2007) * Lies and Crimes (2007) * Saul: The Journey to Damascus (2014) * Dangerous Arrangement (2015) *Angela's Eyes *Stargate: Atlantis *Jeremiah *Dinotopia *The Outer Limits *Stargate SG-1 *Dead Man's Gun *F/X: The Series *Two *In the Heat of the Night *Counterstrike *The Flash *Night Heat *E.N.G.

Biography Born in Enfield, Middlesex, Haining began his career as a reporter in Essex and then moved to London where he worked on a trade magazine before joining the publishing house of New English Library in 1963. Haining achieved the position of Editorial Director before becoming a full-time writer in the early 1970s. He edited a large number of anthologies, predominantly of horror and fantasy short stories, wrote non-fiction books on a variety of topics from the Channel Tunnel to Sweeney Todd and also used the pen names \\"Ric Alexander\\" and \\"Richard Peyton\\" on a number of crime story anthologies. In the 1970s he wrote three novels, including The Hero (1973), which was optioned for filming. In two controversial books, Haining argued that Sweeney Todd was a real historical figure who committed his crimes around 1800, was tried in December 1801, and was hanged in January 1802. However, other researchers who have tried to verify his citations find nothing in these sources to back Haining's claims.

Free the Slaves is the US sister organization of Anti-Slavery International, the world‚Äôs oldest human rights organization.Hochschild, Adam Bury the Chains: The British Struggle to Abolish Slavery, London:Pan, 2006. Professional and academic career Bales graduated from Ponca City High School in Ponca City, Oklahoma in 1970. Bales earned his Ph.D. at the London School of Economics in 1994. He also holds a BA in Anthropology from the University of Oklahoma, an MA in Sociology from the University of Mississippi, and an MSc in Economic History from the London School of Economics. In 1990, Bales teamed with Simon Pell, then head of Arts for Labour in the UK, to form the fund-raising and research consultancy, Pell & Bales Ltd. The firm raises funds for medical charities, human rights groups, environmental campaigns, overseas development, and the Labour Party. In November 2011 fundraising by the company passed the one billion pound mark (¬£1,000,000,000 or $1.6 billion). He has since served as a Trustee of Anti- Slavery International and as a consultant to the United Nations Global Program on Trafficking of Human Beings. He has advised the US, British, Irish, Norwegian and Nepali governments and the Economic Community of West African States on matters relating to the formulation of policy on slavery and human trafficking. Bales edited an Anti-Human Trafficking Toolkit for the United Nations, and published a report on forced labor in the US with the Human Rights Center at Berkeley. In 2015 he was the Richard and Ann Pozen Professor of Human Rights at the University of Chicago. From 2001 to 2005 Bales was a visiting professor of International Studies at the Croft Institute at the University of Mississippi. Presently, Bales holds the position of Professor of Contemporary Slavery at the University of Nottingham, as well as that of Emeritus Professor of Sociology at Roehampton University in London. He served on the Board of Directors of the International Cocoa Initiative, and currently serves on the board of the Freedom Fund. Books Dr. Bales has written extensively on modern slavery. Perhaps his best-known book is Disposable People: New Slavery in the Global Economy (1999; revised edition, 2004, further edition 2012), a firsthand analysis of the operations of five slave- based businesses: prostitution in Thailand, selling of water in Mauritania, production of charcoal in Brazil, general agriculture in India, and brickmaking in Pakistan. Archbishop Desmond Tutu called the book \\"a well researched, scholarly and deeply disturbing expose of modern slavery\\". The book has been published in ten different languages. The book formed the basis for a film, Slavery: A Global Investigation, made by TrueVision in 2000, which won a Peabody Award. Influences Martin Albrow's globalization theory and Darren O'Byrne's theories on human rights have influenced Bales' research, as has the empirical training he received from Jack Gibbs and Larry DeBord. Some commentators believe his views on modern slavery were anticipated by contributors to the 1970s mode of production debate, and that his work on debt bondage in India and Pakistan was anticipated by the Marxist Tom Brass. Awards and recognitions In 2000 Bales was awarded the Premio Viareggio prize for his services to humanity. In 2003 he received the Human Rights Award from the University of Alberta; in 2004, the Judith Sargeant Murray Award for Human Rights; and in 2005 the Laura Smith Davenport Human Rights Award. In 2006 the association of British Universities named Bales' work as one of the top \\"100 world-changing discoveries of the last fifty years\\". Two years later in 2008, Utne Reader named him one of \\"50 Visionaries Who Are Changing Your World.\\" In 2008 he was also invited to address the Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates in Paris, and to join in the planning of the 2009 Clinton Global Initiative. The following year he was awarded a Prime Mover fellowship, and in 2010 awarded an honorary doctorate by Loyola University of Chicago for \\"outstanding service on behalf of human rights and social justice.\\" Most recently, Bales received the 2011 University of Louisville Grawemeyer Award for Improving World Order.The Grawemeyer Awards: Plan to end slavery earns Grawemeyer Award Retrieved 14 December 2010. Bales was appointed Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in the 2017 New Year Honours for services to the global antislavery movement.

Criticism In 2007 in response to Kevin Bales's interview with Democracy Now! about Free The Slaves, investigative journalist Christian Parenti wrote a criticism of Bales claiming he had made false claims about the chocolate industry. Specifically, Parenti argues that \\"Bales goes around fund raising, flogging his book and promoting himself on the basis that he has successfully reformed the chocolate industry and largely halted its use of child labor in West Africa. But no such thing has happened... Bales‚Äô organization FTS defended the chocolate industry when the Department of Labor sought to list cocoa as a product tainted by slave and child labor.\\" Bales' work has also come under critique by sociologist Julia O'Connell Davidson.

Some are bricks-and-mortar institutions that provide online learning as part of their extended university courses while others solely offer online courses. They are regarded as a form of distance education. The goal of virtual universities is to provide access to the part of the population who would not be able to attend a physical campus, for reasons such as distance‚Äîin which students live too far from a physical campus to attend regular classes; and the need for flexibility‚Äîsome students need the flexibility to study at home whenever it is convenient for them to do so. Some of these organizations exist only as loosely tied combines of universities, institutes or departments that together provide a number of courses over the Internet, television or other media, that are separate and distinct from programs offered by the single institution outside of the combine. Others are individual organizations with a legal framework, yet are called \\"virtual\\" because they appear only on the Internet, without a physical location aside from their administration units. Still other virtual universities can be organized through specific or multiple physical locations, with or without actual campuses to receive program delivery through technological media that is broadcast from another location where professors give televised lectures. Program delivery in a virtual university is administered through Information and communications technology such as web pages, e-mail and other networked sources. As virtual universities are relatively new and vary widely, questions remain about accreditation and the quality of assessment. History The defining characteristic of all forms and generations of distance education is the separation of student and teacher in time and space. Distance education can be seen as the precursor to online learning. Before the advent of virtual universities, many higher education institutions offered some distance education through print-based correspondence courses. These courses were often referred to as a \\"course in a box\\". These have been developed so that students can obtain almost immediate feedback from professors and online tutors through e-mails or online discussions. When the term \\"virtual\\" was first coined in the computational sense, it applied to things that were simulated by the computer, like virtual memory. Over time, the adjective has been applied to things that physically exist and are created or carried on by means of computers. The Open University in the United Kingdom was the world‚Äôs first successful distance teaching university. It was founded in the 1960s on the belief that communications technology could bring high quality degree-level learning to people who had not had the opportunity to attend campus universities. The idea for a \\"wireless university\\" was first discussed at the BBC (British Broadcasting Corporation) by the educationalist and historian J.C. Stobbart. From these early beginnings, more ideas came forth until finally the Labour Party under the leadership of Harold Wilson formed an advisory committee to establish an Open University. With the goal of bringing higher education to all those who wanted to access it, the committee came up with various scenarios before settling on the name Open University. The first idea floated in the UK was to have a \\"teleuniversity\\" which would combine broadcast lectures with correspondence texts and visits to conventional universities. In the \\"teleuniversity\\" scenario courses are taught on the radio and television and in fact many universities adopted the use of this technology for their distance education courses. The name \\"teleuniversity\\" morphed into the \\"University of Air\\" which still had the same goal of reaching the lower-income groups who did not have access to higher education. The name \\"University of Air\\" did not stick and by the time the first students were admitted in January 1971 the name had become what it is today \\"Open University\\". OU proved that it was possible to teach university-level courses to students at a distance. By 1980, total student numbers at OU had reached 70,000 and some 6,000 people were graduating each year. The 1980s saw increased expansion continue as more courses and subject areas were introduced; as the importance of career development grew, so the university began to offer professional training courses alongside its academic programmes. By the mid-nineties, the OU was using the internet. As of 2008, more than 180,000 students were interacting with OU online from home. The idea of a virtual university as an institution that used computers and telecommunications instead of buildings and transport to bring students and teachers together for university courses was first published in works like \\"De-Schooling Society\\" by Ivan Illich that introduced the concept of the use of computer networks as switchboards for learning, in 1970. In 1971 George Kasey, a media(activist)ethicist, delivered a series of lectures on \\"the Philosophy of Communications De-Design\\" under the sponsorship of Phil Jacklin PhD, professor at University of California San Jose, a member of \\"The (San Francisco)Bay Area Committee for Open Media and Public Access.\\" The lectures contained the theoretical outlines for use of telecommunications and media for de-schooling and de-design of mainstream education and an alternative Virtual Free University system. By 1972 George Kasey established \\"Media Free Times - periodical Multimedia Random Sampling of Anarchic Communications Art\\" a prototype for remote learning with the use of \\"multi- media periodicals,\\" that are now commonly referred to as \\"web pages\\". In 1995 by John Tiffin and Lalita Rajasingham in their book \\"In Search Of the Virtual Class: Education in an Information Society\\" (London and New York, Routledge). It was based on a joint research project at Victoria University of Wellington that ran from 1986-1996. Called the virtual class laboratory it used dedicated telecommunication systems to make it possible for students to attend class virtually or physically and was at first supported by a number of telecommunication organisations. Its purpose was to seek the critical factors in using ICT for university-level education. In 1992 the virtual class lab moved onto the Internet. A number of other universities were involved in the late eighties in pioneering initiatives and experiments were conducted between Victoria University in New Zealand, the University of Hawaii, Ohio State University and Waseda University to try and conduct classes and courses at an international level via telecommunications. This led to the concept of a Global Virtual University.Tiffin and Rajasingham (2003)The Global Virtual University London and New York, Routledge Coursework Providing access to higher education for all students, especially adult learners, is made easier by the fact that most virtual universities have no entry requirements for their undergraduate courses. Entry requirements are needed for the courses that are aimed at postgraduates or those who work in specific jobs. Studying in a virtual university has essential differences from studying in a brick and mortar university. There are no buildings and no campus to go to because students receive learning materials over the Internet. In most cases, only a personal computer and an Internet connection are needed that traditionally required physical presence of students in the classroom. Course materials can include printed material, books, audio and video cassettes, TV programmes, CD- ROM/software, and web sites. Support is offered to learners from the professor or a tutor online through e-mails if they are having problems with the course. Taking courses online means that students will be learning in their own time by reading course material, working on course activities, writing assignments and perhaps working with other students through interactive teleconferences. Online learning can be an isolating experience since the student spends the majority of their time working by themselves. Some learners do not mind this kind of solo learning, but others find it a major stumbling block to the successful completion of courses. Because of the potential difficulty of maintaining the schedule needed to be successful when learning online, some virtual universities apply the same type of time management as traditional schools. Many courses operate to a timetable, which the student receives with the course materials. These may include the planned activities for each week of the course and due dates for the assignments. If the course has an exam, the students will be informed where they have to go to write it. An example of a university that maintains a tight schedule is the Virtual Global University (VGU) in Germany. VGU offers a graduate program \\"International Master of Business Informatics\\" (MBI)‚Äîa master program in information technology and management that takes an average of four semesters to complete (for full-time students). Each course has a lecture or a virtual class meeting every week. Afterwards, students get a homework assignment; for example, they have to solve an exercise, elaborate on some problem, discuss a case study, or take a test. Lecturers give them immediate feedback, and one week later, the same happens again. Coursework can be the same for a Virtual University as the On- campus University in certain cases. NYU Tandon Online, for example, provides the same course work to its online students as the on-campus students at the NYU Tandon School of Engineering. This is done using advanced technologies. Teaching modes When online courses first began, the primary mode of delivery was through a two way audio-visual network. Then as well as now, many of the virtual study programs were mainly based on text documents, but multimedia technologies have become increasingly popular as well. These web- based delivery modes are used in order to expand access to programs and services that can be offered anytime and anywhere. The spectrum of teaching modes in virtual education includes courses based on hypertext, videos, audios, e-mails, and video conferencing. Teaching on the web through courseware such as WebCT and Blackboard are also used. See Virtual education.  Quality  Students taking \\"virtual\\" courses are doing real work to get their degrees, and educators preparing and teaching those courses spend real time in doing so. That is, students meet a comparable level of academic learning outcomes and are evaluated through programs constructed according to standard university-level criteria. Though it should not be assumed, virtual universities may be accredited in the same way as traditional universities and operate according to a similar set of academic standards. However, questions remain about accreditation and the quality of assessment. Accreditation is required to assure students that the online institute has certified online instructors who have the expertise and educational qualifications to design and carry out the curriculum. Assessment standards need to be particularly closely monitored in virtual universities. For example, respondents in studies of opinions about online degrees will rate an online degree from Stanford the same as an on-campus degree, because the name of the granting institution is recognized.

Population: History Yelets is the oldest center of the Central Black Earth Region. It was mentioned in historical documents as early as 1146 or 1147, when it was a fort belonging to the Princes of Ryazan. The town's position at the very south of Russian lands made it an easy prey for Turkic conquerors. The Mongols burned it in 1239, Uzbeg Khan ravaged it in 1316, Timur sacked it in 1395, and the Tatars devastated it in 1414. In 1483, the Principality of Yelets was absorbed by the Grand Duchy of Moscow, while the local Rurikid rulers (last heard of in the 19th century) entered the service of Ivan III. In 1591, Boris Godunov revived the largely deserted town by establishing a fortress there. In 1618, the fortress was captured \\"by subterfuge\\" by 20,000 Cossacks under Petro Konashevych-Sahaidachny, allied with W≈Çadys≈Çaw IV of Poland. They dismantled a large part of town fortifications. In the 19th century, Yelets became the largest trade center of the region. Handmade lace has been a notable product of the city since then; other important industries are grain milling and the manufacture of machinery. The town's chief landmark is the vast Ascension Cathedral, built over the years 1845‚Äì1889 to a Neo-Muscovite design by Konstantin Thon. The town was occupied by the German Army from December 4 to 9, 1941 and damaged during the brief occupation and Soviet offensive in the region. Administrative and municipal status Within the framework of administrative divisions, Yelets serves as the administrative center of Yeletsky District, even though it is not a part of it.Law #382-OZ As an administrative division, it is incorporated as Yelets City Under Oblast Jurisdiction‚Äîan administrative unit with a status equal to that of the districts.

The FSU was formed from the amalgamation in 1991 of various smaller unions drawn from the banking, insurance, trustee, brokering, and general finance industries. History The origins of the Finance Sector Union of Australia (FSU) extend back to 1919, when the Australian Bank Officers' Association (ABOA) was formed. The Australian Insurance Staffs' Federation (AISF) followed in 1920. An abortive attempt had been made to form an association of bank officers in 1913, but the bank clerk responsible for the move was discovered and summarily dismissed. However, ex-servicemen returning from the trenches of World War I were in no mood to be dealt with in the same way, and it was the self-belief which they had developed on the battlefields of France and the Middle East which gave them the confidence to form their own, independent staff association. This did not necessarily mean that they had become radicalised as such, or that it was their intention to radicalise the finance sector. Indeed, both the ABOA and the AISF remained deeply conservative organisations for many years; terms such as association and federation were quite deliberately chosen to distinguish these organisations from their militant, blue-collar cousins. It is necessary, however, to consider the organisational context in which the ABOA and AISF operated in the early decades of the 20th century. To begin, there were no female employees in either banking or insurance companies in Australia at this time. Recruits were drawn almost exclusively from rural and semi-rural areas, and especially from conservative middle-class families where the father was a lawyer, doctor, or member of some other respected profession. Employment in the finance sector at this time attached to itself a high degree of prestige; but the actual work ‚Äì especially in the lower echelons ‚Äì was tedious, repetitive, heavily supervised, and poorly paid. Moreover, an employee's cadetship (which could last for up to two years) was entirely unpaid, requiring that they be supported by their family; this helped justify the practice of drawing recruits from the middle classes. Employees were required to wear formal suits; were required to doff their hats and address their superiors as \\"sir\\"; were prohibited from marrying until such time as the bank believed they could financially support a family and thus not besmirch the bank's public standing; and were banned from attending public meetings, participating in political campaigns, or from seeking public office.. See also Also militating against their effectiveness was the fact that the ABOA and AISF were actually just two of a number of state-based staff associations which emerged in the finance sector during this period. These various organisations were not necessarily inclined to act co-operatively, or even to view one another as natural allies in the interests of their respective memberships. In some cases, it was not until the 1960s that the last of these state-based organisations agreed to merge with their federally based rivals. This division of membership naturally ensured that the overall coverage of the ABOA and AISF remained relatively small for many years; and those who did join frequently continued in the habits of difference and subservience into which they had been inculcated by the prevailing industry culture. However, by the late 1950s, ABOA and the AISF were members of the Australian Council of Salaried and Professional Associations (ACSPA), an umbrella organisation that continuously co-operated with the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) on basic wages, and margins cases; and, in particular, ABOA's leadership sought close ties with the rest of the union movement.Barney (book). 1980s. =Pre- WWII= Despite the many obstacles by which both the AISF and the ABOA were confronted, the very fact of their formation prompted the banks to raise employee salaries in 1919 and 1920. In 1921, insurance employers agreed to a log of claims submitted by the AISF, thus establishing the first ever national standard for employment conditions in that industry. These improvements, and the formation of the staff organisations themselves, were fiercely resented by banking and insurance employers, who accordingly adopted a number of aggressive tactics ranging from preferential treatment of non-unionists to outright intimidation to blunt the AISF's and the ABOA's effectiveness. The Great Depression of 1930‚Äì39 was a period of extreme difficulty for both unions. The drastically declining national economy created an atmosphere of fear and apprehension, in which the thought of industrial action was abhorrent and the terror of unemployment conspired to produce a subservient workforce. In this environment, finance employers went on the offensive, cutting jobs and, in one instance, serving up a pay cut of 20% to insurance employees. Unsurprisingly, the unions' membership went into steep decline, plunging from 1281 in 1931 to 858 in 1937. Despite these straitened circumstances, the AISF managed to win one important victory in 1931. In that year, the Arbitration Court allowed insurance employers to cut wages by a further 10%; on appeal to the High Court, the AISF successfully argued that this additional cut took wages below the ambit minimum that generated a 1927 pay claim and subsequent award. This ruling ensured that pay cuts could not continue to occur indefinitely. Generally, speaking, however, the 1930s were a period when the extreme economic circumstances rendered both unions largely ineffective. =Post WWII= The aftermath of the Second World War, and in particular, the emerging economic power of women, presented new challenges for both unions. Manpower shortages during the war resulted in many women taking on jobs previously considered male-only preserves; at war's end, many women felt they should not have to surrender jobs which they had demonstrated they could perform as effectively as their male counterparts. The AISF and ABOA were confronted with the dilemma of accommodating the demand for employment by returning servicemen with the rising industrial voice of female employees. This dilemma was only partially resolved by the boom in insurance and banking after the war, which created a demand for staff that could only by partially supplied by the available male workforce. Moreover, many employers had re- classified as \\"female\\" many jobs previously labelled \\"male\\", and were happy to employ women in these roles ‚Äì and pay them at significantly lower wages. However, as early as 1927, the AISF Executive had supported a call for equality of wages, and in 1941, won an award establishing minimum female rates of pay. In 1942, a mass meeting of 600 female insurance employees called for the implementation of the equal pay principle; and in 1948, the AISF and other unions actively campaigned on this issue. However, this push was defeated by the post-war wage pegging legislation; it would not be re-implemented until the 1970s. The ABOA spent the immediate post-war period engaged in a bitter controversy with the Chifley Labor government over its plans to nationalise the banking industry, and was instrumental in the election of the Menzies Liberal government in 1949. In the 1950s the ABOA embarked on three major industrial campaigns: the push for a 5-day working week; the introduction of long service leave; and the equalisation of wages between private banks and the Commonwealth Bank. These campaigns resulted in a growing industrial identity among bank employees; industrial action was seriously considered for the first time in the ABOA's history; and wage increases were won in 1951, 1954, and 1959. The right to a 5-day working week was finally achieved in 1963.. See also =1960s and 70s= The ABOA and AISF spent much of the first half of the 1960s consolidating their positions as the representative voice of banking and insurance employees, finally achieving merger with the various state-based staff associations (the AISF also changed its name to the Australian Insurance Employees' Union; the ABOA did not become the ABEU ‚Äì Australian Bank Employees' Union ‚Äì until some time later)). In the late 1960s, both unions once again took up the battle for equal pay for women. The employment of women had been resisted (and resented) by male employees right up to the outbreak of WWII, and often only grudgingly tolerated after that conflict because of the changed economic circumstances. By the late 1960s, however, women formed the majority of the workforce in both banking and insurance, and though under-represented in the decision-making organs of both unions, successfully pressed the case for an equal wages campaign. The first step occurred when the ABOA instituted a policy of supporting women members who undertook claims for back pay for having performed \\"additional duties\\" ‚Äì that is, work classified as \\"male\\". In 1969, the Arbitration Court handed down a decision setting out a timetable for the elimination of gender-based wage discrimination, and in 1970, the ABOA won compensation for four women who had not been paid the \\"male\\" wage rate when performing \\"male\\" classified work. In 1972, the AIEU and ABOA lodged claims for award variations, resulting in a decision that gender-based wage systems would be phased out by 1975. When employers threatened to drag the chain on implementing these reforms, the AIEU authorised strike action ‚Äì the first time a white-collar clerical union in Australia had made such an authorisation. It was overwhelmingly supported by AIEU members.. See also As a consequence of these campaigns, in November 1975, the AIEU and ABOA finally achieved the elimination of gender-based wage systems. The 1970s also saw the ABOA and AISF launch two more successful campaigns: firstly, for the implementation of four weeks' annual leave; and, secondly, the establishment of minimum entitlements for employees who lose their jobs through retrenchment due to organisational or technological change. =The 1980s and beyond= The deregulation of the Australian finance sector during the 1980s resulted in a highly volatile, fluid industry in which the old certainties were cast aside and the impact of neo-liberal economic policies became more apparent. One of the most noticeable changes was the emergence of \\"all-finance\\", the notion that banking and insurance companies break out of their traditional spheres of activity, and, through mergers, takeovers, and strategic alliances, look instead to offer their clients a suite of banking, insurance, stockbroking, and financial services products. The rapidly changing face of banking and insurance required a coherent response that was not to be anchored in a specific industry, but which instead could cover the entire field of finance and finance-related services. In response to the changing face and direction of the finance industry in Australia, and after much negotiation, the Finance Sector Union of Australia was founded in July 1991 when the ABEU and the AIEU voted to amalgamate and create a union based on the industry itself, as opposed to the increasingly convoluted divide between the trades of insurance and finance. It followed that four smaller unions became involved in this merger: the AMP Society Staff Association, Trustee Companies Officers' Association; the Wool Brokers' Staff Association; and the Reserve Bank Officers' Association. In March 1994, the FSU was further consolidated when the Commonwealth Bank Officers' Association joined the consolidated union, while continuing to retain some functions as a separate section within the union. During this period, the FSU also responded to the changing workplace environment by launching successful campaigns for the introduction of paid maternity leave (followed by paid parental leave, exclusive of gender), job sharing, and the introduction of employer sponsored sick leave cover for retrenched employees who find employment again in the industry within 12 months of their termination from their previous employer. However, the consequences of rapid technological change, the mass restructuring of workplaces and consequent off shoring of jobs, and the implementation of sweeping changes to Australian industrial law by the Howard Liberal government, means that many serious challenges face the FSU into the immediate and ongoing future. On 1 October 2006, the Commonwealth Bank Officers' Section (CBOS) formally amalgamated with the FSU and ceased to be a separate entity within the FSU.

Œ¥- shows an increase in negative charge and Œ¥+ shows an increase in positive charge. Note that the dipole moments drawn in this diagram represent the shift of the valence electrons as the origin of the charge, which is opposite the direction of the actual electric dipole moment. The bond dipole moment uses the idea of electric dipole moment to measure the polarity of a chemical bond within a molecule. It occurs whenever there is a separation of positive and negative charges. The bond dipole Œº is given by: :\\\\mu = \\\\delta \\\\, d. The bond dipole is modeled as Œ¥+ -- Œ¥‚Äì with a distance d between the partial charges Œ¥+ and Œ¥‚Äì. It is a vector, parallel to the bond axis, pointing from minus to plus, as is conventional for electric dipole moment vectors. Chemists often draw the vector pointing from plus to minus. This vector can be physically interpreted as the movement undergone by electrons when the two atoms are placed a distance d apart and allowed to interact, the electrons will move from their free state positions to be localised more around the more electronegative atom. The SI unit for electric dipole moment is the coulomb‚Äìmeter. This is too large to be practical on the molecular scale. Bond dipole moments are commonly measured in debyes, represented by the symbol D, which is obtained by measuring the charge \\\\delta in units of 10‚àí10 statcoulomb and the distance d in Angstroms. Based on the conversion factor of 10‚àí10 statcoulomb being 0.208 units of elementary charge, so 1.0 debye results from an electron and a proton separated by 0.208 √Ö. A useful conversion factor is 1 D = 3.335 64 C m. For diatomic molecules there is only one (single or multiple) bond so the bond dipole moment is the molecular dipole moment, with typical values in the range of 0 to 11 D. At one extreme, a symmetrical molecule such as chlorine, , has zero dipole moment, while near the other extreme, gas phase potassium bromide, KBr, which is highly ionic, has a dipole moment of 10.5 D. Physical chemistry 2nd Edition (1966) G.M. Barrow McGraw Hill For polyatomic molecules, there is more than one bond. The total molecular dipole moment may be approximated as the vector sum of the individual bond dipole moments. Often bond dipoles are obtained by the reverse process: a known total dipole of a molecule can be decomposed into bond dipoles. This is done to transfer bond dipole moments to molecules that have the same bonds, but for which the total dipole moment is not yet known. The vector sum of the transferred bond dipoles gives an estimate for the total (unknown) dipole of the molecule.

It stars William Marshall in the title role about an 18th-century African prince named Mamuwalde, who is turned into a vampire (and later locked in a coffin) by Count Dracula in the Count's castle in Transylvania in the year 1780 after Dracula refused to help Mamuwalde suppress the slave trade. Blacula was released to mixed reviews in the United States, but was one of the top-grossing films of the year. It was the first film to receive an award for Best Horror Film at the Saturn Awards. Blacula was followed by the sequel Scream Blacula Scream in 1973 and inspired a wave of blaxploitation-themed horror films. Plot In 1780, Prince Mamuwalde (William Marshall) is sent by the elders of the Abani African nation to seek the help of Count Dracula (Charles Macaulay) in suppressing the slave trade. Dracula, instead, laughs at this request and insults Mamuwalde by making thinly veiled overtures about enslaving his wife, Luva (Vonetta McGee). After a scuffle with Dracula's minions, Mamuwalde is transformed into a vampire. Dracula curses him with the name \\"Blacula\\" and imprisons him in a sealed coffin in a crypt hidden beneath the castle. Luva is also imprisoned in the crypt and left to die. In 1972, the coffin is purchased as part of an estate by two homosexual interior decorators, Bobby McCoy (Ted Harris) and Billy Schaffer (Rick Metzler) and shipped to Los Angeles. Bobby and Billy open the coffin and become Prince Mamuwalde's first victims. At the funeral home where Bobby McCoy's body is laid, Mamuwalde spies on mourning friends Tina Williams (Vonetta McGee), her sister Michelle (Denise Nicholas), and Michelle's boyfriend, Dr. Gordon Thomas (Thalmus Rasulala), a pathologist for the Los Angeles Police Department. Mamuwalde believes Tina is the reincarnation of his deceased wife, Luva. On close investigation of the corpse at the funeral home, Dr. Thomas notices oddities with Bobby McCoy's death that he later concludes to be consistent with vampire folklore. Prince Mamuwalde continues to kill and transform various people he encounters, as Tina begins to fall in love with him. Thomas, his colleague Lt. Peters (Gordon Pinsent), and Michelle follow the trail of murder victims and begin to suspect a vampire is responsible. After Thomas digs up Billy's coffin, Billy's corpse rises as a vampire and attacks Thomas, who fends him off and drives a stake through his heart. Thomas also finds a photo negative taken of Mamuwalde and Tina in which Mamuwalde is not visible. After killing one of the undead victims in the city morgue, Thomas and Peters track Mamuwalde to his hideout, the warehouse where Bobby McCoy and Billy Schaffer were first slain. They locate and defeat several vampires, but Mamuwalde manages to escape. Mamuwalde lures Tina to his new hideout at a nearby chemical plant, while Thomas and a group of police officers pursue him. Mamuwalde dispatches several officers, but one of them accidentally shoots Tina fatally. To save her life, Mamuwalde transforms her into a vampire. One of the remaining policemen locates the coffin and alerts Peters. However, Peters inadvertently kills Tina with a stake, believing that Mamuwalde would be in the coffin instead. Devastated at losing her again, Mamuwalde tells Thomas and Peters there is no need to pursue him further, and willingly climbs the stairs to the roof where the morning sun destroys him. Cast Production Many members of the cast and crew of Blacula had worked in television. Director William Crain had directed episodes of The Mod Squad.Lawrence, 2008. pg. 49 William H. Marshall's Mamuwalde was the first black vampire to appear in film. Marshall had previously worked in stage productions and in episodes of The Man from U.N.C.L.E., The Nurses, Star Trek and Mannix. Thalmus Rasulala who plays Dr. Gordon Thomas had previously been in episodes of The Twilight Zone, Perry Mason, and Rawhide. Blacula was in production between late January and late March 1972. While Blacula was in its production stages, William Marshall worked with the film producers to make sure his character had some dignity. His character name was changed from Andrew Brown to Mamuwalde and his character received a background story about being an African prince who had succumbed to vampirism.Lawrence, 2008. pg. 50 Blacula was shot on location in Los Angeles, with some scenes shot in Watts and the final scenes taken at the Hyperion Outfall Treatment Plant in Playa del Rey. The music for Blacula is unlike that of most horror films as it uses rhythm and blues as opposed to haunting classical music.Lawrence, 2008. pg. 55 The film's soundtrack features a score by Gene Page and contributions by the Hues Corporation and 21st Century Ltd. Release Blacula opened in Washington, Dallas, Seattle and Oklahoma City on July 26, 1972, and in Chicago two days later. Prior to its release, American International Pictures' marketing department wanted to ensure that black audiences would be interested in Blacula; some posters for the film included references to slavery.Lawrence, 2008. pg. 56 American International Pictures also held special promotional showings at two New York theaters; anyone wearing a flowing cape would receive free admission. Blacula was popular in America, debuting at #24 on Variety's list of top films. It eventually grossed over a million dollars, making it one of the highest-grossing films of 1972. Scream Factory released the film on Blu-ray as a double feature with Scream Blacula Scream on March 2, 2015. Reception Blacula received mixed reviews on its initial release.Lawrence, 2008. pg. 57 Variety gave the film a positive review praising the screenplay, music and acting by William Marshall. The Chicago Reader praised the film, writing that it would leave its audience more satisfied than many other \\"post- Lugosi efforts\\". Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune awarded three stars out of four, calling it \\"well-made and quite frightening.\\"Siskel, Gene (July 31, 1972). \\"Blacula\\". Chicago Tribune. Section 2, p. 15. A review from Roger Greenspun in The New York Times was negative, stating that anyone who \\"goes to a vampire movie expecting sense is in serious trouble, and \\"Blacula\\" offers less sense than most.\\" In Films & Filming, a reviewer referred to the film as \\"totally unconvincing on every level\\". The Monthly Film Bulletin described the film as \\"a disappointing model for what promised to be an exciting new genre, the black horror film.\\" and that apart from the introductory scene, \\"the film conspicuously fails to pick up on any of its theme's more interesting possibilities‚Äìcinematic or philosophical.\\" The film was awarded the Best Horror Film title at the first Saturn Awards. Among more recent reviews, Kim Newman of Empire gave the film two stars out of five, finding the film to be \\"formulaic and full of holes\\". Time Out gave the film a negative review, stating that it \\"remains a lifeless reworking of heroes versus vampires with soul music and a couple of good gags.\\" Film4 awarded the film three and a half stars out of five, calling it \\"essential blaxploitation viewing.\\" Allmovie gave the film two and a half stars out of five, noting that Blacula is \\"better than its campy title might lead one to believe...the film suffers from the occasional bit of awkward humor (the bits with the two homosexual interior decorators are the most squirm-inducing), but Joan Torres and Raymond Koenig's script keeps things moving at a fast clip and generates some genuine chills.\\" The Dissolve gave the film two and a half stars, stating that \\"The placement of an old-fashioned, Bela Lugosi-type Dracula‚Äîalbeit much, much sweatier‚Äîin a modern black neighborhood is a great idea, but the amateurish production leaves Marshall as stranded in the film as his Mamuwalde is stranded in the times.\\" On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 48% based on , with a weighted average rating of 5.3/10. Aftermath and influence The box office success of Blacula sparked a wave of other black-themed horror films.Lawrence, 2008. pg. 58 A sequel to the film titled Scream Blacula Scream was released in 1973 by American International. The film also stars William Marshall in the title role along with actress Pam Grier. American International was also planning a follow-up titled Blackenstein, but chose to focus on Scream Blacula Scream instead. Blackenstein was eventually produced by Exclusive International Pictures.Lawrence, 2008. pg. 59 The film was broadcast on Tele 5 as part of the programme format SchleFaZ in season 2.

A working definition has been proposed by Robert Hayward of the Centre for Health Evidence: \\"Clinical decision support systems link health observations with health knowledge to influence health choices by clinicians for improved health care\\". CDSSs constitute a major topic in artificial intelligence in medicine. Characteristics A clinical decision support system has been defined as an \\"active knowledge systems, which use two or more items of patient data to generate case-specific advice.\\"\\"Decision support systems .\\" 26 July 2005. 17 Feb. 2009 <. This implies that a CDSS is simply a decision support system that is focused on using knowledge management in such a way so as to achieve clinical advice for patient care based on multiple items of patient data. =Purpose= The main purpose of modern CDSS is to assist clinicians at the point of care.Berner, Eta S., ed. Clinical Decision Support Systems. New York, NY: Springer, 2007. This means that clinicians interact with a CDSS to help to analyse, and reach a diagnosis based on, patient data. In the early days, CDSSs were conceived of as being used to literally make decisions for the clinician. The clinician would input the information and wait for the CDSS to output the \\"right\\" choice and the clinician would simply act on that output. However, the modern methodology of using CDSSs to assist means that the clinician interacts with the CDSS, utilizing both their own knowledge and the CDSS, to make a better analysis of the patient's data than either human or CDSS could make on their own. Typically, a CDSS makes suggestions for the clinician to look through, and the clinician is expected to pick out useful information from the presented results and discount erroneous CDSS suggestions. The two main types of CDSS are knowledge-based and non-knowledge-based : An example of how a clinical decision support system might be used by a clinician is a diagnosis decision support system. A DDSS requests some of the patients data and in response, proposes a set of appropriate diagnoses. The physician then takes the output of the DDSS and determines which diagnoses might be relevant and which are not, and if necessary orders further tests to narrow down the diagnosis. Another example of a CDSS would be a case-based reasoning (CBR) system. A CBR system might use previous case data to help determine the appropriate amount of beams and the optimal beam angles for use in radiotherapy for brain cancer patients; medical physicists and oncologists would then review the recommended treatment plan to determine its viability. Another important classification of a CDSS is based on the timing of its use. Physicians use these systems at point of care to help them as they are dealing with a patient, with the timing of use being either pre-diagnosis, during diagnosis, or post diagnosis. Pre- diagnosis CDSS systems are used to help the physician prepare the diagnoses. CDSS used during diagnosis help review and filter the physician's preliminary diagnostic choices to improve their final results. Post-diagnosis CDSS systems are used to mine data to derive connections between patients and their past medical history and clinical research to predict future events. As of 2012 it has been claimed that decision support will begin to replace clinicians in common tasks in the future. Another approach, used by the National Health Service in England, is to use a DDSS (either, in the past, operated by the patient, or, today, by a phone operative who is not medically-trained) to triage medical conditions out of hours by suggesting a suitable next step to the patient (e.g. call an ambulance, or see a general practitioner on the next working day). The suggestion, which may be disregarded by either the patient or the phone operative if common sense or caution suggests otherwise, is based on the known information and an implicit conclusion about what the worst-case diagnosis is likely to be; it is not always revealed to the patient, because it might well be incorrect and is not based on a medically-trained person's opinion - it is only used for initial triage purposes. =Knowledge-based CDSS= Most CDSSs consist of three parts: the knowledge base, an inference engine, and a mechanism to communicate. The knowledge base contains the rules and associations of compiled data which most often take the form of IF-THEN rules. If this was a system for determining drug interactions, then a rule might be that IF drug X is taken AND drug Y is taken THEN alert user. Using another interface, an advanced user could edit the knowledge base to keep it up to date with new drugs. The inference engine combines the rules from the knowledge base with the patient's data. The communication mechanism allows the system to show the results to the user as well as have input into the system. An expression language such as GELLO or CQL (Clinical Quality Language) is needed for expressing knowledge artifacts in a computable manner. For example: if a patient has diabetes mellitus, and if the last hemoglobin A1c test result was less than 7%, recommend re-testing if it has been over 6 months, but if the last test result was greater than or equal to 7%, then recommend re- testing if it has been over 3 months. The current focus of the HL7 CDS WG is to build on the Clinical Quality Language (CQL). CMS has announced that it plans to use CQL for the specification of eCQMs (https://ecqi.healthit.gov/cql). =Non-knowledge-based CDSS= CDSSs which do not use a knowledge base use a form of artificial intelligence called machine learning, which allow computers to learn from past experiences and/or find patterns in clinical data. This eliminates the need for writing rules and for expert input. However, since systems based on machine learning cannot explain the reasons for their conclusions, most clinicians do not use them directly for diagnoses, for reliability and accountability reasons. Nevertheless, they can be useful as post-diagnostic systems, for suggesting patterns for clinicians to look into in more depth. As of 2012, three types of non- knowledge-based systems are support-vector machines, artificial neural networks and genetic algorithms. #Artificial neural networks use nodes and weighted connections between them to analyse the patterns found in patient data to derive associations between symptoms and a diagnosis. #Genetic algorithms are based on simplified evolutionary processes using directed selection to achieve optimal CDSS results. The selection algorithms evaluate components of random sets of solutions to a problem. The solutions that come out on top are then recombined and mutated and run through the process again. This happens over and over until the proper solution is discovered. They are functionally similar to neural networks in that they are also \\"black boxes\\" that attempt to derive knowledge from patient data. #Non-knowledge-based networks often focus on a narrow list of symptoms, such as symptoms for a single disease, as opposed to the knowledge based approach which cover the diagnosis of many different diseases. Regulations = United States = With the enactment of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), there is a push for widespread adoption of health information technology through the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH). Through these initiatives, more hospitals and clinics are integrating electronic medical records (EMRs) and computerized physician order entry (CPOE) within their health information processing and storage. Consequently, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) promoted usage of health information technology including clinical decision support systems to advance quality of patient care. The IOM had published a report in 1999, To Err is Human, which focused on the patient safety crisis in the United States, pointing to the incredibly high number of deaths. This statistic attracted great attention to the quality of patient care. With the enactment of the HITECH Act included in the ARRA, encouraging the adoption of health IT, more detailed case laws for CDSS and EMRs are still being defined by the Office of National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) and approved by Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). A definition of \\"Meaningful use\\" is yet to be published. Despite the absence of laws, the CDSS vendors would almost certainly be viewed as having a legal duty of care to both the patients who may adversely be affected due to CDSS usage and the clinicians who may use the technology for patient care. However, duties of care legal regulations are not explicitly defined yet. With recent effective legislations related to performance shift payment incentives, CDSS are becoming more attractive. Effectiveness The evidence of the effectiveness of CDSS is mixed. There are certain disease entities, which benefit more from CDSS than other disease entities. A 2018 systematic review identified six medical conditions, in which CDSS improved patient outcomes in hospital settings, including: blood glucose management, blood transfusion management, physiologic deterioration prevention, pressure ulcer prevention, acute kidney injury prevention, and venous thromboembolism prophylaxis. A 2014 systematic review did not find a benefit in terms of risk of death when the CDSS was combined with the electronic health record. There may be some benefits, however, in terms of other outcomes. A 2005 systematic review had concluded that CDSSs improved practitioner performance in 64% of the studies and patient outcomes in 13% of the studies. CDSSs features associated with improved practitioner performance included automatic electronic prompts rather than requiring user activation of the system. A 2005 systematic review found... \\"Decision support systems significantly improved clinical practice in 68% of trials.\\" The CDSS features associated with success included integration into the clinical workflow rather than as a separate log-in or screen., electronic rather than paper-based templates, providing decision support at the time and location of care rather than prior and providing recommendations for care. However, later systematic reviews were less optimistic about the effects of CDS, with one from 2011 stating \\"There is a large gap between the postulated and empirically demonstrated benefits of [CDSS and other] eHealth technologies ... their cost- effectiveness has yet to be demonstrated\\". A 5-year evaluation of the effectiveness of a CDSS in implementing rational treatment of bacterial infections was published in 2014; according to the authors, it was the first long-term study of a CDSS. Challenges to adoption =Clinical challenges= Much effort has been put forth by many medical institutions and software companies to produce viable CDSSs to support all aspects of clinical tasks. However, with the complexity of clinical workflows and the demands on staff time high, care must be taken by the institution deploying the support system to ensure that the system becomes a fluid and integral part of the clinical workflow. Some CDSSs have met with varying amounts of success, while others have suffered from common problems preventing or reducing successful adoption and acceptance. Two sectors of the healthcare domain in which CDSSs have had a large impact are the pharmacy and billing sectors. There are commonly used pharmacy and prescription ordering systems that now perform batch-based checking of orders for negative drug interactions and report warnings to the ordering professional. Another sector of success for CDSS is in billing and claims filing. Since many hospitals rely on Medicare reimbursements to stay in operation, systems have been created to help examine both a proposed treatment plan and the current rules of Medicare in order to suggest a plan that attempts to address both the care of the patient and the financial needs of the institution. Other CDSSs that are aimed at diagnostic tasks have found success, but are often very limited in deployment and scope. The Leeds Abdominal Pain System went operational in 1971 for the University of Leeds hospital, and was reported to have produced a correct diagnosis in 91.8% of cases, compared to the clinicians' success rate of 79.6%. Despite the wide range of efforts by institutions to produce and use these systems, widespread adoption and acceptance has still not yet been achieved for most offerings. One large roadblock to acceptance has historically been workflow integration. A tendency to focus only on the functional decision making core of the CDSS existed, causing a deficiency in planning for how the clinician will actually use the product in situ. Often CDSSs were stand-alone applications, requiring the clinician to cease working on their current system, switch to the CDSS, input the necessary data (even if it had already been inputted into another system), and examine the results produced. The additional steps break the flow from the clinician's perspective and cost precious time. =Technical challenges and barriers to implementation= Clinical decision support systems face steep technical challenges in a number of areas. Biological systems are profoundly complicated, and a clinical decision may utilize an enormous range of potentially relevant data. For example, an electronic evidence-based medicine system may potentially consider a patient's symptoms, medical history, family history and genetics, as well as historical and geographical trends of disease occurrence, and published clinical data on medicinal effectiveness when recommending a patient's course of treatment. Clinically, a large deterrent to CDSS acceptance is workflow integration. Another source of contention with many medical support systems is that they produce a massive number of alerts. When systems produce high volume of warnings (especially those that do not require escalation), aside from the annoyance, clinicians may pay less attention to warnings, causing potentially critical alerts to be missed. =Maintenance= One of the core challenges facing CDSS is difficulty in incorporating the extensive quantity of clinical research being published on an ongoing basis. In a given year, tens of thousands of clinical trials are published. Currently, each one of these studies must be manually read, evaluated for scientific legitimacy, and incorporated into the CDSS in an accurate way. In 2004, it was stated that the process of gathering clinical data and medical knowledge and putting them into a form that computers can manipulate to assist in clinical decision-support is \\"still in its infancy\\". Nevertheless, it is more feasible for a business to do this centrally, even if incompletely, than for each individual doctor to try to keep up with all the research being published. In addition to being laborious, integration of new data can sometimes be difficult to quantify or incorporate into the existing decision support schema, particularly in instances where different clinical papers may appear conflicting. Properly resolving these sorts of discrepancies is often the subject of clinical papers itself (see meta-analysis), which often take months to complete. =Evaluation= In order for a CDSS to offer value, it must demonstrably improve clinical workflow or outcome. Evaluation of CDSS is the process of quantifying its value to improve a system's quality and measure its effectiveness. Because different CDSSs serve different purposes, there is no generic metric which applies to all such systems; however, attributes such as consistency (with itself, and with experts) often apply across a wide spectrum of systems. The evaluation benchmark for a CDSS depends on the system's goal: for example, a diagnostic decision support system may be rated based upon the consistency and accuracy of its classification of disease (as compared to physicians or other decision support systems). An evidence-based medicine system might be rated based upon a high incidence of patient improvement, or higher financial reimbursement for care providers. Combining with electronic health records Implementing EHRs was an inevitable challenge. The reasons behind this challenge are that it is a relatively uncharted area, and there are many issues and complications during the implementation phase of an EHR. This can be seen in the numerous studies that have been undertaken. However, challenges in implementing electronic health records (EHRs) have received some attention, but less is known about the process of transitioning from legacy EHRs to newer systems. EHRs are a way to capture and utilise real-time data to provide high-quality patient care, ensuring efficiency and effective use of time and resources. Incorporating EHR and CDSS together into the process of medicine has the potential to change the way medicine has been taught and practiced. It has been said that \\"the highest level of EHR is a CDSS\\". Since \\"clinical decision support systems (CDSS) are computer systems designed to impact clinician decision making about individual patients at the point in time that these decisions are made\\", it is clear that it would be beneficial to have a fully integrated CDSS and EHR. Even though the benefits can be seen, to fully implement a CDSS that is integrated with an EHR has historically required significant planning by the healthcare facility/organisation, in order for the purpose of the CDSS to be successful and effective. The success and effectiveness can be measured by the increase in patient care being delivered and reduced adverse events occurring. In addition, there would be a saving of time and resources, and benefits in terms of autonomy and financial benefits to the healthcare facility/organisation. =Benefits of CDSS combined with EHR= A successful CDSS/EHR integration will allow the provision of best practice, high quality care to the patient, which is the ultimate goal of healthcare. Errors have always occurred in healthcare, so trying to minimise them as much as possible is important in order to provide quality patient care. Three areas that can be addressed with the implementation of CDSS and Electronic Health Records (EHRs), are: # Medication prescription errors # Adverse drug events # Other medical errors CDSSs will be most beneficial in the future when healthcare facilities are \\"100% electronic\\" in terms of real-time patient information, thus simplifying the number of modifications that have to occur to ensure that all the systems are up to date with each other. The measurable benefits of clinical decision support systems on physician performance and patient outcomes remain the subject of ongoing research. =Barriers= Implementing electronic health records (EHR) in healthcare settings incurs challenges; none more important than maintaining efficiency and safety during rollout, but in order for the implementation process to be effective, an understanding of the EHR users' perspectives is key to the success of EHR implementation projects. In addition to this, adoption needs to be actively fostered through a bottom-up, clinical- needs-first approach. The same can be said for CDSS. As of 2007, the main areas of concern with moving into a fully integrated EHR/CDSS system have been: #Privacy #Confidentiality #User-friendliness #Document accuracy and completeness #Integration #Uniformity #Acceptance #Alert desensitisation as well as the key aspects of data entry that need to be addressed when implementing a CDSS to avoid potential adverse events from occurring. These aspects include whether: * correct data is being used * all the data has been entered into the system * current best practice is being followed * the data is evidence-based A service oriented architecture has been proposed as a technical means to address some of these barriers. =Status in Australia= As of July 2015, the planned transition to EHRs in Australia is facing difficulties. The majority of healthcare facilities are still running completely paper-based systems, and some are in a transition phase of scanned EHRs, or are moving towards such a transition phase. Victoria has attempted to implement EHR across the state with its HealthSMART program, but due to unexpectedly high costs it has cancelled the project. South Australia (SA) however is slightly more successful than Victoria in the implementation of an EHR. This may be due to all public healthcare organisations in SA being centrally run. (However, on the other hand, the UK's National Health Service is also centrally administered, and its National Programme for IT in the 2000s, which included EHRs in its remit, was an expensive disaster.) SA is in the process of implementing \\"Enterprise patient administration system (EPAS)\\". This system is the foundation for all public hospitals and health care sites for an EHR within SA and it was expected that by the end of 2014 all facilities in SA will be connected to it. This would allow for successful integration of CDSS into SA and increase the benefits of the EHR. By July 2015 it was reported that only 3 out of 75 health care facilities implemented EPAS.http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-07-01/hospital-beds-closure-epas- electronic-records-delay/6586492 as accessed on 26 July 2015 With the largest health system in the country and a federated rather than centrally administered model, New South Wales is making consistent progress towards statewide implementation of EHRs. The current iteration of the state's technology, eMR2, includes CDSS features such as a sepsis pathway for identifying at-risk patients based upon data input to the electronic record. As of June 2016, 93 of 194 sites in-scope for the initial roll-out had implemented eMR2 =Status in Finland= Duodecim EBMEDS Clinical Decision Support service is used by more than 60% of Finnish public health care doctors.

Luce (1827-1917). Luce was laid down by Bethlehem Steel Co., Staten Island, N.Y., 24 August 1942; launched 6 March 1943, sponsored by Mrs. Stephen B. Luce, Jr., wife of Rear Adm. Stephen B. Luce‚Äôs grandson; and commissioned 21 June 1943, Commander D. C. Varian in command. History Luce departed New York 5 September 1943 and arrived Bremerton, Wash., 28 October after visiting Trinidad and San Diego en route. She departed 1 November for Pearl Harbor as plane guard for Enterprise (CV-6), and conducted gunnery training exercises in the Hawaiian Islands until 24 November. She then steamed to Adak Island, Alaska, and from 30 November 1943 to 8 August 1944 engaged in patrol and ASW duties off Attu Island. This duty was interrupted 1 February 1944 when she sailed from Massacre Bay, Attu, to participate in the 3 to 4 February bombardment of Paramushiru, Kurile Islands, with Task Force 94 (TF 94) of the Northern Pacific Force. Completely surprising the enemy, the attack was successful; Luce destroyed a 2,000-ton enemy freighter in the action. She returned to Attu 4 February and resumed patrol. On 13 June Luce, with TF 94, bombarded Matsuwa, Kurile Islands, and 26 June attacked Paramushiru a second time. On 8 August the ship departed for San Francisco and returned to Pearl Harbor 31 August. As a unit of the Southern Attack Force, TF 79, Luce sortied from Manus, Admiralty Islands, 11 October. During the assault on Leyte 20 to 23 October, she patrolled outside the LST-transport areas providing air cover. Between 1 November and 12 December, Luce sailed from Manus to New Guinea on escort and ASW patrols, and from 12 to 27 December supported the Huon Gulf, New Guinea, landing operations. On 27 December she got underway to screen transports for the Lingayen Gulf attack and landings. She arrived in the operating area 9 January 1945 screening LSTs and transports of TF 78. She fended off all enemy attackers and succeeded in shooting down one on the 11th. In company with 40 other ships, Luce departed 11 January and fought her way victoriously to San Pedro Bay 16 January. The ship patrolled this area until 25 January when she departed for the assault on San Antonio, San Felipe area, Luzon. This operation was unopposed, and Luce sailed for Mindoro 30 January. From 2 February to 24 March she escorted resupply convoys between Subic Bay and San Pedro Bay. Fate On 24 March 1945 she departed Leyte escorting and screening units of TF 51 which landed heavy artillery on Kelse Shima for the support of the main landings on Okinawa. She was detached from this duty 1 April and assigned radar picket duty off Kerama Retto. About 07:40, 4 May, Japanese kamikaze (suicide) planes were intercepted by the combat air patrol in the vicinity of Luce. Two enemy planes avoided the interceptors and attacked her from the portside. Luce shot down one, but the explosion from the bomb it carried caused a power failure. Unable to bring her guns to bear in time, she was struck in the aft section by the second kamikaze. The port engine was knocked out, engineering spaces flooded, and the rudder jammed. At 08:14 Luce took a heavy list to starboard and the order to abandon ship was passed. Moments later she slid beneath the surface in a violent explosion carrying 126 of her 312 officers and men with her. Honors Luce received five battle stars for World War II service.

Best known for her work with the band Henry Cow, she was also a member of Comus, National Health, News from Babel and David Thomas and the Pedestrians. She collaborated with a number of musicians, including Chris Cutler and Sally Potter, and co-founded the Feminist Improvising Group. She wrote scores for film and TV and a song cycle Oh Moscow which was performed live around the world in 1987. She also recorded a number of solo albums, including Rags (1980), The Gold Diggers (1983), and Music For Other Occasions (1986).

Recommended Records. but did not disclose it to the musical community until the late 1990s when her illness prevented her from performing live. In September 2013, Cooper died from the illness at the age of 62. Biography =Early life= Lindsay Cooper was born in Hornsey, North London. She began piano lessons at the age of 11, but switched to bassoon a few years later. Between 1965 and 1968, she studied classical music and bassoon at the Dartington College of Arts with Helen Glatz and at the Royal College of Music. She played in the National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain and became a member of the Royal Academy of Music in London. Towards the end of the 1960s, she lived in New York City for a year, during which time she became involved in music projects outside classical music. When Cooper returned to the United Kingdom in 1971, she left classical music and became a part of the Canterbury scene. She joined the progressive rock band Comus, and although she only remained with the band for a year, it changed her whole approach to music. She added oboe and flute to her instrument repertoire, and started doing session work for other musicians, including Mike Oldfield on his album Hergest Ridge (1974). While working on a theatre project, Cooper encountered Henry Cow, an avant-rock group that would later launch her musical career on the world stage. =Henry Cow= In late 1973, Henry Cow asked Cooper to join them as a replacement for Geoff Leigh (tenor sax and flute) who had recently left. Her classical training interested the group as they were continually looking for new musical directions. In spite of just having had all four wisdom teeth extracted, she immediately joined the band in the studio to record their second album Unrest (1974). However, following their European tour supporting Captain Beefheart, the group reorganized themselves and asked Cooper to leave, performing as a quartet on their Scandinavian tour of September 1974. But she still continued to guest on their albums and by February 1975 she rejoined the group again and remained a permanent member until they split up in 1978. From 1977, Cooper became one of Henry Cow's principal composers and contributed a number of compositions to their repertoire, including half of their final album, Western Culture (1978). The nature of the group enabled her to expand her musical horizons and experiment with new ideas. She also started playing soprano saxophone and piano during this period and began exploring improvisation techniques. Henry Cow toured Europe extensively, exposing Cooper to a variety of musical styles and musicians, all contributing to the development of her musical career. =Other projects= Cooper's work with Henry Cow attracted the attention of musicians from around the world and she had no shortage of performance and recording opportunities. Late in 1977, during Henry Cow's last years, Cooper co-founded the Feminist Improvising Group with Sally Potter, Maggie Nichols, Georgie Born (from Henry Cow) and Ir√®ne Schweizer. An international group of women improvisers, they toured Europe on and off between 1977 and 1982. She also kept a foot in the Canterbury scene by re-uniting briefly with Comus and playing on their second album, recording with Steve Hillage, and contributing to Hatfield and the North's The Rotters' Club (1975) album. After Henry Cow, Cooper joined National Health (whom she had already sat in with), but left soon after when Dave Stewart departed. In 1980 she recorded her first solo album Rags, a song-cycle about sweatshops in Victorian England, with Chris Cutler, Fred Frith and Georgie Born (all from Henry Cow) and Phil Minton and Sally Potter. In 1982 Cooper formed her own group, The Lindsay Cooper Film Music Orchestra, in which she wrote and performed film and TV scores, including the soundtrack to Sally Potter's debut feature film, The Gold Diggers (1983), starring Julie Christie. During the 1980s, she toured the United States with David Thomas and played in various bands in England led by jazz composer Mike Westbrook. In 1983 Cooper collaborated with Chris Cutler and formed the English avant-rock group News from Babel, composing all the music for their two albums, Work Resumed on the Tower (1984) and Letters Home (1986). Oh Moscow CD cover (1991) Cooper's best known work is her 1987 song- cycle Oh Moscow. It was another collaboration with Sally Potter, with Cooper composing the music and Potter the song texts. It premiered at the Zurich Jazz Festival that year and was subsequently performed in Europe, North America and Moscow. The songs dealt with issues facing a divided Europe during the Cold War. Ironically, the Berlin Wall came down 39 days after the work was first performed. Oh Moscow was recorded in October 1989 with Potter, Phil Minton, Hugh Hopper, Marilyn Mazur, Alfred Harth and Elvira Plenar at the 7th Festival International de Musique Actuelle de Victoriaville in Victoriaville, Quebec, Canada, and released on a CD in 1991. In 1990, Cooper spent a few months in Australia where she gave solo performances on bassoon, saxophone and electronics. She also collaborated with Australian singer, writer and theatre director Robyn Archer, arranging and composing the music for Archer's play Cafe Fledermaus, and Sahara Dust, a large scale jazz vocal piece with lyrics by Archer. Sahara Dust was released on CD in 1993 with the voice of Phil Minton, and reflected on the 1990‚Äì91 Gulf War and its impact on the world at large. Later that year, she worked in John Wolf Brennan's \\"Creative Works Orchestra\\" and performed at the Willisau Jazz Festival. She returned to Switzerland in 1991 performing in Brennan's \\"SinFONietta\\" at the Lucerne Festival. Cooper released two collections of her contemporary dance pieces Schr√∂dinger's Cat and An Angel on the Bridge in 1991 and performed her own composition \\"Concerto for Sopranino Saxophone and Strings\\" at the British Conservatory in London in 1992, a piece commissioned by the European Women's Orchestra. She also wrote and performed \\"Songs for Bassoon and Orchestra\\" with the Bologna Opera House Orchestra in Italy in 1992, and composed \\"Face in a Crowd\\" and \\"Can of Worms\\" for the San Francisco-based Rova Saxophone Quartet. =Illness and death= Cooper became aware that she had multiple sclerosis in the \\"late days\\" of Henry Cow, but did not disclose this fact to the musical community and continued performing right up until the late 1990s when the illness forced her to retire. In spite of this, Cooper still remained a highly respected and influential figure in the musical world. Her works are regularly performed and even taught throughout the world. Cooper died from the illness on 18 September 2013, aged 62. A statement from Chris Cutler said that Cooper had contracted pneumonia. =Legacy= In June 2014, it was announced that Henry Cow, Music for Films, News from Babel and Oh Moscow would all be reforming to play Lindsay Cooper's music at two concerts: one at the Barbican Centre, London on 21 November 2014 as part of the EFG London Jazz Festival; and the other at the Lawrence Batley Theatre, Huddersfield on 22 November 2014 as part of the Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival (hcmf// 2014). A third remembrance concert for Cooper featuring the same line-up above was held in Forl√¨, Italy on 23 November 2014. In a review of the Barbican concert on 21 November, Dom Lawson called it \\"a fitting salute to Cooper's life\\", adding \\"what tonight's experience never becomes is self‚Äëindulgent: there‚Äôs a sharpness to the intricate arrangements as very obvious waves of passion and commitment from everyone on stage flow and spread across the auditorium.\\" In November 2014, ReR Megacorp released a double CD Lindsay Cooper: Rarities  Volumes 1 & 2, a collection of unreleased and limited released tracks. Bassist Nasuno Mitsuru preparing before the second set of a live performance by the band Half the Sky on 22 June 2017 in London.

Delmart \\"Mike\\" Vreeland (born March 20, 1966 in Mason, Michigan) became notable for claiming to predict the events of September 11, 2001. Vreeland, wanted by police in eight Michigan jurisdictions for crimes like fraud and burglary was arrested in Iowa's Franklin County on October 20, 2004. According to Sheriff's Deputies, Vreeland ran an identity theft ring in the Detroit area for a few years and had felony convictions for breaking and entering and receiving stolen property. Shortly after the September 11 attacks, Vreeland apparently claimed that he wrote a note that foreshadowed those events while he was in prison. Vreeland is reported to be a folk hero among conspiracy theorists who believe he is a spy for the Office of Naval Intelligence. Government officials denied that Vreeland ever served in the Navy. Vreeland's various claims have included knowing the cause of death of a Canadian Embassy employee before it was officially released, working as an undercover American naval officer, and being the victim of a conspiracy of government officials attempting to keep him quiet. Police officers have reportedly characterized Vreeland as \\"a skilled con\\". In 2008, Vreeland was sentenced in Colorado to 336 years to life in prison after he was convicted of inducement of child prostitution, sexual assault, sexual exploitation of children and distribution of cocaine following his luring of two boys to perform sexual acts on-camera in exchange for cocaine, money and the promise of a drum kit.

The song is one of the few instances of pronouncing the city's name that way. It is normally pronounced \\"LOO-is\\". The song, which is generally styled in the form of a limerick, has many and varied verses, few of which are remembered today ‚Äî unlike the chorus. In the original sheet music, the chorus is the same for the first two verses but varies in verses three through six, which are essentially jokes with the punch line in the chorus.

It is based on the belief that the past, present, and future lives of all humans were foreseen by Dharma sages in ancient time. Nadi astrology uses a sidereal zodiac system. Sidereal zodiac systems coincided with tropical zodiac systems around 2,000 years ago, but have now drifted apart due to sidereal systems accounting for the precession of the equinoxes while tropical systems do not. History In Tamil Nadu, the texts are mainly written in Vattezhuthu, which is an ancient Thamizh (Tamil) script. They were written by an ancient priest or \\"Rishi\\" called Agastya who had a highly developed consciousness. These ancient records of providence were made famous by practitioners around the Vaitheeswara Temple in the state of Tamil Nadu. First, the Naadi palm leaves are located based on the thumb impressions (right for men, left for women). These Naadi leaves were initially stored in the premises of Thanjavur's Saraswati Mahal Library in Tamil Nadu. The British colonialists later showed interest in the Naadi leaves concerned with herbs and medicine, future prediction, etc. Some leaves got destroyed, and the remaining were auctioned during the British Raj (rule). These Nadi leaves were obtained by the families of astrologers at the Vaitheeswaran Temple and have been passed down the years from one generation to the other. There is also another set of astrologers claiming that the content written in the palm leaf is conversation between Shiva and Parvathi. This is called \\"Shiva nadi jyotisiyam\\". Theory The basic concept of Nadi Astrology is \\"Nadi\\" (). There are 150 NƒÅdis in a sign or RƒÅshi (RƒÅsi); one sign is 30 degrees of the zodiac 360. Twelve signs of zodiac are grouped into three categories: Movable (Chara), Fixed (Sthira) and Dual (DvisvabhƒÅva) signs. The nomenclature of 150 NƒÅdis is peculiar to each of these three types of signs. There are 1,800 NƒÅdis in 360 degrees. Numbers and names of NƒÅdis are identical among all four Chara signs. Among all four Sthira signs, numbers and names of NƒÅdis are identical, but numbering is different from those in Chara and DvisvabhƒÅva signs. Similarly, numbering of NƒÅdis in all four DvisvabhƒÅva signs are identical among themselves, but different from Chara or Sthira signs. For instance, the first NƒÅdi in Chara signs such as Aries is VasudhƒÅ NƒÅdi, but in Sthira signs the order is reversed and VasudhƒÅ is 150th NƒÅdi. In DvisvabhƒÅva signs such as Gemini, VasudhƒÅ is 76th NƒÅdi; that is, from the middle of 150. Thus, there are 450 distinctive names and numbers in the full zodiac. NƒÅdi texts use this concept of NƒÅdi as the basic unit for prediction. That is why they are called \\"NƒÅdi amshas\\". Chandra KalƒÅ Nadi, which is also known as Deva Keralam, was published by Sagar Publications in 1992, edited and translated into English by R Santhanam. It is a compilation of over 82 hundred verses by Achyut of Kerala, that is why it is called \\"Deva Keralam\\". But its original kernel was Chandra KalƒÅ NƒÅdi, which has not been preserved as a separate text. Deva Keralam has borrowed many non-NƒÅdi concepts also in order to make the book fuller, but it preserves the gist of NƒÅdi astrology. However, there are many different trends in NƒÅdi Astrology which are not present in Deva Keralam. There are NƒÅdi texts named after planets, such as Guru NƒÅdi or Shukra NƒÅdi, and there are voluminous unpublished texts like Dhruva NƒÅdi. The palm leaves in Tamil NƒÅdu temples use a style different from that of Deva Keralam, and the Tamil method of NƒÅdi Astrology is paralleled by Bhrigu SamhitƒÅ in North India, which has been published in part, but many spurious publications in the name of Bhrigu SamhitƒÅ have also appeared in the market. The basic methodology of these NƒÅdi or SamhitƒÅ texts have never been described in these texts, hence astrologers can predict only what they already possess, and are dumb-founded when they do not possess the required leaf about some particular person. The most fundamental trait of NƒÅdi texts is NƒÅdi, which is actually a sum total of all divisions of a sign caused by sixteen divisional charts (shodasha vargas) described in texts like BPHS (Brihat ParƒÅshara HorƒÅ ShƒÅstra). 135 divisions out of total 285 are repeated in other divisionals; hence there are exactly 150 distinctive divisions of a sign. But these divisions are unequal; largest division being of half a degree, and the smallest division is 36th part of a degree. Another school of thought assumes that all 150 divisions are equal; the value being 12 minutes (arc) in length.Chandulal S. Patel (2008). Nadi Astrology. Sagar Publications. When predictions are based on NƒÅdis in which ascendant and planets are placed; it means the combined results of all sixteen divisional charts are being told. Hence, NƒÅdi Astrology is the most detailed and accurate method. But it requires highly precise birth time, and it also requires knowledge of genuine NƒÅdi texts, most of which are unpublished, and the custodians do not allow others to see the manuscripts. The same is the case with SamhitƒÅ texts in North India, such as Bhrigu SamhitƒÅ or RƒÅvana SamhitƒÅ. Beliefs =Athma= Athman is the 'real' you with no body, no mind or no desire. Athman is immortal, and characterises the real you. Changes apply only to the physical bodies. Common stages are birth, childhood, teenage, adulthood, old age, and death. The real you (the Athma) then enters into a different body depending on your Karma and takes form relative to the good or bad deeds you have done. Athman can neither be created nor destroyed. Athman manifests in a physical body as per applicable karmas. In Karmic terms, a transition like this is like a person working in an organisation getting promoted when he or she works sincerely, honestly and efficiently, or demoted if he or she is a bad worker. Naadii Astrology is like a mirror of your karmas in the previous birth(s). While this is not entirely accurate, for simplicity's sake, let's say there are two options associated with your Karma. You either live out your mistakes or you can overcome them by performing corrective actions in a proactive manner - this goes for all living beings. =Navagrahas and siddars= All beings, irrespective of species, nationality, religion, social class, aggressiveness, etc., are controlled by the Navagrahas (nine houses or planets). The Navagrahas are very sincere in their duties as cosmic public servants and never deviate in performing their duties. They cannot be bribed. They affect individual beings as well as entire societies as per the Karma (thoughts, words and deeds of beings in this world as well as other worlds) applicable. The current life path of a person is determined by past Karma. For example, if a person is blessed with wealth in this birth, then it implies this person has done many punyas (activities that resulted in good Karma) in his/her previous births and he/she is enjoying the benefits of it in this birth. It is like a person who has saved a lot of punyas in his or her account cashing it in when the need arrives. Birth, death, rebirth and moksha are all controlled by our karma. Paapams (activities that result in negative Karma) are obstacles that may take long to dilute whereas punyas earned can be 'spent' very soon. From the Hindu point of view, this makes it important that we always think good thoughts and do no harm to any other being. Bad Karma is committed even if we think unrighteous thoughts. What is to be given to your lot in life, when, how and where are all decided by the Brahma using the Navagarahas and the Siddars as channels. As the Brahma cannot do everything in our realm directly, 84,000 Siddars have been created to perform duties on its behalf. Siddars are only another level of public servants in the cosmos, and they have capabilities and energies many would consider supernatural, although in Hinduism this is quite normal. Of all the siddars, 84,000 are identified as very powerful and these siddars express themselves by way of Naadi. Agathiyar is the leader of all Siddars. Agathiyar along with Kakapujandar, Bokar. Agathiyar always thrived for Jeeva Karunyam (to not harm any being), i.e., taking care of all living things in this world and guiding them to the path of Gnana or the attaining of supreme self-knowledge. =Types= * Naadi talks about a person's past, present and future and is mostly concerned with material things like getting a job, construction of house, marriage, curing a disease, etc. Gaanda Naadi were already written by Siddars ages back and are available in Tamil Nadu with the blessed people. * Jeeva Naadi is like a live thing happening. It is mainly concerned with Gnana and Nakshatra., Naadi astrology in popular culture Prince of Malacca In the film Chandran Rutnam is set to direct, Prince of Malacca, the olai-chuvadi (palm-leaf) reading which Raj Rajaratnam sought to forecast his future is influenced. After Johny reads an article in the Newsweek magazine by a professor at the University of New York, he becomes interested in olai-chuvadi reading or Naadi astrology. The article reveals, \\"Rajaratnam had gone to the ola-leaf readers.\\" It is said there was a government case against Raj, that he was in the stock business, that he was famous worldwide. That he had to close his business down. Rajaratnam revealed in the article that he doesn't generally believe in fortunetellers and astrologers. \\"But the ola leaves were written thousands of years ago. In those days there was no share business. I found it interesting.\\" The leaf reader had also divined that his wife was born in \\"some Southeast Asian country.\\" His wife Asha was born in the Philippines.

Released on 8March 1982, it builds on the low-fidelity production values and caustic lyrical content of their earlier recordings, and features a two-drummer lineup. Frontman Mark E. Smith establishes an abrasive Northern aesthetic built in part from the 20th century literary traditions of kitchen sink realism and magic realism.

He felt constrained by the label's ethos and worried that the Fall were in danger of becoming \\"just another Rough Trade band\\".

Steve Hanley In September 1981, the Fall travelled to Reykjav√≠k, Iceland for the first time to play three concerts, organised by Einar √ñrn. While there, they recorded three new songs (\\"Hip Priest\\", \\"Iceland\\" and non-album single \\"Look, Know\\") at Hlj√≥√∞riti studio. The studio, normally used by local folk artists, had lava walls (according to Smith, it resembled an igloo),Smith, 114 a factor that gave it its otherworldly sound. Kamera agreed to pay costs for the rest of the recordings and hired producer Richard Mazda, who suggested that the sessions would take place in a disused cinema in Hitchin, known as Regal Sound Studio,Britton, 47 as the ambience would resemble the band's live sound. According to critic John Doran, \\"uncertainty around a record label seeps into the album's sound, the work of a band with a gun pressed to their heads\\".

None of those fuckers Elvis Costello or Spandau Ballet did that\\". Hex Enduction Hour was written during an unusually prolific period in his career. Many of the tracks had already been dropped from the band's live set by the time they visited Australia and New Zealand in the autumn of 1982.

During the island's colonial era, it served as the residence of the Colonial Secretary or Chief Secretary. Since the establishment of the State of Singapore in 1959, it has been the official residence of the Prime Minister of Singapore, though none of Singapore's Prime Ministers have ever lived there. Together with the Istana, it was gazetted a national monument on 14 February 1992. Name The name of the house, Sri Temasek, means \\"splendour of Temasek\\" in the Malay language. The Malay word seri or sri means \\"charm; quintessence; splendour; glory\\". or a \\"cynosure\\". (something that attracts attention by its brilliancy or beauty; a centre of attraction, interest, or admiration). Temasek, which means \\"sea town\\" in Javanese, was the name of an early city on the site of modern Singapore. Today, it is used as an epithet for Singapore.\\"Singapore Street Names: A Study of Toponymics\\" by Victor R SavageÔºåBrenda Yeoh, published by Marshall Cavendish (2013). The house was originally merely known as the official residence of the Chief Secretary of Singapore (or the Colonial Secretary of Singapore/the Straits Settlements) and did not have its own name. The State of Singapore was proclaimed and the first Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew assumed office in June 1959, after which the house, which has become the official residence of the Prime Minister, has been officially named Sri Temasek, while the Government House has been officially renamed as the Istana, which means palace. Design The construction of the Istana Singapore (then called Government House) and Sri Temasek was ordered by the Governor of the Straits Settlements, Sir Harry St. George Ord, after the original governor's residence had to be demolished in 1859 to make way for Fort Canning on the hill that bears its name.. Sri Temasek was designed by John Frederick Adolphus McNair (1829‚Äì1910), a civil engineer who was appointed Executive Engineer and Superintendent of Convicts of the Straits Settlements, and built largely using Indian convict labour from Bencoolen. It was completed in 1869... A two-storey detached house ‚Äì often called a bungalow in Singapore ‚Äì with European and Asian features, Sri Temasek has a symmetrical layout consisting of deep verandahs surrounding central living spaces. Notable architectural features include arches on its upper level, an intricate timber arcade with a mixture of eastern and western decorative motifs, and a Chinese moon gate (a circular gateway) on the building's second floor. Although few records exist concerning the moon gate's construction and usage, it is known to have made its appearance in the house in the 1960s and to have been designed and built by William Swaffield, a pre- World War II Comptroller of Government House and a professional furniture designer. It is constructed of chengal, teak and meranti wood.. In the middle of the driveway in front of the house, there is a brick pit that was originally used by horse-drawn carriages. The house was gazetted together with the Istana as a national monument on 14 February 1992.; . Sri Temasek was not used for a number of years and fell into disrepair.. It then underwent restoration between 2006 and March 2008 by CPG Consultants under the supervision of architect Maureen Soh. As the original hand-crafted timber arches and railings on the first-storey verandah had been damaged by termites, replacements moulded from the originals made with an aluminium-cast alloy were used. Details on railings, doors and windows were restored, and several pintu pagar (traditional wooden half-doors) and wooden flooring reinstated. The former servants' quarters at the rear of the building were turned into a heritage gallery. The restoration works on Sri Temasek won the Urban Redevelopment Authority's Architectural Heritage Award in Category A (national monuments and fully conserved buildings) in 2008. Use A stone plaque bearing the name Sri Temasek in the grounds of the Istana Singapore ‚Äì photographed on 31 January 2006 When first built in 1869, Sri Temasek was the residence of the Colonial Secretary of the Straits Settlements (later Colonial Secretary/Chief Secretary of Singapore). All holders of the position had resided in Sri Temasek from 1869 to 1959. It is currently designated as the official residence of the Prime Minister of Singapore since 1959, though none of the past and present holders of the post, Lee Kuan Yew, Goh Chok Tong and Lee Hsien Loong, have lived in it as a family home. In the 1998 book Lee Kuan Yew: The Man and His Ideas,. Lee Kuan Yew said that when he became Prime Minister in 1959 he and his wife Kwa Geok Choo decided not to move into Sri Temasek with their three children, who were then aged seven, five and two, because the couple \\"did not want them to grow up in such grand surroundings with butlers and orderlies to fuss over their needs\\". The family did stay there in 1965 for a short time for security reasons when Singapore was expelled from Malaysia. Apart from that, according to a 2000 Straits Times interview with Kwa, the Lee children often played in the grounds of the house in the evening while their father played golf or made use of the practice tee and putting green.See also . During the interview, Lee said: \\"My official residence was at Sri Temasek in the Istana grounds where there are butlers and waiters galore. We decided to stay at home and not take the official residence which I used for entertainment purposes because we both believe that if they [our children] had so many waiters and helpers picking balls for them, doing things for them, it will give them an inflated and a false idea of what life would be like.\\" Sri Temasek has been used mostly for official functions, particularly in the 1960s and 1970s. Prominent visitors included Tunku Abdul Rahman, the founding Prime Minister of Malaysia; Spiro Agnew, the Vice- President of the United States; Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi; Denis Healey, British Defence Secretary; and King Hussein of Jordan. Sri Temasek was the venue for a party hosted in 1962 by Lee Kuan Yew to thank trade unionists and civil servants for their help with the referendum on Singapore joining Malaysia, and in 1983 the body of the late Minister for Finance Hon Sui Sen lay in state there. On 8 August 2008, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong delivered his National Day message from Sri Temasek for the first time.. The wake for Madam Kwa Geok Choo, mother of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and the wife of Singaporean statesman Lee Kuan Yew, was held at Sri Temasek in October 2010.\\"Madam Kwa Geok Choo's casket to be carried on ceremonial gun carriage\\", Channel NewsAsia, 10 May 2010.

In Anglo-American discourse, he is perhaps best known in regard to his friendship with Friedrich Nietzsche; in German theological circles, Overbeck remains discussed for his own contributions.  Life  = Youth = Franz Overbeck was born in Saint Petersburg as a German citizen to Franz Heinrich Herrmann Overbeck, a German-British merchant, and his wife, Jeanne Camille Cerclet, who was born in Saint Petersburg to a French family. Consequently, his upbringing was European and humanistic: first taking place in Saint Petersburg, then in Paris from 1846 until the February Revolution of 1848, once again in Saint Petersburg, and after 1850 in Dresden. This international education helped him gain fluency in the most important European languages. From 1856 until 1864, Overbeck studied theology in Leipzig, G√∂ttingen, Berlin, and Jena. Primarily through the lectures of Karl Schwarz and in conjunction with the historical theology of Ferdinand Christian Baur, his studies situated him at the beginning of academic criticism against the official theology. In 1859, he received his doctorate degree, after which he worked on his Habilitation on Hippolytus until 1864. After 1864, he taught as a Privatdozent in Jena. During his student time in Leipzig, he became close friends with Heinrich von Treitschke, and in G√∂ttingen, Overbeck had become a member of the Burschenschaft 'Hannovera'. = Theologian in Basel = In 1870, Overbeck became professor of New Testament Exegesis and Old Church History at the University of Basel. From that time until 1875, he lived in the same house (one floor under) as his colleague Friedrich Nietzsche, the Professor of Classical Philology at the same university. During this time, the housemates developed a friendship that would remain crucial for each other. In 1873, Overbeck published his most important work 'How Christian is Our Present-Day Theology?' (√úber die Christlichkeit unserer heutigen Theologie), in which he argued that the \\"historical\\" Christianity, as developed by the fathers of the church, neither did nor could have to do with the original ideas of Christ. He observed that early Christianity had opposed itself to every type of history, culture, and science, which made a \\"Christian theology\\" impossible. In this work, Overbeck criticized the conservative (\\"apologetic\\") theology, which stuck dogmatically to doctrines, as much as the \\"liberal\\" theology, which asserted that belief and knowledge could be reconciled. According to Overbeck, both failed to capture an essence of Christianity, which excludes every type of scientific knowledge. This work was primarily incited by David Strauss's The Old and New Faith (Vom alten und neuen Glauben, 1872) and Paul de Lagarde's 'On the Relationship of the German State to Theology, Church, and Religion' ('√úber das Verh√§ltnis des deutschen Staates zu Theologie, Kirche und Religion', 1873). Both authors attempted to shape a modern Christian religion with the help of theological scholarship. Overbeck regarded this project as impossible and fundamentally in error. In his afterword for the second edition in 1903, he renewed this critique against theologian Adolf von Harnack and his work 'The Essence of Christianity' ('Das Wesen des Christentums', 1900). The publication of this book practically destroyed all his chances to become professor at a German university. He remained in Basel, and for more than ten years, he held the same introductory lecture without addressing his provocative theses. In private, Overbeck made voluminous notes for a 'Church Lexicon' (Kirchenlexikon), in which he develops personal accounts, principally theological but also political, cultural, philosophical, and a literature bibliography with commentary. The goal of this collection fulfilled the only purpose Overbeck saw for a scholarly theologian: a profane history of the church. Exactly what Christianity itself would not explain or could not understand, moreover what it would deny, Overbeck documented, thereby demonstrating his primary dilemma: that a \\"Christian theology\\" is impossible. In 1876, Overbeck married Ida Rothpletz, and for one year was Rector of the University of Basel. = Friendship with Nietzsche = 'How Christian is Our Present-Day Theology?' was published at the same time as the first of Nietzsche's Untimely Meditations. Both writings were critical of David Strauss and shared similar main theses. Although these were the only books Nietzsche and Overbeck published together, theses similar to Overbeck's can be found in Nietzsche's writings through 'The Antichrist'. After Nietzsche left Basel in 1879, he and Overbeck continued a personal friendship through regular correspondence. In a letter from 1881, Nietzsche wrote to Overbeck: : My dear friend, what is this our life? A boat that swims in the sea, and all one knows for certain about it is that one day it will capsize. Here we are, two good old boats that have been faithful neighbors, and above all your hand has done its best to keep me from 'capsizing'! Let us then continue our voyage -- each for the other's sake, for a long time yet, a long time! We should miss each other so much! Tolerably calm seas and good winds and above all sun -- what I wish for myself, I wish for you, too, and am sorry that my gratitude can find expression only in such a wish and has no influence at all on wind or weather.http://www.geocities.com/thenietzschechannel/nlett1881.htm The Nietzsche Channel: Nietzsche's Letters: 1881] at www.geocities.com At the beginning of January 1889, Nietzsche sent letters to friends that exhibited symptoms of a mental collapse. After Overbeck received such a letter, he travelled to Turin the same day to retrieve the sick Nietzsche and his manuscripts. He continued to visit Nietzsche until the latter's death in 1900. To remain sincere to his friend, Overbeck maintained a critical distance from the content of Nietzsche's writings, and denounced the beginnings of a hero- worship and revisionism. He refused to cooperate with Elisabeth F√∂rster- Nietzsche and her Nietzsche-Archiv and, mostly in private notes and letters, accused her of misinterpreting Nietzsche. He refused to give her his correspondence with Nietzsche - which turned out to be right, as she would forge other correspondents' letters. = Old Age and Legacy = After long periods of sickness, in 1897 Overbeck became an Emeritus professor, and in the following year, noticeably weakened, he gave up this honorary appointment at Basel. In 1903 and after long hesitation, he accepted an honorary doctorate degree from the University of St Andrews. In 1905, Franz Overbeck died in Basel. After his death, Elisabeth F√∂rster-Nietzsche continued to pursue Overbeck and his reputation. In 1907, she revived a campaign against him, which in turn was rebuffed by his wife Ida and his longtime friend Carl Albrecht Bernoulli. It was not until several decades after Overbeck's death that his (anti-)theological views were taken seriously, notably by Karl Barth, Karl L√∂with, and Martin Heidegger. Since c. 1980, interest in Overbeck has grown, at least in German academic circles, as is shown by the increasing number of publications in that country.  Works  Although a critical edition of Overbeck's publications (including many of his notes for his lexicon) has been published in Germany, few of his writings have been available in English translation until recently. However, there are now two English translations of '√úber die Christlichkeit unserer heutigen Theologie': * 'On the Christianity of Theology', trans. by John Elbert Wilson, Pickwick Publications, 2002, * 'How Christian is Our Present-Day Theology?', trans. by Martin Henry, T & T Clark/Continuum, 2005, Notes 1\\\\. http://www.thenietzschechannel.com/correspondence/eng/nlett-1881.htm#november-14-1881 The Nietzsche Channel: Nietzsche's Letters: 1881 Bibliography * Martin Henry, \\"Review Article: Franz Overbeck: A Review of Recent Literature (Part 1),\\" Irish Theological Quarterly, 72,4 (2007), 391‚Äì404; \\"(Part 2),\\" ibid., 73,1-2 (2008), 174‚Äì191. * Rudolf Br√§ndle, Ekkehard W.

B'hoy and g'hal (meant to evoke an Irish pronunciation of boy and gal, respectively)Sante, Low Life, 77. were the prevailing slang words used to describe the young men and women of the rough-and-tumble working class culture of Lower Manhattan in the late 1840s and into the period of the American Civil War. They spoke a slang, with phrases such as \\"hi-hi\\", \\"lam him\\", and \\"cheese it\\".Brodsky 527, note 8. Etymology The word b'hoy was first used in 1846. In the United States it was a colloquialism for \\"spirited lad\\" and \\"young spark\\". The word originates from the Irish pronunciation of boy. Theatrical examples The prototypical artistic representation of a b'hoy came in 1848, when Frank Chanfrau played the character Mose the Fireboy in Benjamin A. Baker's A Glance at New York. Mose is a pugilistic Irish volunteer fireman. T.

Because of Chow's theorem any compact complex manifold of dimension 2 and with Kodaira dimension 2 will actually be an algebraic surface, and in some sense most surfaces are in this class. Classification Gieseker showed that there is a coarse moduli scheme for surfaces of general type; this means that for any fixed values of the Chern numbers c_1^2, c_2, there is a quasi-projective scheme classifying the surfaces of general type with those Chern numbers. It remains a very difficult problem to describe these schemes explicitly, and there are few pairs of Chern numbers for which this has been done (except when the scheme is empty). There are some indications that these schemes are in general too complicated to write down explicitly: the known upper bounds for the number of components are very large, some components can be non-reduced everywhere, components may have many different dimensions, and the few pieces that have been studied explicitly tend to look rather complicated. Chern numbers of minimal complex surfaces The study of which pairs of Chern numbers can occur for a surface of general type is known as \\"\\" and there is an almost complete answer to this question. There are several conditions that the Chern numbers of a minimal complex surface of general type must satisfy: *c_1^2 + c_2 \\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod{12} (as it is equal to 12œá) *c_1^2, c_2 \\\\geqslant 0 *c_1^2 \\\\leqslant 3c_2 (the Bogomolov-Miyaoka-Yau inequality) *5c_1^2 - c_2 + 36 \\\\geqslant 12q \\\\geqslant 0 where q is the irregularity of a surface (the Noether inequality). Many (and possibly all) pairs of integers satisfying these conditions are the Chern numbers for some complex surface of general type. By contrast, for almost complex surfaces, the only constraint is: :c_1^2+c_2 \\\\equiv 0 \\\\pmod{12}, and this can always be realized.http://www.pnas.org/cgi/reprint/55/6/1624.pdf Examples This is only a small selection of the rather large number of examples of surfaces of general type that have been found. Many of the surfaces of general type that have been investigated lie on (or near) the edges of the region of possible Chern numbers. In particular Horikawa surfaces lie on or near the \\"Noether line\\", many of the surfaces listed below lie on the line c_1^2 + c_2 = 12 \\\\chi = 12, the minimum possible value for general type, and surfaces on the line 3c_2 = c_1^2 are all quotients of the unit ball in C2 (and are particularly hard to find). =Surfaces with œá=1= These surface which are located in the \\"lower left\\" boundary in the diagram have been studied in detail. For these surfaces with second Chern class can be any integer from 3 to 11. Surfaces with all these values are known; a few of the many examples that have been studied are: *c2 = 3: Fake projective plane (Mumford surface). The first example was found by Mumford using p-adic geometry, and there are 50 examples altogether. They have the same Betti numbers as the projective plane, but are not homeomorphic to it as their fundamental groups are infinite. *c2 = 4: Beauville surfaces are named for Arnaud Beauville and have infinite fundamental group. *c2 ‚â• 4: Burniat surfaces *c2 = 10: Campedelli surfaces. Surfaces with the same Hodge numbers are called numerical Campedelli surfaces. *c2 = 10: Catanese surfaces are simply connected. *c2 = 11: Godeaux surfaces. The cyclic group of order 5 acts freely on the Fermat surface of points (w:x:y:z) in P3 satisfying w^5+x^5+y^5+z^5=0 by mapping (w:x:y:z) to (w:\\\\rho x:\\\\rho^2 y: \\\\rho^3 z) where œÅ is a fifth root of 1\\\\. The quotient by this action is the original Godeaux surface. Other surfaces constructed in a similar way with the same Hodge numbers are also sometimes called Godeaux surfaces. Surfaces with the same Hodge numbers (such as Barlow surfaces) are called numerical Godeaux surfaces. The fundamental group (of the original Godeaux surface) is cyclic of order 5\\\\. *c2 = 11: Barlow surfaces are simply connected. Together with the Craighero-Gattazzo surface, these are the only known examples of simply connected surfaces of general type with pg = 0\\\\. *Todorov surfaces give counterexamples to the conclusion of the Torelli theorem =Other Examples= *Castelnuovo surfaces: Another extremal case, Castelnuovo proved that if the canonical bundle is very ample for a surface of general type then c_1^2 \\\\geqslant 3p_g -7. Castelnuovo surface are surfaces of general type such that the canonical bundle is very ample and that c_1^2 = 3p_g -7. *Complete intersections: A smooth complete intersection of hypersurfaces of degrees d_1 \\\\geqslant d_2 \\\\geqslant \\\\cdots \\\\geqslant d_{n-2} \\\\geqslant 2 in Pn is a surface of general type unless the degrees are (2), (3), (2, 2) (rational), (4), (3, 2), (2, 2, 2) (Kodaira dimension 0). Complete intersections are all simply connected. A special case are hypersurfaces: for example, in P3, non-singular surfaces of degree at least 5 are of general type (Non-singular hypersurfaces of degree 4 are K3 surfaces, and those of degree less than 4 are rational). *Fano surfaces of lines on a cubic 3-fold. *Hilbert modular surfaces are mostly of general type. *Horikawa surfaces are surfaces with q = 0 and p_g=\\\\tfrac{1}{2} c_1^2 + 2 or \\\\tfrac{1}{2}c_1^2 + \\\\tfrac{3}{2} (which implies that they are more or less on the \\"Noether line\\" edge of the region of possible values of the Chern numbers). They are all simply connected, and Horikawa gave a detailed description of them. *Products: the product of two curves both of genus at least 2 is a surface of general type. *Double covers of non-singular degree 2m curves in P2 are of general type if 2m \\\\geqslant 8. (For 2m=2 they are rational, for 2m=4 they are again rational and called del Pezzo double planes, and for 2m=6 they are K3 surfaces.) They are simply connected, and have Chern numbers c_1^2 = 2(m-3)^2, c_2 = 4m^2 - 6m +6. Canonical models proved that the multicanonical map œÜnK for a complex surface of general type is a birational isomorphism onto its image whenever n‚â•5, and showed that the same result still holds in positive characteristic. There are some surfaces for which it is not a birational isomorphism when n is 4. These results follow from Reider's theorem.

The obstetrical dilemma claims that this difference is due to the biological trade-off imposed by two opposing evolutionary pressures in the development of the human pelvis: smaller birth canals in the mothers, and larger skulls in the babies. Proponents believe bipedal locomotion (the ability to walk upright) decreased the size of the bony parts of the birth canal. They also believe that as hominids' and humans' skull and brain sizes increased over the millennia, that women needed wider hips to give birth, that these wider hips made women inherently less able to walk or run than men, and that babies had to be born earlier to fit through the birth canal, resulting in the so-called fourth trimester period for newborns (being born when the baby seems less developed than in other animals). This idea was widely accepted when first published in 1960, but has since been criticized by other scientists.  History  The term, obstetrical dilemma, was coined in 1960, by Sherwood Lerned Washburn, a prominent early American physical anthropologist, in order to describe the evolutionary development of the human pelvis and its relation to childbirth and pregnancy in hominids and non-human primates. In the intervening decades, the term has been used broadly among anthropologists, biologists, and other scientists to describe aspects of this hypothesis and related topics. Evolution of human birth The diagram compares the size and shape of the pelvis as the infant's skull must move through it for the Chimpanzee, Australopithecus afarensis and Homo sapiens sapiens. This comparison is one of the pieces of evidence physical anthropologists use to support the Obstetrical Dilemma hypothesis = Human pelvis = The obstetrical dilemma hypothesizes that when hominids began to develop bipedal locomotion, the conflict between these two opposing evolutionary pressures became greatly exacerbated. Because humans are currently the only recognized extant obligately bipedal primates, meaning our body shape requires to only use two legs, major evolutionary developments had to occur in order to alter to the shape of the female pelvis. Human males evolved narrower hips optimized for locomotion, whereas female hips evolved to be a wider optimization because of childbirthing needs.\\"Why must childbirth be such hard labour? New evidence about why women give birth when they do has turned received opinion on its head by Alice Roberts, 2013-06-30\\". Human pelvises have no distinguishing skeletal markers for sex before puberty, meanwhile, with maturation, hormones and obstetrical demands alter the shape of the pelvis in females. Overall, through evolution of the species, a number of structures in the body have changed size, proportion, or location in order to accommodate bipedal locomotion and allow a person to stand upright and face forward. To help support the upper body, a number of structural changes were made to the pelvis. The ilial pelvic bone shifted forward and broadened, while the ischial pelvic bone shrank, narrowing the pelvic canal. These changes were occurring at the same time as humans were developing larger craniums.  Male versus Female  A male pelvis (left) compared to a female pelvis (right) from a posterolateral view. Differences in the sciatic notch and overall shape of the ilium can be observed. Examination of the pelvis is the most useful method for identifying biological sex through the skeleton. Distinguishing features between the human male and female pelvis stem from the selective pressures of childbearing and birth. Females must be able to carry out the process of childbirth but also be able to move bipedally. The human female pelvis has evolved to be as wide as possible while still being able to allow bipedal locomotion. The compromise between these two necessary functions of the female pelvis can be especially seen through the comparative skeletal anatomy between males and females. The human pelvis is made up of three sections: the hip bones (ilium, ischium and pubis), the sacrum, and the coccyx. How these three segments articulate and what their dimensions are is key for differentiation between males and females. Females acquired the characteristic of the overall pelvic bone being thinner and denser than the pelvic bones of males. The female pelvis has also evolved to be much wider and allow for greater room in order to safely deliver a child. After sexual maturation, it can be observed that the pubic arch in females is generally an obtuse angle (between 90 and 100 degrees) while males tend to have more of an acute angle (approximately 70 degrees). This difference in angles can be attributed to the fact that the overall pelvis for a female is preferred to be wider and more open than a male pelvis. Another key difference can be seen in the sciatic notch. The sciatic notch in females tend to be wider than the sciatic notches of males. The pelvic inlet is also a key difference. The pelvic inlet in females be observed as oval-shaped in females and more of a heart-shape in males. The difference in inlet shape is related to the distance between the ischium bones of the pelvis. To allow for a wider and more oval- shaped inlet, female ischium bones are further apart from one another than the ischium bones of a male. Differences in the sacrum between males and females can also be attributed to the needs of child birth. The female sacrum is wider than the male sacrum. The female sacrum can also be observed as being shorter than the sacrum of a male. The difference in width can be explained by the overall wider shape of the female pelvis. The female sacrum is also more curved posteriorly. This could be explained by the need for as much space as possible for a birthing canal. The articulating coccyx in females is also generally observed as being straighter and more flexible than the coccyx of a male for the same reason. Because of the female pelvic bones in general being further apart from one another than those of the male pelvis, the acetabula in a female are positioned more medially and further apart from one another. It is this orientation that allows for the stereotypical swinging motion of a female's hips while walking. The acetabula not only differ in distance, but depth as well. It has been found that female acetabula have a greater depth than those in males, but also paired with a smaller femoral head. This in turn creates a more stable hip joint(insert). One of the last key differences can be seen in the auricular surface of the pelvic bones. The auricular surface where the sacroiliac joint articulates seen in females generally has a rougher texture compared to the surfaces seen in males. This difference in the texture of the articulating surface may be due to the differences in shape of the sacrum between males and females. These key differences can be examined and used to determine biological sex between two different sets of pelvic bones; all due to the need for bipedal locomotion while having the need for childbearing and childbirth in females. = Adaptations to ensure live birth = Early human ancestors, hominids, originally gave birth in a similar way that non-human primates do because early obligate quadrupedal individuals would have retained similar skeletal structure to great apes. Most non-human primates today have neonatal heads that are close in size to the mother's birth canal, as evidenced by observing female primates who do not need assistance in birthing, often seeking seclusion away from others of their species. In modern humans, parturition (childbirth) differs greatly from the rest of the primates because of both pelvic shape of the mother and neonatal shape of the infant. Further adaptations evolved to cope with bipedalism and larger craniums were also important such as neonatal rotation of the infant, shorter gestation length, assistance with birth, and a malleable neonatal head.  Neonatal rotation  Neonatal rotation was a solution for humans evolving larger brain sizes. Comparative zoological analysis has shown that the size of the human brain is anomalous, as humans have brains that are significantly larger than other animals of our proportions. Even among the great apes, we are distinctive in this regard, having brains 3 to 4 times larger than those of chimpanzees, our nearest relatives. Although the close correspondence between the neonatal cranium and the maternal pelvis in monkeys is also characteristic of humans, the orientation of the pelvic diameters differs. On average, a human fetus is nearly twice as large in relation to its mother's weight as would be expected for another similarly sized primate. The extremely close correspondence between the fetal head and the maternal pelvic dimensions requires that these dimensions line up at all points (inlet, midplane, and outlet) during the birth process. During delivery, neonatal rotation occurs when the body gets rotated to align head and shoulders transversely when entering the small pelvis, otherwise known as internal rotation. The fetus then rotates longitudinally to exit the birth canal, which is known as external rotation. In humans, the long axes of the inlet and the outlet of the obstetric canal lie perpendicular to each other. This is an important mechanism because growth in the size of the cranium as well as the width of the shoulders makes it more difficult for the infant to fit through the pelvis. This enables the largest dimensions of the fetal head to align with the largest dimensions of each plane of the maternal pelvis as labor progresses. This differs in non-human primates as there is no need for neonatal rotation in non-human primates because the birth canal is wide enough to accommodate the infant. This elaborate mechanism of labor, which requires a constant readjustment of the fetal head in relation to the bony pelvis (and which may vary somewhat depending on the shape of the pelvis in question), is completely different from the obstetrical mechanics of the other higher primates whose infants generally drop through the pelvis without any rotation or realignment. In contrast to the narrow shoulders of monkeys and higher primates, which are able to pass through the birth canal without any rotation, modern humans have broad, rigid shoulders, which generally require the same series of rotations that the head undergoes in order to travel through. Due to the evolution of bipedalism in humans, the pelvis had evolved to have a shorter, more forward curved ilium and broader sacrum in order to support ambulating on two legs. This caused the birth canal to shrink and form a more oval shape, thus the infant must undergo specific movements to rotate itself in a certain position to be able to pass through the pelvis. These movements are referred as the ‚Äúseven cardinal movements,‚Äù which the infant rotates itself at the widest diameter of the pelvis to allow for the narrowest aspect of the fetal body to alight with the narrowest diameter of the pelvic. These movements include engagement, descent, flexion, internal rotation, extension, external rotation, and expulsion. # Engagement is the first movement of labor where the first part of the head enters the pelvic inlet. # Descent refers to the deeper movement of the head through the pelvic inlet with the widest diameter of the infant's head. # Flexion occurs during descent, where tissues of the pelvis create resistance as the head moves down the pelvic cavity and brings the infant's chin to the chest. This allows for the smallest part of the head to begin to push through pelvis and actively promote delivery of the baby. # Internal Rotation occurs when the head continues to descend and comes in contact with the pelvic floor, which has resistant muscles. These muscles allow for the infant to rotate their head to allow their head and shoulders to move through the pelvic. Due to the broad shape of the sacrum, the head of the fetus must be rotated from occiput transverse to occiput anterior position, which means the infant must rotate from the sideways position so the anterior head faces the buttock of the mother. # Extension is the point where the head moves past the pubic symphysis, where it has to curve underneath the birth canal while the anterior head still faces the mother's bottom. # External Rotation (or Restitution) occurs when the baby pauses after the head passes through the body. During this pause, the infant rotates itself sideways (facing the mother's thigh) to allow for the shoulder to fit though the birth canal. # Expulsion is the final step of labor. During this stage, the anterior shoulder moves past the birth canal first then the posterior shoulder. Once both shoulders are out, the baby is delivered through the birth canal completely. While the seven cardinal movements is considered the normal mechanism for labor and delivery of human babies, pelvic sizes and shapes can vary among female humans which can increase the risk of errors in rotations and delivery, especially since these moments are done completely by the baby. One of the biggest issues with the pelvic shape for childbirth is the Ischial spine. Since the ischial spines support the pelvic floor, if the spines are too far apart it can lead to a weakened pelvic floor muscles. This can cause issues as pregnancy progresses, such as difficulty carrying the fetus to full term. Another complication that can occur during human childbirth is shoulder dystocia, where the shoulder is stuck in the birth canal. This can lead to fractured humerus and clavicle of the fetus and hemorrhaging of the mother postpartum. Thus, these neonatal rotations are important in allowing the baby to safely pass through the pelvic and ensure the health of the mother as well.  Gestation length and altriciality  Gestation length in humans is believed to be shorter than most other primates of comparable size. The gestation length for humans is 266 days, or eight days short of nine months, which is counted from the first day of the woman's last menstrual period. During gestation, mothers must support the metabolic cost of tissue growth, both of the fetus and the mother, as well as the ever-increasing metabolic rate of the growing fetus. Comparative data from across mammals and primates suggest that there is a metabolic constraint on how large and energetically expensive a fetus can grow before it must leave the mother's body. It is thought that this shorter gestation period is an adaptation to ensure the survival of mother and child because it leads to altriciality. Neonatal brain and body size have increased in the hominin lineage, and human maternal investment is greater than expected for a primate of our body mass. The obstetrical dilemma hypothesis suggests that in order to successfully undergo childbirth, the infant must be born earlier and earlier, thereby making the child increasingly developmentally premature. The concept of the infant being born underdeveloped is called altriciality. Humans are born with an underdeveloped brain; only 25% of their brains fully developed at birth as opposed to non-human primates where the infant is born with 45‚Äì50% brain development.Trevathan, Wenda (2011). Human Birth: An Evolutionary Perspective. Aldine Transaction. Scientists have believed that the shorter gestation period can be attributed to the narrower pelvis, as the baby must be born before its head reaches a volume that cannot be accommodated by the obstetric canal.  Social assistance  Human infants are also almost always born with assistance from other humans because of the way that the pelvis is shaped. Since the pelvis and opening of birth canal face backwards, humans have difficulty giving birth themselves because they cannot guide the baby out of the canal. Non-human primates seek seclusion when giving birth because they do not need any help due to the pelvis and opening being more forward. Human infants depend on their parents much more and for much longer than other primates. Humans spend a lot of their time caring for their children as they develop whereas other species stand on their own from when they are born. The faster an infant develops, the higher the reproductive output of a female can be. So in humans, the cost of slow development of their infants is that humans reproduce relatively slowly. This phenomenon is also known as cooperative breeding.  Malleable cranium  Humans are born with a very malleable fetal head which is not fully developed when the infant exits the womb. This soft spot on the crown of the infant allows for the head to be compressed in order to better fit through the birth canal without obstructing it. This allows for the head to develop more after birth and for the cranium to continue growing without affecting the birthing process. Challenges to the obstetrical dilemma hypothesis The obstetrical dilemma hypothesis has had several challenges to it, as more data is collected and analyzed. Several different fields of study have taken an interest in understanding more about the human birth process and that of human ancestor species. = Early brain growth rates = Some studies have shown that higher brain growth rates happen earlier on in ontogeny than previously thought, which challenges the idea that the explanation of the obstetrical dilemma is that humans are born with underdeveloped brains. This is because if brain growth rates were largest in early development, that is when the brain size would increase the most. Premature birth would not allow for a much larger head size if most of the growth had already happened. Also, it has been suggested that maternal pelvic dimensions are sensitive to some ecological factors. = Maternal heat stress = There has been a lot of evidence linking body mass to brain mass, leading to the determination of maternal metabolism as a key factor in the growth of the fetus. Maternal constraints could be largely due to thermal stress or energy availability. A larger brain mass in the neonate corresponds to more energy needed to sustain it. It takes much more energy for the mother if the brain fully develops in the womb. If maternal energy is the limiting factor then an infant can only grow as much as the mother can sustain. Also, because fetal size is positively correlated to maternal energy use, thermal stress is an issue because the larger the fetus, the more the mother can suffer heat stress. = Environmental effects = Additional studies suggest that other factors may further complicate the obstetrical dilemma hypothesis. One of these is dietary shifts, possibly due to the emergence of agriculture. This can be both due to change in diet as well as the increase in population density since agriculture was developed; more people leads to more disease. Studies have also been done in twins to show that pelvic size may be due more to the environment in which they live than their genetics. Another study disproves the thought that narrower hips are optimized for locomotion because it was found that a Late Stone Age population Southern Africa that survived largely on terrestrial mobility had women who had uncharacteristically small body size with large pelvic canals. = Hormones = The pelvis has the most favorable morphology of the obstetric canal between ages 25 and 30. Given that those are the ages of highest fertility, it may indicate that sex-biased autosomal gene expression, regulated by sex-specific hormones and sensitivity of hormone receptors, may have a role in decreasing not just fertility, but also decreasing preferable morphology of the obstetric canal. As a woman ages, these sex hormones and receptors become less active, which will ultimately decrease fertility and preferable morphology of the obstetric canal. The human body will not remain in a specific morphological state if it does not need to maintain that state. = Energetics of gestation and growth hypothesis = The energetics of gestation and growth (EGG) hypothesis offers a direct challenge to the obstetrical dilemma hypothesis, equating the constraints on gestation and parturition to the energy restrictions of the mother. It has been shown in studies using professional athletes and pregnant women, that there is an upper limitation to the amount of energy a woman can produce before it causes deleterious effects: approximately 2.1x their basal metabolic rate. During pregnancy the growing brain mass and length in the neonate correspond to more energy needed to sustain it. This results in a competing balance between the fetus's demand for energy and the maternal ability to meet that demand. At approximately 9 months gestation, the fetus's energy needs surpasses the mother's energy limitation, correlating with the average time of birth. The newly born infant can then be sustained on breast milk, which is a more efficient, less energy demanding mechanism of nutrient transfer between mother and child. Additionally, this hypothesis demonstrates that, contrary to the obstetrical dilemma, an increased pelvic size would not be deleterious to bipedalism. Studying the running mechanics of males and females, it was shown that an increased pelvic size related to neither an increased metabolic nor structural demand on a woman. = Obstetrical dilemma revisited = The obstetrical dilemma hypothesis has also been challenged conceptually based on new studies. The authors argue that the obstetrical dilemma hypothesis assumes that human, and therefore hominid, childbirth has been a painful and dangerous experience through the species' evolution. This assumption may be fundamentally false as many early analyses focused on maternal death data from primarily females of European-descent in Western Europe and the United States during the 19th and 20th century, a limited population in a time of great change. The study suggests the increase in maternal mortality during this time period was not due to evolutionary limitations as the creators of the obstetrical dilemma hypothesis thought, but due to the increased use of medical intervention, the medicalization of pregnancy and childbirth and restrictive socio-cultural practices of the Victorian era. In a recent study a covariation between human pelvis shape, stature, and head size is reported. It is said that females with a large head possess a birth canal that can better accommodate large-headed neonates. Mothers with large heads usually give birth to neonates with large heads. Therefore, the detected pattern of covariation contributes to ease childbirth and has likely evolved in response to strong correlational selection.

A stem cutting produces new roots, and a root cutting produces new stems. Some plants can be grown from leaf pieces, called leaf cuttings, which produce both stems and roots. The scions used in grafting are also called cuttings.Propagation by Cuttings, Layering and Division Diane Relf, Extension Specialist, Environmental Horticulture; and Elizabeth Ball, Program Support Technician; Virginia Tech Propagating plants from cuttings is an ancient form of cloning.Reproduction and cloning BBC ¬© 2014 There are several advantages of cuttings, mainly that the produced offspring are practically clones of their parent plants. If a plant has favorable traits, it can continue to pass down its advantageous genetic information to its offspring. This is especially economically advantageous as it allows commercial growers to clone a certain plant to ensure consistency throughout their crops. The poet Theodore Roethke wrote about plant cuttings and root growth behavior in his poems \\"Cuttings\\" and \\"Cuttings (Later)\\" found in his book The Lost Son: And Other Poems.  Evolutionary advantage: Succulents  Cuttings are used as a method of asexual reproduction in succulent horticulture, commonly referred to as vegetative reproduction. A cutting can also be referred to as a propagule. Succulents have evolved with the ability to use adventitious root formation in reproduction to increase fitness in stressful environments. Succulents grow in shallow soils, rocky soils, and desert soils. Seedlings from sexual reproduction have a low survival rate; however, plantlets from the excised stem cuttings and leaf cuttings, broken off in the natural environment, are more successful. Cuttings have both water and carbon stored and available, which are resources needed for plant establishment. The detached part of the plant remains physiologically active, allowing mitotic activity and new root structures to form for water and nutrient uptake. Asexual reproduction of plants is also evolutionarily advantageous as it allows plantlets to be better suited to their environment through retention of epigenetic memory, heritable patterns of phenotypic differences that are not due to changes in DNA but rather histone modification and DNA methylation. Epigenetic memory is heritable through mitosis, and thus advantageous stress response priming is retained in plantlets from excised stem.  Physiology  Adventitious root formation refers to roots that form from any structure of a plant that is not a root; these roots can form as part of normal development or due to a stress response. Adventitious root formation from the excised stem cutting is a wound response. At a molecular level when a cutting is first excised at the stem there is an immediate increase in jasmonic acid, known to be necessary for adventitious root formation. When the cutting is excised from the original root system the root inhibiting hormones, cytokinin and strigolactone, which are made in the root and transported to the stem, decrease in concentration. Polyphenol degradation decreases, increasing auxin concentration. The increased auxin concentration increases nitric oxide concentration which initiates root formation through a MAPK signal cascade and a cGMP-dependent pathway that both regulate mitotic division and are both necessary for the initiation of adventitious root formation. The root primordia form from cambial cells in the stem. In propagation of detached succulent leaves and leaf cuttings, the root primordia typically emerges from the basal callous tissue after the leaf primordia emerges. It was known as early as 1935 that when indolyl-3-acetic acid (IAA), also known as auxin, is applied to the stem of root cuttings, there is an increase the average number of adventitious roots compared to cuttings that are not treated. Researchers also applied this compound to stems without leaves that normally would not have any root formation and found that auxin induced root formation, thus determining auxin is necessary for root formation. Identification of this hormone has been important to industries that rely on vegetative propagation, as it is sometimes applied to fresh cuttings to stimulate root growth.  Technique  Softwood cuttings of elm (Ulmus) are kept under a water mist to prevent them from drying out while they form roots. Cuttings from a variety of plants. Some plants form roots much more easily than others. Stem cuttings from woody plants are treated differently, depending on the maturity of the wood: *Softwood cuttings come from stems that are rapidly expanding, with young leaves. In many species, such cuttings form roots relatively easily. *Semi- hardwood cuttings come from stems that have completed elongation growth and have mature leaves. *Hardwood cuttings come from fully matured stems, and are often propagated while dormant. Most plant cuttings are stem pieces, and have no root system of their own, and are therefore likely to die from dehydration if the proper conditions are not met. They require a moist medium, which, however, cannot be too wet lest the cutting rot. A number of media are used in this process, including but not limited to soil, perlite, vermiculite, coir, rock wool, expanded clay pellets, and even water given the right conditions. Most succulent cuttings can be left in open air until the cut surface dries, which may improve root formation when the cutting is later planted. In temperate countries, stem cuttings may be taken of soft (green or semi-ripe) wood and hard wood, which have specific differences in practice. Certain conditions lead to more favorable outcomes for cuttings; timing, size, location on the plant, and amount of foliage are all important. Stem cuttings of young wood should be taken in spring from the upper branches, while cuttings of hardened wood should be taken in winter from the lower branches. Common bounds on the length of stem cuttings are between for soft wood and between for hard wood. Soft wood cuttings do best when about two thirds of the foliage are removed, while hard wood stem cuttings need complete foliage removal. The cut needs to be done either immediately below a node, or up to 1/2 inch below a node. Ficus cuttings rooting in water Besides placing the cuttings directly into soil, it is also possible to root cuttings in water. The water needs to be replaced often, to prevent bacteria buildup and the possibility of root rot. It also requires enough oxygen in the water for the same reason. A moist atmosphere (use of plastic sheeting) is hence not needed with this technique. The environment for softwood and semi-hardwood cuttings is generally kept humid‚Äîoften attained by placing the cuttings under a plastic sheet or in another confined space where the air can be kept moist‚Äîand in partial shade to prevent the cutting from drying out. Cuttings in the medium are typically watered with a fine mist to avoid disturbing the plants. Following the initial watering, the aim is to keep the soil moist but not wet or waterlogged; the medium is allowed to almost dry out before misting again. A rooting hormone may be administered to \\"encourage\\" growth and can increase the success rate of plant growth. Though not essential, several compounds may be used to promote the formation of roots through the signaling activity of plant hormone auxins. Among the commonly used chemicals is indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) used as a powder, liquid solution, or gel. This compound is applied either to the cut tip of the cutting or as a foliar spray. Rooting hormone can be manufactured naturally, such as soaking the yellow-tipped shoots of a weeping willow tree in water, or by preparing a tea from the bark of a willow tree. Shoots or bark do better when soaked for 24 hours prior to using. The extract obtained from the crushing of leaves and bulbs of coco-grass (Cyperus rotundus) is used as an excellent rooting of cuttings and seedlings of various plant species.YAMASHITA, Oscar Mitsuo et al.

Key: eq.:equinox, sol.: solstice, HW: hardwood, SR: semi-ripe, SW: softwood. Many vegetative parts of a plant can be used. The most common methods are: * Stem cuttings, in which a piece of stem is part buried in the soil, including at least one leaf node. The cutting is able to produce new roots, usually at the node. * Root cuttings, in which a section of root is buried just below the soil surface, and produces new shoots. * Scion cuttings are used in grafting. * Leaf cuttings, in which a leaf is placed on moist soil. These have to develop both new stems and new roots. Some leaves will produce one plant at the base of the leaf. In some species, multiple new plants can be produced at many places on one leaf, and these can be induced by cutting the leaf veins. The leaf cutting method is commonly used with succulents. Although some species, such as willow, blackberry and pelargoniums can be grown simply by placing a cutting into moist ground, the majority of species require more attention. Most species require humid, warm, partially shaded conditions to strike, thus requiring the approach above to be followed. Particularly difficult species may need cool air above and warm soil. In addition, with many more difficult cuttings, one should use the type of cutting that has the most chance of success with that particular plant species.  Improving results  A plastic cold frame with semi-white plastic, used to keep the cuttings humid and semi-shaded There are ways of improving the growth of stem cutting propagations. Intensifying light allows cuttings to root and sprout faster, though the heat thus generated could cause the propagation material distress. Azalea cuttings can be mildly heated in water to disinfect it from the fungus pathogen Rhizoctonia, and this could potentially be used for other plants. = Providing the right soil = Depending on the type of cutting (i.e. tree, shrub, succulent, cacti, ...) different potting soil mixes can be used. Many commercial companies sell medium specifically for growing cuttings. = Providing the right air and soil humidity = Although several options can be used here, usually plastic is used to cover the softwood and semi-hardwood cuttings. The soil below the trays (to increase air moisture) and the soil in the tray themselves is kept moist but not waterlogged (=completely saturated). The trays the cuttings sit in are best placed on stones to prevent capillary action (as this can keep the soil inside the trays too wet). Soil in the trays should be kept at 85 to 95% saturation. Automated (overhead) misting systems, boom systems or fog systems can be used in greenhouses. A typical misting frequency during sticking and callusing includes misting for 5-8 seconds every 5-10 minutes over a 24-hour period. After 3 to 4 days, misting is reduced to 3-5 seconds every 10-20 minutes during the day and less frequently at night. When roots become visible (stage 3) misting can be reduced, and by stage 4 (toning), little to no misting should be done (by day 10 to 14 for most species). When using plastic tents, far less misting is needed (once or twice a day). The greenhouse or cold frame should be ventilated once and a while to prevent formation of molds (manually). = Providing the right air and soil temperature = Air temperature for softwood and semi-hardwood cuttings is optimal at around 70¬∞ Fahrenheit (21,1¬∞ Celsius) but temperatures as low as 55¬∞ Fahrenheit (12,7¬∞ Celsius) are acceptable. Heating the air above 75¬∞ Fahrenheit (23,8¬∞ Celsius) stimulates the growth of pathogens. Ventilating (manually or through or through automatic window openers) the greenhouse or cold frame can lower the air temperature. Automated thermostat systems can also be used in greenhouses to keep the heat at a specific temperature. Bottom heating (soil) tends to be ideal for root initiation since growing media temperature is best maintained at 20-22¬∞ Celsius. =Providing the right amount of sunlight= Whereas cuttings need to be kept warm and some amount of light needs to be provided, it needs to be kept out of direct sunlight. Some ways to accomplish this include using white wash, semi-white plastic, retractible shade curtains (which can be deployed if the sun temporarily pierces through), ... Optimum light levels are around 120 to 200 ¬µmol/m¬≤s at the first stage (sticking). Once callus has been formed (stage 2: callusing) and roots start to form and take up water (stage 3: root development phase), light intensity levels can be gradually increased (to 200 to 800 ¬µmol/m¬≤s). Most propagators find that 5 to 10 moles per day (i.e. observed using a Daily Light Integral sensor) will result in a consistent rooting and growth Plant species that allow propagation from cuttings Plants which can be propagated from stem, leaf and/or tip cuttings include:Propagating Foliage & Flowering Plants Inch Plants can be moved easily as its stolons cling lightly to the ground. Pelargonium x hortorum (garden geraniums) are propagated by seeds and cuttings. Nerium can readily root after being placed in water or in compost. A succulent, Echeveria derenbergii is propagated by producing a colony of small offsets which can be separated from the parent plant. Aptenia cordifolia can easily reproduce from cuttings of the developed stems, roots, and even from its own buried leaves. Coleus is easily propagated from stem cuttings readily in plain water, without the addition of rooting hormone. Cape Ivy is propagated from stem cuttings. Snake plants are propagated by leaf cuttings or by dividing the rhizome. common grapevine is propagated from a shoot taken from a mother vine. *African violet ‚Äì tip or leaf cutting *Aglaonema ‚Äì tip cuttings *Aeonium ‚Äì stem cuttings *Aizoaceae ‚Äì stem and tip cuttings *Alternanthera ‚Äì stem cuttings *Aucuba ‚Äì stem cuttings *Azalea ‚Äì stem cuttings *Baby's tears ‚Äì stem cuttings *Begonia ‚Äì tip, leaf and stem cuttings *Blackberries ‚Äì stem cuttings *Brugmansia ‚Äì stem cuttings *Bryophyllum ‚Äì leaf or cuttings *Cactus ‚Äì leaf cuttings *Calathea ‚Äì tip cuttings *Callisia ‚Äì stem cuttings *Cannabis ‚Äì stem and tip cuttings *Christmas cactus ‚Äì tip cuttings *Citrus ‚Äì tip cuttings *Coleus ‚Äì tip cuttings *Cordyline ‚Äì tip or stem cuttings *Cotyledon ‚Äì stem or leaf cuttings *Crepe myrtle ‚Äì stem cuttings *Curio repens ‚Äì stem or leaf cuttings *Common purslane ‚Äì stem cuttings *Croton ‚Äì tip cuttings *Crassula ‚Äì stem or leaf cuttings *Dieffenbachia ‚Äì tip cuttings *Dracaena ‚Äì stem cuttings *Dudleya ‚Äì leaf or stem cuttings *Echeveria ‚Äì leaf cuttings *Euphorbia ‚Äì leaf or steam cuttings *Ficus ‚Äì tip or stem cuttings *Forsythia ‚Äì stem cuttings *Geranium ‚Äì tip cuttings *Golden pothos ‚Äì tip or stem cuttings *Gibasis ‚Äì stem cuttings *Grape ivy ‚Äì tip cuttings or stem cuttings *Graptopetalum ‚Äì leaf or stem cuttings *Grevillea ‚Äì stem cuttings *Haworthia ‚Äì leaf or stem cuttings *Hedera ‚Äì stem cuttings *Hibiscus ‚Äì stem cuttings *Hoya ‚Äì tip cuttings *Hops ‚Äì stem cuttings *Impatiens ‚Äì tip cuttings *Ipomoea ‚Äì stem cuttings *Jasmine ‚Äì stem cutting *Kalanchoe ‚Äì leaf or stem cuttings *Kleinia ‚Äì stem cutting *Kumquat ‚Äì stem cutting *Lemon balm ‚Äì stem cuttings *Maranta ‚Äì tip cuttings *Marjoram ‚Äì stem cuttings *Manioc (cassava) ‚Äì stem cuttings *Monstera ‚Äì tip cuttings *Mint ‚Äì stem cuttings *Morus ‚Äì stem cuttings *Oleander ‚Äì stem cuttings *Oregano ‚Äì stem cuttings *Othonna capensis ‚Äì stem cuttings *Parsley ‚Äì stem cuttings *Pelargonium ‚Äì tip cuttings *Peperomia ‚Äì tip or leaf cuttings *Philodendron ‚Äì tip and stem cuttings *Pilea cadierei ‚Äì tip cuttings *Pineapple ‚Äì stem cuttings *Plectranthus ‚Äì stem cuttings *Podocarpus ‚Äì tip cuttings *Poinsettia ‚Äì stem cuttings *Portulacaria ‚Äì stem cuttings *Plum ‚Äì stem cuttings *Poplar ‚Äì stem cuttings *Red-hot cat tail ‚Äì stem cuttings *Resurrection plant ‚Äì tip cuttings *Rosemary ‚Äì stem cuttings *Sage ‚Äì stem cuttings *Sansevieria ‚Äì leaf cuttings *Sedum ‚Äì leaf cuttings *Schefflera ‚Äì stem or stem cuttings *Senecio angulatus ‚Äì stem cuttings *Senecio crassissimus ‚Äì stem or tip cuttings *Senecio haworthii ‚Äì stem or tip cuttings *Sugar cane ‚Äì stem cuttings *Syngonium ‚Äì stem cuttings *String of hearts ‚Äì stem cuttings *Syringa ‚Äì stem cuttings *Tea ‚Äì stem cuttings *Shrimp plant ‚Äì tip cuttings *Thyme ‚Äì stem cuttings *Tetradenia riparia ‚Äì stem cuttings *Tradescantia ‚Äì stem cuttings *Vanilla ‚Äì stem cuttings *Verbena ‚Äì stem cuttings *Willow ‚Äì stem cutting *Vitis ‚Äì stem cuttings, grafting, aerial layering *Yucca ‚Äì stem cuttings To note, some plants listed above, such as Coleus, Maranta, Nerium and Golden Pothos, among others, may require water for them to root before they can be transplanted to soil.

It is the fictionalised account of \\"the events relating to the last flight of an RAF Bomber over Germany on the night of June 31st, 1943\\", a deliberately impossible date, in which an RAF bombing raid on the Ruhr area of western Germany goes wrong. In each chapter, the plot is advanced by seeing the progress of the day through the eyes of protagonists on both sides of the conflict. Bomber was the first novel to be written on a word processor, the IBM MT/ST. Plot summary Sam Lambert is an experienced RAF Bomber Command Avro Lancaster pilot based in East Anglia. He has flown almost fifty bombing missions over Germany as part of the Combined Bomber Offensive since the start of the war. As Lambert nears his tour's end, he is developing signs of exhaustion. Lambert is an accomplished cricketer and the station commander needs his participation to assure victory against a rival. Lambert's refusals to do so causes his flight commander, an ambitious and unscrupulous flight lieutenant, to force him out of flying by replacing Lambert's best crewmen with poor performers. At the same time, his crew revere him and believe that he is the one factor that will ensure their survival. Across the North Sea, Oberleutnant Victor L√∂wenherz, a Junkers Ju 88 night fighter pilot who intercepts RAF bombers in Defence of the Reich, dislikes the uncouth Nazi barbarians who rule the Fatherland. Fellow pilot Unteroffizier Christian Himmel is outraged to learn that Luftwaffe doctors are participating in Nazi human experimentation on concentration camp inmates. Himmel steals the results from an experiment and sends copies to other officers including Hermann G√∂ring; he is sure that the Reichsmarschall will stop such disgraces to the air force's honour once he learns of them, although L√∂wenherz doubts that that will happen. Near the Dutch border, people in the small German market town of Altgarten are aware of the war's progress but have not been bombed, unlike Cologne and other large cities in the heavily industrialized Ruhr. Oberleutnant August Bach commands a Freya radar unit on the Dutch coastline that tracks British bomber streams on their night-time raids against Germany. A highly decorated World War I veteran who voluntarily serves as a lower-ranked officer away from the front lines, he is a widower with an older son on the Eastern front. While briefly visiting his home in Altgarten, Bach proposes marriage to the young Faith and Beauty Society member who cares for his younger son. In Altgarten, the B√ºrgermeister finalises preparations for his own birthday banquet, at a restaurant in the medieval town square. While the town's hospital treats war injuries, and its TENO (Technische Nothilfe or \\"Civil Defence\\") engineers often work in the Ruhr and have experience with air raids, the fire department does not have such experience. The RAF is organising a large raid on Krefeld in the Ruhr. The bomber crews relax and prepare for the ordeal. The men, their planes, weapons, responsibilities, attitudes, thoughts, and fears are described in great detail. There are frequent references to weather conditions, meteorological phenomena, and forecasts that add to the foreboding in the plot. The bombs are loaded into the Lancasters, the German radars \\"warm up\\", and the fighter pilots adjust their night vision. Superstitions, rites, and rituals are respected as the combatants ready themselves. The British bomber stream forms up and avoids known flak concentrations and searchlight batteries. Despite the meticulous planning, things go wrong immediately: A Lancaster almost crashes on take-off; a Ju 88 crashes into the sea after a bird strike over the IJsselmeer; another is shot down by a friendly flak-ship. As German radar tracks the bombers, tiny pieces of shrapnel from an 88mm anti-aircraft shell destroy Lancasters, each costing more than ¬£42,000 ($ in ). A pathfinder Mosquito is downed and the marker bombs it is carrying explode southeast of Altgarten; with little flak and clear bombing conditions, Christmas Tree marker pyrotechnics are placed over the wrong target. Creepback causes the carpet bombing of a town of 5,000 inhabitants by a force designed for a city. The raid's two waves cause a firestorm that destroys Altgarten; many of the main characters on both sides die or lose those close to them. Despite the attack completely missing its industrial target no one is punished for the failure, but Himmel and Lambert are executed and demoted, respectively, for non-combat reasons. The book ends with an epilogue which gives details of the post-raid lives of the major characters. Viewpoints * The crew of RAF Lancaster bomber, nicknamed \\"Creaking Door\\", particularly its pilot, Flight Sergeant Sam Lambert * August Bach, the commanding officer of a Luftwaffe radar station on the Dutch coast * Oberleutnant Victor L√∂wenherz, an aristocratic Luftwaffe night fighter pilot and his fellow crew members * Bach's housekeeper/mistress, Anna-Luisa, and his young son, Hansl, at their home in Altgarten, a small German village close to the Dutch border * Altgarten's burgomaster, fire chief, civil defence (TENO) engineers and various residents Legacy Bomber is highly regarded by some critics. Anthony Burgess, in Ninety-nine Novels, cited it as one of the 99 best novels in English since 1939. In 1979 Mot√∂rhead frontman, Lemmy, dedicated the band's third album Bomber to Len Deighton, as it was his novel that had inspired the title track. Bomber was announced, on 1 February 2010, as one of twenty-one titles longlisted for the \\"Lost Man Booker Prize\\" of 1970, a contest delayed by 40 years because a reshuffling of the fledgeling competition's rules that year disqualified nearly a year's worth of high- quality fiction from consideration. The book did not make the shortlist. Adaptation In 1995 the BBC's Radio 4 broadcast a \\"real time\\" dramatisation of Deighton's documentary novel Bomber, covering the novel's action following RAF Lancaster bomber O-Orange's take-off in 1943, life in the German town that was its allocated target, the bombing raid and the plane's return at night. The drama threaded through the station's unchangeable schedule of news and current affairs from early morning to midnight. It starred Tom Baker as the narrator, Frank Windsor as Air Marshal Harris, Samuel West as Lambert, Emma Chambers and Jack Shepherd and told how the raid had \\"changed the lives\\" of many men and women - British and German. It was repeated on Radio 4 Extra on Armistice Day 2011.

Originally a part of the Yellowstone Timberland Reserve, the forest is managed by the United States Forest Service and was created by an act of Congress and signed into law by U.S. President Benjamin Harrison in 1891. Shoshone National Forest is one of the first nationally protected land areas anywhere. Native Americans have lived in the region for at least 10,000 years, and when the region was first explored by European adventurers, forestlands were occupied by several different tribes.

Shoshone National Forest is a part of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, a nearly unbroken expanse of federally protected lands encompassing an estimated .

Yellowstone National Park forms part of the boundary to the west; south of Yellowstone, the Continental Divide separates the forest from its neighbor Bridger-Teton National Forest to the west. The eastern boundary includes privately owned property, lands managed by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management and the Wind River Indian Reservation, which belongs to the Shoshone and Arapahoe Indians. Custer National Forest along the Montana border is on the northern frontier. The Oregon Trail, the 19th century covered wagon route, passes just south of the forest, where broad and gentle South Pass allowed the migrants to bypass the rugged mountains to the north. Shoshone National Forest has virtually all the original animal and plant species that were there when white explorers such as John Colter and Jim Bridger first visited the region. The forest is home to the Grizzly bear, cougar, moose, tens of thousands of elk as well as the largest herd of bighorn sheep in the U.S. The streams in the forest are considered to have some of the best game species fishing opportunities in the U.S. including Yellowstone cutthroat trout. More than 1,300 miles of hiking trails, 32 campgrounds and adjacent forests and parklands provide numerous recreational opportunities. There are four wilderness areas within the forest, protecting more than half of the managed land area from development. From sagebrush plains through dense spruce and fir forest to craggy mountain peaks, Shoshone National Forest has a rich biodiversity rarely matched in any protected area.  Human history  Shoshone encampment in the Wind River Mountains of Wyoming, photographed by W. H. Jackson, 1870 Shoshone National Forest is named after the Shoshone Indians, who, along with other Native American groups such as the Lakota, Crow and Northern Cheyenne, were the major tribes encountered by the first white explorers into the region. Archeological evidence suggests that the presence of Indian tribes in the area extends back at least 10,000 years. The forest provided an abundance of game meat, wood products, and shelter during the winter months from the more exposed high plains to the east. Portions of the more mountainous regions were frequented by the Shoshone and Sioux for spiritual healing and vision quests. By the early 1840s, Washakie had become the leader of the easternmost branch of the Shoshone Indians. At the Fort Bridger Treaty Council of 1868 Washakie negotiated with the U.S. Government for ) to be preserved as tribal lands. Subsequent amendments to the treaty reduced the actual acreage to approximately and is known today as the Wind River Indian Reservation. In 1957, Mummy Cave was rediscovered by a local resident on the north side of the North Fork Shoshone River, adjacent to U.S. Routes 14/16/20, east of Yellowstone National Park. Subsequent archeological excavations in the 1960s produced evidence that the cave had been occupied for over 9,000 years. The oldest deposits in the cave yielded prismatic stone blades and other artifacts created by paleoindians and the surrounding soils were radiocarbon dated to 7,300 BC. The evidence indicates the cave was occupied from at least 7280 BC to 1580 AD. Besides projectile points, the cave also produced well preserved feathers, animal hides and other usually perishable materials. Additionally, the mummified remains of an individual buried inside a rock cairn were unearthed, which were dated to 800 AD. Considered one of the finest paleoindian archeological assemblages in the Rocky Mountain region, the site was placed on the National Register of Historic Places list in 1981. Wapiti Ranger Station In the early 19th century, the forest was visited by mountain men and explorers such as John Colter and Jim Bridger. Colter is the first white man known to have visited both the Yellowstone region and the forest, which he did between 1807 and 1808. Having been an original member of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, Colter requested permission from Meriwether Lewis to leave the expedition after it had finished crossing the Rocky Mountains during their return journey from the Pacific Ocean. Colter teamed up with two unaffiliated explorers the expedition had encountered, but soon thereafter decided to explore regions south of where his new partners wished to venture. Traveling first into the northeastern region of what is today Yellowstone National Park, Colter then explored the Absaroka Mountains, crossing over Togwotee Pass and entering the valley known today as Jackson Hole. Colter survived a grizzly bear attack and a pursuit by a band of Blackfeet Indians who had taken his horse. The explorer later provided William Clark, who had been his commander on the Lewis and Clark Expedition, with previously unknown information on the regions he had explored, which Clark published in 1814. Travels by fur trappers and adventurers, such as Manuel Lisa and Jim Bridger from 1807 to 1840, completed the exploration of the region. With the decline of the fur trade in the late 1840s and much of the prized beaver long since made scarce by over-trapping, few white explorers entered the forest over the next few decades. The first federally financed expedition which passed through portions of Shoshone National Forest was the Raynolds Expedition of 1860, led by topographical engineer Captain William F. Raynolds. The expedition included geologist and naturalist Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden and was guided by mountain man Jim Bridger. Though the Raynolds Expedition was focused on exploration of the Yellowstone region, several efforts to enter what later became Yellowstone National Park were impeded by heavy snows across the mountain passes such as Two Ocean Pass. The expedition finally crossed the northern Wind River Range at a pass they named Union Pass and entered Jackson Hole valley to the south of Yellowstone. Hayden led another expedition through the region in 1871. Hayden was primarily interested in documenting the Yellowstone country west of the forest, but his expedition also established that the forest was a prime resource that merited protection. Travels in the forest in the 1880s by later U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt, who was also a strong advocate of land conservation, as well as by General Philip Sheridan, provided the impetus that subsequently established the Yellowstone Timberland Reserve in 1891, creating the first national forest in the U.S. Wolf mine shaft at abandoned gold mine In 1902, President Roosevelt first greatly expanded the reserve and then divided the reserve into four separate units, with Shoshone being the largest. Upon the creation of the U.S. Forest Service in 1905, the reserve was designated a National Forest, but the current wording and title were formulated forty years later in 1945. A remnant of the earliest years of the forest management is the Wapiti Ranger Station which is located west of Cody, Wyoming. The station was built in 1903 and is the oldest surviving ranger station in any national forest, and is now designated a National Historic Landmark. Prior to the establishment of the Wind River Indian Reservation, the U.S. Cavalry constructed Fort Brown on the reservation lands, which was subsequently renamed Fort Washakie. During the late 19th century, the fort was staffed by African-American members of the U.S. Cavalry, better known as the Buffalo Soldiers, including the second African-American graduated from the United States Military Academy, John Hanks Alexander. Chief Washakie is buried at the fort, which is located immediately east of the forest boundary. Rumor has it that Sacajawea, the Shoshone Indian who provided invaluable assistance to Meriwether Lewis and William Clark during the Lewis and Clark Expedition, is also buried here, but it is now considered that this is unlikely and that her actual burial place was Fort Lisa in North Dakota. During the last decade of the 19th century, minerals such as gold were mined with limited success. The last mine was abandoned in 1907, but panning for gold is still allowed in many areas of the forest, and in most circumstances no permit is required. After the end of the mining era, numerous camps were established by the Civilian Conservation Corps to help combat unemployment during the Great Depression of the 1930s. The camps housed groups of unemployed men who were paid by the federal government to build roads, hiking trails, and campgrounds for future travelers to the Yellowstone region. Visitation to national forests like Shoshone increased dramatically after World War II with the advent of better roads and accessibility to the region.  Forest management  Shoshone National Forest highlighted in light green Shoshone National Forest is managed by the U.S. Forest Service, an agency within the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The forest is separated into five districts and from 2008 and 2012 had an average staff of 165 employees and an annual operating budget of $17,500,000. The headquarters and a visitor center are in Cody, Wyoming and a smaller information center is in Lander, Wyoming. There are local ranger district offices in Cody, Dubois and Lander. Shoshone National Forest practices conservation of resources, which ensures a sustainable flow of some raw materials from the forest, such as lumber for construction purposes and wood pulp for paper products. The forest averages an annual harvest of 4.5 million board-feet of timber for the purposes of commercial log home construction and another 2.5 million board-feet of wood collection from dead and down trees that are used for firewood and poles. Additionally, low-scale mineral extraction and oil and gas exploration and recovery are also conducted, though in Shoshone National Forest this has become less common due to a consensus to protect the natural surroundings. Only of oil and gas leases were filed as of 2013. More common than logging and mining are the lease options that are offered to ranchers to allow them to graze cattle and sheep. The U.S. Forest Service provides guidelines and enforces environmental regulations to ensure that resources are not overexploited and that necessary commodities are available for future generations, though conservation groups have voiced concerns over the management practices of the leasing program and especially cattle overgrazing problems. Leases for sheep grazing have declined considerably since the 1940s while cattle grazing has remained relatively constant.  Natural resources  = Flora = A grove of quaking aspen and lodgepole pine in the spring Shoshone National Forest is an integral part of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, which has 1,700 documented species of plants. Since the elevation of the land in the forest ranges from , which is more than , the forest has a wide variety of ecosystems. Lower elevations often have sagebrush and grass- dominated vegetation types, while forested areas are dominated by various combinations of tree and shrub species. These include lodgepole pine, which along with Rocky Mountain juniper, and quaking aspen are found at elevations up to . At higher elevations subalpine fir, Engelmann spruce, whitebark pine and limber pine, are common, each occurring up to timberline. The region above timberline makes up 25 percent of the total acreage of the forest and of that 13 percent is listed as just either barren, rock or ice. The types of plant species is highly dependent on the amount of water available, and trees are more commonly found on higher slopes due to the longer lasting snowfall which keeps the soil moister for a longer time into the summer months. Along lower elevation riparian corridors, cottonwoods and willows are typically dominant. Numerous plant species are endemic to the region including some that are rare. Among them, the whitlow grass, fremont bladderpod, shoshonea, and the north fork Easter daisy provide vivid white and yellow flowers during the spring and summer. Exotic species of flora that are not native to the region include Canada thistle, Musk thistle, Spotted knapweed, Leafy spurge and Yellow toadflax. These non-native plant species are considered noxious, impacting native plant communities and the species that thrive on them. Native species such as the mountain pine beetle are having an enormous negative impact on some tree species. A survey of the forest performed in 2010 indicated that over of timberland had been impacted by insects such as the mountain pine beetle, spruce bark beetle and Douglas fir beetle, and that the insects had killed between 25 and 100 percent of the trees in the impacted areas. The forest service is addressing the situation by performing controlled burns, selling dead trees as firewood, timber harvesting and spraying the highest value areas. = Fauna = Grizzly bear mother and cub Since the migration of the endangered gray wolf into Shoshone National Forest after the successful wolf reintroduction program in the Yellowstone region commenced in the mid-1990s, all of the known 70 mammal species that existed prior to white settlement still exist in the forest. Altogether, at least 335 species of wildlife call Shoshone National Forest their home, including the largest population of Bighorn sheep and one of the few locations Grizzly bears can still be found in the contiguous U. S.. At least 700 grizzly bears are believed to exist in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, which includes Shoshone National Forest, with approximately 125 grizzlies in the forest. The grizzly is listed as a threatened species by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and the forest is one of their last strongholds. For what are considered to be \\"nuisance bears\\", non-lethal traps are set to capture them so that they can be relocated to remote areas, away from civilization. In the case of the grizzly, each captured bear is tranquilized and then ear tagged with an identifying number. Each number is registered, and if the bear continues to return to areas where they pose a risk of imminent threat to human safety, they are exterminated. The grizzly recovery efforts implemented by federal agencies have often resulted in major disagreements with local landowners and surrounding municipalities. This situation occurs less frequently with the smaller and less aggressive black bear. An active management program, in conjunction with other National Forests and National Parks within the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, works cooperatively to maximize human safety and to ensure habitat protection for both species of endemic bears. Visitors are mandated to store their food in their vehicles or in steel containers found in campgrounds, and bear-proof trash receptacles are located in the front-country zones throughout the forest. In the backcountry, food must be stored some distance from campsites, and other related precautions are enforced to help prevent bad encounters. Bighorn Sheep Cougars and timber wolves are large apex predators that inhabit the forest. Since the 1990s wolf reintroduction program in Yellowstone National Park, wolves have migrated into the forest and established permanent packs. Approximately a dozen wolf packs totaling 70 individual wolves were documented in the forest in 2012. The wolf was delisted as endangered once their population levels had reached management objectives and limited hunting of wolves was permitted in the forest starting in 2012. Cougars are generally nocturnal and rarely seen but hunting of this species is also allowed in highly regulated harvests. Wolverines are rare and elusive so documentation is often only from their tracks. The Canada lynx was native to the forest, but no known populations may still exist due to the rarity of its primary food source, the Snowshoe hare. Shoshone National Forest is considered critical habitat for lynx recovery since the species is listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act and the forest is in their historical range. Other generally carnivorous mammals include coyote, bobcat, weasel, marten, ferret and badger. Omnivorous mammals such as the raccoon and skunk and herbivore mammal species such as the porcupine and pika, are common to the forest. The beaver is considered a species of special interest to Shoshone National Forest since its dam building activities improve habitat for numerous other species such as the moose, breeding waterfowl, various amphibians and other species dependent on a riparian environment. Native herbivores such as the moose are found in small numbers near waterways, especially at lower elevations. Moose populations in northwestern Wyoming and other areas of North America have been on the decline since the end of the 20th century, possibly due to a parasite. There were an estimated 739 moose in the forest in 2006 which is almost 300 fewer than there were 20 years earlier. Other ungulate species are much more common and there are over 20,000 elk (also known as wapiti) and 40,000 mule deer. Bighorn sheep and mountain goats inhabit the rocky terrain and highest elevations. During the winter, one of the largest bighorn sheep herds in the lower 48 states congregate in the region around Dubois, Wyoming; however, their numbers since 1990 have been diminished due to disease transmitted from contact with domesticated sheep and goats. An estimated 5,000 bighorn sheep are found throughout the forest and a small but stable population of 200 mountain goats reside in the northernmost portions of the forest. Bison and pronghorn antelope are two other ungulates that live on the forest and have sustainable populations. An estimated 300 species of birds are found in the forest at least part of the year. Bald eagle, peregrine falcon, Swainson‚Äôs hawk and the prairie falcon are birds of prey that are relatively common. Waterfowl such as Western grebe, Northern pintail, Great blue heron and Barrow‚Äôs goldeneye have stable populations and rare sightings of Trumpeter swans are reported. pheasant, ruffed grouse and wild turkey are widely distributed across the open sage lands. Harlequin duck and northern goshawk are generally rare but management plans were implemented to protect various habitats these two species frequent to try and increase their population numbers. Yellowstone cutthroat trout Fish found in Shoshone National Forest include at least six species and subspecies of trout including rainbow, brook and brown trout. The Yellowstone cutthroat trout is widespread throughout the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, but in the forest is mostly limited to the Shoshone River. The mountain whitefish is also found in the Shoshone River, while the burbot is found in two streams in the southern regions of the forest. There are more than a dozen species of reptiles in the forest including the venomous prairie rattlesnake which can be found at lower elevations. The western painted and the ornate box turtle are turtle species known to exist and about eight species of lizards such as the greater short-horned lizard have been documented. Amphibians such as the Columbia spotted frog and the boreal toad are considered species of concern because of their high susceptibility to disease, habitat loss and human introduced toxins. Boreal toads are found at elevations of between and the Columbia spotted frog can live at elevations as high as in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. Exotic species of fauna such as the zebra and quagga mussels and the New Zealand mud snail are invasive species that can greatly impact fish species. Though the mussel species are not known to be in Wyoming, several surrounding regions have reported them. The New Zealand mud snail has been found in the Shoshone River east of the forest. Forest managers have established a preventative program to try to keep these species from entering forest waterways. = Wilderness = Popo Agie Wilderness The forest contains four areas of pristine wilderness that have remained largely untouched by human activities such as mining, logging, and road and building construction. The four regions include the North Absaroka, Washakie, Fitzpatrick and Popo Agie Wildernesses. Additionally, a small portion of the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness extends into the extreme northwestern part of the forest, along the Montana border. In Shoshone National Forest, , constituting 56 percent of the forest is designated wilderness. The wilderness designation provides a much higher level of land protection and prohibits any alterations by man to the resource. The Wilderness Act of 1964 enhanced the protection status of remote and/or undeveloped land already contained within federally administered protected areas. Passage of the act ensured that no human improvements would take place aside from those already existing. The protected status in wilderness designated zones prohibits road and building construction, oil and mineral exploration or extraction, and logging, and also prohibits the use of motorized equipment, including even bicycles. The only manner in which people can enter wilderness areas is either on foot or horseback. Hunting and fishing are permitted in the wilderness, just as they are throughout the forest, provided those engaging in such activities have the proper licenses and permits. = Fire ecology = Dinwoody spot fire in 2001 Fire Management officials in Shoshone National Forest recognize that forest fires are a natural part of the ecosystem; however, this was not always the case. 20th century fire fighting efforts, especially in the first half of that century, emphasized quickly extinguishing all fires, as fire was seen as completely detrimental to a forest. In 1935, fire management officials established the 10 am rule for all fires on federal lands, which recommended aggressive attack on fires and to have them controlled by 10 am, the day after they are first detected. This was intended to prevent fires from remaining active into the afternoon when the rising temperatures and more turbulent air caused fires to expand and become more erratic. However, this policy led to an increase in fuels because fires were often extinguished before they had a chance to burn out dead and dying old growth. It was in a stand of old growth fir trees in Shoshone National Forest that the Blackwater fire of 1937 killed 15 fighters during a firestorm west of Cody, Wyoming. The fire was one of the deadliest in terms of forest firefighter deaths in U.S. history. Between the years 1970 and 2012, Shoshone National Forest averaged 25 fires annually, of which half were due to natural ignition from lightning, which accounted for 90 percent of the total acreage burned. The remaining acreage that burned was due to campfires that got out of control or from other causes. In Shoshone National Forest, the highest fire incidence is generally in the months of August and September. An average of burns annually, with the worst year in the past century being 1988, when burned from fires that had spread from the conflagration that engulfed Yellowstone National Park and the surrounding region. After the Yellowstone region fires of 1988, an effort to identify areas of similar fire potential was implemented. Fire managers at Shoshone National Forest work with a number of outside agencies to incorporate fire restrictions, fuels management, and a controlled burn plans to reduce the chances of a catastrophic fire. The dead and dying trees which have been killed by various species of bark beetle may have a great impact on future forest fires. Fire managers have stated the worst time for increased fire activity is 1‚Äì2 years after the trees are killed and then again after the trees have fallen many years later.  Geography and geology  Gannett Peak is the highest mountain in Wyoming and the forest. Shoshone National Forest borders Yellowstone National Park and Bridger-Teton National Forest to the west. The Continental Divide demarks the boundary between Shoshone and Bridger-Teton National Forests. Along the Montana border, Shoshone National Forest borders Custer National Forest to the north. Private property, property belonging to the state of Wyoming and lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management form the eastern boundaries. Lastly, the Wind River Indian Reservation also borders on the east, and bisects a smaller southern section which includes the Popo Agie Wilderness and the Washakie Ranger District. The altitude in the forest ranges from near Cody, Wyoming, to at the top of Gannett Peak, an elevation gain of over . Of the three major mountain ranges found in the forest, they are geologically distinct from each other. All of the mountains are a part of the Rocky Mountains. In the northern and central portions of the forest lie the Absaroka Mountains which were named after the Crow Indian tribe. The majority of the Absaroka Mountains are contained within the forest, with the highest peak being Francs Peak at . The peaks of the Absaroka are basaltic in origin, having been the result of volcanic activity estimated to have occurred 50 million years ago during the Eocene epoch. The rocks are composed of mostly andesite and breccias deposited for millions of years during volcanic events and are atop more ancient sedimentary rocks that are considered to have economically viable mineral wealth. Gold was mined from the slopes of Francs Peak between the years 1890 and 1915, and the small ghost town of Kirwin remains as a legacy of that period. Major tributaries of the Bighorn River, such as the Shoshone and Greybull Rivers, originate in the Absaroka Mountains. Important passes through the Absarokas include Sylvan Pass, which leads to the eastern entrance of Yellowstone National Park; and Togwotee Pass, which provides access to Jackson Hole and Grand Teton National Park. Beartooth Lake In the far north of Shoshone National Forest a small portion of the Beartooth Mountains are located north of the Clarks Fork of the Yellowstone River. The Beartooths are composed of Precambrian granitic rocks that are amongst the oldest found on Earth. Although often considered a part of the Absaroka Mountains, the Beartooths are distinct in appearance and geologic history. Uplifted approximately 70 million years ago during the Laramide orogeny, the Beartooths consist of vast windswept plateaus and rugged peaks with sheer cliff faces. The Beartooth Highway (U.S. Highway 212) crosses Beartooth Pass, and from there descends to the northeast entrance to Yellowstone National Park. Cirque of the Towers The Wind River Range is in the southern portion of the forest and is composed primarily of Precambrian granitic rock. Gannett Peak, the tallest mountain in Wyoming, is in the northern part of the range. Altogether eight peaks exceed and 119 rise at least above sea level. Fremont Peak, the second highest peak in the range, was originally believed to be the tallest mountain in the Rocky Mountains due to its prominence when viewed from the Oregon Trail by early pioneers. The Wind River Range is popular with mountain climbers because of its solid rock and variety of routes. The Cirque of the Towers in the Popo Agie Wilderness is one of the more popular climbing and hiking destinations, and an estimated 200 different climbing routes are located within the peaks that surround the cirque. There are over 500 lakes in the forest, and of streams and rivers. The Clarks Fork of the Yellowstone River is federally designated as a Wild and Scenic River for through the forest, with cliffs towering up to as the river winds through a gorge. The forest is on the eastern slopes of the Continental Divide, and the rivers flow into the Atlantic Ocean basin. = Glaciology = According to the U.S. Forest Service, Shoshone National Forest has the greatest number of glaciers of any National Forest in the Rocky Mountains. The forest recreation guide lists 16 named and 140 unnamed glaciers within the forest, all in the Wind River Range. Forty-four of these glaciers are in the Fitzpatrick Wilderness, centered around the highest mountain peaks. However, the state water board for Wyoming lists only 63 glaciers for the entire Wind River Range, which includes glaciers in adjacent Bridger-Teton National Forest. Researchers claim that for most of the period that glaciers have been known to exist in the forest, that they have been in a state of general retreat, with glacial mass losses of as much as 25 percent between the years 1985 and 2009. Reversing the growth of mid-latitude glaciers that occurred during the Little Ice Age (1350‚Äì1850), there has been a worldwide reduction of mountain glacial ice since, with some regions losing as much as 50 percent of their peak ice cover. This can be correlated by examining photographic evidence of glaciers taken over time even with an absence of other means of documentation. The behavior of the glaciers of Shoshone National Forest is consistent with this pattern. In one study of Dinwoody and Gannett Glaciers, during the period from 1958 to 1983, the thickness of these glaciers was reduced , respectively. Gannett Glacier on the slopes of Gannett Peak Gannett Glacier, on the northeast slope of Gannett Peak, is the largest single glacier in the U.S. Rocky Mountains. It has reportedly lost over 50 percent of its volume since 1920 with 25 percent of that occurring between the years 1980‚Äì1999. Upper Fremont Glacier has been studied more than any other glacier in the Wind River Range. Scientist have obtained ice cores from the Upper Fremont Glacier and found that there have been measurable changes in the atmosphere over the past several hundred years. The Upper Fremont Glacier and the Quelccaya Ice Cap in the Andes of South America both show nearly identical atmospheric records, which indicate a global linkage of atmospheric conditions over time. The small glaciers in the forest are less able to resist melting than the great ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica. Once a glacier begins retreating, it may fall into disequilibrium and be unable to find mass balance (accumulation versus melting rate) at any size. Without a favorable climate change, it will continue to retreat until it disappears. Loss of glacial ice already reduces the summer glacial runoff that supplies water to streams and lakes and provides a cold- water source vital to certain fish and plant species. This, in turn, may have a significant impact on the forest ecosystem over time.  Climate  Wyoming is an arid state, averaging of precipitation annually. However, Shoshone National Forest is located in and near some of the largest mountain ranges in the state, and consequently receives anywhere between annually. Higher elevations in the forest not only get more precipitation than lower elevations, but also have lower overall temperatures, with summertime highs around and lows near while lower elevations may be or warmer on average. Humidity levels throughout the forest are low, especially at higher altitudes. In the middle of the forest at the Wapiti Ranger Station, which is west of the forest headquarters in Cody, Wyoming, January high and low temperatures are , while the July highs and lows are . The annual precipitation at Wapiti is . Most of the precipitation falls in the winter and early spring, while summer is punctuated with widely scattered thunderstorms. The autumn is usually cool and dry. Due to the altitude and dryness of the atmosphere, vigorous radiative cooling occurs throughout the year, and exceptional daily temperature variances are not uncommon. Consequently, the nights range from very cool in the summer to extremely cold in the winter; therefore, visitors should always remember to bring along at least a jacket, even during the summer. Records indicate that the highest temperature ever recorded in the forest was in 1978, while the coldest was in 1972.  Recreation  Shoshone National Forest receives an average of over half a million visitors a year. Two visitor centers provide orientation, books, maps, and interpretive displays. One visitor center is at the Wapiti Wayside on the Buffalo Bill Cody Scenic Byway, west of Cody, Wyoming and adjacent to the historic Wapiti Ranger Station while the other visitor center is to the south in Lander, Wyoming. There are 30 vehicle access campgrounds in the forest, with up to 54 individual sites per campground. Approximately half of these campgrounds provide running water and restroom facilities and also provide for handicapped accessibility. Referred to as \\"front country\\" campgrounds, they also permit recreational vehicle access in most cases. All of the campgrounds are on a first come, first served basis although four campgrounds have sites that can be reserved in advance by contacting the National Reservation Service. Due to the presence of grizzly bears, a few of the campgrounds require what is referred to as \\"hard-sided\\" camping only, and tent camping is not permitted. Horseback riding in Greybull Ranger District For some visitors the greater solitude of the backcountry requires using hiking trails to backpacking or horseback riding into more remote destinations such as Blackwater Natural Bridge which can be accessed from Blackwater Natural Bridge trailhead. There are dozens of trails which total over located throughout the forest. Many of the trailheads can be accessed at campgrounds, with shorter day hikes available as well. The Continental Divide Trail has a section which passes through the forest and crosses the Continental Divide at Sheridan Pass. There is also the Nez Perce National Historic Trail and the Beartooth Loop National Recreation Trail, both of which are in the northern regions of the forest. Some remote areas can also be accessed by horseback. Trailheads usually provide enough room for horse and pack animal trailers plus personal vehicles. Along forest access roads, all- terrain vehicles (ATV) are allowed, but since wilderness areas do not permit access by way of motorized transport, those who wish to visit such areas usually do so either by hiking in or on horseback. Pingora Peak rises above Lonesome Lake in the Popo Agie Wilderness. Pingora is one of many peaks located in the Cirque of the Towers. Hunting and fishing are popular recreational activities permitted throughout the forest. Many of the streams and rivers are considered to be \\"Blue Ribbon Trout Streams\\". Though many streams and lakes have excellent opportunities to catch various species of trout, the north and south forks of the Shoshone River, the Greybull River and the Clark's Fork of the Yellowstone, the only federally designated Wild and Scenic River in Wyoming, are a few of the better locations to reign in a trophy level Rainbow or Yellowstone cutthroat trout. of streams and a hundred lakes that can be legally fished from provide plenty of elbow room during even the most crowded of fishing seasons. Hunting and fishing licenses are sponsored by the state of Wyoming and are available through the Wyoming Game and Fish Department. The southern section of the forest in the Wind River Range is the primary destination for mountain climbers. Nine of the highest 10 peaks in Wyoming are here, and the mountains are primarily of granitic rock with countless cliffs and sheer rock walls. The Cirque of the Towers is particularly popular as it has numerous peaks within a relatively short distance of each other. Two particular climbs on the peaks in the cirque are considered amongst the finest climbing adventures available in the U.S. The Absaroka Range also attracts climbers but not of a technical nature since the rocks are not considered solid enough for good anchoring points. For the tallest peaks in the Wind River Range, the entire summiting effort will take even experienced climbers many days due to the inaccessibility of the region and complexity of the climbing effort. Winter activities include cross-country skiing and snowmobiling, with of groomed trails for cross-country skiing and over for use by snowmobilers. The region around Togwotee Pass allows snowmobilers easy access from paved roads and has snow depths of between annually at elevations of , which equates to a long season for winter activities. = Scenic roads = Sunlight Bridge on the Chief Joseph Scenic Byway Shoshone National Forest forms the eastern boundary of Yellowstone National Park and the northeastern and eastern entrances to the park are both accessed by way of designated scenic roadways. A federally designated National Scenic Byways All-American Road, the Beartooth Highway (U.S. Highway 212), weaves through the forest and serves as the northeastern entranceway to Yellowstone National Park. Chief Joseph Scenic Byway (Wyoming Highway 296) connects Cody, Wyoming with the Beartooth Highway and follows the old trail in which Chief Joseph and the Nez Perce tribe attempted to flee the U.S. Cavalry in 1877. South of there, Buffalo Bill Cody Scenic Byway (US 14/16/20) heads west from Cody, Wyoming, passes through the forest and crosses Sylvan Pass as it enters Yellowstone. Lastly, the Wyoming Centennial Scenic Byway (US 26/287) heads northwest from Dubois, Wyoming, over Togwotee Pass and enters Jackson Hole and Grand Teton National Park. Though the Beartooth Highway is the only one of these four roads that is a National Scenic Byway, all four of them have been designated Wyoming State Scenic Byways by the state of Wyoming. Hazards Encountering bears is a concern in the Wind River Range, as well as in this nearby adjoining area. There are other concerns as well, including bugs, wildfires, adverse snow conditions and nighttime cold temperatures. Importantly, there have been notable incidents, including accidental deaths, due to falls from steep cliffs (a misstep could be fatal in this class 4/5 terrain) and due to falling rocks, over the years, including 1993, 2007 (involving an experienced NOLS leader), 2015 and 2018. Other incidents include a seriously injured backpacker being airlifted near SquareTop Mountain in 2005, and a fatal hiker incident (from an apparent accidental fall) in 2006 that involved state search and rescue.

Specifically, DEF is an aqueous urea solution made with 32.5% urea and 67.5% deionized water. DEF is consumed in selective catalytic reduction (SCR) that lowers the concentration of nitrogen oxides () in the diesel exhaust emissions from a diesel engine.  Other names  In the international standard defining DEF (ISO 22241), it is referred to as AUS 32 (aqueous urea solution 32%). DEF is also sold as AdBlue, a registered trademark of the German Association of the Automotive Industry. Several brands of SCR system use DEF: BlueHDI is used by Group PSA vehicles including Peugeot, Citroen, and DS Automobiles brands; BlueTec by Daimler AG; and FLENDS (Final Low Emission New Diesel System) by UD Trucks.  Background  Diesel engines can be run with a lean burn air-to-fuel ratio (overstoichiometric ratio), to ensure the full combustion of soot and to prevent their exhausting unburnt fuel. The excess air necessarily leads to generation of , which are harmful pollutants, from the nitrogen in the air. SCR is used to reduce the amount of released into the atmosphere. DEF from a separate tank is injected into the exhaust pipeline. Within the SCR catalyst, the are reduced by the ammonia into water and nitrogen, which are both less polluting. The water and nitrogen are then released into the atmosphere through the exhaust. The injection rate of DEF into the exhaust depends on the specific after-treatment system, but is typically 2‚Äì6% of diesel consumption volume. This low dosing rate ensures long fluid refill intervals and minimizes the tank's size (and intrusion into vehicle packaging space). An electronic control unit adjusts the addition of fluid in accordance with such parameters as engine operating temperature and speed.  Chemistry  DEF is a 32.5% solution of urea, . When it is injected into the hot exhaust gas stream, the water evaporates and the urea thermally decomposes to form ammonia () and isocyanic acid (HNCO): : ‚Üí + HNCO The isocyanic acid reacts with the water vapor and hydrolyses to carbon dioxide and ammonia: : HNCO + ‚Üí + Overall, thus far: : + ‚Üí 2 \\\\+ Ammonia, in the presence of oxygen and a catalyst, reduces two different nitrogen oxides: : 4 NO + 4 \\\\+ ‚Üí 4 \\\\+ 6 and : 6 \\\\+ 8 ‚Üí 7 \\\\+ 12 The overall reduction of by urea is then: : 2 \\\\+ 4 NO + ‚Üí 4 \\\\+ 4 \\\\+ 2 and : 4 \\\\+ 6 ‚Üí 7 \\\\+ 8 \\\\+ 4  Operation in winter time  DEF freezes at . For the SCR exhaust cleaning system to function at low temperatures, a sufficient amount of the frozen DEF must be melted in as short time as possible, preferably on the order of minutes. For example, 2010 EPA emissions requirements require full DEF coolant flow within 70 minutes. Typically, the frozen DEF is melted by heat from the engine, e.g. engine coolant passing through the DEF tank, governed by a thermostatic coolant control valve. This method may take significant time before the SCR exhaust cleaning system is fully operational, often up to an hour. Another method to thaw DEF (and thus allow for full SCR operation) is to integrate an electrical heater into the DEF tank. This heater must be sized, positioned, and powered adequately to rapidly melt sufficient frozen DEF. It should preferably be self-regulating not to overheat if (part of) the heater is outside of the liquid. It should also preferably be self-regulating to eliminate any complicated sensor and temperature regulating systems. Furthermore, the heater should not exceed , as DEF begins to decompose at around . PTC heaters are often used to achieve this.  Safety and storage  The urea solution is clear, non-toxic and safe to handle. Since urea has corrosive impact on metals like aluminium, DEF is stored and transported in special containers. These containers are typically made of stainless steel. Vehicles' selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems and DEF dispensers are designed in a manner that there is no corrosive impact of urea on them. It is recommended that DEF be stored in a cool, dry, and well-ventilated area that is out of direct sunlight. Bulk volumes of DEF are compatible for storage within polyethylene containers (HDPE, XLPE), fiberglass reinforced plastic (FRP), and steel tanks. DEF is also often handled in intermediate bulk containers for storage and shipping. Diesel exhaust fluid is offered to consumers through a variety of quantities ranging from containers for single or repeated small usage, up to bulk carriers for consumers requiring a large amount of DEF. As of 2013, a number of truck stops added DEF pumps that dispense DEF. These are usually adjacent to fuel pumps so the driver can fill both tanks without moving the truck. In Europe, increasing numbers of fuel stations offer AdBlue pumps, not only for large commercial vehicles but also for passenger cars.

Biography Bluestein was born in Evanston, Illinois. After working in the health care industry for several years and dabbling in radio hosting in Amsterdam, he moved to Chicago, Illinois in 1998 and started becoming involved with the underground film and performance scene. In 2000, he set up the website Insane Films, one of the earliest video blogs ever created. Around this time, he worked as a director of photography for independent filmmaker Kristi Alshaibi's Other People's Mirrors, an indie art film which explored adult taboos and helped refine Bluestein's artistic talent. Bluestein developed the popular alter ego of Madge Weinstein to be featured in a This is Spinal Tap-esque mockumentary about feminist riot grrrls and their lesbian Jewish manager. The short film remained unfinished and unreleased until February 2006, when he finally uploaded some footage to Yeast Radio under the title The Origin of Madge. Soon after, he began performing this character in drag with the Feast of Fools cabaret act and in art galleries and underground theatres. In November 2004, Bluestein discovered the growing podcasting community. Seeing it as a perfect medium for expression, he launched Yeast Radio from his Chicago living room. A month later, he sent a demo to former MTV VJ and self-professed \\"podfather\\" Adam Curry which sparked Bluestein's professional career in the podcasting and radio medium Bluestein's transgressive form of comedy has drawn controversy from the conservative podcasting community.

(Not to be confused with The Namesake (1964), a children's novel by artist and writer C. Walter Hodges). The Namesake was originally published in The New Yorker and was later expanded to a full-length novel. It explores many of the same emotional and cultural themes as Lahiri's Pulitzer Prize-winning short story collection Interpreter of Maladies. The novel moves between events in Calcutta, Boston, and New York City, and examines the nuances involved with being caught between two conflicting cultures with distinct religious, social, and ideological differences. Plot The story begins as Ashoke and Ashima Ganguli, a young Bengali couple, leave Calcutta, India, and settle in Central Square in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Ashoke is an engineering student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Ashima struggles through language and cultural barriers as well as her own fears as she delivers her first child alone. Had the delivery taken place in Calcutta, she would have had the baby at home, surrounded by family. The delivery is successful, but the new parents learn they cannot leave the hospital before giving their son a legal name. The traditional naming process in their families is to have an elder who will give the new baby a name, and the parents waited for the letter from Ashima's grandmother. The letter never arrives, and soon after, the grandmother dies. Bengali culture calls for a child to have two names, a pet name to be called by family, and a good name to be used in public. Ashoke suggests the name of Gogol, in honor of the famous Russian author Nikolai Gogol, to be the baby's pet name, and they use this name on the birth certificate. As a young man, Ashoke survived a train derailment with many fatalities. He had been reading a short story collection by Gogol just before the accident, and lying in the rubble of the accident he clutched a single page of the story \\"The Overcoat\\" in his hand. With many broken bones and no strength to move or call out, dropping the crumpled page is the only thing Ashoke can do to get the attention of medics looking for survivors. Though the pet name has deep significance for the baby's parents, it is never intended to be used by anyone other than family. They decide on Nikhil to be his good name. Gogol grows up perplexed by his pet name. Entering kindergarten, the Gangulis inform their son that he will be known as Nikhil at school. The five-year-old objects, and school administrators intervene on his behalf, sending him home with a note pinned to his shirt stating that he would be called Gogol at school, as was his preference. By the time he turns 14, he starts to hate the name. His father tries once to explain the significance of it, but he senses that Gogol is not old enough to understand. As Gogol progresses through high school, he resents his name more and more for its oddness and the strange genius for whom he was named. When he informs his parents that he wishes to change his name, his father objects to the idea but reluctantly agrees. Shortly before leaving for college, Gogol legally changes his name to Nikhil Ganguli. This change in name and Gogol's going to Yale, rather than following his father's footsteps to MIT, sets up the barriers between Gogol and his family. The distance, both geographically and emotionally, between Gogol and his parents continues to increase. He wants to be American, not Bengali. He goes home less frequently, dates American girls, and becomes angry when anyone calls him Gogol. During his college years, he smokes cigarettes and marijuana, goes to many parties, and loses his virginity to a girl he cannot remember. As he is going home for the summer, Gogol's train is suddenly stopped and temporarily loses electricity. A man had jumped in front of the train and committed suicide, and the wait for the authorities causes a long delay. Ashoke, who is waiting at the train station for Gogol, becomes very concerned when he calls the train company and hears of this incident. When they pull into the Ganguli's driveway, Ashoke turns off the car and finally explains the true significance of Gogol's name. Gogol is deeply troubled by this news, asking his father why he didn't tell him this earlier. He starts to regret changing his name and his identity. After graduating from Columbia University, Gogol obtains a very small apartment in New York City, where he lands a job in an established architectural office. He is rather stiff personality-wise, perpetually angry or else always on the lookout for someone to make a stereotypical comment about his background. At a party, Gogol meets a very attractive and outgoing girl named Maxine, with whom he begins a relationship. Maxine's parents are financially well off and live in a four-story house in New York City, with one floor occupied entirely by Maxine. Gogol moves in with her, and becomes an accepted member of her family. When Maxine's parents visit her grandparents in the mountains of New Hampshire for the summer, they invite Maxine and Gogol to join them for a couple of weeks. Gogol introduces Maxine to his parents. Ashima dismisses Maxine as something that Gogol will eventually get over. Shortly after this meeting, Ashoke dies of a heart attack while teaching in Ohio. Gogol travels to Ohio to gather his father's belongings and his father's ashes, and in attempting to sort out his emotions, Gogol gradually withdraws from Maxine, eventually breaking up with her. He begins to spend more time with his mother and sister, Sonia. Later, Ashima suggests that Gogol contact Moushumi, the daughter of one of her friends, whom Gogol knew when they were children, and whose intended groom, Graham, broke up with her shortly before their wedding. Gogol is reluctant to meet with Moushumi because she is Bengali, but does so anyway, to please his mother. Moushumi and Gogol are attracted to one another and eventually are married. However, by the end of their first year of marriage, Moushumi becomes restless. She feels tied down by marriage and begins to regret it. Gogol also feels like a poor substitute for Graham. Eventually, Moushumi has an affair with Dimitri, an old acquaintance, the revelation of which leads to the end of their marriage. With Sonia preparing to marry her fianc√©, an American named Ben, Gogol is once again alone. He is nonetheless comforted by the fact that Ashoke, prior to his death, finally told his son why he had chosen that name for him. Gogol comes to accept his name and picks up a collection of the Russian author's stories that his father had given him as a birthday present many years ago.

Many indigenous peoples have employed the technique as their primary hunting method for thousands of years, and it has survived into contemporary use for sport and hunting. Modern history Picture of Pope taken while grizzly hunting at Yellowstone The last of the Yahi Indian tribe, a native known as Ishi, came out of hiding in California in 1911. His doctor, Saxton Pope, learned many of Ishi's traditional archery skills, and popularized them. The Pope and Young Club, founded in 1961 and named in honor of Pope and his friend, Arthur Young, became one of North America's leading bowhunting and conservation organizations. Founded as a nonprofit scientific organization, the Club was patterned after the Boone and Crockett Club and advocated responsible bowhunting by promoting quality, fair chase hunting, and sound conservation practices. Modern game archery owes much of its success to Fred Bear, an American bow hunter and bow manufacturer. Equipment Hunting crossbow Arrows, bows and sights are commonly of the more modern varieties. However, all effective variations, including crossbows and wooden bows launching wooden arrows with stone points, are used. Arrowheads are chosen to ensure lethality. Broadheads feature blades that jut out from the shaft at an angle to cause more damage to the target; some models have retractable blades that only deploy once they hit the target. Big game hunting requires a draw weight of more than . For larger game such as elk or moose, more than is suggested. Most male American archers can draw a bow rated at , most women . Lighter arrows, all else equal, will give a higher speed and a flatter trajectory. Because arrows with mass more than carry more momentum, and penetrate better in large animals, bow hunters might choose them when hunting these animals. Methods of hunting In contrast to a rifle hunter, who may shoot effectively from ranges in excess of ; archers usually restrict shots to . The distance depends upon individual ability, the target animal, the bow strength, terrain, arrow and weather. The bow hunter may walk along the ground slowly, looking for game and stalking it carefully in the final approach. This type of slow, methodical stalking, is called \\"spot and stalk.\\" Hunters often wear camouflage clothing and walk upwind (with the wind in their face) so that game ahead of them cannot smell them. In \\"stand hunting,\\" the hunter waits for game to come to him, usually near food, water, or known trails. Brush and other natural materials may be placed for cover, or a \\"ground blind\\" that looks like a camouflage tent may be used. They usually \\"pop\\" up and can be set up from folded in a few minutes. The hunter may wait on a wooden or metal stand elevated in a tree, from . Bowhunting for fish is called bowfishing. Bowfishing equipment usually adds a line attached to a spool or a reel as well as a specially designed, heavier, barbed arrow. Most bow-fishers do not use sights, but if they do have sights they are different from standard ones to allow for refraction. Legal and cultural considerations Bowhunting often has different seasons and restrictions from firearm hunting, and they differ significantly between areas. Legal and cultural approaches specific to the area must be taken into consideration by the hunter. =Europe= Legal status of bowhunting in Europe with countries allowing bowhunting in green Nations including Denmark, France, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Hungary, Finland, Bulgaria and Slovenia use bow and arrow hunting as a hunting tool in modern game management. Some European countries, including the United Kingdom, prohibit bowhunting. Bowhunting, like target archery, was revived in the UK during the Victorian era,Archer's Craft. Adrian E Hodgkin. Llanerch Press; Facsimile of 1951 edition (31 May 1996). . but has been banned since 1965. Recently a law was passed in Estonia that would allow bowhunting of small game. = United States and Canada= In the United States and Canada, as with other styles of hunting, bowhunting is regulated by individual provinces and states. Regulations often address issues such as which area to hunt in, what time of year (season), and which sex and species of game may be taken. In many cases, a special archery season is set aside, to minimize interference from rifle hunters. While bowhunting can run into rifle hunting seasons, hunter orange is typically required to be worn during the cross over seasons. In addition, in an effort to maximize game recovery and shot lethality, there are often technical regulations, such as a minimum draw weight, minimum width of head, and lack of barbs. In general most bow hunting for big game begins in late August or early September in northern states and Canadian provinces, and slightly later in southern states. =New Zealand= Organized bow hunting began in New Zealand in 1945. The New Zealand government regulates bowhunting. An annual 3 day field shoot tournament is held every Queen's Birthday Weekend at various locations throughout New Zealand. Bowhunters must have permission to hunt on private land, and they cannot hunt in DOC lands, national parks, or any other reserves without a permit. All native species are protected; only introduced species are legal quarry. There are no special seasons for bowhunters or for hunting with a firearm. There is an active bow hunters' society. =Australia= Bowhunting is practiced in Australia and is not specifically subject to regulation by law. Only non-native species are recognized as game by the Australian Bowhunters Association. However, native species may be killed during government-authorized culls. The states of Victoria and New South Wales both regulate bowhunting. In Victoria hunting is regulated through the Department of Sustainability and Environment (DSE). In New South Wales this is done through the Department of Primary Industry. At the current time there are no specific hunting regulations in other states and territories. In July 2013 the New South Wales Government disbanded the Game Council, and temporarily suspended licensed hunting in NSW State forests. While both Victoria and New South Wales place licensing requirements on would- be bowhunters, the sport is self-regulated. The Australian Bowhunters Association and local clubs assess hunters through the Bowhunter Proficiency Certificate (BPC) which is designed to ensure that animals are killed according to humane principles. =Zimbabwe= Zimbabwe has legally permitted hunting with compound bows since 1989 as an exception, and since 1999 under formal legislation. Minimum arrow weights and bow draws are mandated. Bowhunting is only allowed on private or tribal lands, but not in national parks. Bowhunters must be accompanied by licensed guides or professional hunters. Bowhunting of elephants is mostly conducted in Zimbabwe. Following international outrage over the illegal hunt for Cecil, the lion, in 2015 the Parks and Wildlife Management Authority banned all bowhunting unless specifically authorized, as well as other hunting restrictions. Opposition Some are deeply opposed to bow hunting in particular, on the grounds of cruelty. The organization People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals states that \\"quick kills are rare, and many animals suffer prolonged, painful deaths when hunters severely injure but fail to kill them.\\" =Wounding rates= A study conducted by the Oklahoma Fish and Wildlife Agencies found that approximately 50% of deer that were shot were never recovered, noting that this rate was similar to data from other studies. Some deer survived for up to 5‚Äì7 days before succumbing to their wounds. \\"71% to 82% of all shots taken\\" miss the target and \\"shot placement is, for all practical purposes, random\\". In another study from Maryland, archers who had passed a pre-season accuracy test claimed that 82% of deer hit were recovered within 24 hours. Danish licensed bowhunters are required to complete a report every time that they kill a roe deer. (To become a licensed bowhunter in Denmark it is necessary to pass a very demanding proficiency test, including a test of accuracy in which five of six arrows must hit within the vital area of game targets ranging from roe deer to pheasant in size at unknown distances up to . Only 2% of Danish bowhunters use traditional equipment.) For 1999‚Äì2004, these reports showed that 576 arrows were released at roe deer. 92.5% of these shots resulted in a dead roe deer being collected by the hunter, and 2.6% are documented as misses. In 5% of reports the deer was hit and wounded (as indicated by bodily fluids on the ground or on the arrow), but not recovered by the hunter. The European Bowhunters Association states that \\"this percentage compares favorably with other means of harvesting roe deer in Europe.\\" References External links Category:Archery Category:Hunting ","title":"Bowhunting"},{"id":"2368447","text":"Filipino Negritos traditionally used bows and arrows to shoot fish in clear water.March, Alden (1899) The history and conquest of the Philippines and our other island possessions; embracing our war with the Filipinos in 1899 Page 39. Bowfishing is a method of fishing that uses specialized archery equipment to shoot and retrieve fish. Fish are shot with a barbed arrow that is attached with special line to a reel mounted on the bow. Some freshwater species commonly hunted include common carp, grass carp, bighead carp, alligator gar, and bowfin. In saltwater, rays and sharks are regularly pursued. Equipment =Bows= Bows are usually very simple. Most do not have sights, and aiming is by line-of-sight judgment down the arrow. There are a couple of types of rests including the hook-and-roller rest. Most bows have little to no let-off and not much draw weight. This differs with what one has available and personal preference. There are two main types of bows. Traditional bows include long bows and recurve bows. In more modern times compound bows have come into use, as they are easier to draw. Modern bows can have as much as draw weight. The crossbow is also sometimes used in this manner and has its own advantages, including the use of a reel. See Recreational fishing. =Arrows= Arrow with three prongs carrying three barbed points. For catching fish in rivers. From Guyana. Photographed at the Royal Albert Memorial Museum, Exeter, Devon. Bowfishing arrows are considerably heavier and stronger than arrows used in other types of archery and are most commonly constructed of fiberglass, but solid aluminum, carbon fiber, and carbon fiber reinforced fiberglass are also used. Bowfishing arrows generally lack fletching, as it can cause the arrow to flare to one side or another underwater and they are not required at the relatively short ranges associated with bowfishing. Line is attached to the arrow by tying to a hole in the arrow shaft or through the use of a slide system. =Line= Bowfishing line is often made from braided nylon, Dacron, or Spectra. Commonly used line weights range from eighty to four-hundred pound test, with six-hundred being used when bowhunting for alligators. Line color is normally either lime green, white, or neon orange. =Reels= Three types of reels are commonly used in bowfishing: Hand-wrap, spincast, and retriever. Hand-wrap reels are the simplest reels; they consist of a circular spool that line is wrapped onto by hand and then secured in a line holding slot. When the arrow is shot the line comes free from the line holder and feeds off the spool. Fish are caught by pulling the line in hand over hand; hand-wrap reels are the least effective at fighting arrowed fish, but they can be used in conjunction with a float system to shoot and fight large trophy fish. Retriever reels have a \\"bottle\\" which holds the line in place. When shot the line comes out either until the shot goes too far and the line runs out or the hunter pushes down a stopping device which can be used to keep a fish from traveling out too far. Some retriever reels have slots cut in them and are known as slotted retriever reels. They are more commonly used for alligator, alligator gar, shark and other big game that will take more time to chase down than smaller game fish. =Glasses= One of the keys to bowfishing is having a good visual of the target. In order to see the fish in the water on a sunny day, polarized sun glasses are helpful. They cut the glare on top of the water so it makes it easier to see what is below the surface. Different tints and lens colors make a difference in the color of water the hunter is fishing in, from darker brown to clearer blue and green. At night glasses are unnecessary, as lights are used to see through the water.  Boats Although bowfishing can be done from the shore, bowfishers most often shoot from boats. Flat bottom \\"john boats\\" and canoes are used in areas of low water, as they have less draw, but are unsuitable for open water. Larger boats can accommodate multiple hunters. Many of these boats are highly customized specifically for bowfishing, with raised shooting platforms, and generators to provide electrical power to multiple lights for bowfishing at night. \\"Airboats\\" also incorporate some type of fan propulsion for operating in very shallow waters. The fan and motor are generally mounted on a raised platform at the stern. Techniques A modern bowfisher takes aim at spawning carp in an Iowa pond.Along with fishing from boats and off the shore, wading and shooting is also effective as long as the hunter doesn't mind getting soaked. Wading in rivers allows the shooter to get up close to the fish if the hunter is skillful. When keeping fish while wading, the hunter may utilize a stringer tied to a belt loop. Standing on large rocks in shallower parts of a river is another technique. This provides a better view higher out of the water. Going from rock to rock in a river with two hunters gets the fish moving if they are inactive. It is similar to herding the fish to the other hunter; while one hunter is wading the other is stationary on a rock. All of these river techniques typically work best for carp or catfish, depending on the location. =Aiming= Knowing where to aim on a fish can be one of the most difficult skills to master in bowfishing. Due to the refraction of the water and how it optically distorts the location of objects in the water, aiming straight at the target usually results in a miss. Aiming well below the target compensates for the optical illusion. Depth and distance of the target also impact how far below the fish to aim. Aiming four inches low for every ten feet (33 mm/m) of lateral distance from the fish water, and adding 3 inches for every foot (250 mm/m) of water depth in which the target resides typically yields good results, though actual compensation for refracted light must account not only for distance and depth, but angle as well. Common advice includes, \\"When in doubt, aim low, then aim lower.\\" Targeted species =Freshwater= *Common carp *Bighead carp *Silver carp *Grass carp *River Carpsucker *Longnose gar *Shortnose gar *Spotted Gar *Alligator gar *Paddlefish *Threadfin Shad *Frog *Bigmouth buffalo *Smallmouth buffalo *Freshwater drum *Catfish *American alligator *Tilapia *Bowfin *Asian snakehead =Saltwater= *Southern stingray *Cownose ray *Bull shark *Barracuda *Flounder *Sheepshead Huge native smallmouth buffalo harvested with a single arrow in Mississippi River backwaters, Iowa.

It is deciduous over part of its range,PDF Ursula K. Schuch and Margaret Norem, Growth of Legume Tree Species Growing in the Southwestern United States, University of Arizona. but evergreen in most locales. The species grows to a height of and grows multiple trunks. The base of each leaf is accompanied by a pair of thorns on the branch.  Etymology  The taxon name farnesiana is named after Odoardo Farnese (1573‚Äì1626) of the notable Italian Farnese family which, after 1550, under the patronage of cardinal Alessandro Farnese, maintained some of the first private European botanical gardens in Rome, the Farnese Gardens, in the 16th and 17th centuries. This acacia was first described from these gardens; imported to Italy from Santo Domingo, in what is now the Dominican Republic. Analysis of essences of the floral extract from this plant, long used in perfumery, resulted in the name for the sesquiterpene biosynthetic chemical farnesol, found as a basic sterol precursor in plants, and cholesterol precursor in animals. The name huisache of Mexico and Texas is derived from Nahuatl and means \\"many thorns,\\". The Australian name needle bush came about because of the numerous thorns distributed along its branches.  Taxonomy  = Taxonomic history = It was first described by Europeans under the name Acacia Indica Farnesiana in 1625 by Tobias Aldini from plants grown in Rome in the Farnese Gardens from seed collected in Santo Domingo, in what is now the Dominican Republic, which germinated in 1611. Tobias Aldini included an illustration of the plant, which he contrasted with an illustration of the first known Acacia; Acacia nilotica. This first (European) illustration of the plant was later designated as the (lecto-)type. In 1753 Linnaeus used Aldini's work as basis for his taxon Mimosa farnesiana. In 1806 Carl Ludwig Willdenow moved this taxon to the genus Acacia. Partly due to its wide distributional range the taxon has attracted many synonyms. Especially in the United States the taxonomy has been confused. In 1809 Willdenow described Acacia acicularis from Central America collected and named during Humboldt and Bonpland's scientific expedition to the Americas. Acacia ferox was described in 1843 in Belgium from collections in Mexico. Acacia lenticellata was described in 1859 for the plants found growing throughout Australia. In the Prodromus Florae Peninsulae Indiae Orientalis of 1834 Wight & Arnott attempted to split the burgeoning genus Acacia by moving a number of the Acacia species growing in India to the new genus Vachellia. This wasn't widely followed, nonetheless in 1933 Small verified Alexander's name Vachellia densiflora for plants growing in Louisiana, and awarded V. peninsularis and V. insularis to different populations of the plants growing in Florida. In 1936 Cory moved Vachellia densiflora to Acacia densiflora, but as this name had already been used for another taxon and was therefore invalidated sensu Cory, in 1969 this taxon was renamed A. smallii by Isely. In 1948 F.J.Herm. synonymised Vachellia peninsularis and V. insularis under Acacia pinetorum. In 1933 M.E.Jones named plants he collected in Mexico Pithecellobium minutum. This taxon was moved to Acacia minuta by R.Mitchel Beauchamp in 1980. Beauchamp also subsumed A. smallii under A. minuta subsp. densiflora, although this wasn't widely followed. Acacia smallii was used in the United States for the 'native' A. farnesiana growing in the drylands west of Louisiana, but at the same time the taxon A. farnesiana was recognised in the United States for purportedly imported non-native plants originally cultivated in the southeastern United States as ornamentals and later thought naturalised there. Additionally, in Florida, A. pinetorum was recognised as a rare endemic native. A paper in 1989 by H.D. Clarke, D.S. Seigler and J.E. Ebinger finally cleared up some of this confusion, synonymising Acacia smallii and a number of other taxa under the nominate form of A. farnesiana, under which they also included all of the plants growing outside of the Americas. In the same paper they recognised A. farnesiana var. guanacastensis from herbarium collections made by D.H. Janzen in 1976 in Guanacaste, Costa Rica.Clarke, H.D., Seigler, D.S., Ebinger, J.E. 1989; 'Acacia farnesiana (Fabaceae: Mimosoideae) and Related Species from Mexico, the Southwestern U.S., and the Caribbean' Systematic Botany 14 549-564 This taxon was later elevated to species status as A. guanacastensis by the same three in 2000 and later moved to Vachellia guanacastensis by Seigler and Ebinger in 2006. Acacia pinetorum was subsumed under A. farnesiana as A. farnesiana subsp. pinetorum in 2002 by Clarke, Seigler and Ebinger (rendering the nominate form A. farnesiana subsp. farnesiana). Seigler and Ebinger later reclassified this as Vachellia farnesiana var. pinetorum in 2005. = Classification and relationships = = Infraspecific diversity = Acacia farnesiana var. guanacastensis is primarily distinguished by larger leaflets. It remains controversial; most taxonomic authorities in Mexico and Central America recognise this taxon as a full species under either A. guanacastensis or Vachellia guanacastensis, the √Årboles nativos e introduciados de El Salvador of 2009 subsumed it under Acacia farnesiana. It is recognised as present in Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua and the southern Gulf and southwestern regions of Mexico by the Kew World Checklist of Selected Plant Families (2018) but it is unclear if the taxon as recognised by the different authorities replaces Acacia farnesiana in Central America (but not the Caribbean or South America) or exists sympatrically. This has implications for the classification of the extra-American distribution of A. farnesiana as the populations growing in Australia and the Philippines have recently (2017) been shown to derive from ancient Central American origins. Acacia pinetorum, the pineland acacia or pineland wattle, is also disputed: ILDIS continues to recognise A. pinetorum, USDA PLANTS recognises V. farnesiana var. pinetorum. In France two old cultivars have been developed for the perfume industry. These were also recognised as varieties at one time.  Distribution  Of all Acacia species, this plant has the greatest distribution. It was first described by Europeans in 1625 by Tobias Aldini from plants grown from seed collected in Santo Domingo, in what is now the Dominican Republic. The native range of V. farnesiana has been or is sometimes disputed. While the point of origin is thought to be the Caribbean, the Guianas, Mexico and/or Central America, the species has a pantropical distribution incorporating most of the Americas (from southern USA to Chile, excluding the Amazon), most of Australia, much of Africa, southern Europe and southern Asia. In the Caribbean it is present from the Bahamas and Cuba south to Trinidad, Cura√ßao and Aruba, where in it is believed to be native to Hispaniola and certainly Cuba, but possibly native or naturalised elsewhere. In the United States it is thought to be native to southern Texas, southern New Mexico, southern Arizona and southern California, but perhaps naturalised in southern Louisiana, coastal Mississippi, coastal Alabama, coastal Georgia and southern Florida (or not). It remains disputed whether the extra-American distribution is natural (the seed pods have probably floated across the Pacific) or anthropogenic. It was introduced to Europe, the Middle East, India, Africa, and recently Gran Canaria and Hawaii. It has long been thought to be native to the Philippines and Australia, having spread there by natural means, because plants were collected there before colonisation in 1788, it was distributed throughout the country, indigenous knowledge on the plant is extensive, and recent (2017) DNA investigations show this as most likely. In Australia, however, the government now considers it as non-native or even invasive.  Ecology  Deer and peccaries eat its fruit, various birds use the plant for nesting and cover, and insects eat the nectar from its flowers. If disturbed, Huisache will readily resprout. It thrives in dry, saline, or sodic soils. It is considered a serious pest plant in parts of Australia, as it interferes with cattle ranching operations. It readily spreads in commercial grazing pastures, especially along creeks, which might affect ease of transport for farmers, complicates muster, and can damage farm machinery. The seeds are dispersed by cattle after they eat the nutritious pods, and growth is promoted by overgrazing. Numerous herbicides are used to control it on ranches, chemical control is the only way to kill it. The plant has been spread to many new locations as a result of human activity and it is considered a serious weed in Fiji, where locals call it Ellington's curse.  Uses  = Perfume = The flowers are processed through distillation to produce a perfume called Cassie which has been described as \\"delicious\\". It is widely used in the perfume industry in Europe. Flowers of the plant provide the perfume essence from which the biologically important sesquiterpenoid farnesol is named. Scented ointments from Cassie are made in India. = Gum = It exudes a gum which is sometimes collected. = Tanning leather = The bark is used for its tannin content. The concentration of tannin in the seed pods is about 23%. Highly tannic barks are common in general to acacias. Extracts of many are used in medicine for this reason. (See cutch). = Food = The seeds of V. farnesiana are not toxic to humans. = Fodder and forage = The foliage is a significant source of forage in much of its range, with a protein content around 18%. The tree makes good forage for bees. The seed pods are readily eaten by livestock. = Ornamental = This drought-tolerant species is often used in xeriscaping in Texas. = Dyes and inks = A black pigment is extracted from the bark and fruit. = Wood = = Traditional medicine = In Brazil some people use the seeds of V. farnesiana to kill rabid dogs. V. farnesiana has been used in Colombia to treat malaria, and in one in vitro study an ethanol extract from the leaves showed some activity against the malarial pathogen Plasmodium falciparum with an IC50 value of 1 to 2 ¬µg/mL (as did almost everything tested), though it showed no activity in animal models or a ferriprotoporphyrin biomineralization inhibition test. In the Philippines the leaves are traditionally rubbed on the skin to treat skin diseases in livestock. In Malaysia, an infusion of the plant's flowers and leaves is mixed with turmeric for post-partum treatment.

A 25th- anniversary album followed in 2015 entitled Texas 25, followed by the band's ninth studio album, Jump on Board (2017), which achieved mainstream chart success, topping the albums charts in Scotland and debuting within the top ten in France, the United Kingdom and Belgium. Early life Spiteri was born in Bellshill Maternity Hospital, Scotland, to father Eddie, a guitar-playing merchant seaman, and mother Vilma, a singing window-dresser. Spiteri is of French, Maltese, Italian, Irish and German descent. When she was young, the family moved from the Glaswegian suburbs to nearby Balloch, close to the banks of Loch Lomond. While a student at Vale of Leven Academy, her nickname was ‚ÄòSpit the Dog‚Äô, after the character on the TV show Tiswas. Career Sharleen Spiteri worked as a hairdresser in Muirhead, North Lanarkshire, until Texas became her sole priority in 1988. =Southside and early success= Spiteri's musical influences include the Clash (the main reason she plays a black Fender Telecaster), Blondie, Marvin Gaye and Prince. She is also a dedicated Diana Ross fan. Spiteri co-founded the band The band, composed of Spiteri, McElhone, McErlaine, Tony McGovern, Eddie Campbell, Michael Bannister and Neil Payne, first released an EP titled Everyday Now before releasing their debut album Southside in July 1989. The band gained international success with their debut single \\"I Don't Want a Lover\\" which reached No. 8 in the UK Singles Chart, and No. 77 on the US Billboard Hot 100 charts. Later singles released from Southside were not as successful, \\"Thrill Has Gone\\" which charted at No. 60 on the UK Singles Chart, \\"Everyday Now\\" at No. 44 and \\"Prayer For You\\" at No. 73. Only four singles were released from Southside before going on a tour and return to the studio to start work on their second album Mothers Heaven. Around the same time as Southside was being recorded, Spiteri's cousin Mark Rankin was founding his own band, the hard rock band Gun, and Spiteri contributed backing vocals to two tracks from their debut album Taking on the World, also released in 1989. In 1991, Texas's second studio album Mothers Heaven was released, soon after the band released an extended play to help promote the album; Extracts from Mothers Heaven was released in 1991. The album was released on 23 September 1991 and was not as successful as Southside. The album charted at a low and unexpected No. 32 on the UK Album Charts and two singles \\"Why Believe In You\\" which charted at No. 66 in the UK, \\"In My Heart\\" which charted at No. 74 in the United Kingdom were not as successful, but the album's third and final single \\"Alone With You\\" which charted at No. 32 on the UK Singles Chart. Promotion had stopped for Mothers Heaven and again the band returned to the studio to work on their third album, Ricks Road. Ricks Road was released in 1993, again, not as successful as the band and fans had hoped for, but chart and sales wise, the album did better than Mothers Heaven. Ricks Road charted at No. 18 on the UK Album Charts, only spending a further 1-week falling to No. 56 on the UK Album Charts before leaving the charts. The album's lead single \\"So Called Friend\\" charted at No. 30 on the UK Singles Chart and the second \\"You Owe It All To Me\\" charted at No. 39. The further three singles released, \\"So In Love With You\\" charted at No. 28 in the United Kingdom. The further two singles \\"You've Got To Give a Little\\" and \\"Fade Away\\" did not chart in the United Kingdom. =White on Blonde and rise to popularity= In 1997, Texas came back to the music scene with the international hit \\"Say What You Want\\". The song was released internationally on 6 January 1997. The song became the band's highest charting single to date on the UK Singles Chart, peaking at No. 3. In February, Texas released their fourth, multi-platinum selling album. White on Blonde, it went on to become the band's most successful album to date. The album charted at No. 1 on the UK Album Charts and returned to the top spot in the United Kingdom three times (including its debut peak at number one). The album managed 91 weeks on the UK Album Charts. After the success of \\"Say What You Want\\", Texas released the track \\"Halo\\" on 7 April 1997. \\"Halo\\" became one of the band's biggest charting UK singles (the band's third UK Top 10 single at that point) charting at No. 10 on the UK Singles Chart. Like \\"Say What You Want\\", \\"Halo\\" received strong airplay on British radio stations and received fairly positive reviews from music critics. The song stayed on the UK Singles Charts for a total of seven weeks. Texas went on to release a third single from the album; \\"Black Eyed Boy\\" was released on 28 July 1997 and became the band's fourth UK top-ten single at the time of its release. The song charted at No. 5 on the UK Singles Chart and No. 29 on the French Singles Charts, as well as charting at No. 68 in Germany and No. 23 on the Irish Singles Charts. In the United Kingdom, the song received strong radio play. The song managed 6 weeks on the UK Singles Chart. The album's fourth single; \\"Put Your Arms Around Me\\" was released on 3 November 1997. The single became the band's fifth United Kingdom top-ten single at the time when it was released in November 1997 and also made White on Blonde one of a few albums to spawn five UK top- ten Singles. The song managed a strong eight weeks on the UK Singles Chart. In 1998, Texas's song \\"Put Your Arms Around Me\\" was the lone vocal track for the Andy Tennant film, Ever After: A Cinderella Story, starring Drew Barrymore. In 1999, Texas released their first single from their new fifth studio album. \\"In Our Lifetime\\" was released in April 1999 and became the band's second highest charting single in the United Kingdom, debuting at No. 4 on the UK Singles Chart. The song also was included on the Notting Hill soundtrack. With the success of \\"In Our Lifetime\\", Texas continued to go ahead with the released of their fifth studio album; The Hush was released in May 1999, and like its predecessor White on Blonde, charted at No. 1 on the UK Album Charts in its first week of release. The Hush received fair reviews with 'All Music Guide' stating the album was \\"Blessed with a stylish production and sharp commercial songs\\". In the album's second week, it dropped two places to No. 3 but in its third week rose back to No. 2. The album managed 43 weeks on the UK Album Charts. With the continued Texas success, the band followed up the success of their album with a second single. \\"Summer Son\\" was released on 16 August 1999. Summer Son charted in the UK top 10 at No. 5, making Summer Son the band's seventh UK top-ten single at that point. \\"Summer Son\\" received a lot of fair radio airplay in the United Kingdom and other parts of Europe and received a fair amount of positive reviews. The song serves as one of Texas's biggest and best known songs to date. One more single was released from The Hush, \\"When We Are Together\\". The song was released on 15 November 1999 and missed the UK top 10, but became the band's 13th UK top-40 singles (including their UK top-ten singles). The song charted at No. 12 on the UK Singles Chart behind Garbage's 1999 James Bond film theme \\"The World Is Not Enough\\". The Hush has become one of the band's biggest selling albums worldwide. Spiteri performing live with Texas in 2011 =The Greatest Hits and continued success= In 2000, Texas released their debut Greatest Hits album on 23 October 2000. The album's lead single \\"In Demand\\" was released 2 October 2000. The song reached No. 6 on the UK Singles Chart and also reached high positions in various European countries such as No. 80 in Germany, No. 10 in Spain, No. 20 on the Irish Singles Charts and No. 49 in Switzerland. When The Greatest Hits was released, it went straight to No. 1 in the United Kingdom like the previous to studio albums White on Blonde and The Hush. The album also charted at No. 24 on the Belgium Album top 100, No. 48 on the Spanish Albums Top 100 charts, No. 60 on the Irish Album Charts and No. 72 in Switzerland. The Greatest Hits saw the release of a second single titled \\"Inner Smile\\". The song was released at the end of 2000 and the beginning of 2001 in certain countries. Inner Smile reached No. 6 on the UK Singles Chart, becoming the band's ninth UK top-ten single at the time of the singles release. The video for \\"Inner Smile\\" featured a homage to Elvis Presley (and specifically his '68 Comeback Special shows) with Spiteri dressed as Presley in his black leather suit and using prosthetics to resemble him. It had some black and white stills showing her in distinct situations (in one of them, Sharleen/Elvis proudly holds a belt with the word \\"SHAR\\" instead of \\"ELVIS\\", formed with diamonds). The video clip was shot in London in November 2000, with a live audience and with the band members playing different roles as musicians and/or audience members (with Spiteri portraying various groupies). In September 2002, Spiteri gave birth to her daughter Mysty Kyd, although this did not prevent her from working on another album. On 6 October 2003, Texas released their first single from their upcoming sixth album titled Carnival Girl which featured rapping vocals by Canadian artist Kardinal Offishall. The song reached No. 9 on the UK Singles Chart, No. 15 on the Denmark Singles Charts, No. 41 in Switzerland, No. 43 on the Irish Singles Charts, No. 57 on the French Singles Charts top 100 and No. 94 on the German top 100. On 30 October 2003, Texas released their long- awaited sixth studio album Careful What You Wish For. The album did not make No. 1 in the United Kingdom like the past three albums (two studio and one Greatest Hits) but however made No. 5 on the UK Album Charts and only managed Gold status awarded by the BPI for sales of over 100,000 copies in the United Kingdom. A second and final single was released from the album titled \\"I'll See It Through\\" was released on 8 December 2003. The single became the band's lowest charting single in the UK since \\"In My Heart\\" in 1991. The song only managed No. 40 on the UK Singles Chart and only remained in the UK top 100 for another two weeks. =Red Book and hiatus= The band returned in mid-2005 with the single \\"Getaway\\", which entered the UK Singles Chart at No. 6 becoming the band's tenth UK top-ten single. The song also charted at No. 6 on the Denmark Singles Top 40, No. 18 in Norway, No. 34 on the Irish Singles Charts, No. 41 in Sweden, No. 43 in Belgium No. 45 in Switzerland, No. 59 in France and 59 in Germany. \\"Can't Resist\\" was released as the second single on 31 October 2005. The song failed to make the UK top 10, reaching No. 13 in the UK and becoming the band's nineteenth UK top-40 single. The band's seventh studio album; Red Book followed on 7 November 2005. The album reached No. 16 in the UK albums chart. Red Book became the band's third album to miss the UK top 10 after Mothers Heaven in 1991 and Ricks Road in 1993. The band's third single and final single from the album was released on 9 January 2006; \\"Sleep\\". The song became the band's eleventh UK Top 10 single peaking at No. 6 on the UK Singles Chart as well as making No. 37 on the Irish Singles Charts. The song featured vocals from Paul Buchannan from the Scottish band the Blue Nile. On 21 February 2006, a promo only single \\"What About Us\\" was released. On 24 September 2007 the band released The BBC Sessions, including radio sessions spanning from 1989 to 2005, with extensive liner notes and interviews with Spiteri. Cover songs include Elmore James's \\"It Hurts Me Too\\", the Beatles' \\"I've Got a Feeling\\", and Ashford & Simpson's \\"You're All I Need to Get By.\\" In 2008, Spiteri embarked on a solo career. Her debut album, Melody, was released in July 2008 and debuted at No. 3 in the UK. Worldwide the album sold over 300,000 copies. She released her debut solo single \\"All The Times I Cried\\" which made the UK top 40 at No. 26. She also released the singles \\"Stop, I Don't Love You Anymore\\" and \\"It Was You\\". \\"Don't Keep Me Waiting\\" was released as a promo single in Switzerland. On New Year's Eve 2009, she performed two cover songs on The Graham Norton Show. Her second solo studio album, The Movie Songbook, was released on 1 March 2010 worldwide. On 11 September 2009, Ally McErlaine was hospitalised after he collapsed with a massive brain aneurysm at age 41. As of February 2010, he is on the road to recovery, as reported by Spiteri in The Sunday Mail: \\"Ally is the most stubborn person I have ever come across, and I think his sheer pigheadedness is the reason he's still here. When he asked what was happening with Texas, I said it was up to him. He told me he wanted to get back into the studio.\\" =Solo career and Melody= Spiteri in February 2011 After the release of Texas's 2005 album Red Book the band members confirmed that they would enter a hiatus. Spiteri performed as guest vocalist on Rammstein's Rosenrot album. She began work on her debut solo album, working with some of her former bandmates. She wrote the vast majority of the tracks on the album. She released her debut solo album Melody on 14 July 2008 with \\"All The Times I Cried\\" serving as the album's lead single. The song charted at No. 26 on the UK Singles Chart. Melody was proven popular in the United Kingdom, debuting at a high No. 3 on the UK Album Charts. In other European countries where Texas were popular like in Belgium, the album charted at No. 15 on the Belgium Flanders Charts and No. 13 on the Belgium Wallonia Charts. The song \\"Don't Keep Me Waiting\\" was released as a single in Switzerland only, in which it charted at No. 78 on the singles charts there. A further two singles were released worldwide, \\"Stop, I Don't Love You Anymore\\" and \\"It Was You\\" which were both unpopular in the United Kingdom, missing the UK top 100, with \\"Stop, I Don't Love You Anymore\\" charting at No. 107 and \\"It Was You\\" at No. 178. By 2009, Melody has been certified Gold by the BPI (UK) with sales of over 100,000. Spiteri released her second solo studio album The Movie Songbook which consists of film covers chosen by Spiteri herself was released on 1 March 2010. The album's lead single \\"Xanadu\\" was released in February 2010, and charted at No. 71 on the UK Singles Chart in March 2010. As for the album, it charted at No. 13 on the UK Album Charts on 7 March 2010, thus becoming Spiteri's second UK top-40 album as a soloist, and her seventh UK top-40 album both as a soloist and a member of Texas. To promote the album, she performed in front of 55,000 fans supporting Paul McCartney on his Up and Coming Tour at Hampden Park in Glasgow. In 2010, Spiteri appeared as a judge on the Sky 1 reality show Must Be the Music. Spiteri has a large lesbian fanbase, although she is heterosexual. =Return to Texas and The Conversation= In February 2013, Music Week announced the band had signed a new record deal with PIAS Recordings and were to release their first new album since reuniting. The Conversation was released on 20 May 2013. Physical formats included a single disc and double-disc deluxe edition. The latter featured a bonus disc entitled Live in Scotland. Also in 2013, a UK tour was announced and the album launched at two gigs, one at King Tut's Wah Wah Hut in Glasgow and the other at the 100 Club in London. Spiteri performed a cover of \\"River Deep ‚Äì Mountain High\\" at these gigs as well as a selection of new tracks from The Conversation. Tracks are written mainly by Spiteri herself and Johnny McElhone, with Richard Hawley and Bernard Butler as collaborators. The album's lead single of the same name joined BBC Radio 2's playlist in April 2013 with two more singles, \\"Detroit City\\" and \\"Dry Your Eyes\\", following later that year. The album is certified Platinum in France and peaked at No. 4 on the UK Album Charts. In November 2014, Texas contributed to BBC Radio 2's Sounds of the '80s album with a cover of \\"Don't Talk to Me About Love\\" by Altered Images, a band which also included current Texas member Johnny McElhone in its lineup. =Recent work and Texas 25= To celebrate the band's 25th anniversary, it was announced that some of their biggest hits would be re-recorded for a new album entitled Texas 25. The collection features eight songs from the band's back catalogue completely reworked with the help of New York production team Truth & Soul, as well as four brand new songs, and was released on 16 February 2015. Deluxe packages include a second disc of the hits in their original form. The lead single, \\"Start a Family\\", premiered online on 6 January 2015. The band embarked on a UK tour throughout April and May 2015. Filmography Spiteri landed the part of a detective opposite Edward Furlong in the thriller 3 Blind Mice, but backed out due to pregnancy. She was also cast in Moulin Rouge! starring Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor, but she told Jonathan Ross on his show on 4 November 2005 that she declined because she did not want to move to Australia for a year. In 2011, she appeared in the French version of The X Factor with Henri Padovani who was managing groups for the competition. In 2016, she appeared on the British programme Top Gear, along with Seasick Steve and Tinie Tempah in a South African SUV challenge. Personal life Spiteri had a long- term relationship with the editor of Arena magazine, Ashley Heath. The couple has a daughter, Misty Kyd (named after the phrase from the Clint Eastwood film Play Misty for Me and Wild West outlaw Billy the Kid), born on 9 September 2002. The birth prompted her close friend Thierry Henry to dedicate a goal to her daughter by revealing the slogan \\"For the new born Kyd\\" beneath his shirt later that day. The couple separated in the second half of 2005. In the run-up to the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, Spiteri expressed support for Scotland remaining in the Union, stating \\"As far as I'm concerned, I'm British. And, yeah, I'm Scottish but I feel I'm part of the UK.\\" Spiteri married celebrity chef Bryn Williams in September 2018. She is a patron of children's cancer charity CLIC Sargent.

During his long life Hou√´l witnessed the reign of Louis XV, the French Revolution, and the period of Napoleon's First Empire. Biography He was born at Rouen into a family of prosperous artisans, who sent him to the city's drawing academy when he was fifteen. Here he was exposed to the art of early Dutch and Flemish painters, which was to have a defining impact on his chosen specialty of landscape painting. In 1758 Hou√´l published a book of landscape engravings, and in 1768 he painted six views of the Duc de Choiseul's country estate, the Ch√¢teau de Chanteloup. The following year his influential patrons secured a place for him at the French Academy in Rome. Here, captivated with Italian customs, landscapes, and ancient sites, he traveled throughout southern Italy, making gouache drawings, which he presented at the Paris Salons of the early 1770s, exhibits that drew the attention of a wide public. He spent the years 1776 to 1779 traveling in Sicily, Lipari, and Malta, after which, based on his journey, he published a series of four volumes of lavishly illustrated travel books (1782‚Äì1787). Hou√´l's main intention was to illustrate local topography, but his delicate applications of watercolor also magnificently captured the effects of light and atmosphere. To help finance these projects, he sold his preliminary drawings in Paris in 1780. Louis XVI purchased 46, and Catherine II of Russia, more than 500, of which 260 are preserved at the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg. In his later years Hou√´l published two illustrated treatises on elephants. Drawings of other animals suggest he was preparing to publish further zoological works; however, his death at the age of seventy- eight cut short his plans. image:Prise de la Bastille.jpgPrise de la Bastille (1789) File:Houel- Vue du ch√¢teau de Chanteloup prise de la cascade ‚Äì Mus√©e des Beaux Arts, Tours.jpgView of the Ch√¢teau de Chanteloup from the south Notes Bibliography * Conisbee, Philip (1996). \\"Ho√ºel, Jean-Pierre- Louis-Laurent\\", vol. 14, p. 799, in The Dictionary of Art, edited by Jane Turner, reprinted with minor corrections in 1998.

At least three piano concerto arrangements of the work have been made by other composers, based on Liszt's suggestions.  History and significance  In 1851 Breitkopf & H√§rtel published the solo piano work Grosses Concert-Solo (in modern editions as Grosses Konzertsolo) (S.176) by Franz Liszt. Though not as popular as the later Piano Sonata in B minor by the same composer, the work achieves significance by the fact that it anticipates the Sonata as a large-scale nonprogrammatic work. It shows structural similarities to the Sonata and obvious thematic relationship to both the Sonata and the Faust Symphony. One unpublished earlier version of the work exists, titled in French in the manuscript Grand Solo de concert (S.175a). This version differs structurally from the published Grosses Concert-Solo, thus revealing the existence of interesting material for a study on the genesis of Liszt‚Äôs gradual innovations in constructing a large-scale musical organism, which were to come to full fruition in the Sonata. In 1866 a two-piano version was published under the title Concerto path√©tique (S.258/2) which, though not differing structurally from the Grosses Concert-Solo, introduces a more effective layout of the musical thoughts, mainly due to an innovative concerto-like treatment of the two-piano ensemble. The initial conception of a projected piano concerto can further be proved by a number of extant piano concerto arrangements by various composers, including orchestra sketches by Liszt himself (the unpublished manuscript containing the piece's original (French) title Grand solo de concert) (S.365). While the solo piano version is rarely performed today, the Concerto path√©tique has become a repertoire piece of the two-piano genre.  Genesis of the \\"four-movements-in-one\\" form  The experimental nature of the Concerto path√©tique gives it an outstanding presence in the Liszt oeuvre. The composer made many attempts to find an appropriate title ‚Äî Grand solo de concert, Grand Concert, Morceau de Concert, etc. ‚Äî indicating that this work was an experiment with new forms. Even the Piano Concerto No. 2 in A Major which Liszt begun work on in the same year (1849) as the Grand Solo de concert/Grosses Concert-Solo had its genesis ten years earlier in a seemingly self-contradictorally entitled work Concerto sans orchestre (S.524a). The fact that the solo Grosses Concert-Solo has been overshadowed by the later two- piano version has obscured the importance of the former as one of Liszt‚Äôs largest and most ambitious original works for the instrument. The Grosses Concert-Solo anticipates several of the most salient features of Liszt's undisputed masterwork, the Piano Sonata in B minor, namely the nonprogrammatic \\"four-movements-in-one\\" form. The earlier unpublished solo version (S.175a) as well as the unpublished orchestra accompaniment sketches for a projected piano concerto version (S.365) do not contain the slow Andante sostenuto middle section, which shows that Liszt‚Äôs initial conception was one virtuoso sonata- allegro movement with exposition, development, recapitulation, and coda. The new \\"comprehensive\\" sonata form is the result of an insertion of a slow movement (sometimes compared to the Lento sostenuto of Chopin‚Äôs Fantasy in F minor) between exposition and development and a cyclic recurrence of the slow movement theme between recapitulation and coda in order to achieve unity. Since this afterthought of Liszt does not quite agree with the initial intentions, the result is a somewhat loose rhapsodic structure with interlinked sections held together by a few insertions. Liszt did not smooth out those \\"rough edges.\\" He simply used some of the thematic material to compose an entirely new work in similar large-scale form ‚Äî the Sonata in B minor. Here the form convinces because the thematic ideas have been contrived to match each other, which makes the thematic transformation, already apparent in the Grosses Concert-Solo and many earlier works, more natural. In contrast to the Grosses Concert-Solo the accompaniment figurations in the sonata are permeated by thematic allusions resulting in a more logically compelling development of ideas. It is typical for Liszt that he did not destroy the earlier solo work (Grosses Concert-Solo) but rearranged it in the two-piano version Concerto path√©tique. Since Liszt had projected a piano concerto version but dropped the plan, the two-piano arrangement can be seen as a sort of compromise. In this version Liszt seems to have been more interested in the concerto-like effects of the two-piano ensemble than in structural innovations, because he left the overall design of the solo version unaltered. The suggestion of a concerto version can be detected in various remarks such as quasi arpa, quasi timpani, etc., and the fact that the first piano part is more virtuosic throughout. Later concerto arrangers, like Eduard Reuss (1885, corrected by Liszt (S.365a)), Richard Burmeister (1898) or G√°bor Darvas (1952), have usually incorporated the second piano part into the orchestra part. Despite the structural relationship between the Concerto path√©tique and the Sonata, Liszt always rejected the idea of a preconceived form. In his Faust Symphony, which employs related thematic material, he does not attempt to write another \\"four-movement-in-one\\" work.  Concert piece or concerto?  The word concert(o), except for its spelling, is the only consistent part of the various titles of the Concerto path√©tique, though its meaning is open to interpretation. The German word Concert (modern spelling Konzert) could mean both concert and concerto, but the titles Grosses Concert-Solo or Grand solo de concert seem just to denote a large-scale concert piece (as opposed to a short salon piece for example), whereas Concerto path√©tique calls to mind a concerto. The prefix Concert (Konzert) or the French de concert could also mean a concerto-like and/or one-movement work for solo and orchestra (such as Schumann's Konzertst√ºck and Konzert-Allegro, Chopin's Allegro de concert, or Weber's Konzertst√ºck, one of Liszt's \\"war horses\\"). Such a Konzertst√ºck (concertino) form seems to be indicated by the title Morceau de concert [sic] (pour piano sans orchestre). The existence of sketches (in Liszt‚Äôs hand) for a piano concerto version of the Grosses Concert-Solo give evidence to the concerto character of the solo version. Liszt was not the only composer to have written a \\"concerto without orchestra\\". The term concerto might also point to certain formal procedures. Liszt‚Äôs later addition of the Andante sostenuto part to the solo version results in sectional tempo (and mood) changes somewhat related to a baroque concerto. Another heritage from the baroque age is the idea of competing forces (solo against orchestra for example). The two-piano medium is excellently suited for projecting this concert style (also recognized by Stravinsky's Concerto per due pianoforti soli or Busoni's Duettino concertante). In a solo piece the idea of struggling forces would be expressed by different moods (registers, modes, keys, dynamics, tempos, etc.) pitted against each other (the opposing characters in Faust). It cannot be doubted that there exists more than just a technical connotation of the term concerto for Liszt's unlimited imagination. The adjective grand could mean large-scale and/or indicate a certain grandeur of character, expression, or style. It is commonly used by Romantic composers (Chopin's Grande polonaise brillante). But the German gro√ü does not have that connotation in Grosses Concert-Solo.

It was segregated from Lentinus in the broad taxonomic sense, hence the derivation of the name. Biologically Neolentinus species produce a brown rot type of decay of wood, whereas Lentinus causes a white rot. Molecular phylogenetic analysis shows that the two genera are unrelated. Neolentinus is phylogenetically allied to other brown rot genera such as Gloeophyllum, Heliocybe, and Veluticeps. A new order, the Gloeophyllales, has been described for these fungi. Heliocybe had been placed in synonymy but it differs phylogenetically and anatomically by the lack of clamp connections that all Neolentinus produce on their generative hyphae. Species The best known species in this genus is Neolentinus lepideus, sometimes known as the \\"train wrecker\\", a name coined because the fungus is one of the few decay fungi that can grow on creosote- treated railroad ties. Neolentinus lepideus also grows on timbers in old mines, but because it requires light to form its cap, the fungus forms bizarre growth forms when fruit bodies start to form in dark mine shafts or cellars. Neolentinus lepideus is widely distributed. Neolentinus kauffmanii decays sitka spruce on the west coast of North America, producing a variation of brown rot called brown pocket rot. Neolentinus ponderosus is another western North American species found on the ground, growing from the roots of or growing from the stumps of pine, predominantly Pinus ponderosa in montane areas. In California, it is often solitary, common in the Sierra, and is rare at low elevations. The fruiting commences from late spring to late summer. Sought out when young and tender, it has an excellent taste. Neolentinus dactyloides is a fire ecology species that fruits from massive subterranean pseudosclerotia in Australia. Etymology Neolentinus means the new (Latin - neo-) Lentinus. Lentinus is an older generic name historically applied to a broad group of agarics, and now restricted in application excluding Neolentinus.

It is located in the south end of Cagayan de Oro City, about eight kilometers away. Composed of the two main caverns, it is situated on the eastern side of Cagayan de Oro River, along the brow of a vertical limestone cliff. The skeletal fragment from these caves were found belong to a child and a woman who inhabited in 377 A.D. This was based on the acid racemization done by Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, California, USA.  Heritage  Huluga is more than 80-feet high. It has an area of 50 meters across it northern and southern parts and measures 40 meters from the western edge of the precipice to the eastern slope. Cogon grass covers much of the area with big balete trees on both the northern and southern flanks. According to the Heritage Conservation Advocates, is \\"the home of the original native people of Cagayan de Oro City\\". It is considered by many people, to be a sacred site which lacks protection and guidance by the government. Inside, they have found native tools such as glass beads, spoons, pendants, bracelets, stone tools, axe tip and pieces of iron. In 1977, Burton sent bone samples taken from the caves for acid racemization to the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California in San Diego, California, and the sample was traced to 1600 BP or 377 A.D. Experts at the National Museum earlier said they were convinced that these caves were used by early Cagayanons from the late Neolithic Age to the Iron Age. At present, archeological artifacts can still be retrieved at the damaged portion of the open site. Antonio Montalvan II, a former commissioner at the City Hall's Historical Commission, said no pits were ever dug by scientists at the open site but only surface scans. \\"It is therefore possible that the site will still yield unearthed artifacts and evidences of prehistoric Cagayan culture. This was in fact one of the recommendations of the National Museum team,\\" he said. Aside from its continuing archeological yields, the Huluga Site is believed to have been the site of prehistoric Cagayan de Oro known in written historical documents as \\"Himologan\\". When the Spanish soldiers and Augustinian friars arrived in Cagayan in the year 1622, there was no town in the area that existed. They founded only a large cave fortress called Himologan. It was only in 1626 that Himologan's chief, Datu Salangsang and his people were persuaded by Fray Agustin de San Pedro to move the town site to the present-day Gaston Park and the San Agustin Cathedral.

Now retired from teaching, he was Professor of Modern Literature at Trinity College, Dublin until 2005. Since his retirement he has been titled \\"Professor Emeritus\\" by Trinity College. He is father to one daughter, Doodle Kennelly and is also grandfather to Doodle's three daughters: Meg, Hannah and Grace. Early life Kennelly was born in Ballylongford, County Kerry, on 17 April 1936 and was educated at the inter-denominational St. Ita's College, Tarbert, County Kerry, and at Trinity College, where he edited Icarus. Kennelly graduated from Trinity and wrote his PhD thesis there. He also studied at Leeds University. Brendan was married to Margaret (Peggy) O'Brien for 18 years, Peggy was Brendan's colleague in the English Department at Trinity College. They lived together in Sandymount, Dublin, with daughter Doodle for 12 years before separating. Brendan and Peggy remain friends and Peggy is now remarried. Peggy is a published poet and Professor of English at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. Poetry Kennelly's poetry can be scabrous, down-to-earth and colloquial. He avoids intellectual pretension and literary posturing, and his attitude to poetic language could be summed up in the title of one of his epic poems, \\"Poetry my Arse\\". Another long (400-page) epic poem, \\"The Book of Judas\\", published in 1991, topped the Irish best- seller list. A prolific and fluent writer, he has more than fifty books of poetry to his credit, including My Dark Fathers (1964), Collection One: Getting Up Early (1966), Good Souls to Survive (1967), Dream of a Black Fox (1968), Love Cry (1972), The Voices (1973), Shelley in Dublin (1974), A Kind of Trust (1975), Islandman (1977), A Small Light (1979) and The House That Jack Didn't Build (1982). Kennelly has edited several other anthologies, including \\"Between Innocence and Peace: Favourite Poems of Ireland\\" (1993), \\"Ireland's Women: Writings Past and Present, with Katie Donovan and A. Norman Jeffares\\" (1994), and \\"Dublines,\\" with Katie Donovan (1995). He has also written two novels, \\"The Crooked Cross\\" (1963) and \\"The Florentines\\" (1967), and three plays in a Greek Trilogy, Antigone, Medea and The Trojan Women. Kennelly is an Irish language (Gaelic) speaker, and has translated Irish poems in \\"A Drinking Cup\\" (1970) and \\"Mary\\" (Dublin 1987). A selection of his collected translations was published as \\"Love of Ireland: Poems from the Irish\\" (1989). Style Language is important in Kennelly's work ‚Äì in particular the vernacular of the small and isolated communities in North Kerry where he grew up, and of the Dublin streets and pubs where he became both roamer and raconteur for many years. Kennelly's language is also grounded in the Irish-language poetic tradition, oral and written, which can be both satirical and salacious in its approach to human follies. Regarding the oral tradition, Kennelly is a great reciter of verse with tremendous command and the rare ability to recall extended poems by memory, both his own work and others, and recite them on call verbatim. Kennelly has commented on his own use of language: \\"Poetry is an attempt to cut through the effects of deadening familiarity and repeated, mechanical usage in order to unleash that profound vitality, to reveal that inner sparkle. In the beginning was the Word. In the end will be the Word ... language is a human miracle always in danger of drowning in a sea of familiarity.\\" Awards and honours *1967 √Ü Memorial Prize *1988 Critics Special Harvey's Award *1996 IMPAC International Dublin Literary Award *1999 American Ireland Fund Literary Award *2003 The Ireland Funds of France Wild Geese Award *2010 Irish PEN Award List of works * Cast a Cold Eye (1959) with Rudi Holzapfel * The Rain, the Moon (1961) with Rudi Holzapfel * The Dark About Our Loves (1962) Rudi Holzapfel * Green Townlands (1963).

They are bulbous perennials, some evergreen, associated with rocky and arid habitats. They bear spherical umbels of lily-like flowers in shades from white through pink to crimson. In the case of deciduous species, the flowers may appear on naked stems before the leaves develop. Native to South Africa, there are about 20‚Äì30 species in the genus. Though described as lilies, they are not significantly related to the true lilies (Liliaceae), but more closely resemble their relatives, Amaryllis and Lycoris. The genus was established by the Revd. William Herbert in 1820. Nerines have been widely cultivated and much hybridized worldwide, especially Nerine bowdenii, N. sarniensis and N. undulata (previously known as N. flexuosa). The hybrid cultivar 'Zeal Giant' has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. The other 20 species are rarely cultivated and very little is known regarding their biology. Many species are threatened with extinction due to the loss or degradation of their habitat.  Description  Species of Nerine are herbaceous perennial bulbous flowering plants. In the case of deciduous species, the inflorescence may appear on naked stems before the leaves develop (hysteranthy), otherwise they appear together with the flowers (synanthy) or afterwards. The bulbs may have a short neck, but this is absent in other species. The leaves are filiform (threadlike) (as in N. filifolia; Figure 1D) to linear and flat and strap-shaped (as in N. humilis; Figure 2C). Their flowers, which are few, are borne in spherical umbels on a solid leafless stem (scape or peduncle). The stem may be slender or robust, and rarely minutely puberulous (hairy), with two lanceolate (lance shaped) spathe- valves (spathal bracts) surrounding the inflorescence. The pedicels (flower stalks) may be glabrous (hairy) or smooth, a feature used in differentiating species. Individual flowers are lily-like, generally with a perianth that is zygomorphic (with one plane of symmetry) but may be actinomorphic (radially symmetrical or \\"regular\\"). Each flower is flared, usually with a short extended or recurved perianth tube, consisting of six narrow white, pink or red tepals (perianth segments) joined at the base to form the tube. The free parts of the tepals are generally narrowly oblanceolate (wider near tip) and undulate (wavy) with crisped (curly) margins. The six stamens may be declinate (curvy) or erect, are unequal and are inserted into the base of the tepals, and are connate (fused) at their bases, frequently protruding from the flower. The stamen filaments are thin and filiform, but may be appendiculate (bearing appendages) at their base, a feature that is also important in differentiating species. Their anthers are versatile (swinging freely) and oblong and attach to the filament at the back (dorsifixed). The pollen is bisulcate (two grooves). The inferior ovary is subglobose (slightly flattened sphere) and trilocular (three-lobed or three locules), with one to four ovules in each loculus. The style is filiform, straight or declinate and has an obscurely tricuspidate (three tipped) stigmatose apex. The fruit is a subglobose dry loculicidal dehiscent capsule, that produces between one and a few seeds per loculus that are globose to ovoid, red-green and often viviparous (begin to develop before separating). Chromosome number: 11 (2n=22), but rarely 2n=24 or triploids. Taxonomy =History= Herbert's 1820 illustration of N. rosea (N. sarniensis) Nerine sarniensis The first description was in 1635 by French botanist Jacques-Philippe Cornut, who examined Narcissus japonicus rutilo flor (N. sarniensis), a plant he found in the garden of the Paris nurseryman, Jean Morin in October 1634. In 1680 Scottish botanist Robert Morison gave an account of a shipment from Japan being washed ashore. In 1725 James Douglas FRS published an account in his A Description of the Guernsey Lilly, as it was known then. Douglas gave it the Latin name Lilio-Narcissus Sarniensis Autumno florens. Linnaeus called this Amaryllis sarniensis in 1753, after Douglas' usage, one of nine species he assigned to this genus. The earliest published name for the genus was Imhofia, given by Lorenz Heister in 1755. The later name Nerine, published by William Herbert in 1820, was widely used, resulting in a decision to conserve the name Nerine and reject the name Imhofia (nom. rej.). Herbert was unaware of Heister's work initially in 1820, but noting that Heister had not defined it and it had not been adopted, transferred the name to Amaryllis marginata, retaining Nerine for N. sarniensis and renaming A. marginata Imhofia marginata (now Brunsvigia marginata). Herbert's main role was in untangling a number of distinct genera that Linnaeus had included under Amaryllis. Although in Herbert's description of Nerine rosea there, he attempted to distinguish it from N. sarniensis, the former is now accepted as a synonym of the latter, the accepted name. When Herbert chose the name of these nymphs for the first species of the genus, Nerine sarniensis, he alluded to the story of how this South African species arrived on the island of Guernsey in the English Channel. It is said that a ship carrying boxes of the bulbs of this species destined for the Netherlands was shipwrecked on Guernsey. The boxes of bulbs were washed up on the island and the bulbs became established and multiplied around the coast. Herbert eventually recognised nine species. At that time Amaryllis (and hence Nerine) were placed in the family Amaryllideae, following the classification of de Candolle (1813). Herbert's main interests were in the taxonomy of amaryllids, publishing a monograph on this in 1837, considering Amaryllideae as one of seven suborders of Amaryllidaceae. He then further subdivided this suborder into groups, placing Nerine and Amaryllis together with twelve other genera into the Amaryllidiformes. In his extensive treatment of Nerine he divided the nine species he recognised into two sections, Regulares and Distortae, of which only N. humilis and N. undulata are still in use. He had also begun a breeding program and described seven hybrids he had raised. His enthusiasm for the genus is evident in that he chose to illustrate the front of the book with one of his hybrids, N. mitchamiae (see illustration). New species continued to be described so that by the time Traub published his monograph in 1967, he identified 30 species. Other authors, including Norris (1974) and Duncan (2002), have identifiied 31 and 25 species respectively. At one stage 53 species were described. Snijman and Linder (1996), who used a cladistic analysis of 33 characteristics and chromosome number, reduced this to 23, assigning many of these species to varietal status. They considered Nerine to be characterised by zygomorphic flowers with attenuated tepals and crisped margins. = Phylogeny = In the APG IV system (2016), the genus Nerine is placed in the subfamily Amaryllidoideae of a broadly defined family Amaryllidaceae. Within the subfamily, Nerine is placed in the Southern African tribe Amaryllideae. The phylogenetic relationships of the Amaryllideae have been investigated through molecular analysis of DNA combined with morphological data. This cladistic analysis has demonstrated that Nerine belongs to a monophyletic group forming subtribe Strumariinae. The members of this clade all originate from South Africa and often have prostrate leaves, fused stamens forming a tube towards the base of the flower, dehiscent fruit, and seeds with a well developed seed coat and chlorophyll. Within the Strumariinae, Nerine is most closely related to Brunsvigia Heist., Namaquanula D. & U. M√ºll.-Doblies and Hessea Herb. The genera of Strumariinae are related as in this cladogram, with number of species in each genus in (parentheses): = Subdivision = Attempts to generate an infrageneric classification (such as those of Traub's four sections and Norris' twelve groups) based on morphological characteristics alone relied on the presence of appendages to the bases of the stamen filaments, the presence of hairs on the ovary, scape and pedicels, together with the shape and arrangement of perianth segments. Traub divided the genus into four subgeneric sections, Nerine, Laticomae, Bowdeniae and Appendiculatae. For instance the six taxa of Laticomae were grouped on the basis of filaments that were not distinctly appendiculate or otherwise modified at the base and scapes that were relatively short and stout. Much of the modern understanding of the genus comes from the work of Graham Duncan and colleagues at SANBI, Kirstenbosch. In 2002 Duncan grouped the species of Nerine by growth cycle, with three distinct patterns. Nerine species can be either evergreen or deciduous, the deciduous species either growing during the winter or the summer. Zonnefeld and Duncan (2006) examined the total amount of nuclear DNA by flow cytometry in 81 accessions from 23 species. When the species were arranged by DNA content, five groupings (A‚ÄìE) were apparent, that correlated with growth cycle and leaf width, but only two of the other characteristics (filament appendages and hairy pedicels). Traub's sections were not confirmed, although a slightly better agreement was found with Norris' groups. Leaf width fell into two main groups, narrow (1‚Äì4 mm) or broad (6‚Äì37 mm). When taken together these characteristics confirm Duncan's original three groups based on growth cycle alone. The first of these is the largest of these groups, correspomding to DNA groups A, B and C, with 13 species, and contains narrow-leafed evergreen nerines that retain their leaves throughout the summer and winter. They contain the lowest amount of DNA per nucleus. The second group corresponds to DNA group D with four broad-leafed deciduous winter growing species. They contain an intermediate amount of DNA. A third group (DNA group E) has six broad-leafed sunmmer growing deciduous species that have no leaves in the winter. They contain the highest amount of DNA. The two broad-leaved groups are also distinguished by the absence of filamentous appendages and glabrous pedicels, although two of the species have hairs on the pedicels, but these are minute or sparse. The first group (the evergreens) can then be considered to have three subgroups corresponding to DNA groups A, B and C but also by other characteristics. N. marincowitzii is an outlier being summer growing but narrow-leafed. The other outlier is N. pusilla which is narrow-leafed despite being summer growing. N. duparquetiana has at times been considered to be a synonym of N. laticoma but was restored to species status here. N. huttoniae is another species whose status is disputed, but here is treated (as Traub did) as a subspecies of N. laticoma, a status subsequently confirmed. Two species of doubtful status were not accessed, N. transvaalensis and N. hesseoides. Based on morphology, geography and DNA content they concluded that there were in fact 23 species, in contrast to the large number of subspecies considered by Traub.  Species list  , the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families (WCLSPF) recognises 24 species and The Plant List (TPL), 25 (for explanation of the discrepancy, see Notes).

One of these hybrids is √ó Amarine tubergenii Sealy, which comes from a cross between Amaryllis belladonna and Nerine bowdenii. = Etymology = The genus name given to it by Herbert in 1820 derives from the Nereids (sea-nymphs) of Greek mythology that protected sailors and their ships. Herbert combined Morison's account of the plant being washed ashore from a shipwreck with Renaissance poetry, alluding to the rescue of Vasco da Gama‚Äôs ship by a Nereid in the epic poem of Cam√µes, Os Lusiadas. Although bearing the name \\"lily\\" in the vernacular, Nerine is only distantly related to the true lilies (Lilium) of the lily family, Liliaceae, sensu stricto. Instead they are one of many genera placed in the amaryllid lily family, Amaryllidaceae, such as the closely related Amaryllis, and Lycoris. These were once part of the much larger construction of Liliaceae sensu lato. The name \\"spider lily\\" is shared by a number of different genera within Amaryllidaceae. For instance, Lycoris aurea may be sold under its earlier synonym, Nerine aurea.  Distribution and habitat Nerine are native to Southern Africa, their distribution range being from the Cape Peninsula in the south to Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia and Swaziland to the northwest and northeast of South Africa, occupying all nine provinces of South Africa. (see distribution maps in Zonneveld & Duncan, 2006). They prefer rocky, arid and mesic habitats, and most species are found in the summer rainfall region.  Ecology  Nerine species form three distinct growth patterns, namely winter- growing, summer-growing and evergreen species. While the flowers are generally pink, a red colour is an adaptation to a pollinator, the butterfly Aeropetes tulbaghia.  Conservation  N. masoniorum Some Nerine species from Eastern Cape Province are naturally rare, but they are not considered to be in immediate danger of extinction. These include the winter-growing species N. pudica that inhabits inaccessible locations in the Du Toitskloof and Sonderend mountains, and the summer-growing N. marincowitzii that originates from the semi-arid Karoo region. A number of evergreen nerine species from areas of South Africa that have summer rain are in danger due to the loss or degradation of their habitat and at least two or three of them are on the verge of extinction. Nerine masoniorum is probably the most critically threatened and it may even have become extinct as the area occupied by the only surviving colony has been used for the construction of housing. Another species that is seriously threatened is N. gibsonii from Eastern Cape Province as the grasslands that it grows in have been seriously damaged by overgrazing and erosion resulting from the construction of paths and roads. In addition, this species rarely produces seeds as grazing cattle eat the flowers as soon as they appear. Various measures have been taken to relieve the threat of extinction from these species. One of these measures, thanks to their ease of cultivation, is the ex situ conservation of a number of populations of N. filamentosa, N. gibsonii, N. gracilis, N. huttoniae and N. masoniorum in the Kirstenbosch botanical garden. Another measure, this time relating to in situ cultivation is the official protection of some species in nature reserves, such as has happened for N. platypetala in the south of Mpumalanga. In Guernsey, the national flower is Nerine sarniensis, and the island collection of nerines is seeking recognition by National Council for the Conservation of Plants and Gardens as a national collection.  Cultivation  William Herbert's hybrid, N. mitchamiae (left) from Frontispiece to his Amaryllidaceae 1837 Breeding and hybridisation of Nerine began as early as the beginning of the nineteenth century with the work of William Herbert. A number of the species of this genus are cultivated as ornamentals, such as N. sarniensis, N. undulata (N. flexuosa) and Nerine bowdenii. N. sarniensis is, probably, the best known species of the genus and it has been cultivated in Europe since the beginning of the 17th Century. N. bowdenii was introduced to England at the end of the 19th Century and used as an ornamental since the first decade of the 20th Century. Along with Nerine bowdenii they have been extensively used in plant breeding programmes that have produced the majority of the commercially available hybrids. The hybrid cultivar 'Zeal Giant' has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. The bulbs of Nerine species need a minimum of two years growth and development in order to produce their first flowers. The largest bulbs can give rise to two stems or more if they have been grown under suitable conditions. They are used as cut flowers as they can survive up to 14 days in a vase with water without showing any staining.  Uses  Nerine species and hybrids with their colourful long- lasting blooms are grown commercially for the cut-flower industry and sale of ornamental bulbs.

It is southeast of the village of Croughton. The station is home to the 422nd Air Base Group and operates one of Europe's largest military switchboards and processes approximately a third of all U.S. military communications in Europe. History = Early years = RAF Croughton was built in 1938, and was originally known as Brackley Landing Ground until 1940 when it became RAF Brackley. In July 1941 the name changed again and the station became RAF Croughton. It consisted of consolidated from three farms. Three grass runways with concrete taxiways dominated the high ground with the tower and other infrastructure buildings along the north side of the station and the slope leading up to the runways. In June 1940 the station became a satellite for RAF Upper Heyford for No. 16 Operational Training Unit (No. 16 OTU) to provide the unit with extra airfield space for night-flying training. Much of this training was for Commonwealth pilots (Canadians, South Africans, Australians, and New Zealanders) on Handley Page Hampdens, Bristol Blenheims, and Vickers Wellington bombers. The unit fell under the operational control of the newly formed No. 7 Group RAF of RAF Bomber Command. =Second World War= In September 1940 the Air Ministry decided that certain stations would be designated as emergency airfields. These stations would give assistance to any operational aircraft returning damaged or with engine problems. The Station Commander at RAF Upper Heyford received one of these orders. RAF Brackley (Croughton) would remain open with its flare paths illuminated irrespective of enemy activity in the area. This meant that RAF Brackley along with other emergency airfields attracted additional enemy night attacks. Added to this accepted high risk was the fact that RAF Brackley was a training airfield. During the war both sides considered it worthwhile to attack and disrupt training programmes. Because training fields and aircraft were lightly defended, they made for easier targets. For these reasons, it was not uncommon for the station or training crews conducting night training to receive the attention of the Luftwaffe. While the station remained a satellite for RAF Upper Heyford and No. 16 OTU until July 1942 and even partially re-equipped with Wellington bombers, its future had already changed. No. 23 Squadron of RAF Flying Training Command (FTC) was desperately seeking a suitable airfield to re-house its No. 1 Glider Training School (No. 1 GTS). Its then home was a small airfield at RAF Thame in Buckinghamshire and FTC felt it inadequate for glider training. Several airfields in the near vicinity made the short list, but RAF Croughton became the new home for the gliders. On 19 July 1942, No. 1 GTS began to move in and by 1 August 1942 they were settled into their new home. During this training Hawker Hectors, North American Harvards, and Miles Masters pulled General Aircraft Hotspur gliders, while Douglas Dakotas pulled the larger Airspeed Horsa gliders. With this new mission came a far stricter training regime and standards than that usually found at an RAF training station. The reason for this was the dual roles required of the glider pilots. They would receive twelve weeks of basic flying training, before moving to one of the GTS. Training at the GTS took another twelve weeks. From there they would move onto their operational units. In addition to flying the gliders, pilots had to be as highly trained and disciplined as infantry troops. This way they could make a positive contribution to the battle after landing in the assault areas. However, they would only remain in the assault area until their recovery. By the end of 1942 the RAF thought it had enough trained glider pilots, at least for foreseeable operational need. There was now a large number of trained glider pilots and this led to its own problems and another change in the station's mission. Airspeed Oxford As the last class passed out of RAF Croughton on 24 March 1943, the glider school closed down. It continued to be a training base, but now it was a satellite for Kidlington in Oxfordshire where the No. 20 (Pilots) Advanced Flying Unit RAF (AFU) gave refresher or advanced training to pilots. Established in 1942, the AFUs provided refresher courses to pilots trained overseas under the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan. It also gave newly qualified pilots experience with flying in British weather and handling heavier aircraft. With the No. 20 AFU, this meant the Airspeed Oxford. Pilots training with these aircraft knew they were destined for either Bomber or Coastal Command. On 15 April 1943 No. 1538 (Beam Approach Training) Flight RAF (No.15 BATF) formed at RAF Croughton and added to the station's training mission. Before this many of the pilots training with No. 20 AFU received their Beam Approach Training at RAF Feltwell. Both No. 1538 BATF and No. 20 AFU remained at RAF Croughton until 18 October 1944 when the airfield returned to Flying Training Command. On this date No. 1538 BATF disbanded and No. 20 AFU retired to Kidlington. RAF Flying Training Command needed the station to reform No. 1 Glider Training School. The decision to reopen glider training came about when the army finally agreed that the glider pilots should be RAF. From the beginning both the RAF and Army had differing opinions as to who should pilot the gliders. The Army felt the Glider Pilot Regiment was an elite force and that the pilots should be from the Army or at the very least trained to the same standard. The Army even rejected a proposal from the RAF to have a RAF pilot sit in the second pilot or co-pilot seat. This changed after Operation Market Garden. Hotspur Glider During the Arnhem portion of that operation 460 glider pilots were either killed or captured, with another 150 wounded. The Army agreed to let the RAF help fill the vacancies in the Glider Pilot Regiment. Of the planned 1,000 trained glider pilot target figure, to be reached by April 1945, the RAF proposed to fill 500. No. 1 GTS arrived at RAF Croughton on 1 November 1944. Training continued until after the war and even included the addition of a Glider Instructor Flight. During August 1945 No. 1 GTS came under the command of No. 21 Heavy Glider Conversion Unit RAF at RAF Brize Norton. Flying and training ceased on 25 May 1946. With No. 1 GTS leaving RAF Croughton, its remaining aircraft, Hotspurs and Masters worth preserving, moved to No. 3 GTS at RAF Wellesbourne Mountford. =Postwar ‚Äì United States Air Force use= RAF Croughton Front Gate Sign, 1977. From 1947 to 1950 the Station remained fairly quiet and forgotten except for its occasional use as an ammunitions store. That all changed towards the end of 1950 when the USAF took over the station when the 1969th Communications Squadron at RAF South Ruislip formed a detachment at RAF Croughton. This began RAF Croughton's new communications mission. Over the next several decades the units stationed at RAF Croughton changed many times, but the mission remained communications. In 1955 this detachment became the 1230th Airways and Air Communications Service Squadron (AACS). As part of the establishment of the Air Force Communication Service as a separate major command, Air Force Communications Command, in 1961, the 1230 AACS redesignated to become the 2130th Communications Squadron (CS). In just over ten years the mission and unit grew to the point that it needed to redesignate to the 2130th Communications Group (CG). By 1977, the 2130 CG controlled USAF communication resources from as far south as Cornwall, England and as far north as Keflav√≠k, Iceland. 2168 Communications Squadron Patch. With the formation of the 2147th Communications Group at RAF Mildenhall and the realignment of many squadrons, detachments, and Operating Locations in 1980, the 2130 CG inactivated. Several communications missions at RAF Croughton, like the Defense Communications System, and Global Command and Control Radio System, combined with the responsibility for their maintenance falling on the 2168th Communications Squadron at RAF Upper Heyford. This changed again with the reactivation of the 2130th Communications Squadron on 1 July 1983 to manage the communications missions at RAF Croughton. The mission increased in December 1985 when the Giant Talk station at RAF Croughton began operations. In mid-1986 the 2130 CS again redesignated to become the 2130th Communications Group. In 1991, RAF Croughton housed US Aeromedical Evacuation personnel in support of Operation Desert Storm. The beginning of 1993 saw several big changes for RAF Croughton. Most of these had to do with mission support. With the projected inactivation of the 20th Fighter Wing at RAF Upper Heyford and closure of that station the 2130 CG redesignated to the 630th Communications Squadron. This new squadron functionally aligned under the 100th Communications Group (CG) at RAF Mildenhall. However, this was no ordinary communications squadron. Before the closure of RAF Upper Heyford, RAF Croughton had relied on the larger base for administrative support to one degree or another. The closure of RAF Upper Heyford forced the squadron to look for ways to be as self-sufficient as possible. To handle most day-to-day support functions, the squadron had its own finance, personnel, supply, and other support elements. It became a mini- station. During this time RAF Croughton received most of its mission support from the 100 CG as well as some from the 100th Regional Support Group (RSG). Both of these units resided at RAF Mildenhall under the 100th Air Refueling Wing (ARW). This changed on 1 July 1994 when United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) conducted another command-wide reorganization. One result of this reorganization was the inactivation of the 100 RSG, its subordinate squadrons and the 100 CG. In their place, USAFE activated the 603d Regional Support Group as an independent group directly under Third Air Force. This in turn forced the redesignation of the 630 CS to the 603rd Communications Squadron. The end of 1995 saw USAFE clarifying the roles and missions of the numbered air forces. This resulted in a change that led to the alignment of three UK and one Norway Geographically Separate Units (GSUs) under the 100 ARW. Third Air Force issued an order, effective 24 May 1996, assigning all personnel formally attached to the 603 RSG and its subordinates to the 100 ARW for administrative control. For RAF Croughton this led to the inactivation of the 603 CS and the activation of the 422nd Air Base Squadron (422 ABS) on 1 August 1996. = 21st century = The RAF Croughton dish in 2007 On 14 January 2004, the 420th Air Base Group (420 ABG) was established at RAF Fairford to improve the oversight and advocacy of GSUs that had been aligned beneath the 100 ARW to include the 422 ABS. The 420 ABG reported directly to 3rd Air Force until 26 May 2004, when the 38th Combat Support Wing (38 CSW) was established to provide oversight/advocacy on behalf of three GSU groups. The 38 CSW and 420 ABG were responsible for the day-to-day operations of the 422 ABS and RAF Croughton. On 12 May 2005, the 422 ABG became a unit of the 501st Combat Support Wing (501 CSW) when the 501 CSW replaced the 38 CSW. This change was made to functionally align all major Geographically Separate Units (GSUs) in England. This created the 422 ABG in charge of the 422nd Air Base Squadron, the 422nd Communications Squadron, the 422nd Civil Engineering Squadron and the 422nd Security Forces Squadron. In 2012 a 2.5 gigabits per second data circuit was established to Camp Lemonnier in Djibouti, U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM) only permanent military base in Africa. In November 2013 Tom Watson MP, was reported as saying that there was: \\"an urgent need for \\"public scrutiny\\" of the activities at RAF Croughton. The US Air Force station is a major hub for American military and clandestine communications\\". It is reported to have been central to the monitoring of the mobile phone of the German Chancellor Angela Merkel.Urgent review needed of RAF base used to handle US spy data, says MP Tom Watson, The Independent, Thursday 7 November 2013; retrieved 8 November 2013 In December 2013 The Independent reported that the base was used to relay U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and National Security Agency communications, and it was a key intelligence facility in the UK. In 2014 byelaws were enacted by statutory instrument prohibited various activities in and around the base. National Review (an American publication) refers in a July 2015 story to: 'the Joint Intelligence Analysis Center (JIAC), an \\"intelligence fusion center\\" that Congress approved for construction at UK airbase RAF Croughton. The facility would bring together intelligence analysts from U.S. European Command (EUCOM), AFRICOM, and NATO under one roof, fostering a level of collaboration military commanders say is crucial to confronting Russian aggression and Islamic fundamentalism in Africa'. http://www.nationalreview.com/article/421842/devin-nunes-pentagon- fight-lajes-air-force-base In 2016 the United States Department of Defense announced that a ¬£200 million Joint Intelligence Analysis Centre would be built at the base, to house up to 1,250 staff analysing intelligence from Europe and Africa, some transferred from the Joint Analysis Center at RAF Molesworth. However an Office of the Inspector General investigation found that financial analysis leading to this decision was inaccurate, and as of 2019 the decision is being reviewed. The 2017 Office of the Inspector General report recorded that the base provided command, control, communications, and computer support to Department of Defense and civilian agencies across Europe, and was staffed by about 265 U.S. military personnel, 140 Department of Defense civilians, and 200 UK Ministry of Defence employees. It provided about 25% of all European to United States military communications. In August 2019 Harry Dunn, a local teenager, was killed in a collision with a vehicle driven on the wrong side of the road by Anne Sacoolas, the wife of a US government employee working at the United States Air Force listening station at the base.https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/08/dominic-raab-urges-us- to-reconsider-anne-sacoolas-immunity After initially co-operating with police, Sacoolas left the country in haste asserting diplomatic immunity. The family of the victim travelled to the United States to pursue the matter, and were invited to the White House where the President, Donald Trump, attempted unsuccessfully to surprise them into a meeting with Sacoolas. In December 2019 the Crown Prosecution Service announced that Sacoolas would be charged with causing death by dangerous driving, and the Home Office requested her extradition; in January 2020 it became clear that there had been many similar incidents in the vicinity of RAF Croughton, and friends of the victim gathered to demonstrate outside the base, while on 24 January the USA refused extradition. On 9 July 2020 an adjournment debate on RAF Croughton, in the House of Commons, was led by local Member of Parliament Andrea Leadsom, who called for the expansion of the airbase to be stopped and for the base entrance to be moved to the A43 main road.  Role and operations  RAF Croughton houses the 422nd Air Base Group whose function is to provide installation support, services, force protection, and worldwide communications across the entire spectrum of operations. The group is located in the UK and supports NATO, US European Command, US Central Command, Air Force Special Operations Command, US Department of State operations and Ministry of Defence operations. The group sustains more than 450 C2 circuits and supports 25 percent of all European Theater to continental United States (CONUS) communications.

It is situated on the River Suir and R665 regional road. The Catholic parish of Ardfinnan is made up of three areas: Ardfinnan, Ballybacon, and Grange. Ardfinnan is also a civil parish in the ancient barony of Iffa and Offa West.Placesnames Database of Ireland - Ardfinnan civil parish The village is located 14 kilometers from the town of Clonmel and six miles from Cahir via the R670 road. The population of the village is approximately 900 people.

At the weekend there are three buses each way.  7th century abbey  Saint Finian Lobhar (or Finian the Leper) founded an abbey for Canons Regular of Saint Augustine with a leper colony here in the early 7th century, high up on the site of the now present castle, known as F√≠on√°in's height, where the village gets its name. In 908, King of Munster Cormac mac Cuilenn√°in bequeathed one ounce of gold, one ounce of silver, his horses, armour and sword to the abbey. The abbey was plundered and burnt by Cambro-Normans during the Norman Invasion of Ireland in 1178. A Carmelite abbey was later built on the opposite side of the river valley, known as Lady's Abbey, of which its ruin is still extant after it was destroyed during the English Reformation. There was also a monastery for Franciscan Friars, Third Order Regular. Ardfinnan Castle A prominent feature of the village is the Anglo-Norman Ardfinnan Castle, the sister castle to Lismore Castle and was built by Prince John of England in 1185 to guard the river crossing. The 13 arch bridge was started soon after the castle was completed. The castle has a long and varied history of owners and is inhabited to the present. The castle is a private residence and is not open to the public. Economy = Mulcahy-Redmond & Co. = Illustration of corn mill leased by the Prendergasts - Mid 19th century The former Ardfinnan Woollen Mills of Mulcahy-Redmond & Co., which produced its renowned Ardfinnan tweeds and suitings was established in the village in March 1869. It was built on the site of a former corn mill which had been in operation since before the Civil Survey of 1654 up until it was sold by the Prendergasts of Ardfinnan in the mid 19th century. The woollen mills became a leading firm in Irish textiles and was of great benefit to the village of Ardfinnan, providing employment to over 220 workers at its peak and electricity for streetlights and homes in the surrounding area long before the Rural Electrification Scheme was introduced. HM King Edward VII visited the mill in the 1900s. It closed in 1973. =Developments= Ardfinnan was a location, used by Atari, for the manufacture of wooden video game arcade cabinets from 1974 to 1984. At its height 200 workers were building 2,000 arcade cabinets a month at the location just outside the village. The plant in Ardfinnan closed in 1989.

In 2005 he was working as a freelance journalist in Basra, Iraq, reporting for The Christian Science Monitor, National Review, Mother Jones, Reason, Front Page and American Enterprise, among other publications, when he was abducted and murdered in southern Iraq after investigating corruption by Shia militias. Early life Vincent was born in Washington, DC, but his family would soon move to northern California. The family spent four years in Palo Alto before moving to Sunnyvale, now the heart of Silicon Valley, in 1960. He graduated from Homestead High School in 1974, went to the University of California, Santa Barbara, then to University of California, Berkeley, from which he graduated summa cum laude with a degree in English and Philosophy. After a summer spent traveling around Europe, he hitchhiked to New York in 1980 to pursue a writing career, supporting himself by taking a series of jobs in the restaurant industry, driving a cab and doing temp work. Writing career His first professional experience came when he was offered the editorship of a local newspaper, The East Villager. From 1984 to 1991 he wrote, edited, laid out and oversaw the publication of each month's edition; during his tenure he also became deeply involved in local issues, and successfully used the paper as a forum to influence neighborhood politics. In the late 1980s he began his career as a writer of fiction and essays, publishing in various literary magazines and booklets. In 1997, he received a Dactyl Foundation Award for his essay on Pop Art, \\"Listening to Pop.\\" He also self-published two issues of a poetry magazine, The Plowman. In 1990 he was hired by Art+Auction magazine, where he quickly became the senior writer, specializing in investigative stories of art theft, fraud, counterfeiting and malfeasance. After an abortive six-month stint at The Wall Street Journal, he returned to Art+Auction as a freelancer until his death. After watching United Flight 175 crash into the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, and the subsequent collapse of the Twin Towers, Vincent scaled back his art critic job to write instead about what he considered more timely and pressing issues. In 2003, after learning that his friend, the artist Steve Mumford, had gone to Baghdad following the start of the Iraq War, Vincent went as well, first in 2003, then again in 2004, operating freely as a journalist, traveling through the country without so much as a cell phone, interviewing the local populace, observing the reality of life on the ground. In 2004, he would publish In the Red Zone: A Journey Into the Soul of Iraq, as well as a blog about his travels. Vincent returned to Iraq in April 2005, this time to the south, basing himself in Basra as the only Western journalist in the region. Initially he pursued stories such as the reconstruction of the marshlands drained by Saddam Hussein, but in the process of meeting and speaking to locals on all levels, from people in the street to government officials, he uncovered and began investigating reports of Iran's growing logistical and financial support for the local insurgency and the unchecked movement over the border of Iranian agents, drug smuggling to support the area's militias, the killing of Basra's Christian populace, increasing corruption and violence in the local police force and the inexplicable unwillingness of the British forces stationed there to address such dangerous issues. Death On August 2, 2005, three months to the day after he had arrived, Vincent and his translator Nouriya Itais Wadi went to a Basra money exchange after spending the day doing interviews; when they came back out, they were kidnapped off the street in broad daylight by men in police uniforms driving a white police truck. They were bound, gagged, taken to an undisclosed location where for five hours they were beaten and interrogated, then taken to the outskirts of town and shot. They were found by British and Iraqi policemen but Vincent was dead, shot in the back at close range. Wadi survived despite having been shot three times, since she was farther from the truck when the men opened fire. It is generally accepted that Vincent was murdered because of his criticism of religious extremism in the area, expressed three days before his murder in \\"Switched Off in Basra\\", a July 31 op-ed for The New York Times, in which he noted the increasing infiltration of the Basra police force by Islamic extremists loyal to Muqtada al Sadr. Vincent is buried in Brooklyn's Green- Wood Cemetery; his widow, Lisa Ramaci-Vincent, to whom he was married from 1992 until his death, still lives in Manhattan. They had lived together in the East Village.Wong, Edward. \\"American Journalist Is Shot to Death in Iraq\\", The New York Times, August 3, 2005.

It is situated at the junction of Highway 47 and the Trans-Canada Highway 1 east of Regina, the provincial capital. It is south of the Qu'Appelle Valley where Crooked Lake Provincial Park (at Crooked Lake) and Bird's Point Resort (at Round Lake) are popular beach destinations in summer and are accessed by Highway 47.

Grenfell was incorporated as a town in 1911. It has a stable economic base and reasonable land prices. The community sent men to war in both the First and Second World Wars. They are remembered at the local cenotaph.Grenfell Cenotaph. Retrieved 18 November 2007. As in many other prairie towns, Chinese railworkers from the building of the CPR in the 1880s settled down and established local businesses: as late as the 1960s there were two Chinese caf√©s on Main Street. Grenfell is close enough to the provincial commercial and political metropole of Regina that its residents do not feel impossibly remote and can repair there when occasion demands; it is far enough away that a lively local community persists. The town has long been known for cultural vitality; in 1974 the University of Saskatchewan, Regina Campus choir gave a concert in the Community Hall with the audience filling the hall, students accommodated by town and farm families. Eminent provincial academics, lawyers, medical doctors, lieutenant- governors, musicians and artists either came from or spent time working in Grenfell. Geography Grenfell is located in the Indian Head Plain of the Aspen Parkland ecoregion on the parkland of the Qu'Appelle flood plain. Grenfell is within the topographical area of Weed Hills. The bedrock geology belongs to that of the Mannville Group, a stratigraphical unit of Cretaceous age in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin formed during the lower Cretaceous period. The area is characterised by lush rolling grasslands, interspersed with poplar bluffs (in prairie Canadian terminology poplar groves surrounding sloughs) and open sloughs. Sakimay First Nation consists of 11,295.2 ha located northeast of Grenfell and includes 1,340 people on the Sakimay, Shesheep, Little Bone and Minoachuk reserves. Grenfell Beach is located within the Sakimay Reserve area on Crooked Lake. =Climate= Grenfell has a humid continental climate. It has warm summers and cold winters. Snow cover generally lasts from November to March. Demographics The 2006 Statistics Canada data estimates the town's population at 947 residents, continuing a slight trend of population decline in the town since the 2001 Census, although unusual for prairie towns, Grenfell's population today is larger than in 1916. Of the current adult population, 43.7 per cent were male and 55.8 per cent were female. Children under five accounted for approximately 1.6 per cent of the resident population of Grenfell. Between 2001 and 2006, Grenfell's population decreased by 11.2 percent. During the same time period, the population of Saskatchewan decreased by 1.1 percent, while that of Canada grew by 5.4 percent. A recent economic boom in Saskatchewan and an atypical persistence of prosperity during the 2008 worldwide slump will have altered this trend. The population density of Grenfell averaged , compared with an average of for the province. According to data from 2001 (although with so small a population percentages are not especially informative) more than 12.1% of the town's residents identify themselves as Catholic; 37.5% of residents are Protestant, 4.2% are Christian and 3.2% of residents do not practise a religion. Whereas, the first settlers were from the British Isles and eastern Canada, later immigrants from Germany would also settle here. From 2006 to 2011, Grenfell population rebounded. This trend carried over to 2016. Younger adults moved into the town, as the median age fell from 54.4 in 2011 to 49.4 in 2016. Government The town of Grenfell has a mayor as the highest ranking government official. The town also elects aldermen or councillors to form the municipal council. Currently the mayor is Rod Wolfe, and is serving with councillors Constance MacKenzie, Corey Thiessen, Ken Hamnett, Patty Cole, Tyler Tomlinson and Wes Overand. The Chief Administrative Officer is Victoria McDonald. Provincially, Grenfell is within the constituency of Moosomin served by their Member of legislative assembly, the honourable Stephen Bonk. Federally, the Souris‚ÄîMoose Mountain riding is represented by their Member of Parliament, Robert Kitchen. Commerce By 1915, Grenfell hosted a flour mill company, one of 37 across the province. The CPR employed hundreds of Chinese labourers on its incremental westward growth from Ontario to British Columbia throughout the 1880s. Once the railroad was complete many Chinese returned to railroad towns like Grenfell to establish caf√©s and groceries which persisted until the latter part of the twentieth century. Well into that time Grenfell was served by two such Chinese caf√©s and groceries which considerably contributed to the amenity of its business district. Grenfell also had a women's clothing store on Main Street and the provisions of a bakeshop and movie theatre on Front Street well into the 1960s. A cinema on Front Avenue opposite the railway line continued in business until the 1960s, much beyond the time when such facilities had lapsed in other, larger prairie towns which were closer to urban metropoles. No doubt this was in part because television transmission remained poor, Grenfell being a good east of the broadcast locus in Regina. However they might have regretted the lack of choice, community life was assuredly enhanced by first- release films being available only in the town cinema. Access to both Regina and somewhat less quickly Winnipeg became vastly more convenient and fast with the great improvement in quality of the Trans-Canada Highway, even substantially eliminating the demand for train passenger transport. This constituted both an improvement in town and farm dwellers' overall quality of life but decline in its nature within the town without a lengthy drive. As in virtually all prairie Canadian towns, the centre of commerce was from the beginning until very recently the grain elevators: assorted grain-buying companies maintained large depots to which farmers regularly brought wheat and other crops for sale whenever the centralised grain-buying board announced a quota.

Infrastructure Grenfell's hospital was first established in 1915, followed by a maternity home in 1933. The hospital in Grenfell was one of 52 hospital closures announced April 15, 1993, by Health Minister Louise Simard. Grenfell belongs to the Regina Qu'Appelle Health Region, and a hospital is within a 10-minute drive. The Grenfell Medical Centre is staffed with a doctor, emergency room, lab and x-ray department. As well Grenfell is home to the Grenfell and District Pioneer Home providing health care for senior citizens of the area. =Transportation= Grenfell is situated at the junction of Highway #47 and Trans-Canada Highway 1 east of Regina, the provincial capital. By 2004, the Trans-Canada Highway 1, the Trans-Canada Highway had been \\"twinned\\" from Alberta all the way eastward to Grenfell. The entire highway was divided by 2007. The Canadian Pacific Railway came through in October 1882. Shacks and tents appeared the following spring allowing the village to incorporate on April 12, 1894, with over 100 residents. It was reorganised in 1967 becoming the Grenfell Branch of the South East Regional Library. Grenfell was located on the CPR West line between Regina and Winnipeg, Manitoba. The line ran through Indian Head, Sintaluta, Wolseley, Summerberry then Grenfell and continues west through Oakshela, Broadview. It is here that in 1925, the time zone changed from Central Standard Time to Mountain Standard Time. Education Grenfell High School circa 1925. MacPherson School, north of town, circa 1925. Grenfell is home to the Mechanic's Library Institute which was established in 1882 being one of the province's oldest libraries. Grenfell Elementary Community School offers pre-school to grade 6 with an enrolment near 160 pupils. Grenfell High Community School offers Grade 7 to Grade 12 to an enrolment of about 134 students. Both a part of the Prairie Valley School Division #208. Historically several one-room school houses served Grenfell and area. Faulkner School District #53 was one of the first established in 1886 followed by Rillington #62, and Prospect #65. Grenfell #150 was located south of the town site. Le Cain #224, Tetlock #289, Brown Hill #353, Arlington #429, Sims #432, Wolf Hills #823, Gettel #1904, and Oakshela #2458 came next serving the community until the 1950s. By the 1960s only two of every former one-room schoolhouses were still in use. Churches Grenfell United Church 2011. St. Michael's and All Angels Anglican.

In the 19th century, Grenfell boasted one of the dozen or so \\"town bands\\" or \\"citizens‚Äô bands\\" of the North-West Territories. The early English settlers had a flair for sporting activities, kept hounds and horses and also established a run similar to that of fox hunting runs in Britain in the 1800s. One of Canada's first polo clubs started in Grenfell. Currently, the town features an active snowmobiling club, the Grenfell Snowdrifters, and the Grenfell Spitfire Hockey club plays in the Qu'Appelle Valley Hockey League.

Valley of Europe) is the eastmost part of the new town of Marne-la-Vall√©e, located around to the east of Paris, France. It was built in conjunction with The Walt Disney Company, who wished to create a town near the Disneyland Paris resort. The final area of the district is currently in development. Description and history Serris, designed by new classical architect Pier Carlo Bontempi Val d'Europe shopping mall Val d'Europe is made up of five communities, which have grouped together to form a town council. The five districts are: *Bailly-Romainvilliers *Chessy *Coupvray *Magny-le-Hongre *Serris The area is primarily given over to Disneyland Park, as per the contract between the government and The Walt Disney Company. One of the terms was that the Euro Disney Resort (now Disneyland Paris) immediately got of land to build Festival Disney (now named Disney Village). The Walt Disney Company is the only company within France that has had such a large say in the development of an urban area of this scale. The government was represented by an EPA (governmental development company). Disney has also contributed to the development of the new town Marne-la-Vall√©e. The building work started in 1987, after Jacques Chirac (then French prime minister) and Disney signed the contract. Val d'Europe was to be opened with the Euro Disney Resort in 1992. The villages of Bailly-Romainvilliers, Magny-le-Hongre, and Serris were to be made into housing estates for the employees. It was not until the start of 1998 that Val d'Europe saw the opening of its shopping centre, which included a hypermarket and boutiques. However, a garden centre, Delbard, was opened in 2004 in a building to the south of the shopping centre. As of 2005, Val d'Europe has a population of 19,700 people, but this is expected to eventually increase to 40,000 people and 60,000 employees. out of is set aside for development by Disney. The Walt Disney Company has spent ‚Ç¨5 billion ($5.93 million/¬£3.42 million), compared to ‚Ç¨500 million ($595,326,686/¬£342,080,667) from the French government. The architectural style takes inspiration from the \\"neo-traditional\\" style of Baron Haussmann, who supervised the construction of many buildings in Paris in the 19th century. The town plan, by the firm of a Driehaus Prize winner, Cooper, Robertson & Partners of New York City, was designed based upon traditional French town planning principles consistent with the New Urbanism, a design philosophy which is frequently used in the United States and used with the intent to plan new cities based upon known working principles studied by architects. Disney had previously created a New Urbanist city in Florida, known as Celebration, also designed by Cooper, Robertson & Partners. It is believed that Val d'Europe and Celebration are descendants of Walt Disney's 1960s plans for the Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow (EPCOT), which was Walt Disney's original plan for a city of the future.  Shopping centre  At the shopping centre there is a large Auchan hypermarket, 190 shops, and a food court known as \\"Les Terrasses.\\" There is also a Sea Life aquarium indoors with about 300 species of marine creatures.

He was a member of the Democratic Party and served 16 terms in the House of Representatives from 1945 to 1947 and from 1949 to 1978. Biography =Early life= Delaney was born in New York City on March 19, 1901. He attended public school in Long Island City, Queens. In 1931, he graduated from the law department of St. John's College in Brooklyn with a LL.B. and was admitted to the bar in 1933. He worked as an assistant district attorney of Queens County from 1936 until his election in 1944. =Early Career in Congress= Delaney was elected as a Democrat to the 79th Congress. In 1944, much of what was the 6th district was shifted to the 10th district taking Rep. Andrew Lawrence Somers with it. Delaney ran for the open 6th district seat and defeated Republican Otto Schuler. Delaney suffered his only defeat in 1946. With President Harry Truman's popularity at a low point, the Republican Party gained 55 seats with Robert Nodar Jr. defeating Delaney. He regained the seat two years later in 1948 and won 14 consecutive elections afterwards. During the late 1950s, after a series of lurid magazine articles and Hollywood films helped to sensationalize youth gangs and violence, Delaney was one of the first congressmen to author legislation banning automatic- opening or switchblade knives in 1954. On April 17, 1958, Delaney stated, \\"Every day our newspapers report numerous muggings and attacks, most of them involving knives. Can we sit by complacently and ignore the bloodshed in our streets?\\"Levine, Bernard R., The Switchblade Menace, OKCA Newsletter (1993)Knife World (August 1990)Switchblade Knives: Hearing, House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, Eighty-fifth Congress, Minutes of the Second Session, April 17, 1958 The ban on switchblade knives was eventually enacted into law as the Switchblade Knife Act of 1958. Rep. Delaney and other congressmen supporting the Switchblade Knife Act believed that by stopping the importation and interstate sales of automatic knives (effectively halting sales of new switchblades), the law would reduce youth gang violence by blocking access to what had become a symbolic weapon.Knife World Magazine (August 1990) However, while switchblade imports, domestic production, and sales to lawful owners soon ended, later legislative research demonstrated that youth gang violence rates had in fact rapidly increased, as gang members turned to firearms instead of knives.Clark, Charles S., Youth Gangs Worsening Violence Prompts Crackdowns and Community Mobilization, Congressional Quarterly 1, 11 October 1991, pp. 753-776 Delaney later became chairman of a Select Committee to conduct an investigation and study of the use of chemicals, pesticides, and insecticides in and with respect to food products (81st and 82nd Congresses). He was noted for adding the 1958 Delaney clause to the 1938 Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to ban carcinogens as food additives, Committee on Rules (95th Congress). =Later Career in Congress= His political views tracked those of his constituents, which included many working class, but socially conservative Catholic voters. Voters who supported Franklin Delano Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy in previous elections supported Richard Nixon three-to-one over George McGovern. Delaney's political views became more conservative over his time in Congress. In 1961, he helped to defeat an education funding bill in 1961 because it excluded parochial schools from receiving funding. He also opposed busing to integrate schools and supported the Vietnam War. In the 91st Congress, the liberal interest group Americans for Democratic Action gave him a 25% rating while the American Conservative Union gave him a 69% rating. He further angered forces in the Democratic Party when he endorsed Conservative Party candidate James Buckley in the 1970 Senate election. Delaney himself received the endorsement on the Conservative line for his own re-election bid in 1970. In 1971, the New York delegation expelled him from delegation meetings after he opposed a bill from Rep. Benjamin S. Rosenthal to set up a consumer protection agency. As a high- ranking member of the House Rules Committee, Delaney helped kill the bill. In 1972, Delaney faced his closest election race since his defeat in 1946. Councilman Matthew Troy, the Queens Democratic Party leader supported his fellow Councilman Thomas Manton to run in the Democratic primary. The local party split between the two candidates with Troy backing Manton and other party leaders like Thomas J. Mackell, the district attorney, who reported backed Delaney. On Election Day, Delaney won renomination, but Manton took 46% of the vote. After his 1972 victory, Delaney moved closer to the Democratic fold and was eventually elected as the delegation leader in the House. He also credited his conservative views and relationships with conservative leaders in helping secure the New York City Seasonal Financing Act of 1975, which provided the city with a $2.3 billion loan to stave off bankruptcy. Delaney also played a role in the enactment of the second New York City bailout -- the New York City Loan Guarantee Act -- when he served as Chairman of the Bipartisan New York State Congressional Delegation and Chairman of the House Committee on Rules, which cleared the bill for consideration on the House floor. https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1978/07/14/110889086.html?pageNumber=15 Coordinating the activities of the congressional delegation for Delaney was his Legislative Assistant, Peter Allen Peyser.

Career Devienne was born in Joinville, as the youngest of fourteen children of a saddlemaker. After receiving his first musical training as a choirboy in his hometown, he played in various Parisian ensembles as soloist and orchestra player. He studied the flute with F√©lix Rault; in 1780 he joined the household of Cardinal de Rohan. He was active in Paris as a flautist, bassoonist and composer, and played bassoon at the Paris Opera. He wrote successful operas in the 1790s, including (1792) which brought him much success. He was also a member of the Military Band of the French Guard where he was given the rank of sergeant with the duty of teaching the children of his colleagues in the military band in its Free School of Music. After the Revolutionary period, when the Free School became the National Institute of Music, later chartered as the Paris Conservatory in 1795, Devienne was appointed an administrator and flute professor; among his students was Fran√ßois Ren√© Gebauer. He wrote (1793), which was reprinted several times and did much to improve the level of French wind music in the late 18th century. Like many other musicians, he joined the Freemasons and Concert de la Loge Olympique orchestra. Devienne died in Charenton-Saint- Maurice near Paris on September 5, 1803. Works His output comprises approximately 300 instrumental works that are mostly written for wind instruments. There are a dozen flute concertos (plus two posthumously published works, one of them a flute arrangement of G. B. Viotti's violin concerto No 23), sinfonias for woodwinds, quartets and trios for different ensembles, 12 operas, 5 bassoon concertos, 6 bassoon sonatas and 6 oboe sonatas (Opp. 70 and 71). Devienne's compositions for flute, revived by Jean- Pierre Rampal in the 1960s, became well-known among flautists. As well as extensive educational work, including the , his collected work also includes eight books of sonatas for flute or bassoon, a variety of chamber music and no less than seventeen concertos. He became known in his day as the \\"Mozart of the Flute\\". Devienne's complete oboe sonatas (opp. 70 and 71) as well as three of his bassoon sonatas (op. 24) were recorded by the Ensemble Villa Musica (Ingo Goritzki, oboe, Sergio Azzolini, bassoon, Ilze Grudule, cello, Ai Ikeda, bassoon, Diego Cantalupi, lute, Kristian Nyquist, fortepiano) and published on the MDG label (MDG 304 1749-2) in 2012.

Distribution and habitat  The common vole is hardly restricted in means of distribution and habitat and inhabits large areas of Eurasia but, apart from the Orkney vole, not the British Isles. As Microtus arvalis followed human civilization, primary and secondary habitats can be distinguished. The primary habitats are everything but dense forests, such as meadows, heath lands, and fallow land. The secondary habitats are mainly agricultural fields, where shallow sloped areas are preferred. The natural food of the common vole is grass, but it also feeds on many agricultural crops (within secondary habitats) and here its reproduction is faster than in primary habitats.  Reproduction, demography, and predation  After pregnancy of 16 to 24 days, females give birth to 3 to 8 juveniles, weighing between 1.0 and 3.1 g. Weaning is around the 20th day. Female juveniles can be impregnated from the 13th day after birth. Hence, first birth can be given from the 33rd day. During annual reproduction, which starts in March and ends in October, females usually have three reproductive cycles. The average life span is 4.5 months, which means that most animals die after the last reproduction in October, while the latest offspring in the year survives the winter and starts reproduction the following spring. Weights can reach 51 g in males and 42 g in non-pregnant females. Sex ratio at birth is equal, but becomes female-biased as the animals mature or with increasing population density when the ratio can level off to 3:1 or even 4:1 in favour of females. These ratios depict an intense competition for female mates, which leads to higher mortality and dispersal rates among the males. Population density varies seasonally and exhibits a considerable long-term fluctuation that shows typically three-year or five-year cycles. Densities can range from 100 individuals per ha (very low level) over 500 individuals per ha (medium level) up to 2000 individuals per ha in some years. As reaction females‚Äô reproduction can decrease or even stop. Not only influenced by population level, reproduction rate can change with the amount and quality of food and light. Self-regulation (e.g. decrease of reproduction rate) has been addressed to be a response to increased population densities. However, M. arvalis is one of the main food sources of a considerable number of predators in Central Europe. Buzzard, kestrel, long-eared owl, tawny owl, and barn owl are some of the birds that feed on the common vole and so delimit population sizes. Ground-predators are mainly weasel, stoat, adder, polecat, fox and boar.  Territories and nests  M. arvalis maintains aboveground runways, which expand like a railway-system through the entire home range. Voles are seldom seen outside these runways, which enable a faster and safer locomotion and easier orientation. The climbing ability of the common vole is very poor. Underground nests are dug 30 to 40 cm deep into the ground and are used for food storage, offspring raising, and as a place for rest and sleep. Nests can be shared and defended by up to five females with juveniles that are related in most cases. Females are territorial and an overlap of occupied areas does not occur. Hence, the number of colonies increases with individual number (i.e. population density). As common voles have a polygynous mating system the males do not maintain territories and move as so-called \\"floaters\\" between several females‚Äô territories in order to mate as often as possible. They can show overlap in territories. These findings are supported by the different home range sizes of males (1200‚Äì1500 m2) and females (300‚Äì400 m2) that can decrease in both males and females as population density rises. Another response to population growth is to leave the original habitat and move towards another one. Males predominantly conduct dispersal, being most often caused by the competition for mates.

He is believed to have died in the foothills of the Himalayas in 1929. Biography =Early years= Sundar Singh was born into a Sikh\\"Sadhu Sundar Singh\\", CCEL family in the village of Rampur(near Doraha) district, Ludhiana (Punjab state) in northern India. Sundar Singh's mother took him to sit at the feet of a sadhu, an ascetic holy man, who lived in the jungle some miles away, while also sending him to Ewing Christian High School, Ludhiana, to learn English. Sundar Singh's mother died when he was fourteen. In anger, he burned a Bible page by page while his friends watched. Sadhu Sundar Singh Memorial Church in Faridkot, Punjab Sadhu Sundar Singh CNI Church Rupnagar, Punjab =Conversion to Christianity= Sundar felt that his religious pursuits and the questioning of Christian priests left him without ultimate meaning. Sundar resolved to kill himself by throwing himself upon a railroad track. He asked that whosoever is the 'True God' would appear before him, or else he would kill himself; that very night he had a vision of Jesus. Sundar announced to his father, Sher Singh, that henceforth he would get converted into the missionary work of Christ. His father officially rejected him, and his brother Rajender Singh attempted to poison him. He was poisoned not just once but a number of times. People of that area threw snakes in his house, but he was rescued from mistreatment by the help of a nearby British Christian. On his sixteenth birthday, he was publicly baptised as a Christian in the parish church in Simla, in the Himalayan foothills. Prior to this he had been staying at the Christian Missionary Home at Sabathu, near Simla, serving the leprosy patients there. =Life of conversions= Sadhu Sundar Singh In October 1906, he set out on his journey as a new Christian, wearing a saffron turban and the saffron robe of a sadhu, an ascetic devoted to spiritual practice. Singh propagated himself as a sadhu, albeit one within Christianity because he realized Indians could not be converted unless it was in an Indian way. \\"I am not worthy to follow in the steps of my Lord,\\" he said, \\"but, like Him, I want no home, no possessions. Like Him I will belong to the road, sharing the suffering of my people, eating with those who will give me shelter, and telling all men of the love of God.\\" After returning to his home village, where he was given an unexpectedly warm welcome, Sundar Singh traveled northward for his mission of converting through the Punjab, over the Bannihal Pass into Kashmir, and then back through Muslim Afghanistan and into the brigand-infested North-West Frontier and Baluchistan. He was referred to as \\"the apostle with the bleeding feet\\" by the Christian communities of the north. He suffered arrest and stoning for his beliefs, and experienced mystical encounters. In 1908, he crossed the frontier of Tibet, where he was appalled by the living conditions. He was stoned as he bathed in cold water because it was believed that \\"holy men never washed.\\" In 1908 he went to Bombay, hoping to board a ship to visit Palestine but was refused a permit, and had to return to the north. He realized during his stay in missions that Western civilization had become the antithesis of original Christian values. He was disillusioned with the materialism and colonialism of western society and tried to forge an Indian identity for Indian church. He used to lament that Indian Christians adopt British customs, literature and dresses which have nothing to do with Christianity and Christ. =Formal Christian training= In December 1909, Singh began training for Christian ministry at the Anglican college in Lahore. According to his biographers, he did not form close relationships with fellow students, meeting them only at meal times and designated prayer sessions. He was ostracised for being \\"different\\". Although Singh had been baptised by an Anglican priest, he was ignorant of the ecclesiastical culture and conventions of Anglicanism. His inability to adapt hindered him from fitting in with the routines of academic study. Much in the college course seemed irrelevant to the gospel as India needed to hear it. After eight months in the college, Singh left in July 1910. It has been claimed by his biographers that Singh's withdrawal was due to stipulations laid down by Bishop Lefroy. As an Anglican priest, Singh was told to discard his sadhu's robe and wear \\"respectable\\" European clerical dress, use formal Anglican worship, sing English hymns and not preach outside his parish without permission. As an ardent devotee of Christ who was only interested in spreading his message, he rejected the mixing of Jesus Christ and British culture. =Converting others= Stories from those years are astonishing and sometimes incredible and full of miracles which helped in conversion. Indeed, there were those who insisted that they were mystical rather than real happenings. That first year, 1912, he returned with an extraordinary account of finding a three-hundred-year-old hermit in a mountain cave‚Äîthe Maharishi of Kailas, with whom he spent some weeks in deep fellowship. According to Singh, in a town called Rasar he had been thrown into a dry well full of bones and rotting flesh and left to die, but three days later he was rescued. The secret Missionaries group is alleged to have numbered around 24,000 members across India.Eric J. Sharpe, The Riddle of Sadhu Sundar Singh (New Delhi: Intercultural Publications, 2004 ), p.64. The origins of this brotherhood were reputed to be linked to one of the Magi at Christ's nativity and then the second century AD disciples of the apostle Thomas circulating in India. Nothing was heard of this evangelistic fellowship until William Carey began his missionary work in Serampore. The Maharishi of Kailas experienced ecstatic visions about the secret fellowship that he retold to Sundar Singh, and Singh himself built his spiritual life around visions.Sharpe, Riddle of Sadhu Sundar Singh, p. 65. Whether he won many continuing disciples on these hazardous Tibetan treks is not known. One reason why no one believed his version of this story was because Singh did not keep written records and he was unaccompanied by any other Christian disciples who might have witnessed the events. =Travels abroad= During his twenties, Sundar Singh's Gospel work widened greatly, and long before he was thirty, his name and picture were familiar all over the Christian world. He described a struggle with Satan to retain his humility, but people described him as always human, approachable and humble, with a sense of fun and a love of nature. This character, with his illustrations from ordinary life, gave his addresses great impact. Many people said, \\"He not only looks like Jesus, he talks like Jesus must have talked.\\" His talks and his personal speech were informed by his habitual early morning meditation, especially on the gospels. In 1918 he made a long tour of South India and Ceylon, and the following year he was invited to Burma, Malaya, China and Japan. Some of the stories from these tours were as strange as any of his Tibetan adventures. He claimed power over wild things. He claimed even to have power over disease and illness, though he never allowed his presumed healing gifts to be publicised. For a long time Sundar Singh had wanted to visit Britain, and the opportunity came when his father, Sher Singh, who was converted too gave him the money for his fare to Britain. He visited the West twice, travelling to Britain, the United States and Australia in 1920, and to Europe again in 1922. He was welcomed by Christians of many traditions, and his words searched the hearts of people who now faced the aftermath of World War I and who seemed to evidence a shallow attitude to life. Singh was appalled by what he saw as the materialism, emptiness and irreligion he found throughout the West, contrasting it with Asia's awareness of God, no matter how limited that might be. Once back in India he continued his Gospel-proclamation work, though it was clear that he was getting more physically frail. =Final trip= In 1923, Singh made the last of his regular summer visits to Tibet and came back exhausted. His preaching days were apparently over and, in the following years, in his own home or those of his friends in the Simla hills, he gave himself to meditation, fellowship and writing some of the things he had lived to preach. In 1929, against all his friends' advice, Singh determined to make one last journey to Tibet. He was last seen on 18 April 1929 setting off on this journey. In April he reached Kalka, a small town below Simla, a prematurely aged figure in his yellow robe among pilgrims and holy men who were beginning their own trek to one of Hinduism's holy places some miles away. Where he went after that is unknown. Whether he died of exhaustion or reached the mountains remains a mystery. In the early 1940s, Bishop Augustine Peters, another converted missionary from South India, sought out Singh's brother Rajender, led him to the Christian faith and baptised him in Punjab. Rajender Singh referred to many reputed miracles performed by Singh and people converted to Christ under his ministry. Singh is revered by many as a formative, towering figure in the missionary conversions of the Christian church in India. =Postmortem prophecies= His apocalyptic prophecies about the fate of Romania are famous in that country, but are apocryphal, being written by a medium who said he was channeling Singh's spirit. These look more like warmongering propaganda than Christian theology and were probably written about 1939.

He was a member of the Agrarian League (later known as Keskusta, Centre Party) and served two terms as Prime Minister of Finland. He is, however, better known for his period as Minister of Foreign Affairs of Finland. Karjalainen is considered one of the most influential figures in post-war Finnish politics. Like President Urho Kekkonen, Karjalainen attached great importance to Finland's relationship with the Soviet Union. Karjalainen served as the Minister of the Treasury, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of Trade and Industry for half a decade from 1957, forming his first government on 13 April 1962. It remained in office until December the following year; ultimately disbanding due to the resignations of ministers sympathetic to the SAK over economic and political issues. Karjalainen served a second term as prime minister from 15 July 1970 to 29 October 1971. Karjalainen's ministerial career continued with only short interruptions until May 1977. By this time he had spent 5,772 days as a political minister - a period of service only surpassed by Johannes Virolainen. Karjalainen first entered the Parliament of Finland in 1966, serving as a member for 13 years. In 1950, Urho Kekkonen made Karjalainen a key secretary in his first government. This was the start of a long-standing cooperative relationship between Kekkonen and Karjalainen, which endured for more than twenty years. So close was their partnership that throughout the 1960s and early 1970s, Karjalainen was seen by many as Kekkonen's crown prince. Their partnership ended when Kekkonen dismissed Karjalainen's second government in 1971. In 1981 Karjalainen put his name forward to be presidential candidate of the Centre Party, but lost to Johannes Virolainen. The election was ultimately won by Mauno Koivisto who became President of Finland in January 1982, succeeding Kekkonen. Outside politics Karjalainen had a successful career with the Bank of Finland. He served as director of its research facility from 1953 to 1957, and was elected to its Board of Management in 1958. Karjalainen served as Deputy Governor of the Bank of Finland from 1979, acting chairman of the board from 1979 to 1982 and as governor from 1982 to 1983. Karjalainen was a Doctor of Political Science; his thesis was entitled \\"The relationships between the monetary politics of the Bank of Finland and the state economy from 1811 to 1953 mainly regarding liquidity analysis\\". The later stages of Karjalainen's political career were notably affected by his alcoholism ‚Äì a national scandal ensued following his final resignation as prime minister when he was arrested for drunk-driving. His alcoholism was the cause of his dismissal as Governor of the Bank of Finland in 1983. Karjalainen's use of alcoholic beverages and the peculiar manner in which he spoke the English language led him to receive the moniker of \\"Tankero\\". \\"Tankero jokes\\" ended up becoming a widely known part of Finnish culture. In 1989, Karjalainen publicized his memoirs where he publicly claimed that how Paavo V√§yrynen had worked with KGB spy Viktor Vladimirov.Finlandization' Wins Respect of FinnsHS kuukausiliite 1/2010, pages 32-36Vanhan liiton mies.

Most wireless air interfaces are tuned to provide 1% packet loss, and most Vocoders are mutually tuned to sacrifice very little voice quality at 1% packet loss. However, 1% packet loss is intolerable to all variants of TCP, and so something must be done to improve reliability for voice networks carrying TCP/IP data. A RLP detects packet losses and performs retransmissions to bring packet loss down to .01%, or even .0001%, which is suitable for TCP/IP applications. RLP also implements stream fragmentation and reassembly, and sometimes, in-order delivery. Newer forms of RLP also provide framing and compression, while older forms of RLP rely upon a higher-layer PPP protocols to provide these functions. A RLP transport cannot ask the air interface to provide a certain payload size. Instead, the air interface scheduler determines the packet size, based upon constantly changing channel conditions, and upcalls RLP with the chosen packet payload size, right before transmission. Most other fragmentation protocols, such as those of 802.11b and IP, used payload sizes determined by the upper layers, and call upon the MAC to create a payload of a certain size. These other protocols are not as flexible as RLP, and can sometimes fail to transmit during a deep fade in a wireless environment. Because a RLP payload size can be as little as 11 bytes, based upon a CDMA IS-95 network's smallest voice packet size, RLP headers must be very small, to minimize overhead. This is typically achieved by allowing both ends to negotiate a variable 'sequence number space', which is used to number each byte in the transmission stream. In some variants of RLP, this sequence counter can be as small as 6 bits. A RLP protocol can be ACK-based or NAK-based. Most RLPs are NAK-based, meaning that forward-link sender assumes that each transmission got through, and the receiver only NAKs when an out-of- order segment is received. This greatly reduces reverse-link transmissions, which are spectrally inefficient and have a longer latency on most cellular networks. When the transmit pipeline goes idle, a NAK-based RLP must eventually retransmit the last segment a second time, in case the last fragment was lost, to reach a .01% packet loss rate. This duplicate transmission is typically controlled by a \\"flush timer\\" set to expire 200-500 milliseconds after the channel goes idle. The concept of a RLP protocol was invented by Phil Karn in 1990 for CDMA (IS-95) networks. The January 2006 IEEE 802.20 specification uses one of the newest forms of RLP. Cellular networks such as GSM and CDMA use different variations of RLP. In UMTS and in LTE, the protocol is called RLC (Radio Link Control).

Sandoval was first elected to the Board of Supervisors in December 2000, and was re-elected in November 2004. In March 2000 he was elected to the San Francisco Democratic Central Committee.  Early life  Sandoval's mother was a garment worker and homemaker. His father was a gardener and union organizer. Except for his oldest brother, who is developmentally disabled, all of Gerardo's siblings graduated from college. He was in the first Head Start class in 1966 and considers himself a product of Lyndon Johnson's \\"Great Society\\". He is fully bilingual in Spanish and has traveled extensively in Latin America, Asia and Europe. Sandoval is married to the former Amy Harrington, and they have two daughters. Sandoval attended Loyola High School in Los Angeles before graduating from the University of California, Berkeley in 1987. In 1989 he received his Master's degree in City and Regional Planning from UC Berkeley, with a specialization in real estate and housing development. He wrote his master's thesis on using tax credits to build affordable housing. Sandoval received his law degree from Columbia University Law School. Sandoval is the first in his family to receive an advanced degree.  Career  Sandoval worked as an assistant to San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos from 1990 to 1992, where he was responsible for budget and finance issues. He worked as a trial attorney and Deputy Public Defender in the San Francisco Public Defender's Office for five years. He was formerly an associate at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, the largest law firm in the United States. Sandoval also completed a three-year term on San Francisco's Public Transportation Commission, an agency with over $350 million in expenditures and 3500 employees. As Supervisor, Sandoval passed a consular identification ordinance in San Francisco. The ordinance requires that City employees (including police officers, airport workers, and health care workers) accept as identification the ID cards issued by foreign consulates if the cards have sufficient safeguards against fraudulent duplication and are accepted by the foreign government for entry into their national territory. This landmark legislation has been duplicated in many major US cities including Los Angeles, New York and Chicago. Most major US banks also accept the identification cards. The cards are used by individuals traveling temporarily in the US such as Mexican truck drivers who are allowed under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) to enter the US. The cards also allow individuals to open bank accounts and otherwise access commonly available financial services. The ordinance has been criticized by opponents as allowing undocumented workers to more easily live in the US. Supporters of the ordinance have argued that such legislation by local governments is necessary to fill the vacuum in policy left due to inaction from federal and state governments. Hundreds line up to get consular ID cards San Francisco Chronicle.  Controversy and activism  = Anti-Semitic remarks = Shortly after his election, Sandoval made statements that were criticized as anti- Semitic, and Sandoval apologized at a press conference, saying \\"It was an unfortunate example and I apologize for it... I want to thank everyone for bringing this to my attention. As a Latino, a Mexican-American, I am sensitive to discrimination.\\"Eskenazi, Joe (May 4, 2001) \\"S.F. Supe apologizes for off- the-cuff 'bar mitzvah' remark.\\" Jewish News Weekly. The criticized statements were made when Sandoval spoke out against an $80 million legal settlement that the City of San Francisco was paying to its biggest corporations. At a community meeting, Sandoval stated that the issue was not a legal one but a political one. Sandoval articulated an argument that San Franciscans should leave no stone unturned in trying to fight back, stating people should protest at \\"corporate headquarters, at the homes of CEOs, and their birthdays, weddings, bar mitzvahs or wherever\\" as the lawsuit would take money away from underserved segments of the population. = Statements on U.S. military = In an interview on Hannity & Colmes, San Francisco Supervisor Sandoval said that \\"I don't think we should have a military.\\"(February 15, 2006) \\"Battleship Brouhaha\\" FOXNews.com. He then claimed that local police and firefighters should be responsible for national defense. Sandoval also stated in the same interview, \\"we should invest our money in our kids.\\" This video can be found on YouTube.(January 04, 2009) \\"People who think the United States Military should be abolished\\". YouTube(August 13, 2007) \\"Leftist San Francisco Supervisor Talks Military\\". YouTube. In a February 20 op-ed for the San Francisco Chronicle, he defended his remarks by stating that his own views are in line with a municipal resident current which runs against further military involvement in city life. = Response to criticism of immigrants = Sandoval introduced a resolution \\"condemning the defamatory language used by talk radio host Michael Savage\\" after Savage criticized undocumented immigrant protesters who were fasting in support of the controversial DREAM Act, which would give qualifying undocumented immigrants a path to US citizenship as well as enable them to receive tax payer funded in-state college tuition.Rob Roth, KTVU While the original 9-1 vote on August 14, 2007 failed to receive the required unanimous vote, the Board‚Äôs second attempt on October 2, 2007 passed after the one dissenting supervisor had been suspended from the Board by the Mayor.

Graham Greene: A Literary Life - Page 130 0230535801 N. Sinyard - 2003 Stoppard, it will be remembered, wrote the screenplay for the film version of Greene's The Human Factor. . Plot summary Maurice Castle is an aging bureaucrat in the British secret service MI6. Married to a black African woman with whom he fell in love during his previous stint in apartheid South Africa, he now lives a quiet life in the suburbs and looks forward to retirement. As the book begins, a leak has been traced to the African section in London where he works and threatens to disrupt this precarious tranquility. Castle and younger colleague Davis make light of the resulting inquiry, but when Davis is accused on circumstantial evidence and quietly \\"disposed of\\", Castle begins to wrestle with questions of loyalty, morality and conscience. On the one hand, Castle undertakes his day- to-day job professionally, and is willing to do what is more than required for both Davis and Daintry, his boss. On the other hand, Castle is grateful to Carson, who, as a Communist, helped Castle's wife escape South Africa. In return, Castle decides to help the Communists and believes that by helping them, he is helping his wife's people‚Äînot knowing that Moscow has all along been using him for entirely different purposes. Rather than action or high politics, the novel builds its suspense by focusing on the psychological burdens of the pawns in the game: doubt and paranoia bred by a culture of secrecy, the sophisticated amorality of the men at the top, and above all, loyalties (to whom and what and at what cost?) Greene's characters are complete psychological portraits located within the context of the Cold War and the impact of international affairs on the complicated lives of individuals and vice versa. The interplay of international politics on the individual level is a trademark of this author. Major themes In his 1980 autobiography Ways of Escape, Greene wrote that his aim with this book was \\"to write a novel of espionage free from the conventional violence, which has not, in spite of James Bond, been a feature of the British Secret Service. \\"I wanted to present the Service unromantically as a way of life, men going daily to their office to earn their pensions.\\" Writing in his 70s, Greene drew on his own experience in MI6 and explored the moral ambiguities raised by his old boss, legendary Soviet double agent Kim Philby, although Greene stated that Castle, the main character in the novel, was not based on Philby. Another theme Greene explored was what he considered the hypocrisy of the West's relations with South Africa under apartheid. He thought that even though the West publicly opposed apartheid, \\"they simply could not let South Africa succumb to black power and Communism\\" (from the Introduction to the 1982 edition of The Human Factor).

Cantor, Inventing the Middle Ages, (1991) pp. 79-117. Career Kantorowicz was born in Posen (then part of Prussia) to a wealthy, assimilated German-Jewish family and as a young man was groomed to take over his family's prosperous liquor distillery business. He served as an officer in the German Army for four years in World War I. After the war, he matriculated at the University of Berlin to study economics, at one point also joining a right-wing militia that fought against Polish forces in the Greater Poland Uprising (1918‚Äì1919) and helped put down the Spartacist uprising in Berlin. The following year, he transferred briefly to the University of Munich, where once again he was involved in armed clashes between leftists and pro-government militias, but soon thereafter settled on the University of Heidelberg where he continued to enroll in economics courses while developing a broader interest in Arabic, Islamic Studies, history, and geography. While in Heidelberg, Kantorowicz became involved with the so-called Georgekreis, a group of artists and intellectuals devoted to the German symbolist poet and aesthete Stefan George, believing that George's poetry and philosophy would become the foundation of a great revival of the nationalist spirit in post-war Germany. In 1921, Kantorowicz was awarded a doctorate supervised by Eberhard Gothein based on a slim dissertation on \\"artisan associations\\" in the Muslim world. Although his degree was in Islamic economic history, Kantorowicz's interests soon turned to the European Middle Ages and to ideas about kingship in particular. His association with the elitist and culturally conservative Georgekreis inspired Kantorowicz to undertake writing a sweeping and highly unorthodox biography of the great Holy Roman emperor Frederick II, published in German in 1927 and English in 1931.Kantorowicz, Ernst. Frederick the Second, 1194‚Äì1250, Frederick Ungar Publishing Co., 1957. Instead of offering a more typical survey of laws, institutions, and important political and military achievements of Frederick's reign, the book struck a distinctly panegyrical tone, portraying Frederick as a tragic hero and the idealized embodiment of the German nation. It included no footnotes and seemed to elide historical events with more fanciful legends and propagandistic literary depictions. The work elicited a combination of bewilderment and criticism from the mainstream historical academy. Reviewers complained that it was literary myth-making and not a work of serious historical scholarship. As a result, Kantorowicz published a hefty companion volume (Erg√§nzungsband) in 1931 which contained detailed historical documentation for the biography. Despite the furor over the Frederick book, and not having written a formal Habilitationsschrift (second thesis to qualify for a professorial appointment), Kantorowicz received an (honorary) professorship at the University of Frankfurt in 1930. By 1933, however, Kantorowicz had to cease giving lectures due to increasing pressure on Jewish academics under the new Nazi regime. After taking several leaves of absence, he was finally granted an early retirement with a pension in 1935. He remained in Germany until 1938, when after the Kristallnacht riots it became clear that the situation for even assimilated Jews such as himself was no longer tenable. After a brief stay in Oxford, he accepted a lectureship at the University of California, Berkeley in 1939 and departed for the United States. After several years, Kantorowicz was finally able to secure a permanent professorship, but in 1950, he famously resigned in protest when the UC Regents demanded that all continuing faculty sign a loyalty oath disavowing affiliation with any politically subversive movements. Kantorowicz insisted he was no leftist and pointed to his role in an anti-communist militia as a young university student, but nonetheless objected on principle to an instrument which he viewed as a blatant infringement on academic freedom and freedom of conscience more generally. During the controversy in Berkeley, two eminent German √©migr√© medievalists working in Princeton, Theodore Mommsen (grandson of the great classical historian) and the art historian Erwin Panofsky, persuaded J. Robert Oppenheimer, director of the prestigious Institute for Advanced Study, to appoint Kantorowicz to the Institute's faculty of Historical Studies. Kantorowicz accepted and moved to Princeton, where he remained for the rest of his career. In 1957, Kantorowicz published his masterpiece, The King's Two Bodies, which explored, in the words of the volume's subtitle, \\"medieval political theology.\\" The book traced the ways in which theologians, historians, and canon lawyers in the Middle Ages and early modern period understood \\"the king\\" as both a mortal individual and an institution which transcends time. Drawing on a diverse array of textual and visual sources, including Shakespeare and Dante, The King's Two Bodies made a major contribution to the way historians and political scientists came to understand the evolution of ideas about authority and charisma vested in a single individual versus transpersonal conceptions of the realm or the state in pre- modern Europe. The book remains a classic in the field. Kantorowicz died in his home in Princeton of an aortic aneurysm at age 68. Kantorowicz was the subject of a controversial biographical sketch in the book Inventing the Middle Ages (1991) by the medievalist Norman Cantor. Cantor suggested that, but for his Jewish heritage, the young Kantorowicz could be considered a Nazi in terms of his intellectual temperament and cultural values. Cantor compared Kantorowicz with another contemporary German medievalist, Percy Ernst Schramm, who worked on similar topics and later joined the Nazi Party and served as the staff diarist for the German High Command during the war. Kantorowicz's defenders (particularly his student Robert L. Benson)\\"Defending Kantorowicz,\\" Letter to the New York Review of Books, by Robert L. Benson, Ralph E. Giesey and Margaret Sevcenko, Aug. 13, 1992. responded that although as a younger man Kantorowicz embraced the Romantic ultranationalism of the George-Kreis, he had only contempt for Nazism and was a vocal critic of Hitler's regime, both before and after the war.

On December 1, 1976, a revised and expanded version () of the 2nd edition was published. =3rd edition= The 3rd edition (1983) added 12,000 entries, and was published in CD-ROM format in 1987. =4th edition= Three major Japanese publishers released new dictionaries specifically designed to compete with the Iwanami's popular and profitable K≈çjien: Sanseid≈ç's Daijirin (Â§ßËæûÊûó \\"Great forest of words\\", 1988), Sh≈çgakukan's Daijisen (Â§ßËæûÊ≥â \\"Great fountainhead of words\\", 1995), and K≈çdansha's Nihongo Daijiten (Êó•Êú¨Ë™ûÂ§ßËæûÂÖ∏ \\"Great dictionary of Japanese\\" 1989). In response, the 4th edition K≈çjien (1991) was a major revision that added some 15,000 entry words, bringing the total to over 220,000. The CD-ROM version was published in 1993 and revised with color illustrations (like the Nihongo daijiten) in 1996. In 1992, Iwanami published both an e-book format 4th edition and a useful Gyakubiki K≈çjien (ÈÄÜÂºï„ÅçÂ∫ÉËæûËãë \\"Reverse dictionary K≈çjien\\"). =5th edition= The 5th edition (1998) includes over 230,000 headwords, and its 2996 pages contain an estimated total of 14 million characters. Iwanami Shoten currently publishes K≈çjien in several printed and digital formats, and also sells dictionary subscription services for cell phone and Internet access. Various manufacturers of Japanese electronic dictionaries have licensed the digital K≈çjien, and it is the core dictionary in many models. Shinmura's preface to the 1st edition stated his hope that the K≈çjien would become regarded as the standard by which other dictionaries would be measured. This has largely been fulfilled; many people regard the K≈çjien as the most authoritative Japanese language dictionary on the market. It remains a bestseller in Japan. According to Iwanami, the 1st edition K≈çjien sold over one million copies, and the 5th edition brought cumulative total sales to over eleven million in 2000. =6th edition= The sixth edition was released on January 11, 2008, includes more than 10,000 new entries, bringing the total to approximately 240,000. It also contains an additional 1,500 quotations. =7th edition= The seventh edition was released on January 12, 2018. Changes include 10,000 new words were added from 100,000 words collected by its editors firstly, including \\"apuri\\"(app), \\"Isuramu-koku\\"(Islamic State), LGBT, \\"hanii torappu\\" (honey trap), \\"jidori\\" (selfie) and \\"diipu raningu\\" (deep learning). Other changes include citing available source literature for a given explanation of a term, listing changes of the usages of a term, addition of 140 pages without adding book thickness.Á¨¨‰∏ÉÁâà„ÅÆÁâπÈï∑Á≠âË∫´Â§ßÁöÑÊó•Êú¨Ôºà192Ôºâ„ÄäÂπøËæûËãë„ÄãÁ¨¨7ÁâàÂç≥Â∞Ü‰∏äÂ∏Ç However, the definition of LGBT in the edition was written as \\"individuals whose sexual orientation differs from the majority.\\" Some criticized that the definition only describes the \\"LGB\\" portion of the acronym which refers to sexual orientation, while the \\"T\\" refers to sexual identity.

Baroni and Bialock (2005) describe the K≈çjien as \\"an old standard that gives extensive definitions, etymologies (as always take care with these), and variant usages for words, places, historical and literary figures, and furigana for difficult or old terms.\\" This dictionary is notable for including current Japanese catchphrases and buzzwords. For instance, the 4th edition added furƒ´tƒÅ („Éï„É™„Éº„Çø„Éº \\"a part-time worker by choice\\"), which blends two loanwords: furƒ´ („Éï„É™„Éº \\"free\\", from English, as in furƒ´ransu „Éï„É™„Éº„É©„É≥„Çπ \\"freelance\\") and arubaitƒÅ („Ç¢„É´„Éê„Ç§„Çø„Éº \\"part-time worker\\", from German Arbeiter \\"worker\\"). The K≈çjien dictionary had a censorship policy before it became politically correct (see kotobagari), and omitted taboo words such as sexual slang or offensive terms. It includes encyclopedic information such as 2700 illustrations and maps, and mini-biographies of notable people (both living and dead foreigners, but only deceased Japanese).

Gally (1999) says, \\"Koujien is a fine dictionary with a sterling reputation. Because it gives definitions in historical order, it is the best single-volume choice for people interested in how the meanings of words have changed over time.\\" However, he notes, \\"In my experience as a translator of contemporary Japanese, though, I have found Koujien less useful than Daijirin.\\" This criticism is based on his use of the fourth edition, though, and he concedes that later editions seem to have improved in this regard.

The architect Apollodorus of Damascus oversaw its construction. History This forum was built on the order of the emperor Trajan with the spoils of war from the conquest of Dacia, which ended in 106. The construction began between 105 and 107; according to the Fasti Ostienses the Forum was inaugurated in 112. Trajan's Column was erected and then inaugurated in 113. To build this monumental complex, extensive excavations were required: workers eliminated a ridge connecting the Quirinal and Capitoline (Campidoglio) Hills. Over 300,000 cubic meters of soil and rock were excavated and dumped outside the Porta Collina. It is possible that the excavations were initiated under Emperor Domitian, while the project of the Forum was completely attributed to the architect Apollodorus of Damascus, who also accompanied Emperor Trajan in the Dacian campaign. During the time of the construction, several other projects took place: the construction of the Markets of Trajan, the renovation of Caesar's Forum (where the Basilica Argentaria was built) and the Temple of Venus Genetrix. Structure The Forum consisted of a sequence of open and enclosed spaces, beginning with the vast portico-lined piazza measuring long and wide, with exedrae on two sides. The main entrance was at the south end of the piazza, through a triumphal arch at the center commemorating the Dacian Wars, decorated with friezes and statues of Dacian prisoners. The arch was flanked by tall walls built from blocks of Peperino tuff clad entirely in marble, which enclosed the Forum on three sides. The tuff walls which enclosed the piazza to the west and east featured exedrae; outside the exedrae, separated by streets, were markets of concentric shape. The three-story eastern market, known as Trajan's Market, buttressed the excavated edge of the Quirinal Hill. The open space of the Forum measured about 300 feet by 380 feet, and was paved entirely in Carrara marble.Fritz Heichelheim, Cedric Veo, Allan Ward(1984);A History of the Roman People; Prentice-Hall; Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey Via a doorway in the far east wall of the Forum, one gained entry to an open courtyard with a portico, which communicated in turn with the neighboring Forum of Augustus. Plan of Trajan's Forum Along the piazza's north side was the Basilica Ulpia, and north of that was a smaller piazza, with a temple dedicated to the deified Trajan on the far north side facing inwards. The position of ‚Äì and very existence of ‚Äì the temple dedicated to the deified Trajan is a matter of hotly contested debate among archaeologists, particularly clear in the ongoing debate between James E. Packer and Roberto Meneghini.J. E. Packer and J. Burge, ‚ÄúTemplum Divi Traiani Parthici et Plotinae: a debate with R. Meneghini,‚Äù Journal of Roman Archaeology (January 2003) pp. 103-136. Between the Basilica Ulpia and the terminal piazza containing the temple, were two libraries, one housing Latin documents and the other Greek documents. Between the libraries stood the Trajan's Column. The libraries housed state archives including the acts of the Emperors and the edicts of the praetors. Trajan's successor Hadrian added a philosophical school adjacent to the piazza containing the Temple of Trajan. The building consisted of three parallel halls separated by annexes and was known as the Athenaeum; it functioned variously as school, a venue for judicial proceedings, and an occasional meeting-place for the Senate. Map of the Imperial Fora showing Trajan's Forum Constantius II, while visiting Rome in the year 357, was amazed by the huge equestrian statue of Trajan and by the surrounding buildings: Post-Roman history In the mid-9th century, the marble cobble blocks of the piazza were systematically taken for re-use, because of the good quality of the lime. They were replaced with concrete, showing that the piazza was still in use as a public space. By the 10th century the Imperial Fora were semi-rural, with a patchwork of houses and farmland crisscrossed by roads occupying the former plaza of Trajan's Forum. In the late-16th century, the whole area of the Imperial Fora, which by then lay 3‚Äì4 meters below ground, was built-up during a wave of urban expansion and the area became known as the \\"Alessandrino\\" district. In 1526 the arch which formed the entrance to the Forum was demolished by the maestri di strade, Rome's Commissioners of Streets, which caused the Conservatore Francesco Cenci to submit a report to Rome's municipal government seeking redress for the destruction. Vestiges of the arch were found later in the century, including friezes which depicted scenes from the Dacian Wars, according to the descriptions of Flaminio Vacca. In modern times only a section of the markets and the column of Trajan remain. A number of columns which historically formed the Basilica Ulpia remained on site, and have been re-erected. The construction of the Via dei Fori Imperiali in 1933 covered a number of these columns, which remain visible under the arches on which the road runs.

Part of the Surrealist group in Paris, Leiris became a key member of the College of Sociology with Georges Bataille and head of research in ethnography at the CNRS. Biography Michel Leiris obtained his baccalaur√©at in philosophy at the Lyc√©e Janson de Sailly in 1918 and after a brief attempt at studying chemistry, he developed a strong interest in jazz and poetry. Between 1921 and 1924, Leiris met a number of important figures such as Max Jacob, Georges Henri Rivi√®re, Jean Dubuffet, Robert Desnos, Georges Bataille and the artist Andr√© Masson, who soon became his mentor. Through Masson, Leiris became a member of the Surrealist movement, contributed to La R√©volution surr√©aliste, published Simulacre (1925), and Le Point Cardinal (1927), and wrote a surrealist novel Aurora (1927‚Äì28; first published in 1946). In 1926, he married Louise Godon, the stepdaughter of Picasso's art dealer Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler and traveled to Egypt and Greece. Following a falling-out with the surrealist leader Andr√© Breton in 1929, Leiris contributed an essay to the anti-Breton pamphlet Un Cadavre, and joined Bataille's team as a sub-editor for Documents, to which he also regularly contributed articles such as ‚ÄúNotes on Two Microcosmic Figures of the 14th and 15th Centuries‚Äù (1929, issue 1), ‚ÄúIn Connection with the ‚ÄòMus√©e des Sorciers'\\" (1929, issue 2), \\"Civilisation\\" (1929, issue 4), ‚ÄúThe ‚ÄòCaput Mortuum‚Äô or the Alchemist's Wife‚Äù (1930, issue 8), and on artists such as Giacometti, Mir√≥, Picasso, and the 16th Century painter Antoine Caron. He also wrote an article on ‚ÄúThe Ethnographer‚Äôs Eye (concerning the Dakar-Djibouti mission)‚Äù before setting off in 1930 as the secretary-archivist in Marcel Griaule's ambitious ethnographic expedition. From this experience, Leiris published his first important book in 1934, L‚ÄôAfrique fant√¥me, combining both an ethnographic study and an autobiographical project, which broke with the traditional ethnographic writing style of Griaule. Upon his return, he started his practice as an ethnographer at the Mus√©e de l'Homme, a position he kept until 1971. In 1937, Leiris teamed up with Bataille and Roger Caillois to found the Coll√®ge de sociologie in response to the current international situation. Increasingly involved in politics, he took part in a mission to C√¥te d'Ivoire in the French colonies, in 1945. As a member of Jean-Paul Sartre's editorial committee for Les Temps modernes, Leiris was involved in a series of political struggles, including the Algerian War, and was one of the first to sign the D√©claration sur le droit √† l'insoumission dans la guerre d'Alg√©rie, the 1960 manifesto supporting the fight against the colonial forces in Algeria. In 1961, Leiris was made head of research in ethnography at the C.N.R.S. (Centre national de la recherche scientifique) and published numerous critical texts on artists he admired, including Francis Bacon, a close friend for whom he had modeled. That year he also published Nights as Day, Days as Night (Eng. translation, Spurl Editions, 2017). Considered a leading figure in 20th century French literature, Michel Leiris left a considerable number of works, as diverse as they are numerous, from autobiographical works such as L'Age d'homme (1939), La R√®gle du jeu (1948‚Äì1976) and his Journal 1922-1989 (published postmortem in 1992); art criticism such as Au verso des images (1980) or Francis Bacon face et profil (1983); music criticism such as Operratiques (1992); and scientific contributions such as La Langue secr√®te des Dogons de Saga (1948) and Race et civilisation (1951). (His fields of interest in anthropology ranged from bullfighting to possession in Gondar, Ethiopia.) With Jean Jamin, Leiris founded Gradhiva, a journal of anthropology in 1986. The journal is now the journal of anthropology and museology of the Mus√©e du quai Branly (Paris, France). Leiris was also a talented poet, and poetry was important in his approach to the world. In the preface to *Haut Mal, suivi de Autres Lancers (Gallimard 1969) he is quoted as saying that \\"the practice of poetry enables us to posit the Other as an equal\\" and that poetic inspiration is \\"a very rare thing, a fleeting gift from Heaven, to which the poet needs to be, at the price of an absolute purity, receptive - and to pay with his unhappiness for the benefits derived from this blessing.\\" Works (selection) See also * Limit-experience  References  * Jean-Louis de Rambures, \\"Comment travaillent les √©crivains\\", Paris 1978 (interview with M.

Fencing is one of four sports which have been featured at every one of the modern Olympic Games. Also known as modern fencing to distinguish it from historical fencing. 250px  What type of thing is fencing?  Fencing can be described as all of the following: * Form of combat (fighting) - purposeful violent conflict meant to weaken, establish dominance over, or kill the opposition, or to drive the opposition away from a location where it is not wanted or needed. ** Form of hand-to-hand combat - lethal or non-lethal physical confrontation between two or more persons at very short range (grappling distance) that does not involve the use of firearms or other distance weapons. * Martial art - codified system and tradition of combat practices, which are practiced for a variety of reasons: self-defense, competition, physical health and fitness, entertainment, as well as mental, physical, and spiritual development. * Sport - form of competitive physical activity which, through casual or organised participation, aim to use, maintain or improve physical fitness and provide entertainment to participants or spectators. ** Contact sport - involve a degree of player-to-player or player-to-object contact. *** Combat sport - competitive contact sport where two combatants fight against each other using specialized rules of engagement, typically with the aim of simulating real hand-to-hand combat in some way. ** Competitive sport - sport in which one or more participants or teams compete against one another. The one that is the most successful in achieving the objective of the game or sport event is the winner. *** Amateur sport - competitive sport in which participants engage largely or entirely without remuneration. *** Individual sport - sport in which participants compete as individuals. ** Recreational sport - sport engaged in as a leisure time activity. ** Spectator sport - sport that is characterized by the presence of spectators, or watchers, at its matches. Spectator sports are a form of entertainment.  Types of fencing  A foil fencer. Valid target (the torso) is in red. A sabre fencer. Valid target (everything from the waist up, including the arms and head) is in red. An √âp√©e fencer. Valid target (the entire body) is in red. * Foil fencing - uses a foil, a light thrusting weapon, targeting the torso, including the back, but not the arms. Touches are scored only with the tip; hits with the side of the blade do not count, and do not halt the action. Touches that land outside of the target area (off-target) stop the action, and are not scored. Only a single hit can be scored by either fencer at one time. If both fencers hit at the same time, the referee uses the rules of right of way to determine which fencer gets the point. * Sabre fencing - uses a saber, a light cutting and thrusting weapon, targeting the entire body above the waist, excluding the off hand. Hits with the edges of the blade as well as the tip are valid. As in foil, touches which land outside of the target area are not scored. However, unlike foil, these off-target touches do not stop the action, and the fencing continues. In the case of both fencers landing a scoring touch, the referee determines which fencer receives the point for the action, again through the use of \\"right of way\\". * √âp√©e fencing - uses an √©p√©e, a heavier thrusting weapon, targeting the entire body. All hits must be with the tip and not the sides of the blade. Touches hit by the side of the blade do not halt the action. Unlike foil and sabre, √âp√©e does not use right of way, and allows simultaneous hits by both fencers. However, if the score is tied at the last point and a double touch is scored, nobody is awarded the point.  History of fencing  *History of fencing ** Predecessors of modern fencing weapons *** Khopesh *** Bronze Age sword *** Rondel dagger *** Longsword *** Rapier *** Small sword *** History of the foil *** History of the √©p√©e ** Historical European Martial Arts *** Italian school of swordsmanship **** Bolognese Swordsmanship *** French school of fencing **** Ecole Fran√ßaise d'Escrime *** German influence **** Fechtbuch **** German masters ***** Johannes Liechtenauer ***** Paulus Hector Mair ***** Joachim Meyer *** Classical fencing *** Academic fencing (or \\"Mensur\\") *** History of dueling * History of martial arts  Facilities  * Strip (Piste) - The fencing area, roughly . The last two metres on each end is hash-marked, to warn a fencer before he/she backs off the end of the strip. Retreating off the end of the strip with both feet gets a touch against. Going off the side of the strip with one foot halts the fencing action. Going off the side with both feet gets a penalty of the loss of one metre. After each touch, fencers begin again at the center of the strip, 4 metres apart.  Equipment and gear  = Weapons = Olympic weapons and their parts * √âp√©e - A fencing weapon with triangular cross- section blade and a large bell guard; also a light dueling sword of similar design, popular in the mid-19th century, which was also called an '√âp√©e de Terrain.' * Foible - The top third of the blade. This section of the blade is weaker in terms of leverage, and is used for beats, presses, and other motions where speed is needed and leverage is not crucial. * Foil - A fencing weapon with rectangular cross-section blade and a small bell guard. More generally, any sword that has been buttoned or had its point turned back to render it less dangerous for practice. * Forte - The bottom third of the blade, so named for the strength in leverage that it provides. Always perform your parries with the forte. Hitting the opponent with the forte is not recommended. * French Grip - A traditional hilt with a slightly curved grip and a large pommel. * Guard - also Bell and Bell Guard. A Cup-shaped metal (steel or aluminum) weapon part which protects the hand. Foils use small concentrically mounted bell guards, √©p√©es use larger offset-mounted bell guards, and sabres have a knuckle guard that wraps around the hilt to protect from cuts to the hand. * Hilt - Everything that you hold. The handle of a sword, consisting of guard, grip, and pommel. * Maraging steel - A special steel alloy used for making blades rated for international competition. Usually stronger and more durable than conventional carbon-steel blades, but more importantly, it tends to break less frequently than carbon-steel blades. This is because propagation of micro-cracks in the blade is approximately 10 times slower in maraging steel than in carbon-steel. It is a fencing urban myth that a maraging steel blade is designed to break flat; the breakage patterns are identical. Both maraging and non-maraging blades break with the same degree of jaggedness. The sole reason for requiring a maraging steel blade (or a non-maraging one that has the same longevity under FIE testing) is that less blade breaks equals less potential for follow-on injury. * Pistol Grip - A modern, orthopedic grip, often shaped vaguely like a small pistol (generally with more protrusions than a real pistol's grip). Varieties are known by names such as Belgian, German, Russian, and Visconti. Orthopedic grips were introduced to aid a fencer who has lost some fingers and was unable to use a traditional grip. * Point - In foil and √©p√©e, the point is the only part of the blade with which to score points. The point may also be used in sabre. * Pommel - From the old French word for 'apple'. This fastener affixes the grip and guard to the tang of the blade. It has female threading, but the threaded hole does not go all the way through as is the case with a nut. It is screwed onto the distal end of the tang, locking guard, grip and electric connector is position by compression and friction. The pommel traditionally acts as a counterweight on non-orthopedic grips of foils and √©p√©es, and on all sabres. In electric sabre, it is covered with plastic as to not interfere with the detection of valid hits by allowing stray currents. Orthopedic (pistol-grip) weapons use only a pommel nut, usually fitting inside a cylindrical hole in the grip. * Sabre - A fencing weapon with a flat blade and knuckle guard, used with cutting or thrusting actions; a military sword popular in the 18th to 20th centuries; any cutting sword used by cavalry. The modern fencing sabre is descended from the dueling sabre of Italy and Germany, which was straight and thin with sharp edges, but had a blunt end. Non-Olympic weapons and styles * Backsword - A type of heavy sabre, generally single-edged with a 'false edge' down the top third of the back of the blade. Typified by a basket hilt. In use from the 16th to 20th centuries. * Broadsword - A military sword and fencing weapon popular in the 18th-19th centuries, similar to a heavy sabre. Beginning only in the late 20th century, this term came to be inappropriately applied to almost any straight-bladed, double-edged, single- handed cutting sword, especially of the Medieval and Renaissance eras. * Longsword - also Hand-and-a-half Sword. A larger cutting sword that could be use with one or two hands. Manuals detailing the use of such swords are among the earliest extant, dating back to the 14th Century. * Great Sword - also Two-handed Sword. A very large cutting sword, generally double-edged, intended for use with both hands. Great Swords could be as tall as the swordsman, and were often used as front-line offensive weapons in late 17th Century warfare. * Italian Grip - A traditional hilt with finger rings and crossbar. Used only in foil and √©p√©e. The Italian grip provides more 'grip' than the French grip, but less than a 'pistol-grip'. The finger rings and crossbar are descendants of the swords that used quillions. This type of grip is rarely, if ever, used in Olympic-style fencing. * Quillion - also Quillon, Cross-guard. A bar that composes all or part of the guard of a sword. The quillions (usually two) extend from the hilt of the sword, perpendicular to the line of the blade, on the same plane as the edge(s) of the blade. In simple medieval swords, the quillions usually form the entire guard. In later, more complex hilts, rings and other protective structures were extended in front of the quillions. One or two fingers can be wrapped around the quillions, providing better control of the weapon. In modern fencing weapons, the Italian grip is the only one that retains quillions. * Rapier - A long, double-edged thrusting sword popular in the 16th-17th centuries. Rapiers began as swords which were designed to use the point, in addition to heavy cuts. Some consider the 'estoc' a precursor to the rapier. As the styles of combat changed, and heavy armor was lightened, the rapier became more focused on the use of the point, and less on heavy cutting strokes. Hilts were designed to allow the forefinger to wrap around a quillion and provide better control. Hilts could be of complex 'swelp-hilt' design, or shaped like a deep cup. * Ricasso - An unsharpened portion of the blade in front of the quillions. In complex rapier and smallsword hilts, the ricasso is behind the guard, or the forward portion of the hilt. * Smallsword - Also court sword. A light dueling sword popular in the 18th century. These were, as often as not, a fashion accessory as much as a gentleman's weapon, and were decorated as such. = Other equipment or gear = * Body Cord - The insulated wire that runs under a fencer's jacket, connecting the Electrical Competition weapon to the reel, and thence to the scoring machine. The body cord also connects to the lam√© causing it to become conductive. ** Three Prong - A type of √©p√©e body wire/connector. ** Two Prong - A type of body-wire/connector, used in foil and sabre. * Lam√© - The electrically conductive jacket worn by Foil and Sabre fencers. In foil, the lam√© extends on the torso from the shoulders to the groin area. It also covers the back. In sabre, the lam√© covers both arms, the torso from the shoulders to the waist, and the back. Sabreurs also wear a conductive glove cover, called a manchette on their weapon hand. The lam√© is connected to the body cord with an alligator clip causing it to be conductive. * Manchette - A special glove cover worn by sabre fencers, on their weapon hand. Covered by a type of brocaded fabric with inwoven metal threads that serve as a conductive surface that aides in the practice of electric fencing, the manchette is worn on the hand and wrist. The manchette is conducting up to but not exceeding the wrist area. It is worn in conjunction with a lam√©. * Plastron - Also Underarm Protector. A partial garment worn under the jacket for padding or for safety. Usually Consists of a sleeve and a chest/abdomen covering, which provides additional padding and protection. An 'underarm' plastron is seamless under the weapon arm, providing no weak seams for a broken blade to rip through. An 'over-plastron' is worn to provide additional padding. Bouting * Assault - A friendly combat between two fencers, where score may or may not be kept, and is generally not a part of any competition. Public exhibitions (spectator events) used to be often conducted as assaults, rather than as round-robin or direct-elimination events, especially with a few fencers. (See also Bout). * Bout - An assault at which the score is kept. Usually refers to a match between two fencers in a competition. This is the term used in the US to generally denote any combat between fencers, replacing the terms 'match' and 'assault'. * Corps-√†-corps - (French \\"body-to-body\\") The action of two fencers coming into physical contact with one another with any portion of their bodies or hilts. This is illegal in foil and sabre bouts, and is cause for the Referee (Director) to halt the fencing action. In √©p√©e, it does not violate the spirit of the game, but contact may not be accompanied with any brutality or forcefulness (intentional or not). * Double - A double touch. in √©p√©e, two attacks that arrive within 40-50 ms of each other. This time margin is handled by the scoring machines, which lock out any touches after the time limit. Double touches are not allowed in foil and sabre. * Dry (USA) / Steam (UK) - Fencing without electric scoring aids. 'Dry' weapons have plastic or rubber buttons on the tips. * Match - The aggregate of bouts between two fencing teams. * Salute - A gesture of respect and civility performed with the weapon. Performed at the start and end of a bout (match, assault, etc.), and also at the start and end of a lesson. At the start of a bout, it is traditional, and expected, to salute the adversary, the referee of the bout, any additional judges for the bout, and then, optionally, others (the timekeeper, scorekeeper, etc.). The FIE rules now state that failure to salute an opponent and shake his/her hand at the end of a bout is an offense punishable by removing a touch, and therefore, possibly, the bout. * Salut des armes - A sort of a choreographed demonstration of arms, consisting of sets of fencers saluting, attacking, parrying, drilling and performing set routines in chorus. =Officiating and rules enforcement= * Avertissement - (French) A warning; used to indicate a minor rule infraction by one of the fencers. See Yellow Card * Black Card - A severe penalty. A black card is used to indicate the most serious offences in a fencing competition. The offending fencer is expelled immediately from the event or tournament, regardless of whether he or she had any prior warnings. A black card can also be used to expel a third party disrupting the match. * Jury - The 4 officials, or judges, who watch for hits in a dry fencing bout. The judges watch for hits on the fencer opposite their end of the strip. A judge acknowledges a hit by raising his or her hand, attracting the attention of the referee (or president of the jury). A judge cannot interpret the right-of-way (foil and sabre), only vote on the touches as described by the referee. In electronically scored foil bouts, hand-judges can be used to watch for a fencer who may be covering valid target area with the unarmed hand. The Jury is hardly used anymore because of electric fencing and replays where the referee can watch again to see who made the touch. * Red Card - Used to indicate repeated minor rule infractions or a major rule infraction by one of the fencers; results in a point being given to the other fencer, and often the annulment of any touch which would have been made by the offending fencer. * Referee - also director, president. The mediator of the fencing bout. * Yellow Card - also avertissement, warning. Used to indicate a minor rule infraction by one of the fencers.  Tactics and techniques  * Fencing tactics =Footwork= * Advance - The 'advance' is the basic forward movement. The front foot moves first, beginning by lifting the toes. Straighten the leg at the knee, pushing the heel out in front. Land on the heel, and then bring the back foot up to en garde stance. Also, the term advance is used in general for any movement forward by either step, cross, or ballestra. * Advance-Lunge - An advance followed immediately by a lunge. * Appel - Stamping the front foot to the ground, to produce a sound to distract or startle the opponent. This may be made during an advance, or directly from an en garde position. It may precede a lunge, or be used merely as a distraction. An appel is also sometimes called a 'half-Advance'. This action may also be used to halt a bout, often by stamping the trailing foot insistently. * Balestra - A footwork preparation, consisting of a jump forwards. It is most often, but not always, immediately followed by a lunge. It is faster than a step forward, which helps change the rhythm and timing of moves. 'Balestra' is the French term for sudden leap. * Fl√®che - Fl√®che means 'arrow' in French. The rear leg is brought in front of the front leg and the fencer sprints past his/her opponent. This action is not allowed during sabre bouts, because the front and rear legs must not cross. In √©p√©e, a quick pass is essential, since the defending fencer is allowed one attack after the pass, so long as the defenders attack is in one action, with or without a parry, initiated before the pass is completed. * Cross Over - An advance or retreat by crossing one leg over the other; see also Pass Forward (passe' avant) and Pass Backwards (passe arriere). * Forward Recovery - A recovery from a lunge, performed by pulling the rear leg up into en garde, rather than pulling the front leg and body backwards. Can be used to gain ground on the opponent more secretly than a standard advance, and when used sparingly can surprise the opponent by changing the expected distance between fencers. * In Quartata - An evasive action that is recognized under category of the defensive actions ( see also \\"Passata-sotto\\"), and made with a quarter turn to the inside, concealing the front but exposing the back. This attempts to move some of the target out of harm's way during an attack or a counter-attack. This evasive action is often executed and used in conjunction with opposition parry. * Lunge - A forward movement made by advancing the front foot and straightening the back leg. One of the most basic and common attacking movements in modern fencing. * Passata-sotto - An evasive action which is initiated by dropping a hand to the floor and lowering the body under the opponent's oncoming blade. Often accompanied by a straightening of the sword arm to attempt a hit on the opposing combatant. * Pass Backwards - also Passe Arriere. A backwards footwork action. The front foot moves behind the rear foot on the body's outside. Landing on the ball of the front foot, the rear foot moves backwards to the 'en garde' stance. * Pass Forward - also Passe Avant. A forwards footwork action. The rear foot moves in front of forward foot on the body's inside. From the crossed position, the front foot moves forward into the 'en garde' stance. Note: Passing forward is illegal in sabre. * Patinando - There are two types of patinandos, speed and tempo. They are advance lunges but with different tempos. The speed patinando is a fast step and a lunge, while the tempo patinando is a slow step (to get a slow response from one's opponent) and a fast lunge. * Recovery - A return to en garde stance from any other position, generally by pulling backwards into en garde. Recovery from a lunge occurs by reversing the motions in a lunge, and recovering the extended arm last of all. A forward recovery involves moving the rear foot forward to return to en garde. For a center recovery, both feet move towards the center simultaneously. * Reprise - From a lunge, a swift surprise attack made by performing a short forward recovery and an immediate second lunge. In terms of Right-of-way, a new action that follows an attack that missed or was parried. A redoublement takes place in a fencing tempo subsequent to that of the initial attack or riposte. * Retreat - The basic backwards movement. Rear foot reaches backwards and is firmly planted, then front leg pushes body weight backwards smoothly into 'en garde' stance. =Blade Work= * Absence of blade - The situation in a bout when the opposing blades are not touching; opposite of engagement. * Arr√™t √† bon temps - see Stop Hit.  Attacks  * Attack - The initial offensive action made by extending the sword arm and continuously threatening the valid target of the opponent. ** Compound Attack - Also composed attack. An attack or riposte incorporating one or more feints to the opposite line that the action finishes in. A compound attack does not necessarily lose right of way during its execution; it just comprises more than one indirect action. Compound attacks are usually used to draw multiple reactions from an opponent, or against an opponent who uses complex parries. A counter-attack into a compound attack must hit a clear tempo ahead of the compound attack to be valid. ** Coul√© - Also graze, glis√©, or glissade. An attack or feint that slides along the opponent's blade. In performing a sliding action along the opponent's blade, it is generally the goal to establish leverage by moving forte against foible, or forte to forte. ** Counter-attack - An attack made against, or into, an attack initiated by the opponent. In foil and sabre, a counter-attack does not have the right-of-way against the opponent's initiated attack. Counter-attacking is a common tactic in √©p√©e, where one may gain a touch by hitting first, and avoiding the opponent's attack. Counter-attacks, especially in √©p√©e, are often accompanied by an action on the blade (beat, opposition, prise-de-fer, transfer). *** Stop Cut - also Stop Thrust, Stop-in-Time. A counter-attack that attempts to take advantage of an uncertain attack. A properly performed Stop Hit allows a fencer to counter-attack into an oncoming attack, hit his opponent, and then still parry the oncoming attack (allowing a possible valid riposte as well). It may try to break the continuance of an attack by 'stopping' into it. However, it is still a Counter-attack, and does not have Right-of-Way against a continuous attack. ** Counter-time - an attack that responds to the opponent's counter-attack, typically a riposte following the parry of the counter-attack. ** Cut - An attack made with a chopping motion of the blade, landing with the edge. Cuts, that is, attempts to hit with the edge, are only valid in sabre. *** Flick - A cut that lands with the point, often involving some whip of the foible of the blade to strike at a concealed target. In foil and √©p√©e, flick attacks often start out without the point directly threatening the target area, and comes in with a circular action, to allow the blade to bend at the end of the attack, placing the point on target, possibly by whipping past a parry. *** Moulinet - In sabre, a circular cut. A moulinet is often composed of a parry, usually prime or seconde, moving thence into a circular cut. This action, while flashy and impressive, is slow, since the action pivots around the wrist and elbow, and is rarely used in modern sabre. In Historical Fencing, this is the circular motion of the fighter's blade around the opponent's blade. The hilt does not move during this maneuver. ** Coup√© - also Cut-Over. Another indirect attack, being an attack or deception that passes around the opponent's tip. Following a feint, the blade is pulled up and over the opponent's parrying blade. Use of the fingers and wrist ONLY is permitted, since moving the blade backwards at any time during this move invalidates the established right-of-way. Done in proper time, and with proper distance, the point may never be moved backwards, and the cut-over retain right-of-way during its entire execution. ** Direct - an attack or riposte that finishes in the same line in which it was formed, with no feints out of that line. Most attacks that hit are done with straight attacks. ** Double - an attack or riposte that describes a complete circle around the opponent's blade, and finishes in the opposite line. The full circle is done in reaction to the opponent's attempt to parry the attack or riposte with one or more parries, generally circular in nature. An attempt to perform a double' against an opponent who does NOT parry results in the attack running onto the opponent's blade, and parrying itself. A double' may be composed of simply a circular deception, which is effective against a defender's circular or semicircular parries, or it may be a combination of a disengage and cut-over, which is effective against two lateral parries. ** Extension - The simplest action of attacking. A simple offensive action, consisting of extending the weapon arm forward. The point should move in the smoothest possible line towards the target, without wavering. Excess motion can ruin the control needed for precise, consistent hits. ** False attack - an attack that is intended to miss or fall short, so as to produce a reaction from the opponent. *** Feint - An offensive movement resembling an attack in all but its continuance. It is an attack into one line with the intention of switching to another line before the attack is completed. A feint is intended to draw a reaction from an opponent. This is the 'intention', and the reaction is generally a parry, which can then be deceived. **** Disengage - A type of feint. Disengages are usually executed in conjunction with an extension/attack, though technically, they are just a deception around the opponent's blade. To use in an attack, feint an attack with an extension and avoid the opponent's attempt to parry or press your blade, using as small a circular motion as possible. Circle under the opponent's blade. The first extension must be a believable feint in order to draw a reaction. Be prepared to proceed forward with a straight attack if no parry response is forthcoming. ** Indirect - An attack or riposte that finishes in a line different from that in which it was formed. ** Insistence - Forcing an attack through the parry, using strength. ** Remise - An immediate, direct replacement of an attack that missed, was short, or was parried, without withdrawing the arm. A remise is a direct continuation, meaning that no deceptions or changes of line occur with the continuation (replacement) of the attack. This may be done with a simple further extension of the arm, or may be accompanied with additional forward footwork (e.g. a reprise). In foil and sabre, a remise does not have right of way over a direct riposte. ** Riposte - An attack with right-of-way following a valid parry. A simple (or direct) riposte goes straight from the parry position to the target. A riposte may attack in any line. Consider its equivalent in a conversation. *** Compound-Riposte - A riposte made with one or more feints. A riposte may incorporate disengages, beats, and so on, as long as it is a continuous attack. *** Counter-Riposte - A second, third, or further riposte in a fencing 'phrase' or encounter. A counter-riposte is the offensive action following the parry of any riposte. ** Simple - An attack or riposte that involves no feints. ** Redoublement - An indirect renewal of an attack that missed, was short, or was parried. This used to be defined as an attack after a return to en-garde, or a withdrawal of the arm after a failed attack. A reprise is now defined as a continued attack that uses an indirect action to reach the target. This indirect action may consist of a change of line, opposition, a withdrawal of the arm, or other action that does not immediately threaten the target. In foil and sabre, a reprise does not have right of way over a direct riposte. ** Thrust - An attack made by moving the sword parallel to its length and landing with the point. ** Trompement - The action of hitting an opponent at the end of a feint, after a successful deception. ** Whip-over - In sabre, a touch that results from the foible of the blade whipping over the opponent's guard or blade when parried. Whip-overs are usually not counted, and used to be a way of saying that even though the blade hit, it was parried prior to body contact, and was not valid. However, with the advent of electric sabre, whip-overs are being allowed more often. The FIE has resolved this by introducing a new standard of stiffness for sabre blades (put into effect in 1999).  Engagement  * Engagement - During an encounter between two fencers, the point at which the fencers are close enough to join blades, or to make an effective attack. Blade contact is also referred to as an engagement, whether just standing there, during a parry, attack au fer, or prise de fer. ** Conversation - The back-and-forth play of the blades in a fencing bout, composed of phrases (phrases d'armes) punctuated by gaps of no blade action. *** Attaque au Fer - An attack on the opponent's blade, e.g. beat, expulsion, pressure. *** Change of Engagement - An engagement of the opponent's blade in the opposite line. Changes of engagement are sometimes performed to place one fencers blade on the side of his/her opponent's blade that he feels has an advantage, or could be just to fool with the opponent. Often, a bout with a left-handed fencer versus a right-handed will see both of them jockey for position with changes of engagements. *** Prise de Fer - (French : Literally take the steel); also \\"Taking the Blade\\"; an engagement of the blades that attempts to control the opponent's weapon. See also beat, press, expulsion, bind, crois√©, envelopment, opposition, transfer. **** Beat - A simple preparatory motion. A sharp controlled blow to the middle or 'weak' of the opponents blade, with the objective of provoking a reaction or creating an opening. The action should knock the opponent's blade aside or out of line. Your foible should contact the opponent's forte. ***** Counter-Beat - Also Change-Beat. A beat that is preceded by a circle under the opponent's blade. This can provoke a reaction with a beat from an unexpected quarter. **** Bind - also Lie, Liement; An action in which one fencer forces the opponent's blade into the diagonally opposite line, (that is, from high line to low line on the opposite side, or vice versa) by taking it with the guard and forte of his own blade. See also Transfer. **** Crois√© - also Cross, semi-bind; an action in which one fencer forces the opponent's blade into the high or low line on the same side, by taking it with the guard and forte of his own blade. See also Transfer. **** Envelopment - an action to seize the opponent's blade in one line and lead it (without losing contact) through a full circle to end in the same line. See also Transfer. **** Glide - An attack or preparatory movement made by sliding down the opponent's blade, keeping it in constant contact. **** Opposition - An action to seize the opponent's blade and control it progressively (moving along the blade) in the same line (of the opponent). An attack or counter-attack in the same line as the opponent's blade; a combined parry and riposte. This is, by definition, an offensive maneuver, since to 'progressively' control the opponent's blade you must move along its length, closing distance towards him. See also Transfer. **** Press - also Pressure. An attempt to push the opponent's blade aside or out of line from engaged blades. A press can precede a direct or indirect attack, depending on the opponent's reaction, but should be followed by an immediate threat (a full or partial extension). A press which is not followed by a threat may invite a disengage from the opponent, and an attack thereby. From an engagement, press smoothly on the opponent's foible, taking his/her blade out of line, and perhaps provoking a response. The thumb and fingers should provide the force behind this action. *** Derobement - An avoidance of an attempt to take the blade. A derobement is a reaction to the opponent's attempt to entrap, beat, press or take the blade, in a circular, lateral, vertical or diagonal motion. *** Opposition - engagement in one line, and continuing the control with that same line. Also, moving the blade laterally, controlling with the same side of the blade, and the same line of the opponent's. e.g. quarte to sixte, septime to octave, and vice versa. *** Preparation - Any action that precedes the actual launch of an attack. Preparation usually consists of actions against the opponents blade to take it out of line, or to provoke a reaction. In foil and sabre, any action that occurs during a phrase or conversation that precedes the establishment of right-of-way on the part of a fencer, often accompanied with a movement forward. In calling the actions in a foil or sabre bout, a referee may indicate preparation on the part of one fencer, meaning the fencer was moving forward without establishing right-of-way, and was vulnerable to an attack made during this time. ** Point-in-Line - An established threat made with the extended arm. A point-in-line is a static threat, created by one fencer by extending the weapon and arm prior to any actions in a phrase. In foil and sabre, a Point-in-line has right of way, therefore, if the line is not withdrawn, any attack launched by the opponent does not have right of way. This can be likened to a spear poking up from the ground: If you throw yourself upon it, you have only yourself to blame. A successful attack on the blade will invalidate a point-in-line or causing the opponent to withdraw his/her arm. In √©p√©e, Point-in-line has no right of way advantages, but is still an effective tactic. * Coup d'arr√™t - see Stop-Hit. * Invitation - A line that is intentionally left open to encourage the opponent to attack. * Presentation - Offering one's blade for engagement by the opponent. * Posting - A method of holding a weapon further down the handle in order to extend the reach by a few inches. Posting is a trade-off; the fencer loses a little control over their blade work in return for the longer reach. This is most commonly done using a french grip √©p√©e, where there is no need to establish right of way, and hitting first can result in being awarded the touch. Technically, it is not legal to slide one's hand on the grip from front to back during an action (see USFA t.16), so a fencer who wishes to post must do it while the action is stopped, or risk a possible penalty. * Salute - A blade action performed before a bout or lesson. Indicates respect and good sportsmanship. A handshake is usually exchanged after a bout. * Touch√© () - the French word for \\"touched\\" is used to acknowledge a hit, called out by the fencer who is hit. Conversely, if a fencer concedes a hit when no hit was actually made, the fencer's adversary would say, \\"'pas de touch√©'\\" (; ) to indicate that the hit should not be counted.Why Study Classical Fencing? Parrying techniques * Line - The main direction of an attack (e.g., high/low, inside/outside), often equated to the parry that must be made to deflect the attack; see also point in line. * Lines - The means of referring to a position or area on a fencer's body. The idea behind 'lines' is that the torso, as facing the viewer in 'en garde' is bisected both laterally and vertically. There are then four quadrants of the body. The quadrants which are above the lateral line are referred to as 'high line,' those below as 'low line.' The fencer's left-hand-side, referred to as chest, is the inside. The fencer's right-hand-side, referred to as flank, is the outside. The lower chest side quadrant is then referred to as 'inside low line.' : The common parries in foil and ep√©e are: sixte (outside-high), quarte (inside-high), octave (outside-low), and septieme (inside-low). Angled (up-and-down) parries can also be used. In sabre, tierce replaces sixte to guard the inside-high line, quarte becomes more erect, seconde replace octave on the inside-low line, and prime replaces septieme. Quinte is used in sabre to protect the head. * Parry - A simple defensive action designed to deflect an attack, performed with the forte of the blade. A parry is usually only wide enough to allow the attacker's blade to just miss; any additional motion is wasteful. A well-executed parry should take the foible of the attacker's blade with the forte and/or guard of the defender's. This provides the greatest control over the opponent's blade. In sabre, the guard should be turned appropriately using the fingers to protect the wrist. : Parries generally cover one of the 'lines' of the body. The simplest parries move the blade in a straight line. Other parries move the blade in a circular, semicircular, or diagonal manner. There are eight basic parries, and many derivatives of these eight. (see Prime, Seconde, Tierce, Quarte, Quinte, Sixte, Septime, Octave, Neuvieme). See also Lines. : In foil, the opponent's blade should not only be deflected away from the target, but away from off-target areas as well. An attack that is deflected off the valid target but onto invalid target still retains right-of- way. In sabre, the opponent's blade need only be deflected away from valid target, since off-target touches do not stop the phrase. Sabre parries must be particularly clean and clear to avoid the possibility of whip-over touches. In √©p√©e, a good parry is simply any one that gains enough time for the riposte; opposition parries and prise-de-fer are commonly used, since they do not release the opponent's blade to allow a remise. ** Beat Parry - deflecting the incoming attack with a sharp striking motion. ** Counter-Parry - also circular parry. A parry that moves in a circle to end up in the same position in which it started. A counter-parry usually traps an attack coming in a different line, but in the same high/low line. Thus, Parry Counter-Six (circular outside hide) is effective against attacks in the Four line (inside high). ** Opposition Parry - deflecting the incoming attack without ever losing contact with the blade from the initial engagement. ** Ordinal parries *** Prime - Parry #1; blade down and to the inside, wrist pronated. The point is significantly lower than the hand. Covers the inside low-line (this is a rare sabre parry). *** Seconde - Parry #2; blade down and to the outside, wrist pronated. The point is significantly lower than the hand. Covers the outside low line in sabre, replacing octave. *** Tierce - Parry #3; blade up and to the outside, wrist pronated. The point is significantly higher than the hand. Covers the outside high line. This is the basic en garde position in sabre. Then retreat toward original position. *** Quarte - Parry #4; blade up and to the inside, wrist supinated. The point is higher than the hand. Covers the inside high line. *** Quinte - Parry #5; blade up and to the inside, wrist pronated. The point is higher than the hand. This parry, more than any other, is subject to different interpretations in different schools (in foil and √©p√©e). In foil and √©p√©e, this parry generally covers the inside high line, since the pronated wrist can push further down that the supinated wrist (in Quarte). If the point and hand are lifted, this parry can also cover the inside low line with a sweeping action upwards, carrying the opponents point over the outside shoulder. In sabre, the blade is held above the head to protect from head cuts, but should still point slightly forward ready for riposte. *** Sixte - Parry #6; blade up and to the outside, wrist supinated. The point is higher than the hand. Covers the outside high line. This is generally the parry taught as the basic en garde position in foil and √©p√©e. *** Septime - Parry #7; blade down and to the inside, wrist supinated. The point is lower than the hand. Covers the inside low line. *** Octave - Parry #8; blade down and to the outside, wrist supinated. The point is lower than the hand. Covers the outside low line. *** Neuvieme - Parry #9; blade behind the back, pointing down; alternatively, similar to elevated sixte. Originally used in sabre, to defend the back against a passing or overtaking opponent. Covers the outside line on the back. ** Semicircular Parry - A parry that moves from a high line to a low line, or vice versa. The parry can also cross the body. The parry must be made in a semicircle to provide the enveloping movement needed to trap the attacking blade. ** Yielding Parry - deflecting the incoming attack by maintaining contact with the blade and changing the point of contact between the blades, moving from a position of poor leverage to one using the forte for strong leverage. * Pronation - The position of the hand when the palm is facing down. See supination. * Supination - The position of the hand when the palm is facing up. See Pronation.  Other maneuvers  * Counter-Attack - An attack into an established attack (that already has right-of-way). In foil and sabre, a counter-attack does NOT have the right-of- way, and will not gain a touch if the opposing fencer's attack lands. Breaking the arm in the middle of a perfectly good attack can turn your attack into a counter-attack without right-of-way. * Displacement - Moving the target to avoid an attack; dodging. * In-fighting - Fencing at closed distance, where the distance between the two fencers is such that the weapon must be withdrawn before the point can threaten or hit the target. * Inside - The direction to the front of the body. (The left for a right-hander.) * Opposition - An attack that is made fully in contact with the opponent's blade. The purpose is to control the opponent's blade from the starting point (usually a parry) throughout the attack. This is often used as a counter-offensive technique, especially in √©p√©e, but can be a problem if a disengagement is made by the opponent. Also Lateral Transfer. * Outside - The direction away from the front of the body. (The right for a right-hander.) * Pass√© - An attack that passes the target without hitting. * Point-in-Line - An extended arm and blade that threatens the opponent, which is established before any other valid attack from the opponent. For instance, from outside of engagement distance, a fencer performs an extension, establishing right-of-way. Until this extension is broken, it maintains right-of-way. Any direct attack made against it (without a beat, or other similar action) will be considered a counter-attack. * Preparation - The initial phase of an attack, before right-of-way is established. * Priority - In sabre, the now-superseded rules that decide which fencer will be awarded the touch in the event that they both attack simultaneously; also used synonymously with right-of-way. In the 1995 revision of the rules for all weapons, priority is also awarded when time expires with a tied score. The priority is determined by the flip of a coin at the start of the last minute, and the winner of the toss wins the bout if the score is tied when time expires. * Redoublement - A new action that follows an attack that missed or was parried. This is distinguished from a remise, reprise, or riposte by being a NEW action. See also redoublement under Footwork. * Remise - An immediate, direct replacement of an attack that missed, was short, or was parried, without withdrawing the arm. This is a continuation of an attack, and does not have priority (in foil and sabre) over a direct riposte. * Reprise - An indirect renewal of an attack that missed or was parried. This is a continuation of an attack, and does not have priority (in foil and sabre) over a direct riposte.'' * Right-of-Way - The rules for awarding the point in the event of a double touch in foil or sabre. The concept involved in being the first to establish a valid threat to an opponent's target area. Extending is the usual means to establishing this threat. Breaking the extended arm during an attack means relinquishing right-of-way. An opponent can take right-of-way by parrying the opponents blade. * Riposte - An attack made immediately after a parry of the opponent's attack. * Salle - (French: \\"room\\") A fencing hall or club. * Second-Intention - In general, a term used to imply that the first action initiated is NOT the one intended to score. The fencer may initiate a move, anticipating (or intending to draw) a certain response from the opponent, against which a second action is planned. For example, Lunge Attack (anticipating that it will be parried), Parry the riposte, and Redouble with a Counter-Riposte. * Simple - An attack or riposte that involves no feints. * Simultaneous - In foil and sabre, two attacks for which the right-of-way is too close to determine. * Target Area - The area delimited for valid hits in that weapon. Foil target area consists of the entire torso, including the groin and the bottom of the mask which covers the lame, and down to the waist in back. Head, arms and legs are considered off-target in foil. √âp√©e uses the entire body for target. Sabre uses all the body area above the waist, except the hands and the back of the head.

Biography  White was raised in Duluth, Minnesota by his mother and an aunt. His father was killed in combat while serving in the Pacific theater during World War II. White stated in a 2009 Motherboard interview that his interest in the human brain started in high school when his biology teacher admired his dissection of a frog cranium and told White that he should become a brain surgeon. White began his undergraduate studies at the University of St. Thomas before entering the University of Minnesota Medical School in 1949; he later transferred to Harvard Medical School in 1951, where he earned his medical degree cum laude in 1953. White had ten children with his wife, Patricia Murray, a nurse he met at Peter Bent Brigham Hospital while completing his surgical internship and residency. A devout Roman Catholic, Dr. White was a member of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences. He attended mass regularly and prayed before performing surgeries. Throughout his career, White performed over 10,000 surgical operations and authored more than 900 publications on clinical neurosurgery, medical ethics and health care. He received honorary doctorates from John Carroll University (Doctor of Science, 1979), Cleveland State University (Doctor of Science, 1980), Walsh University (Doctor of Humane Letters, 1996) and the University of St. Thomas (Doctor of Sciences, 1998). White received invitations worldwide to speak, lecture and share his medical expertise. He was a consultant to the Burdenko Institute of Neurosurgery in Moscow and was the only foreign member of both Russian and Ukrainian Academies of Medical Science. He lectured extensively in the U.S., Russia, China and Europe. White also became an adviser to Pope John Paul II on medical ethics. He established the Vatican's Commission on Biomedical Ethics in 1981 after his appointment to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences. Under White's leadership, the Commission influenced the church's stance on brain death and in vitro fertilization. He nicknamed himself Humble Bob. White founded Metro's neurosurgery department. Many people know him for being the leading target for protesters. A PETA activist went as far as to call him \\"Dr. Butcher\\" and described his experiments as \\"epitomizing the crude, cruel vivisection industry.\\" For 40 years, White was a neurological surgery professor at Case Western Reserve University medical school, a well-liked teacher and an acclaimed surgeon. He was one of the best known neurosurgeons in the United States, notably for his head transplant experiments on rhesus monkeys.[National Geographic video http://lhommeunearmededestructionmassive.e-monsite.com/pages/destruction- massive/des-animaux/la-vivisection-tests-sur-les-animaux/videos/robert-j- white-le-vrai-frankenstein.html] White died at his home in Geneva, Ohio on September 16, 2010 at age 84 after suffering from diabetes and prostate cancer.  Research  In 1970, after a long series of preliminary experiments, White performed a transplant of one monkey head onto the body of another monkey. Because the surgery included severing the spine at the neck, the subjects were paralyzed from the neck down. After the surgery, because the cranial nerves within the brain were still intact and nourished by the circulatory system from the new body, the monkey could still hear, smell, taste, eat and follow objects with its eyes. Ultimately, immune rejection caused the monkey to die after nine days. Dr. Jerry Silver, an expert in regrowing severed nerves, called White's experiments on monkeys, \\"fairly barbaric.\\" During the 1990s, White planned to perform the same operation on humans and practiced on corpses at a mortuary. It was hoped he could do head transplant surgery on the physicist Stephen Hawking and the actor Christopher Reeve. The continuation of White's work in head transplantation research and application has been discussed recently in the neurosurgical literature by Dr. Canavero; the feasibility of spinal cord reconstruction and cephalo-spinal linkage in humans has received recent support by a German study.

He made his living in the Champagne by travelling from castle to castle singing songs of his own composition and playing the vielle. These are not confined to the praise of courtly love that formed the usual topic of the trouv√®res, but contain many details of a jongleur's life. His complete works are eighteen: nine attributed in chansonniers, three self- referencing, and six whose attributions are based on modern scholarship (one of which is held to be mis-attributed in the manuscripts). Twenty one poems credited to him were edited and published by Joseph B√©dier in 1912 (Paris). Two further editions appeared in 2005: one by Callahan and Rosenberg with translations into modern French, and, with translations into Italian, an edition by Massimiliano Chiamenti, which reduced his authentic corpus to sixteen poems. Oxford Music online (effectively New Grove 2001), lists 12 songs.The author is Robert Falck; see https://doi.org/10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.article.19397 (paywalled). Nine of his poems have surviving music. Seven are chansons jongleuresques, that is, songs describing the life of a jongleur. His three serventois condemn the avarice of the nobility, but his moralising is balanced by self-deprecating humour. He also wrote two descorts, one lai, and one cynical tenson with Jacques d'Amiens. The nickname \\"Muset\\" may derive from his inspiration (\\"muse\\") or from his habit of muser (wandering about, wasting time).

It is the country's only nuclear power plant and the largest in the region. The construction of the first reactor began on 6 April 1970. Kozloduy NPP currently manages two pressurized water reactors with a total gross output of 2000 MWe and 1966 MW net. Units 5 and 6, constructed in 1987 and 1991 respectively, are VVER-1000 reactors. By 2017 Unit 5 was to be upgraded to reach a capacity of 1,100 MWe, as part of a programme to extend the life of the unit by 30 years. A seventh 1,000 MW unit may be installed, using a part manufactured reactor from the terminated Belene project for which Bulgaria has paid ‚Ç¨600m. The older and smaller Units 1 to 4 were all shut down by 2007. Two spent fuel storage facilities are part of the power plant. Safety concerns and consequent shutdown of Units 1 to 4 Units 1-4 Kozloduy NPP previously operated four older reactors of the VVER-440/230 design, but under a 1993 agreement between the European Commission and the Bulgarian government, Units 1 and 2 were taken off-line at the beginning of 2004. An unpublished 1995 report by the United States Department of Energy had supposedly listed those units among the world's \\"ten most dangerous reactors\\". On 21 October 2010, licenses for the shutdown reactors were transferred to Bulgaria state radioactive waste enterprise DP RAO, signaling the formal beginning of decommissioning work. Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s Units 3 and 4, originally licensed for operation until 2011 and 2013, respectively, underwent substantial safety improvements and, after rigorous inspections, received positive reviews from the IAEA in 2002, and from the World Association of Nuclear Operators (WANO) in the following year, concluding that \\"no technical reasons exist for the early closure of units 3 & 4\\". Backed by these findings, the government had hoped to convince the European Commission to allow a postponement of the agreed pre-accession shutdown; from a legal and political standpoint, however, this proved untenable. Units 3 and 4 were taken out of operation in the final hours of 2006, immediately prior to the country's accession to the European Union. 82 metric tons of its spent fuel were sent to a repository in Zheleznogorsk, Krasnoyarsk Krai during 2001 and 2002. In 2008, officials at the power plant announced their intention to use CONSTOR storage casks for this purpose. Prior to the shutdown of units 3 and 4, Kozloduy NPP produced 44% of Bulgaria's electricity supply; as of March 2006, Bulgaria exported about 14% of its electricity production. =Pressure to restart= In January 2009, during the 2008 Bulgarian energy crisis, Bulgaria's president Georgi Parvanov suggested that Unit 3 be restarted. However, this was never pursued as an option. In principle, under the conditions of its Accession Treaty Bulgaria may request temporary derogation from its commitments in the event of serious economic difficulties arising within the first three years of membership in the union. Ownership Inside the control room of Unit 5 Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant is a subsidiary of Bulgarian Energy Holding EAD. =Future expansion= Bulgaria's government recently decided to start the construction of a new reactor in Kozloduy after it gave up on the construction of what was supposed to be the country's second nuclear power plant in Belene. Thus, the Bulgarian government decided to install in Kozloduy the 1000 MW reactor that the Russian state company Atomstroyexport already produced for the Belene NPP. The Belene Nuclear Power Plant project was terminated in late March 2012. In October 2013, the Ministry of Environment and Water approved the environmental impact assessment report on the investment proposal for Unit 7, thereby giving a green light for its construction. A month later it was announced that construction of the reactor could begin in 2019 if full approval is granted by the Council of Ministers in 2014. The Bulgarian Energy Holding (short BEH) propose to construct a Westinghouse AP1000. Negotiations between the BEH and Westinghouse already started. In 2013 the Austrian Environment Agency prepared a report on the Bulgarian Ministry for the Environment's Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) on the proposed 7th unit of the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant. It assesses whether the EIA-Report allows for making reliable conclusions about the potential trans-boundary impacts on Austria. The Austrian report considers the assumption, that the Kozloduy NPP site is flood-proof, to be well-founded and the seismic hazard at the site to be low (but points out that the seismic hazard study needs updating as it was performed 20 years ago). It also highlights a number of unsubstantiated claims and some failings in the Bulgarian EIA report. These include: * shortcomings in the safety analyses of the reactors being considered, including a lack of the consideration of post- Fukushima lessons learned and, as far as applicable, the use of the concept of practical elimination (pgs 60-61); * serious gaps in the assessment of the impact of external human induced events such as crashes, leaks etc. (pgs 72-73); * contrary to IAEA (2002) analysis requirements, the EIA report does not contain considerations about the formation of pressure shock waves and their possible impact on buildings of the NNU due to explosions outside the perimeter of the NPP (pg 73) * no comprehensible technical basis provided for an evaluation of design basis accidents and severe accidents (pg 84) * only three (insufficient) ‚Äútypical‚Äù dry case weather conditions were used for the calculations of the trans-boundary impacts on the Austrian territory, not worse case scenarios. \\"Kozloduy NPP ‚Äì Construction of unit 7: Expert Statement to the Environmental Impact Assessment Report\\" Andrea Wallner, Helmut Hirsch Adhipati Y.

Etymology  The school is named after Awang Semaun, a legendary figure of Brunei. History The campus from a water taxi Awang Semaun Secondary School was established in March 1982 by the name 'Sungai Kebun English Secondary School'. It was first located at the present Paduka Seri Begawan Sultan Science College before it moved to its current location on 3 February 1983. On 13 December 1984 marked its official opening by the then Minister of Education, Yang Berhormat Pehin Orang Kaya Laila Wijaya Dato Seri Setia Haji Awang Abdul Aziz. The occasion was marked by the renaming of the school as Sekolah Menengah Awang Semaun (Awang Semaun Secondary School), a tribute to a Brunei legendary hero.  Academic  The school follows the national Secondary Schools' curriculum of the SPN-21 (Sistem Pendidikan Abad ke-21) starting 2007. Under this system, students study a two-year common curriculum in Year 7 and Year 8 and are then channelled to five streams namely Express (two years programme), General Science (three years), General Programme (3 years), General Applied (3 years) and Special Applied (Edexcel) Programme. Channelling is determined by the results of the Students' Progress Examination at the end of Year 8. At the end of Year 11 (Year 10 for the Express stream), students sit for GCE 'O' Level and/or IGCSE examination. Passing the examination may allow students to proceed to sixth form. Alternatively, students may also opt for public vocational education at IBTE schools. Staff The teaching staff consists is locals and a small group of expatriates (CfBT and contract teachers).

Born in Goleta, California, he was active from 1989 until his death in 2005. Although best known as a former member of Lagwagon, Derrick also played in several different bands like Bad Astronaut, Jaws, The Ataris, Mad Caddies and Rich Kids on LSD, among others. Besides drums, he also played guitar and was described as a multi-instrumentalist. Aside from music, he was also known as being a skilled painter and a gifted carpenter, appreciated for his off-beat sense of humor. After a long battle with drug addiction, Derrick committed suicide on March 30, 2005.  Career  Derrick first caught the attention of the pop-punk underground in the Goleta/Santa Barbara scene in the early 1990s in the band Lagwagon (then called Section 8). That recognition expanded outside of the Southern California scene in 1992 with the release of Lagwagon's debut album \\"Duh\\" (the first release from Fat Wreck Chords) and the two follow-up albums \\"Trashed\\" and \\"Hoss\\". Derrick left Lagwagon in 1995 and was replaced by Dave Raun of RKL. In 1997, Plourde contacted Kris Roe of The Ataris, who were looking for a rhythm section at the time. The two immediately hit it off and Plourde would stay with the band through the recording of their debut album \\"Anywhere But Here\\" Derrick also played with acclaimed Santa Barbara outfit The Mad Caddies, and appeared on their 2001. album \\"Rock the Plank\\". Later in 2001, Derrick teamed up with his friend and former bandmate Joey Cape in the band Bad Astronaut and played on their first two albums \\"Acrophobe\\" and \\"Houston: We have a drinking problem\\". The band also released a third album in 2006. named \\"Twelve Small Steps, One Giant Disappointment\\" with several tracks featuring Derrick on drums. After Derrick's death, Joey Cape announced that there will be no more Bad Astronaut albums because \\"without Derrick, there is no Bad Astronaut\\".  Influences and playing style  Although Rush's Neil Peart and RKL's Bomer Manzullo are often credited as his biggest influences, Derrick developed his own distinctive sound and style that was considered innovative and fresh in the hardcore/punk music scene. His playing style can best be described as a mixture of fast, complex grooves and fills, often played with a lot of dynamics. Songs like \\"Move The Car\\" and \\"Rifle\\" by Lagwagon are often considered the best examples of his skill, speed and technique as these songs involved many things that were prominent in Derrick's style such as linear and syncopated drum grooves, fast single strokes and double strokes with both hands and feet. Songs like \\"Bury The Hatchet\\", \\"Mr.Coffee\\" and \\"Give It Back\\" by Lagwagon, all originally recorded with Derrick on drums, are also often cited as examples of his progressive influences and outstanding skill and versatility.  Death and tributes  Although the official cause of death and other details were not immediately disclosed, a posting by The Ataris frontman Kris Roe to that band's website confirmed reports that Derrick took his own life ‚Äî the victim of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Despite never being diagnosed, Derrick was suspected as bipolar and was battling drug addiction. Joey Cape described in one interview that many people, including himself, felt like \\"it's not if, it's when\\" [will Derrick commit suicide]. His former band, Lagwagon, produced a tribute album titled Resolve in his honor and made a video for the song \\"Heartbreaking Music\\" that consisted almost entirely of different photographs of Derrick along with the footage of the band playing. The first verse in the lyrics for the NOFX song \\"Doornails\\", on their Wolves in Wolves' Clothing album is about PlourdeFull lyrics of this song at MetroLyrics. while the song itself is a tribute to punk rock musicians who have died.

The landscape consists of more than 500 tufa spires (porous rock formed as a deposit when springs interact with other bodies of water), some as high as , rising from the bed of the Searles Lake (dry) basin. The pinnacles vary in size and shape from short and squat to tall and thin, and are composed primarily of calcium carbonate (tufa). They now sit isolated and slowly crumbling away near the south end of the valley, surrounded by many square miles of flat, dried mud and with stark mountain ranges at either side. Geography The Trona Pinnacles, at an elevation of above sea level, are located approximately south of Trona, California. Access to the site is from a BLM dirt road (RM143) that leaves State Highway 178, about east of the intersection of State Highway 178 and the Trona-Red Mountain Road. The long dirt road from State Highway 178 to the Pinnacles is usually accessible to 2-wheel drive vehicles, however, the road may be closed during the winter months after a heavy rain. The Pinnacles are located within of federal land managed by the Bureau of Land Management. The Trona Pinnacles are inside a BLM Area of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC) designated to protect and preserve unique resources. Geology During the Pleistocene, massive runoff spilled from the Sierra Nevada into a chain of inland seas. The system of interconnected lakes stretched from Mono Lake to Death Valley and included Searles Lake. Deep beneath Searles Lake, calcium-rich groundwater and alkaline lake water combined to grow tufa formations. Similar (modern) formations can be found today at Mono Lake to the north. Known as tufa pinnacles, these strange shapes formed underwater 10,000 to 100,000 years ago. The pinnacles did not all form at the same time. They are divided by age and elevation into three groups. The groups are dubbed the northern, middle, and southern groups because they formed during three ice ages. The northern group is the youngest at 11,000 to 25,000 years old. These are the best examples of what are known as tufa towers. The northern group also include shapes called tombstones, ridges and cones. The small middle group claims only 100 spires, but boasts the tallest \\"tower\\", rising . The southern group, includes 200 tufa formations aged 32,000 to 100,000 years old. A close-up of one of the major clusters of pinnacles. June 2018. People have historically given names to the strange forms. These ancient spires were once dubbed \\"Cathedral City\\". Geologically, the pinnacles are classified into four general shapes. Towers are taller than they are wide and rise . Tombstones are stubby and squat and rise . Most tombstones are in the northernmost tufa formations. Ridges are massive toothy tufa ruins. Trona has three ridges, one in the northern tufa cluster and two in the middle group. One ridge is long and wide and tall. Cones are less than tall. Dumpy and mounded, cone shapes lie scattered throughout the Trona Pinnacles. Films The Pinnacles are recognizable in more than a dozen hit movies. Over thirty film projects a year are shot among the tufa pinnacles, including backdrops for car commercials and sci-fi movies and television series such as Battlestar Galactica, Star Trek V: The Final Frontier, Disney's Dinosaur, The Gate II: Trespassers, Lost in Space, and Planet of the Apes.David Kelly, Stark Beauty, Solitude, Squalor and Sulfur ‚Äì Trona Has It All, The Los Angeles Times, October 4, 2006, Accessed December 28, 2006.

Gostick influenced a number of figures on the Canadian far right. Jim Keegstra got most of his reading material through his membership in Gostick's League. He also collaborated with John Ross Taylor and was a mentor to Paul Fromm and an associate of Patrick Walsh, a fellow traveller who worked as research director at the CLR. He was also associated with former Member of Parliament John A. Gamble, who worked with Gostick as Canadian leader of the World Anti-Communist League in the 1980s.The Heritage Front Affair Report to the Solicitor General of Canada, Security Intelligence Review Committee, section 7.6.8, December 9, 1994. David Lethbridge, an anti-fascist activist and Communist Party member, described the CLR and Gostick as a \\"danger\\" because they soft-pedaled an essentially \\"fascist\\" message. \\"What made them dangerous was that they came across as mainstream\\", said Lethbridge to The Globe and Mail. Biography Ron Gostick was born in Merthyr Tydfil, Wales to Canadian parents and moved with them to Canada shortly after the First World War. They established a homestead near Stettler, Alberta and lived there for nine years before moving to Calgary. From 1933 to 1935, he attended Crescent Heights High School and was influenced by the school's principal, William Aberhart, a proponent of the social credit movement in Alberta. Gostick and his family became members of the Alberta Social Credit League. His mother, Edith Gostick, was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Alberta in the 1935 provincial election that brought Social Credit to power for the first time, making Aberhardt Premier of Alberta. She would remain the Member of the Legislative Assembly for Calgary until 1940. Ron Gostick entered the Canadian Army in 1941 and fought in the Second World War. After demobilization, he worked as a court reporter in Ontario and served as national secretary of the Social Credit Party of Canada, the less successful federal counterpart of Aberhardt's Alberta Social Credit party. He settled in Flesherton, Ontario where he spent most of the rest of his life. In the 1945 federal election, he ran as the Social Credit candidate in the Ontario riding of Grey North, coming in last place with 250 votes. In 1946, Gostick founded the \\"Union of Electors\\", a social credit based provincial party that was inspired by the more radical Quebec wing of the Canadian social credit movement, the Union des electeurs. He also began his publishing activities at the same time, beginning to issue the periodical Social Credit in 1947. The publication was disowned by the Social Credit Association of Canada in 1950 because of its anti-Semitism. Gostick renamed the periodical The Canadian Intelligence Service in 1951. In the early 1950s, Gostick was a public speaker at meetings sponsored by the Americans rightists Gerald Smith and Wesley Swift (who later founded the Christian Identity movement). Gostick founded the Canadian Anti-Communist League with a mandate of exposing the \\"Communist-Zionist-monopolist-finance enemy of Christian civilization.\\" The CACL became the Canadian affiliate of the World Anti- Communist League once the larger body was formed in the 1960s. The CACL became the Christian Action Movement and later in 1967 became the \\"Canadian League of Rights\\" (CLR). B'nai B'rith described the organization as being \\"long-known to support racist and anti-Semitic positions\\". Gostick died of cancer at the age of 87.

A magnetic field is applied to the metering tube, which results in a potential difference proportional to the flow velocity perpendicular to the flux lines. The physical principle at work is electromagnetic induction. The magnetic flow meter requires a conducting fluid, for example, water that contains ions, and an electrical insulating pipe surface, for example, a rubber-lined steel tube. If the magnetic field direction were constant, electrochemical and other effects at the electrodes would make the potential difference difficult to distinguish from the fluid flow induced potential difference. To mitigate this in modern magnetic flowmeters, the magnetic field is constantly reversed, cancelling out the electrochemical potential difference, which does not change direction with the magnetic field. This however prevents the use of permanent magnets for magnetic flowmeters.

Programmes were transmitted on TeleG between 6pm and 7pm each day. The channel slot was shared with the CITV channel (which broadcast from 6am to 6pm) and ITV2 +1 (which broadcast from 7pm to 6am). The Broadcasting Act 1996, required that programmes shown would be repeats of programmes transmitted on analogue channels (many of which are first shown outside peak hours). The Communications Act 2003 created the Gaelic Media Service which decides on the future development of Gaelic Broadcasting services. The broadcaster and service provider of TeleG was SDN, the company which holds the licence for DTT multiplex A. SDN, then owned by NTL, S4C and United Business Media, was awarded the Multiplex A licence in May 1998. Part of the capacity on Multiplex A was reserved for services provided by Channel 5, S4C in Wales and Gaelic programming in Scotland. SDN was purchased by ITV plc in 2005. TeleG initially continued to broadcast after the launch of BBC Alba on 19 September 2008. At launch BBC Alba was only available on satellite television before later being added to cable. TeleG would continue to broadcast until the BBC Trust had reviewed the performance of BBC Alba and announced their decision on whether they would recommend carriage of BBC Alba on Freeview. In December 2010 the BBC Trust approved a plan put forward by BBC management which would see the thirteen BBC Radio stations which broadcast on Freeview removed from the platform in Scotland during the hours of BBC Alba's broadcast, to free up capacity for the TV channel to operate. The radio services would not be affected outside Scotland, and the affected BBC radio stations would continue to be available on other platforms in Scotland including DAB digital radio, FM/AM (where applicable), satellite and cable TV and online. A date for the change to be brought in has yet to be confirmed, and as the service would broadcast on the BBC's public service multiplex, at the time the effect this would have on TeleG was not as yet clear. The plans were later revised to allow BBC Radio 1Xtra, 5 Live and 6 Music to continue broadcasting alongside BBC Alba. It was confirmed on 22 May 2011, that TeleG would close on 23 May, with BBC Alba launched on 8 June 2011, using its old EPG number on Freeview.

An ultrasonic flow meter is a type of flow meter that measures the velocity of a fluid with ultrasound to calculate volume flow. Using ultrasonic transducers, the flow meter can measure the average velocity along the path of an emitted beam of ultrasound, by averaging the difference in measured transit time between the pulses of ultrasound propagating into and against the direction of the flow or by measuring the frequency shift from the Doppler effect. Ultrasonic flow meters are affected by the acoustic properties of the fluid and can be impacted by temperature, density, viscosity and suspended particulates depending on the exact flow meter. They vary greatly in purchase price but are often inexpensive to use and maintain because they do not use moving parts, unlike mechanical flow meters. Means of operation There are three different types of ultrasonic flow meters. Transmission (or contrapropagating transit-time) flow meters can be distinguished into in-line (intrusive, wetted) and clamp-on (non-intrusive) varieties. Ultrasonic flow meters that use the Doppler shift are called reflection or Doppler flow meters. The third type is the open-channel flow meter. Principle =Time transit flow meter= Ultrasonic flow meters measure the difference between the transit time of ultrasonic pulses propagating with and against the flow direction. This time difference is a measure for the average velocity of the fluid along the path of the ultrasonic beam. By using the absolute transit times t_{up} and t_{down}, both the averaged fluid velocity v and the speed of sound c can be calculated. Using these two transit times, the distance between receiving and transmitting transducers L and the inclination angle \\\\alpha, if we assume that sound has to go against the flow when going up and along the flow when returning down, then one can write the following equations from the definition of velocity: c - v \\\\cos \\\\alpha = \\\\frac{L}{t_{up}} and c + v \\\\cos \\\\alpha = \\\\frac{L}{t_{down}} By adding and subtracting the above equations we get, v = \\\\frac{L}\\\\;\\\\frac{{t_{up} - t_{down} }}{{t_{up} \\\\;t_{down} }} and c = \\\\frac{L}{2}\\\\;\\\\frac{{t_{up} + t_{down} }}{{t_{up} \\\\;t_{down} }} where v is the average velocity of the fluid along the sound path and c is the speed of sound. =Doppler shift flow meters= Another method in ultrasonic flow metering is the use of the Doppler shift that results from the reflection of an ultrasonic beam off sonically reflective materials, such as solid particles or entrained air bubbles in a flowing fluid, or the turbulence of the fluid itself, if the liquid is clean. Doppler flowmeters are used for slurries, liquids with bubbles, gases with sound-reflecting particles. This type of flow meter can also be used to measure the rate of blood flow, by passing an ultrasonic beam through the tissues, bouncing it off a reflective plate, then reversing the direction of the beam and repeating the measurement, the volume of blood flow can be estimated. The frequency of the transmitted beam is affected by the movement of blood in the vessel and by comparing the frequency of the upstream beam versus downstream the flow of blood through the vessel can be measured. The difference between the two frequencies is a measure of true volume flow. A wide-beam sensor can also be used to measure flow independent of the cross- sectional area of the blood vessel. =Open channel flow meters= In this case, the ultrasonic element is actually measuring the height of the water in the open channel; based on the geometry of the channel, the flow can be determined from the height. The ultrasonic sensor usually also has a temperature sensor with it because the speed of sound in air is affected by the temperature.

It is the central feature of the main market square in the Krak√≥w Old Town (the historic center of Krak√≥w), which since 1978 has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site). History It was once a major centre of international trade. Travelling merchants met there to discuss business and to barter. During its golden age in the 15th century, the hall was the source of a variety of exotic imports from the east ‚Äì spices, silk, leather and wax ‚Äì while Krak√≥w itself exported textiles, lead, and salt from the Wieliczka Salt Mine. In the immediate vicinity of the hall, the Great Weigh House and the Small Weigh House existed until the 19th century. Other, similar cloth halls have existed in other Polish as well as other European cities such as in Ypres, Belgium; Braunschweig, and in Leeds, England. Krak√≥w was Poland's capital city and was among the largest cities in Europe already from before the time of the Renaissance. However, its decline started with the move of the capital to Warsaw at the end of the 16th century. The city's decline was hastened by wars and politics leading to the Partitions of Poland at the end of the 18th century. By the time of the architectural restoration proposed for the cloth hall in 1870 under Austrian rule, much of the historic city center was decrepit. A change in political and economic fortunes for the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria ushered in a revival due to newly established Legislative Assembly or Sejm of the Land. The successful renovation of the Cloth Hall, based on a design by Tomasz Pryli≈Ñski and supervised by Mayor Miko≈Çaj Zyblikiewicz, Sejm Marshal, was one of the most notable achievements of this period. The hall has hosted many distinguished guests over the centuries and is still used to entertain monarchs and dignitaries, such as Charles, Prince of Wales and Emperor Akihito of Japan, who was welcomed here in 2002. In the past, balls were held here, most notably after Prince J√≥zef Poniatowski had briefly liberated the city from the Austrians in 1809. Aside from its history and cultural value, the hall still is still used as a center of commerce. Upper-floor museum Sukiennice Museum, upstairs On the upper floor of the hall is the Sukiennice Museum division of the National Museum, Krak√≥w. It holds the largest permanent exhibit of Polish painting and sculpture, in four grand exhibition halls arranged by historical period and the theme extending into an entire artistic epoch. The museum was upgraded in 2010 with new technical equipment, storerooms, service spaces as well as improved thematic layout for the display. The Gallery of 19th-Century Polish Art was a major cultural venue from the moment it opened on October 7, 1879. It features late Baroque, Rococo, and Classicist 18th-century portraits and battle scenes by Polish and foreign pre-Romantics; the art of partitioned Poland with famed Prussian Homage by Jan Matejko; mythological and biblical scenes with the monumental Nero's Torches by Henryk Siemiradzki, the art of representative members of Young Poland from the turn of the 20th century including Jacek Malczewski, J√≥zef Che≈Çmo≈Ñski; prominent impressionists J√≥zef Pankiewicz and Leon Wycz√≥≈Çkowski; paintings by Wojciech Gerson and Julian Fa≈Çat, as well as large, and controversial Ecstasy, or Frenzy of Exultations by W≈Çadys≈Çaw Podkowi≈Ñski among other masterpieces.

The Club is the trademark version of a popular automotive steering-wheel lock, produced by Sharon, Pennsylvania-based Winner International. The company was formed in 1986 for the purpose of marketing the device. The inventor, James E. Winner Jr., derived the idea for the device from his service in the Korean War, where he and his fellow soldiers were instructed to secure the steering wheels of their vehicles with metal chains.The Club Legacy Design The device consists of two pieces which, when locked together, form one long, fixed bar with two protruding hooks opening towards the ends of the bar. Each piece has one hook, intended to fit around the rim of the steering wheel. The smaller of the two pieces fits inside the larger piece and slides in and out for sizing. When the lock is set, the larger piece's long handle protrudes out, so that the wheel is practically impossible to turn due to collision with other parts of the car or with the driver's legs, and the device cannot be removed because it is too large to slip around the wheel. To remove the device, the user unlocks the central bar, and slides the pieces together so that the hooks no longer surround the rim of the wheel; this allows it to slip out, freeing the wheel. Weaknesses The Club as originally designed was prone to having its lock shattered by freezing with freon; later models addressed this issue by changing to a chromium/molybdenum alloy. A television broadcast test showed that this form of attack now took several minutes of hammering. The most grievous flaw in the design is inherent in the modern construction of steering wheels; thieves can defeat this type of lock by making a cut through the steering wheel's outer rim, allowing the device to be removed. This does, however, require access to a hacksaw or other cutting tool, and ruins the steering wheel. However, after the Club has been removed, it can be used to assist the thief in breaking the steering lock built into the steering column; some thieves target cars \\"protected\\" with the Club over other cars for this reason. An additional device called \\"The Cap\\" was made which added a metal cover over the steering wheel; this can also be defeated by replacing the entire steering wheel with a similar one. A newer variation was made with a pair of hooks on each end of the Club instead of one, thereby requiring two cuts with a hacksaw to remove, and thereby twice the time to remove. In 2000, a device called the \\"Club Buster\\" was designed for locksmiths. It is a big screw with a hook on one end and a large handle on the other and two legs designed to rest on the lock. It breaks steering wheel locks such as the Club by hooking onto the lock and tightening the screw with the handle. The large handle provides mechanical advantage, concentrating the force applied by the hook and eventually forcing the lock to fold in half or snap in two.

It originally aired on July 3, 2002. It was selected No. 2 on the \\"10 South Parks that Changed the World\\" list, and was also part of \\"South Park's Dirty Dozen.\\"The Dirty Dozen South Park Club Newspaper In the episode, Father Maxi travels to the Vatican to confront the growing problem of Catholic priests molesting children. Meanwhile, Cartman discovers that it is possible to defecate from the mouth. Plot The parents of South Park are a bit concerned when Father Maxi informs them about the Young Men's Catholic Retreat and agree that they do not want their kids to go. They also decide to have a counselor talk to the boys to find out if the priest had been molesting them. The counselor, assuming the children were molested, asks, \\"Did Father Maxi, at any time, ever try to put something in your butt?\\" Having never been abused by Father Maxi, the boys are completely baffled about the question's meaning. Cartman has a \\"brilliant\\" idea, reasoning she meant it could be possible that eating food through the rectum can cause defecation through the mouth. The other boys (especially Kyle) think it is stupid and disgusting, and Cartman bets him $20 it will work. While the counselor is questioning the boys, all the parents decide to become atheists, as the sexual molestation scandals have destroyed their faith in Catholicism and God. Cartman ultimately does defecate out of his mouth, winning the bet and continually boasts the fact to Kyle, who becomes increasingly angered by it. News of this spreads, and it is concluded nationwide that this method of eating is much healthier than the traditional method (with the surgeon general basing that on \\"absolutely nothing\\"). The adults of South Park immediately adopt the new method of eating, calling it interorectogestion and even start passing trash cans around at social situations to openly collect the waste (literally \\"spewing crap from their mouths\\"), completely disregarding the previously long-held custom that defecation should occur in private. Meanwhile, Maxi has gathered a meeting of Catholic priests in Colorado to discuss the problem of child molestation. Maxi is appalled by such behavior and wants it to cease entirely, but to Maxi's horror, all of the other priests there have molested their altar boys. Maxi decides he has to go to the Vatican. Once there, he quickly finds the same: priests from all over the world (and from other worlds, specifically an alien race known as the Gelgameks) are molesting children and claim they need to continue the practice to receive gratification. They claim the \\"Holy Document of Vatican Law\\" does not prohibit the behavior, so Maxi wants to change the canon law to outlaw sodomy, as well as to allow sex with women. The Cardinal tells him that the Document cannot be changed as no one knows where it is. Maxi decides to try to find it. Meanwhile, Kyle has lost his patience with Cartman's incessant boasting and tells Cartman that he accepts the fact that he beat him fairly. This angers Cartman, as he wanted to hold the victorious bet over Kyle's head indefinitely. Maxi searches through the lower levels of the Vatican, and goes through a gauntlet in the style of Pitfall! in order to reach the Holy Document. But the Pope says they must first consult the highest power. He summons the \\"Queen Spider\\", which has for centuries been responsible for the pedophilia in the church, and declares that the Holy Document of Vatican Law cannot be changed. Angered by this, Maxi finally snaps and tears the Document in two, and the building begins to crumble. Maxi stands in front of the ruins, and tells everyone that Catholicism is not about the Holy Document of Vatican Law, molestation, or Queen Spiders, but about being a good person. He says by clouding the moral lessons of the Bible with needless ceremony and so many literal translations, the Vatican has caused people to reject religion and argues that \\"when they have no mythology to live their lives by, they just start spewing a bunch of crap out of their mouths\\". The parents, watching this on TV, regain their faith in God, deciding to stop shoving food up their rectum and to start going to church again, wanting to reconcile with God and their religion. Randy then vomits up another bowel movement. Production In the DVD commentary for this episode, Stone and Parker refer to their irritation towards arguments from more socially liberal/atheistic/secular minded types of people, as well as from socially religious conservatives. The scene where the parents discuss atheism while crapping out their mouths is based on Parker's annoyance with atheists. When Maxi searches for the Holy Document the scene is animated in the style of Pitfall! Randy's nightmare about the priest molesting the boys is done using footage from The Love Boat. The Great Queen Spider was taken from \\"Planet of the Spiders\\", a 1974 episode of Doctor Who, and is later referenced in the 2017 Role-playing video game South Park: The Fractured but Whole. Accuracy The episode's suggestion that the Vatican enforces stricter bans on priests engaging in heterosexual sex has been disproven. In February 2019, the Vatican acknowledged that the Catholic Church had secretly enacted rules to protect clergy who not only violated their vow of celibacy, regardless of the gender of their sexual partner, but who also fathered children by doing so as well. Home release \\"Red Hot Catholic Love\\", along with the sixteen other episodes from South Park's sixth season, were released on a three-disc DVD set in the United States on October 11, 2005. The sets included brief audio commentaries by Parker and Stone for each episode. IGN gave the season a rating of 9/10.

He succeeded founder Manuel Marulanda (alias Sureshot, in ) in March 2008 and commanded the Marxist rebel group until being killed in action by the Colombian Army. Early life Born into an upper-class family in Bogot√°, Cano began his studies in anthropology at the National University of Colombia in 1968, where he became a member and leader of the Communist Youth. He was arrested by Colombian police directed by Rodrido Avenda√±o, layer of the moment who carried an investigation because of communist suspicions. It was there that he met members of FARC, who invited him often to lecture about Marxism for a number of guerrilla columns. He dropped out of university to join the group and devoted himself to political activism. Ideologically he was described as a hardliner, with the belief that his ideas and side would ultimately win. Diario de la resistencia de Marquetalia, Jacobo Arenas, Ediciones Abej√≥n Mono, 1972. Joining FARC During the late 1970s Cano is believed to have joined FARC, where he quickly rose through the ranks, working with the group's co-founder and chief ideologue, Jacobo Arenas. His main role was originally to serve as a sort of political commissary for the urban network of the guerrilla in Bogota, and in 1978 he was appointed chief of finances for the Central High Command. A search warrant on his apartment, where he lived with his first wife (Maria Eugenia) and son (Federico), ended in his arrest in 1981 and imprisonment in the La Modelo Penitentiary, where he founded a library. He was freed in 1983 as a result of the amnesty offered by the government of president Belisario Betancur. He soon moved to the mountains to join the guerrilla soldiers, but instead of active combat he was sent to Casa Verde, the headquarters of the FARC commanders, in La Uribe (Meta), where he was recognized as an intellectual and as such was part of a number of peace dialogues with the government. His main role was to encourage the growth of the Coordinadora Guerrillera Sim√≥n Bol√≠var, a movement to join all guerrillas operating at the time in Colombia. With communism's collapse in Europe in 1989, Cano argued that the Soviet model had failed, and the FARC should develop its own model based on national ideas, whose paradigmatic figure was to be Simon Bolivar. After Arenas' death in 1990, Cano succeeded him, joining the seven-member Secretariat that led the group, and remaining as the second in command for about two decades. He was chief negotiator during failed peace talks in 1991 and 1992. However he had little role in the long running 1999‚Äì2002 FARC‚ÄìGovernment peace process with the government of Andres Pastrana. Pastrana later said that Cano never attended the peace talks. In 2000, Cano founded and became the leader of the Clandestine Colombian Communist Party. Leader of FARC On 26 March 2008, Manuel Marulanda V√©lez, the founder and leader of FARC, died of a heart attack and Cano succeeded him as commander-in-chief. During the same month two other members of the Secretariat, Raul Reyes and Ivan Rios, were killed in action. In July 2008, the Colombian Army rescued fifteen of FARC's highest-profile hostages, including √çngrid Betancourt, in Operation Jaque, further weakening the rebels' position. As commander in chief, Cano spread his views about the guerrillas, and the nature and solution to the political conflict in Colombia. He believed that the conflict was a class struggle, and that it should be the rich and multinational companies that should fund the war, encouraging blackmailing and kidnapping of politicians and the rich. Mass kidnappings were used to press the government into exchanging hundreds of guerrilla members in jail. The most outstanding example of this practice was the kidnapping of 12 deputies from the Valle del Cauca department, an action that he coordinated with Pablo Catatumbo. Death On 6 March 2008, the Miami Herald stated that the national daily El Tiempo had reported troops were pursuing Cano, and he was believed to have been wounded in a 21 February helicopter attack. This attack on Cano took place on the border of the two departments of Tolima and Valle del Cauca, rainy weather hampering the effort. El Nuevo Herald article of 7 March 72008. Cano was shot and killedRevolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) Leader Killed by Rachelle Dragani by army forces on 4 November 2011 in the southwestern Cauca Department in what the Colombian government dubbed \\"Operation Odysseus.\\" President Juan Manuel Santos confirmed his death on television, claiming the Colombian army dealt the FARC \\"the biggest blow in the history\\" of the guerrilla organization. The FARC leader's death came months after he fled his stronghold in the south of Tolima, being pursued by armed forces since. FARC responded to Santos' plea to lay down arms by saying that it would continue its fight against the government.

They perform daily shows for the public, which involve diving 30 meters (100 ft) or 41 meters (135 ft) from the cliffs of La Quebrada into the sea below. The depth of water in the \\"Gulch\\" can vary from 4.8 meters (16 ft) to 5.8 meters (19 ft) depending on the waves. The width of the channel varies from 12.8 meters (42 ft) to 14.6 meters (48 ft). Timing is crucial for the divers. During the night, they often hold torches while diving. Acapulco cliff diving was regularly featured on weekend sports television programming in the United States during the 1960s and 1970s when the USA High Diving Team competed with the La Quebrada Cliff Divers annually during the Acapulco Christmas Festival. The 2002 Guinness Book of World Records lists this as \\"the highest regularly performed headfirst dives\\" in the world. Although cliff diving at La Quebrada had taken place for many years, it was not until 1934 that the La Quebrada Cliff Divers was formed. One of the more famous Cliff Divers was Raoul Garcia. Swiss big-band leader, playboy, club owner and hotelier Teddy Stauffer, the man who is credited with turning Acapulco into a world class resort and for some time managed the El Mirador Hotel at La Quebrada, actually turned the boys, who were diving from the cliffs there, into stars, some ten years later. He is remembered as \\"Mr. Acapulco\\" to this day. The 1963 Elvis Presley film Fun in Acapulco brought the cliffs to worldwide attention. ABC's Wide World of Sports popularized La Quebrada during the 1970s as one of the early extreme sports. Professional high divers worldwide regard La Quebrada as one of their favorites.

The game allows one to enter information such as the player's position, name, jersey number, height, weight, dominant hand, skin color, and age. After one fills out this information, he or she is taken to a stat customization screen where one can edit a player's stats, such as accuracy and range (for kickers and quarterbacks), catching abilities, agility, speed, and strength (all for numerous players). After a player is created, he is put into Free Agency, where a player must be signed by a team. Players can also create a team, using color schemes of the 30 NFL teams found in the game. Teams' playbooks, stadiums, and initials (shown next to a team's score during gameplay) can be edited, and a team may contain up to 55 players. Players can be put onto any of the 30 teams already in the game, as well as Free Agents (including created players), and can be substituted into any position. In addition to the 30 pro teams in the game, there were also four hidden teams, accessed by entering a cheat code. Two teams, AFC and NFC, are the Pro Bowl teams from 1997. The other two teams are based on Iguana Entertainment and Acclaim, the developer and publisher of the game respectively, and feature then-employees as members of the team. Iguana Entertainment and Acclaim's teams are the two best teams statistically in the game. There is a season mode where players can select a team and play through their 1997 schedule. There is also a playoff mode where a player can select a team and try to guide them through the playoffs. Quarterback Club '98 also features a Quarterback Profile feature. This feature contains 30 quarterbacks, one from each team, and their college and pro football achievements in encyclopedic format. The game's commentary was done by Marv Albert. Brett Favre was the chief spokesperson for the game. Development Acclaim brought the NFL Quarterback series into the 64-bit age using technology they had been working on for several years for Turok: Dinosaur Hunter. With this, they were able to keep the game running at 30fps in high-resolution (640 x 480), something that hadn't yet been done in the U.S. They obtained the full NFL license, including all the teams, stadiums and rosters. Event occurs at 8:52-12:18. Their competitor for the N64 that year, Electronic Arts' Madden Football 64 was not able to get the NFL license in time for the game's release as Acclaim had acquired all the licenses for that year, but the game did feature real player names as it did get a license from the league's players' association that year. As a result, NFL Quarterback Club 98 is the only football video game for the Nintendo 64 to be fully licensed by the NFL in 1997. Adrian Murrell served as the actor for the game's motion capture. A number of the plays in the team playbooks were designed by Brett Favre. A version of the game was in development for the Sega Saturn, but was cancelled as part of Acclaim's withdrawal of support for that console. One month before the game's release, its play-by-play commentator Marv Albert pled guilty to a misdemeanor charge of sexual assault and battery. Though a morals clause in Albert's multigame contract with Acclaim allowed Acclaim to dissolve the relationship if Albert were ever convicted of a crime, Acclaim opted to ship the game with Albert's commentary intact. An Acclaim representative explained that the game had already gone into production by the start of Albert's trial and was in the final stage of manufacturing when he entered his guilty plea, and said if the game were successful enough to merit a second manufacturing run, the company would re-evaluate its position on the inclusion of Albert's commentary. Reception NFL Quarterback Club '98 received mixed reviews. Critics esteemed it for being the first Nintendo 64 game with high resolution graphics, in many cases noting how this enabled a high level of detail on the players. IGN elaborated, \\"Players have realtime shadows, noticeable breath in frigid weather, and detailed uniforms and helmets.\\" Next Generation said the high resolution \\"effectively takes away that nasty N64 blur we've all become accustomed to.\\" However, critics widely opined the game's good visuals are outweighed by gameplay issues, specifically that the A.I. is easily exploited and often unrealistic, and passes float in the air for an inordinate length of time, even bullet passes. GameSpot explained the problem: \\"Because of this hang time, defenders have way too much time to close in. The ball often drops down in the middle of about three defenders that shouldn't have been there, and one wide receiver that should have been wide open. As the ball reaches the players, they all jump up to catch it, in what looks like synchronized volleyball. What's more amusing is that somehow the receiver still makes the catch. This happens so often that it seems like it was done on purpose to compensate for the game engine's shortcomings.\\" Several critics also remarked that the audio is dry and sparse, and overall fails to provide an NFL atmosphere as compelling as other football video games of the time. They particularly said that Marv Albert's voice-overs were interesting solely for his then-recent sex scandals, as his actual commentary is remarkably dull. Even the game's visuals were not exempt from criticism, as many cited poor animation and odd player models with disproportionate arms. However, IGN instead praised the animation as fluid and realistic, and said the game's flaws are overall too minor to prevent the game from being recommended. The inclusion of full NFL licensing was widely praised. Next Generation stated that \\"In the end, serious football fans may want to stick with Quarterback Club 64 [sic] for its realism, but the slow play is likely to drive gamers crazy.\\" Electronic Gaming Monthlys four reviewers instead argued that problems such as the poor AI and slow passes would inevitably irritate football devotees, while casual players were more likely to overlook these flaws and therefore enjoy the game. GameSpot similarly concluded, \\"To be fair, some gamers will enjoy Quarterback Club despite its shortcomings - but only if they don't know or care about realistic football.\\" GamePro called it \\"Probably the most disappointing sports game of the year\\", remarking that while it had enough good qualities to satisfy hardcore football fans, there was no reason to prefer it over its competitor, Madden Football 64. They gave it a 4.5 out of 5 for graphics but a 3.0 for both control and sound, and a 2.5 for fun factor.

Foundation The National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons was formed in 1944 by Herbert Macaulay. Herbert Macaulay was its first president, while Azikiwe was its first secretary.O. E. Udofia, Nigerian Political Parties: Their Role in Modernizing the Political System, 1920‚Äì1966, Journal of Black Studies Vol. 11, No. 4 (Jun., 1981), pp. 435‚Äì447. The NCNC was made up of a rather long list of nationalist parties, cultural associations, and labor movements that joined to form NCNC. The party at the time was the second to take a concerted effort to create a true nationalist party. It embraced different sets of groups from the religious, to tribal and to trade groups with the exception of a few notable ones such as the Egbe Omo Oduduwa and early on the Nigerian Union of Teachers. Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe became its 2nd president and Dr. M.I. Okpara, its 3rd president, when Dr. Azikiwe went on to become the first indigenous President of Nigeria. The party is considered to be the third prominent political party formed in Nigeria after a Lagos-based party, the Nigerian National Democratic Party and the Nigerian Youth Movement formed by Professor Eyo Ita who became the Deputy National President of NCNC before he left the party to form his own political party called the National Independence Party. Pre-independence The first test of the party came in the 1951 election. The party won majority votes in the Eastern Region of Nigeria's House of Assembly but became the opposition in the western region with Azikiwe as the opposition leader representing Lagos. Although the Action Group (AG) won a plurality of the votes in the election, its prospects were uncertain as the NCNC could have secured a majority if it had been able to persuade the third party, which was an Ibadan community party and which had been viewed by the NCNC as its ally, to support it. This it was not able to achieve and the AG therefore formed the government amid accusations of carpet-crossing by Azikiwe and his NCNC. This event is still viewed by some historiographers as the beginning of ethnic politics in Nigeria. Azikiwe later on became the Premier of Eastern Region, Nigeria in 1954. During a national conference in 1954, the party opposed a call to include the right of secession ‚Äì a stance which was later exploited by the North and the West to deny the East the right to secede in the Nigerian Civil War. It had argued that the country was not a league of forced nations and it would be ruinous to include such right. The policies of the party, from its inception favored a countenance of determined expression for self- government and nationalism. The major aims of the party taken on subsequent campaigns at home and abroad were as follows. * The extension of democratic principles and advancement of the interest of the people of Nigeria and Cameroons under British mandate. *The impartings of political education to the people of Nigeria in order to prepare them for self-government. *The provision of medium of expression for members of NCNC through which they would endeavor to secure for Nigeria and the Cameroons, political freedom, social equality, religious toleration and economic activity.D. I. Ilega, Religion and \\"Godless\\" Nationalism in Colonial Nigeria: The Case of the God's Kingdom Society and the NCNC Journal of Religion in Africa > Vol. 18, Fasc. 2 Jun., 1988. Executive members from November 1957 to August 1958 included: *Nnamdi Azikiwe, National President and President of the Senate (Ibo, Methodist) *J. O.

Benson, National Financial Secretary, Federal Minister of Information (Yoruba, Protestant) Post-independence After Nigeria's independence, Azikiwe was Governor-General (1960-1963) and President (1963-1966). In 1966, a military coup ended Azikiwe's term as president, and the NCNC dissolved in the following turmoil. The NCNC was accused by its adversaries of focusing overly on the interests of the Igbo population. By the late 1940s, the remnant of the Nigerian Youth Movement, now effectively a western Nigeria political organization, had decided to support the Action Group accusing the NCNC of ethnic imperialism. However, the western opposition needed to tactically rev up local sentiments as its base was made up of local elites who depended little on nationalistic sentiment but on the local economic and political activity in their various towns and cities. During the Biafran war of secession, Azikiwe became a spokesman for the republic and an adviser to its leader, Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu, before switching allegiance back to Nigeria and publicly appealing to Ojukwu to end the war. Azikiwe became chairman of the Nigerian People's Party in 1978, making unsuccessful bids for the presidency in 1979 and again in 1983. Notes References *Peter C.

Biography and political career  Pardo Leal studied law in Universidad Nacional de Colombia, where he graduated as a lawyer in 1963. As a student he became active in the Colombian Communist Youth (JUCO) and was an active part in the student movement. After obtaining his degree he started a long career in the judicial branch of the government, where he worked as judge for town and regional courts, and then in the Superior tribunal and as a magistrate in the Superior Tribunal of Bogot√°. As such, Pardo Leal was instrumental in the creation of the judicial branch union Asonal Judicial, and leader of many strikes to push for better work conditions for the employees of the judicial branch. This leadership brought him the enmity of many in the branch. This led to his not being reelected as a magistrate, which became the origin for his political aspirations. Following the peace conversations between the FARC and the government of Belisario Betancur, the Uni√≥n Patri√≥tica political party was formed, and Pardo was called as an advisor. At the time, he was also involved in the Colombian Communist Party and in the formation of the Central Union of Workers of Colombia. On February 4, 1986, he decided to make official his aspirations as a presidential candidate for the just formed party. He ended up third, behind Virgilio Barco and Alvaro G√≥mez Hurtado, with a total of 328.752 votes. The UP party soon became a target for paramilitary organizations who started killing local leaders throughout the country. As party president, Pardo became vocal in denouncing this selective killings and accusing the government of overlooking those crimes, or even committing them. When he started denouncing the collaboration of members of the government and from the military with these assassinations, he became a target as well.  Assassination  By the time of his death, 471 members of UP had already been assassinated throughout the country. According to his obituary from Semana, \\"Jaime Pardo Leal knew he would be killed. His family knew he would be killed. Patriotic Union knew he would be killed. Journalists knew he would be killed. The whole country knew he would be killed. And finally, he was killed. It was 3:45 in the afternoon on Sunday, October 11.\\" Pardo had received many death threats, and although he initially refused protection from the government he ended up accepting it finally as the threat level increased. On the day of his death he had decided to dispatch his security and kept only one of his bodyguards as he went to his farm in the La Mesa town, near to Bogota. As he drove back to Bogota, men shot at him from another car. Although he was transported immediately to the nearby hospital, he died before he could be helped. = Aftermath = Four people were convicted for his assassination, brothers William and Jaime Infante, Oliveria Acu√±a Infante and Beyer Yesid Barrera. William Infante had been released and was then captured and sentenced to life for drug trafficking in the United States. Barrera was captured and condemned to 24 years in prison for the crime. Drug lord Jos√© Gonzalo Rodr√≠guez Gacha, also known as \\"the Mexican\\", was apparently involved in the murder as a sponsor. The Colombian Communist Party newspaper Voz published a report in which it linked members of the Colombian military to Rodr√≠guez Gacha. Pardo Leal was replaced by Bernardo Jaramillo Ossa as president of UP. Jaramillo was also assassinated during the presidential campaign of 1990. By 1988, the UP announced that more than 500 of its members, including Pardo Leal and four congressmen, had been assassinated to date. Unidentified gunmen later attacked more than 100 of the UP's local candidates in the six months preceding the March 1988 elections. An April 1988 report by Amnesty International charged that members of the Colombian military and government would be involved in what was called a \\"deliberate policy of political murder\\" of UP militants and others. The terms of that accusation were rejected and deemed to be an inaccurate exaggeration by the administration of Virgilio Barco Vargas. By 2003‚Äì2004, the official legal representatives of a partial number of UP victims presented a concrete death toll of about 1,163 to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR), of which 450 (38%) were attributed directly to paramilitary groups. The breakdown of the remainder was not publicly specified.

It is made from the milk of Gloucester cattle. History By 1972 there were just 68 Gloucester breed heifers left in the world. Charles Martell bought up many of the surviving cows, and began to produce cheese from their milk, not initially for its own sake, but to promote interest in the breed. Since then his own herd has expanded to 25 cows, and there has been a revival of interest by other farmers, which has increased the total number of cows to around 450. The relatively small size of Martell's herd means that the Gloucester milk is combined and pasteurised with the milk of Friesian cattle from another farm nearby. The fat content is 48%. The colour of Stinking Bishop ranges from white/yellow to beige, with an orange to grey rind. It is moulded into wheels in weight, in diameter, and deep. Only about 20 tonnes are produced each year. The distinctive odour comes from the process with which the cheese is washed during its ripening; it is immersed in perry made from the local Stinking Bishop pear (from which the cheese gets its name) every four weeks while it matures. To increase the moisture content and to encourage bacterial activity, salt is not added until the cheese is removed from its mould. In 2017 Stinking Bishop launched a bid to \\"make Stinking Bishop to Easter what Stilton is to Christmas\\", including a full-scale social media campaign, in-store media for their UK-wide stockists and a competition to win a tour around Hunts Court Farm.  Availability  Stinking Bishop is an artisanal, handmade cheese and is therefore not produced for supermarkets. It currently has over 130 stockists across the UK, and can be found in artisan food stores and delicatessens, as well as in Harrods and Selfridges. Packaging of Stinking Bishop Cheese A slice showing typical maturation at room temperature In popular culture This cheese was brought to international attention in the 2005 Wallace & Gromit movie, The Curse of the Were-Rabbit, in which Gromit used it to revive Wallace who appeared to be dead. Demand for the cheese subsequently rose by 500%, forcing the cheesemaker to hire more people and increase production. Chef Andrew Zimmern, host of the TV show Bizarre Foods (Travel Channel), tasted Stinking Bishop during a visit to Harrods in London. Note: the show's recap mentions other delicacies tasted by Zimmern, but not the cheese; the relevant part is where Zimmern visits the store and is guided by marketing manager Andre Dange. In the 2011 Channel 4 show King Of..., hosted by Claudia Winkleman, Stinking Bishop was named as the King of Cheese by Winkleman and her two guests; Chris Evans and Sarah Millican. In the Monty Python Live (Mostly) version of the Cheese Shop sketch, Stinking Bishop is added to the list of cheeses after whose availability John Cleese's character enquires in vain.

It is one of the most relevant examples of the Gothic style in Spain. It was built on the site of previous Roman baths of the 2nd century which, 800 years later, king Ordo√±o II converted into a palace. Almost all of it built between 1205 - 1301, the north tower and cloister were built in 14th-century, and the south tower completed in 1472. It is best known for its stained glass windows. With at least 1,764 square meters of surface, most of it containing the original windows, it is one of the most extensive and best preserved collections of medieval stained glass in Europe. Current structure Le√≥n Cathedral, dedicated to Santa Mar√≠a de la Regla, was declared of Cultural Interest in 1844. It is known as the Pulchra Leonina and is a masterpiece of the Gothic style of the mid-13th century. The design is attributed to the architect Enrique. By the mid 15th century it was virtually completed. The main fa√ßade has two towers. The southern tower is known as the 'clock tower'. The Renaissance retrochoir contains alabaster sculptures by Jusquin, Copin of Holland and Juan de Malinas. Particularly noteworthy is the Plateresque iron grillwork screen or reja in the wall behind the sepulchre of King Ordo√±o. It has three portals decorated with sculptures situated in the pointed arches between the two towers. The central section has a large rose window. Particularly outstanding is the image of the Virgen Blanca and the Locus Appellatione, where justice was imparted. The church has nearly 1,800 square meters of stained glass windows. The great majority of them date from the thirteenth to the fifteenth century: a rarity among medieval gothic churches. In the Main Chapel, there is an altarpiece by Nicol√°s Franc√©s (15th century) and a silver urn containing the relics of San Froil√°n, the town's patron saint, made by Enrique de Arfe. The 13th- to 15th-century cloister contains sculpted details in the capitals, friezes and ledges. The Cathedral Museum houses a large collection of sacred art. There are almost 1,500 pieces, including 50 Romanesque sculptures of the Virgin, dating from pre-historic times to the 18th century (Neoclassicism) with works by Juan de Juni, Gregorio Fern√°ndez, Mateo Cerezo, a triptych of the School of Antwerp, a Mozarabic bible and numerous codices. The first manuscript in Leonese language, the Nodicia de Kesos, can be found in its archives. An example of the many stained-glass windows. Wide view of north part of the cathedral. Main rosette. Vaulting of the crossing Leon Cathedral is also one of the three most important cathedrals, along with that of Burgos and Santiago de Compostela, on The Way of Saint James (or in Spanish, El Camino de Santiago). History =Previous constructions= ;The Roman baths and the first cathedral Remains of the thermal baths of Legio VII in the crypt of Puerta Obispo. Originally, under the current location of the cathedral, the Legio VII Gemina had built the baths, with a size larger than the current building. Remains of the first cathedral were explored near the south facade in 1997. During the Christian reconquest the ancient Roman baths were converted into a royal palace. King Ordo√±o II, who had occupied the throne of Leon in 916, defeated the Arabs in the Battle of San Esteban de Gormaz in 917. As a sign of gratitude to God for victory, he gave up his palace to build the first cathedral. Under the episcopate of Fruminio II, the building was transformed into a sacred place. The tomb of Ordo√±o II of Leon, who died in 924, is found in the cathedral. The temple was guarded and governed by monks of the Order of St. Benedict, and it is likely that its structure was very similar to many others existing during the Leonese Mozarabic period. Almanzor campaigned through these lands in the late 10th century, devastating the city and destroying the temples. However, damage to the building of the cathedral appears to have been rapidly addressed, since in the year 999 King Alfonso V was crowned in the church. After the political turmoil and Moorish raids that lasted till 1067 the state of the cathedral was in extreme poverty. This would move to King Ferdinand I of Le√≥n, who, after transferring the remains of San Isidoro to Le√≥n, sought to restore the temple. This king achieved success in the expansion of the kingdom. ;The Romanesque cathedral With the help of Princess Teresa Urraca of Navarre, sister of the king, the construction of a second cathedral, was started, and within its architecture. It fell within the Pelayo II episcopal see. Its style was essentially Romanesque, built in brick and masonry, with three naves finished in semicircular apses, the central one dedicated to Saint Mary, as in the previous church. While the cathedral was built according to the international style, examination of what has survived of its original facade, its originally indigenous nature can be noted. There is still the use of the horseshoe arch, at least decoratively. The cathedral was consecrated on November 10, 1073 during the reign of Alfonso VI. Presumably the same masons who were building the Basilica of San Isidoro of Leon worked on it. This cathedral remained standing until the end of the next century. When the last proprietary king of Leon, Alfonso IX, rose to the throne, the city and the kingdom witnessed major social, artistic, and cultural changes. =The Current Gothic Cathedral= Le√≥n Cathedral, main facade South facade The cathedral around 1850, with plateresque gables in the facades and the baroque dome and pinnacles in the crossing. Reconstruction of the Western facade, approximately 1890. Construction of the third cathedral, now Gothic in style, began circa 1205, but problems with the foundation delayed continued work until 1255 under Bishop Mart√≠n Fern√°ndez with the support of King Alfonso X of Castile and Le√≥n. The design is attributed to the master Enrique, perhaps a native of France, who had previously worked on the Cathedral of Burgos. Clearly, he knew the Gothic architectural form of the Isle of France. He died in 1277 and was replaced by the Spaniard Juan Perez. In 1289, Bishop Mart√≠n Fern√°ndez was also dying when the front of the temple was already open for worship. The basic structure of the cathedral was finished soon, and in 1302 Bishop Gonzalo Osorio opened the whole church to the faithful. The cloister and the north tower were completed in the fourteenth century. The south tower was not completed until the second half of the fifteenth century. The Cathedral of Leon, like its sister predecessor, Burgos Cathedral, follows the layout of the Reims Cathedral. Like most French cathedrals, the one of Leon is built with a geometric module based on the triangle (ad triangulum), the primary lines of which relate to the square root of 3, and to which respond all of the parts and the whole. This aspect, as with the layout, the elevations, and the decorative and symbolic repertoires, makes this cathedral an authentic trans- Pyrenee building, removed from Hispanic fashion and belonging to the purest school of French Champagne. This has earned it the epithets of being \\"the most French of Spanish cathedrals\\" or the Pulchra Leonina (the Beauty of Leon), since its formal features are related to the Gothic style of Champagne. In addition to its layout, the Cathedral of Leon is also inspired by that of Rheims in its structure, the form of the chapels of its ambulatory (in this case polygonal), and the development of its transept. The influence of Chartres Cathedral can be seen in the western porch. The one in Leon abandons the model of Rheims Cathedral in the elevations beyond the body of the clerestory, as it is transparent there and it accommodates the technical progress achieved in the Sainte Chapelle and Amiens Cathedral. French influence is also found in developing the chancel, where initially the choir was to be put according to their custom. Specifically Leonese is the location of the cloister, with no organic tie to the temple, the exit in the floor plan of the towers of the main facade, displaying the elevation of the buttresses of the nave, and the discontinuity of the five naves at the front end of the main area of the temple, which were reduced to three. The problem was that much of the foundation site sits upon Roman ruins, hypocausts of the second century, hampering a good foundation for the pillars. The accumulation of moisture and water seepage caused serious inconveniences to the master builders. Besides that, most of the stones of the cathedral are of poor quality rock, a limestone, with little resistance to atmospheric agents. In addition, the subtlety of its style is a challenge to its construction materials; the numerous supports are extremely fragile, the lines are reduced to a total optimization, to such a degree that several architects of the time questioned whether such a project could remain standing. This almost unreal structure, together with the poor quality of the stone and its poor foundation, forced it to suffer constant interventions and restorations from the fifteenth century on, changing the temple into a European model for transformative intervention, restoration and conservation.  Modifications and restorations  Extensive modifications and additions have been made to the Cathedral, sometimes trying to improve its stability but also to adapt it to contemporary taste, until restorations beginning in the nineteenth century tried to remove most non-Gothic elements and restore the building to its original, purely Gothic state. In the fifteenth century, the South tower was finished, in the Flamboyant Gothic style. Also in this style was the library, currently the Chapel of Santiago, built by Juan de Badajoz el Viejo at the end of the century. In the sixteenth century, Juan de Badajoz el Mozo started the addition of non-Gothic elements with the construction of a plateresque gable in the Western facade, too tall and heavy. He also added a plateresque sacristy in the South-East end of the Cathedral and rebuilt some vaults. Serious problems started in the seventeenth century. Parts of the largest vault in the crossing fell down in 1631. It was replaced by a baroque semicircular dome designed by Juan de Naveda. This addition damaged the delicate balance of the whole building, causing cracks in the Southern facade that needed restoration in the end of the century, including a new gable. In the eighteenth century, Joaquin de Churriguera tried to improve stability by adding four pinnacles around the dome, but this caused further damage. The Cathedral was affected by the Lisbon earthquake of 1755. Extensive rebuilding of the Southern facade was done. In 1857, stones started to fell down from the central nave and the crossing, causing fears of a complete collapse. Mat√≠as Lavi√±a started a full restoration of the building in 1859. He dismantled the central dome and the pinnacles, parts of the transept and the Southern facade. After Lavi√±a died in 1868, Juan de Madrazo was commissioned to direct the restoration. He was a friend of Viollet-le-Duc and had a good knowledge of the French Gothic style. The goal of his extensive work was making the Cathedral stable and restoring its original pure Gothic style. He placed a complex wooden support structure to keep the vaults in place and proceeded to rebuild the vaults and the Southern facade. When the supports were removed in 1878 and the building resisted, it meant that the original Gothic balance system had been restored. Madrazo's successors, Demetrio de los R√≠os and Juan Bautista L√°zaro, kept removing alien elements, like the plateresque gable in the Western facade, and replacing them with Neo-Gothic designs. The stained glass windows, that had been dismantled and stored for years, were restored after 1895. Finally, the Cathedral was reopened in 1901, after one of the most complex and extensive restoration projects in nineteenth century Europe. Smaller restoration works were undertaken during the twentieth century. A fire caused by lightning consumed the rooftop in May 27th 1966, but the structure suffered no serious damage (thanks, partly, to the decision of not using too much water to put out the blaze). A general project to restore the stained glass started in 2009.  Bibliography  In Spanish * Ricardo Puente, La Catedral de Santa Mar√≠a de Le√≥n. Le√≥n, Imprenta Moderna.

History According to family tradition, they originated from the area of Mestre, and had settled in Venice proper in the late 10th century, and the first members of the family are attested in written sources in the early 11th century. The Foscari were not very important during the subsequent centuries, but in the 13th century, after the Fourth Crusade, they became rulers of the Greek island of Lemnos, along with the Navagero family, until 1276. The family's real rise to prominence began in the early 14th century, when they managed to be included among the patrician families that held the hereditary right to be members of the Great Council of Venice following the so-called \\"Serrata\\" (\\"Closing\\"). As membership in the Great Council was a prerequisite for holding any of the senior offices of the Republic of Venice, this meant that henceforth the upper nobility monopolized control of the state. The first important member of the family was Niccol√≤, who owned much property both in Venice and in the hinterland (terraferma). His contacts with the princes of northern Italy led to him being knighted by Cangrande I della Scala, Lord of Verona, in 1328, while three years later, he was enfeoffed over his estates at Zellarino, Noventa, and San Bruson and given the hereditary title of count by John of Luxemburg. Niccol√≤ married three times and had two sons, Giovanni and Jacobello, and two daughters, Agnesina and Maria. Giovanni enjoyed a long and somewhat successful career in public office, serving as military commander, city governor (podesta), and ambassador. He had at least six sons, of whom the most prominent were Paolo, who became a priest and eventually rose to become Latin Archbishop of Patras, Niccol√≤ the younger, and Franzi Foscari. Until his death in 1412, Niccol√≤ served in a succession of political offices, including governor of Corfu and Verona, ducal councillor, and finally a member of the powerful Council of Ten. The eldest of his six children was the future doge Francesco Foscari. Franzi Foscari also followed a distinguished career until his death in 1424/25, and his son Polidoro Foscari rose to become Archbishop of Zara. The family reached its apogee under Francesco Foscari, Doge of Venice from 1423 to 1457, when he was forced to abdicate by the Council of Ten. Francesco Foscari's dogeship was marked by Venice's expansion in the terraferma and its wars with the Duchy of Milan, but also by the increasingly autocratic rule of the Doge, and the trials and exile of his son Jacopo Foscari for bribery and corruption. Jacopo's misdeeds, actual and alleged, provided a means for the Doge's political opponents to attack him, and played a major role in Francesco's own downfall. The tragic spectacle of a father, acting as head of state, forced to send his only surviving son into exile, provided much inspiration for artists, such as Lord Byron's The Two Foscari, on which Giuseppe Verdi based his opera I due Foscari. The family continued after that, but never recovered its former prominence. In 1558, brothers Nicolo and Luigi Foscari commissioned a new villa beside the Brenta canal on the terraferma, the main land near Venice, with architect Andrea Palladio. It was completed in 1560 and is one of the most splendid examples of Palladianism. The villa was sold by the family in 1926, but re-purchased in 1973 and restored to its old glory. It houses a museum. In the 19th century count Piero Foscari married the Austrian countess Elisabeth Widmann-Rezzonico, heiress of the lordship of Paternion in Carinthia, Austria. Paternion Castle, together with castles P√∂llan and Kreuzen and 8,800 hectares of forest, are still today owned by the Austrian branch, the counts Foscari-Widmann- Rezzonico.

While Tacitus' Germania makes no mention of them, Ptolemy's Geographia locates the Charudes (ŒßŒ±œÅŒø·ø¶Œ¥ŒµœÇ) on the east coast of the Cimbrian peninsulaPtolemy, Geography, book II, c. 10. (see Hardsyssel). Their name suggests that they may have at one point settled in east jutland and founded the city of Charudes (Arus or nowadays Aarhus). People of classical times Sometime before 60 BC, the \\"rex Germanorum\\" Ariovistus had been petitioned by the Celtic Sequani for assistance in their war against the Aedui. In return, Ariovistus was promised land grants in Gaul, although exactly where is not certain. Gathering forces from a wide area of Germany, Ariovistus crossed the Rhine with large numbers and defeated the Aedui at the Battle of Magetobriga. It is in the context of Ariovistus' subsequent land claims that the Harudes are first mentioned by Caesar: > \\"But a worse thing had befallen the victorious Sequani than the vanquished > Aedui, for Ariovistus, the king of the Germans, had settled in their > territories, and had seized upon a third of their land, which was the best > in the whole of Gaul, and was now ordering them to depart from another third > part, because a few months previously 24,000 men of the Harudes had come to > him, for whom room and settlements must be provided.\\" (Commentaries on the > Gallic War, I.31) In the following battle against Caesar near Vesontio (Besan√ßon), the Harudes formed one of the seven tribal divisions of Ariovistus' host. After suffering a crushing defeat at the hands of the Romans, the Germans fled back over the Rhine.Julius Caesar, Commentaries on the Gallic War, I.51ff. The Harudes (in the graecized form \\"Charydes\\") are next mentioned in the Res Gestae Divi Augusti, in which Augustus claims that his fleet had \\"sailed from the mouth of the Rhine eastward as far as the lands of the Cimbri to which, up to that time, no Roman had ever penetrated either by land or by sea, and the Cimbri and Charydes and Semnones and other peoples of the Germans of that same region (Cimbrian peninsula) through their envoys sought my friendship and that of the Roman people\\".Res Gestae Divi Augusti, 5.26. The naval expedition in question took place in 5 AD under the generalship of Tiberius and is also attested by Velleius Paterculus.Velleius Paterculus, II.106. Germanic migrations During the later age of Germanic migrations, the Harudes do not seem to appear in Jutland. Instead, the Angles and Jutes are there, who migrate to Britain. In Tacitus the Angles are further south. Perhaps not all the Harudes left Jutland, and the Harudes could have been a constituent of the Jutes. Norway and beyond The Angles were probably occupying territory abandoned at least in part by the Harudes, as the latter migrated into Norway. There they are believed to be the H«´r√∞ar people who settled in Hordaland and gave name to the fjord Hardanger. In a second theory, the H«´r√∞ar are identical to the Arochi dwelling in the Scandza mentioned in the Getica of Jordanes, which dates to the 6th century, but might refer to any time prior to then. The ch in that case would be a corruption of th, with the initial h not expressed. Jordanes had read Ptolemy, but he claimed to be writing of times before those of Ptolemy. A comparison of Germanic geography in the works of the two men has raised some questions concerning the direction in which some Germanics migrated. On the whole, based on Jordanes, the direction has been taken to be southward from Scandinavia, and it is possible that the Charudes of Ptolemy's Jutland arrived there in prehistory from a more ancient Hordaland. On the other hand, the H«´r√∞ar could have intruded locally and late into Norway. Some have expanded this idea into a theory that the Goths originated in Germany and entered Scandinavia in the age of Germanic migration. As this hypothesis discounts Jordanes' judgement but accepts his tribal picture, it is not generally accepted. Etymology Latin Harudes is also attested in Old English as H√¶redas and related to Old Norse H√∂r√∞ar \\"Hords\\". This name is considered to be an extension of Germanic *xaru√æaz (PIE *·∏±osdho-) \\"forest\\" (cf. OE , OHG \\"mountain forest, wooded hills\\", MHG ), making the Harudes the \\"forest-dwellers\\".Orel, Vladimir. A Handbook of Germanic Etymology. Leiden, Netherlands: Brill, 2003: 164.

History  The ancient ruins at Con√≠mbriga, the best preserved ruins in the ancient Roman province of Lusitania. Inhabited by the Lusitanians, an Indo-European people living in the western Iberian Peninsula, the Romans settled in the region and colonized it as a part of the Roman Province of Lusit√¢nia. The Roman town of Con√≠mbriga, near Coimbra, is among the most noted and well-preserved remains of that period. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, Visigoths were the main rulers and colonizers from the 5th to the 8th century. In the 8th century, the Muslim conquest of Iberia turned the region a Muslim-dominated territory. In the earliest years of the Christian Reconquista, just before the rise of a Portuguese national identity, the region was a battleplace for Muslim Moors and Christian crusaders. Once the Moors were expelled, the Christian kings and landlords made the region a county, called the County of Coimbra. It was integrated into the newly created Condado Portucalensis, the early precursor of the modern nation of Portugal. The modern region matches up roughly with the boundaries of the historical Beira Province, as well as the Oeste in former Estremadura and M√©dio Tejo in former Ribatejo. Beira was an historical province of Portugal and its name was used by the heirs to the Portuguese throne during the monarchy period, before 1910.

Over the centuries, Moors, Christians, Spaniards and Portuguese have all tried to take these villages, but their higher elevations usually gave them a distinct advantage. On that border, the more than one dozen fortified frontier villages beckon today's visitors to come explore a 900-year history ‚Äî full of the heroism, epic battles and romance upon which Portugal struggled to become a nation. Today, Portugal boasts the longest-standing border in all of Europe.Sortelha, the historic town nestled within the rugged hills.In these rural border villages, ancient rituals and religious festivals remain popular. Visitors can sample them and partake in the traditional foods of that area, such as cheese, sausages, and mountain honey. In the fortress town of Almeida, a walk through the narrow cobbled streets can lead a visitor to the ruins of a once mighty 12-pointed fortress. One of Portugal's many Pousadas‚Äî an historic property turned into an inn‚Äî is located in Almeida. In the town of Castelo Rodrigo, a memorial stone marks the place of a fierce battle in 1664, and visitors can view the remains of the castle and its keep, as well as a palace. The town also has a small Gothic church. Near Castelo Mendo stands an intricate stone bridge built by the Romans. = Frontier castles = Most of the castles in this border region of Centro are classified as national monuments. These stone fortresses date back to the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries. Castles, or parts of castles, still stand at Alfaiates, Sortelha, Vilar Maior, Sabugal, Castelo Mendo, Castelo Bom, Castelo Rodrigo, Penamacor, Monsanto, Pinhel and Almeida. A 20-castle route has been delineated by the Portugal government (see www.visitportugal.com), of which Sortelha, Castelo Mendo, Castelo Rodrigo and the fortified town of Almeida are considered gems among them all.  Geography  The Sanctuary of F√°tima is located in the Center Region of Portugal. The Centro is a region of diversified landscapes. The interior is mountainous with some plateaus, dominated by the Serra da Estrela mountain. The region is plentiful of pine and chestnut trees forests. The green, rugged landscape of this region is crisscrossed by rivers. Several river valleys at the foot of the mountains have a full bodied charm that draw one to outdoor activities like hiking, fishing, tennis and canoeing. In the Winter season, skiing on Serra da Estrela is a popular activity, but in some places, like near the town of Seia, skiing before the Winter season is possible due to artificial snow infrastructures. The coastal plain has several beaches, like the ones of Mira, Figueira da Foz, √çlhavo, Nazar√©, Peniche and S√£o Martinho do Porto. Natural landmarks in this region are the Serra da Estrela mountain range (the biggest and highest in mainland Portugal), with its Serra da Estrela Natural Park, the Mondego river (the longest river located exclusively in Portuguese territory), the Aveiro Lagoon (Ria de Aveiro) and the coastal beaches. The largest urban centres include Coimbra, F√°tima, Aveiro, Viseu, Leiria, Covilh√£, Castelo Branco, Figueira da Foz, Guarda, Pombal, Tomar, Abrantes, Torres Vedras, Torres Novas, √Ågueda and Caldas da Rainha. = Subregions = Subregion map of the Centro Region. (before the addition of M√©dio Tejo and Oeste sub-regions) The region is divided in eight sub-regions: * Beira Baixa * Beiras e Serra da Estrela * M√©dio Tejo * Oeste * Regi√£o de Aveiro * Regi√£o de Coimbra * Regi√£o de Leiria * Viseu D√£o Laf√µes  Economy  The Gross domestic product (GDP) of the region was 38.2 billion euros in 2018, accounting for 18.8% of Portugal's economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 20,100 euros or 67% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 68% of the EU average. One of Portugal's richest regions by the abundance of natural streams of water, forests, arable land and its long coast line, the Centro region has some of the most economically dynamic and densely populated municipalities of the country. Excellent transportation links with the Lisbon metropolitan area to the south and the Porto Metropolitan Area to the north, making ocean, rail and motorway access possible via containers, have all contributed to making manufacturing the principal industry, found mainly in the littoral strip, which is one of the largest industrialized areas in Portugal. Important products such as motor vehicles, food, electrical appliances, machinery, chemicals, and paper are produced there. Higher education, research and development, healthcare, information technologies, biotechnology, forestry, agriculture, fishing, and tourism industries are all major industries in the region. The wine regions of D√£o DOC and Bairrada DOC are among the most reputed in Portugal. The major industrial, commerce, and service centres are located in and around Coimbra, Aveiro, Viseu, Leiria, Covilh√£, Castelo Branco, and Figueira da Foz. Important light industry and agriculture is also based in and around Guarda, Torres Novas, Torres Vedras and Caldas da Rainha.  Education  The Centro region has three public universities: the University of Coimbra, the oldest Portuguese university and the largest in the region; the Aveiro University; and the University of Beira Interior. There are also five state-run polytechnical institutes: Castelo Branco Polytechnical Institute; Coimbra Polytechnical Institute; Guarda Polytechnical Institute; Leiria Polytechnical Institute; and Viseu Polytechnical Institute. In addition, there are a large number of public nursing schools and private higher education institutions across the region.

He won the German National Road Race in 1959, 1960 and 1961. Junkermann was born in St. T√∂nis, near Krefeld, Rhine Province. He excelled in mountainous stage races and hard one-day events. He won nine Six Day races and the European Madison championship in 1965. He rode the Tour de France eight times. Junkermann showed class as an amateur and was approached twice in 1954 to defect to the GDR and become a paid amateur, but he wanted to stay in West Germany and be a professional. He turned professional in 1955 season for the small Bauer team. In May 1957 he won Z√ºri-Metzgete, followed by fourth in the Tour de Suisse, the start of his excellent record in the Swiss tour, a hilly stage race. In 1959 he moved to Faema-Molteni under Rik Van Looy, winning the national road championship, a feat he repeated in 1960 and 1961. He won his first Tour de Suisse in 1959 after finishing second the previous year. Defensive riding and no support from his team stopped him from winning the Tour de France. He came fourth in 1960 and fifth in 1961. He abandoned in 1962, claiming his food was tampered with in Luchon. Junkermann came second in the 1961 Tour of Germany and sixth in the Giro d'Italia. In 1962 he switched to Wiel‚Äôs-Groene Leeuw with 1963 world champion Benoni Beheyt of Belgium. Junkermann won the 1962 Tour de Suisse and came third in La Fl√®che Wallonne. In 1963 he won the Rund um den Henninger Turm in Frankfurt am Main. This was the 29-year-old's last big victory on the road although his career continued for a further ten years. His best results in latter years were 11th in the 1967 Tour de France and 7th in the 1965 Vuelta a Espa√±a. In 1964 he won six- day races at Essen, Cologne and Frankfurt, riding with specialists Peter Post and Rudi Altig. After retirement in 1973 Junkermann coached young riders for 25 years, first with the RSV City Neuwied cycling team and between 1984 and 1998 with Olympia Dortmund. At Dortmund, he brought Erik Zabel, Udo Bolts, Rolf Aldag, Kai Hundertmarck and Bernd Groene through the ranks to become professionals. Junkermann lives in Krefeld and at 70 was still riding several hundred kilometres a week.

The satellite communications facility is located at Belrose on Sydney's Northern Beaches. Optus' satellites are divided into 4 classes A, B, C and D. As of April 2014 it owns and operates Optus B3, Optus C1, Optus D1, Optus D2 and Optus D3. Optus A1, Optus A2, Optus A3 and Optus B1 satellites have been retired. Optus has the largest network of satellites in Australia and New Zealand. On February 2, 2014 NBN Co of Australia chose Optus for a five-year contract to operate two purpose-built satellites to deliver high speed broadband across rural and remote Australia. A-Class *Satellite Type: Hughes HS-376 *Design Life: 7 Years for A1 & A2 - 10 Years for A3 *Equipment: 15 Ku band transponders (including four 30W transponders and eleven 12W transponders) *Diameter: 2.2m *Height: 2.9m (stowed), 6.3m (deployed) The Aussat A-Class satellites were funded by the Government for Aussat Pty Ltd. When Optus was granted a telecommunications carrier licence in 1991, it was bundled with the purchase of Aussat Pty Limited as part of the carrier licence deal. =Aussat (Optus) A1= Aussat 1 (now Optus A1) on deployment from on right *Operational Location: 160¬∞ east (1985‚Äì1993) *Launch Date: 27 August 1985 (Out of service; not deorbited) Aussat 1 was deployed by during the first day of the STS-51-I mission. =Aussat (Optus) A2= *Operational Locations: 156¬∞ east (1985‚Äì1993), 164¬∞ east (1993‚Äì1999) *Launch Date: 27 November 1985 (Out of service; not deorbited) Aussat 2 was deployed by during the STS-61-B mission. =Aussat (Optus) A3= *Operational Locations: 164¬∞ east (1987‚Äì1993), 156¬∞ east (1993‚Äì1995), 152¬∞ east (1995‚Äì1999) *On retirement from Optus service, Optus A3 was transferred to the 31.5¬∞E orbital position which belongs to SES. *Launch Date: 16 September 1987 *Moved to graveyard orbit and shutdown: April 2008 Watch The shutdown on Youtube.com *Was the oldest HS-376 still in active operation Aussat 3 was launched from Guiana Space Centre by an Ariane 3. B-Class *Satellite Type: Hughes HS-601 *Design Life: 10 Years *Equipment: 15 Ku band transponders, 1 L band transponder, Ka band beacon, laser retroreflector The B-Class satellites were manufactured by Hughes and launched from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center by Long March rockets. The two satellites were the first U.S.-built satellites to be approved by the Reagan administration for launch on Chinese rockets. To break into the commercial launch market, the Chinese offered to launch for less than half of what a U.S. launch company would charge. =Optus B1= *Primary mission location: 160¬∞ east *Current location: Sent to Junk orbit *Launch date: 13 August 1992 *Beacon frequencies: 12.748.000 H / 12.749.000 H Optus B1 was moved to Junk orbit in May 2008. Failures Satellite Control Processor On 21 May 2005 services were temporarily lost when the Primary Satellite Control Processor failed. The satellite was switched to use the Backup SCP in order to restore services. Thereafter the satellite continued to operate from the Backup SCP. March 2006 Positioning Failure At 06:52 UTC on 30 March 2006, a routine repositioning manoeuvre failed, resulting in loss of pointing control of the satellite. Although communication with the satellite was not lost, transmission services provided by the satellite failed due to its incorrect positioning. Services were progressively restored between 18:00 and 20:00 UTC. Local time at the time of the start of the outage ranged from 14:52 AWST to 18:52 NZST, a peak time for listeners and viewers of the radio and television broadcast and subscription services provided directly or indirectly by the satellite. =Optus B2= *Launch Date: 21 December 1992 The Long March 2E rocket carrying Optus B2 experienced a collapse of the payload fairing, destroying the satellite. The rocket continued functioning and delivered the debris into low-earth orbit. The cause of the failure could not be determined at the time. However, the Long March 2E experienced the same payload fairing collapse when launching Apstar 2 in 1995. Based on instrumentation added to the satellite, Hughes determined that the failure was caused by aerodynamic forces and wind shear. The information provided by Hughes caused great political controversy in the United States, which subsequently banned U.S. satellites from being launched on Chinese rockets. =Optus B3= *Primary mission locations: 156¬∞ east (from initial launch until establishment of Optus C1), 152¬∞ east (until establishment of Optus D2) *Current location: 164¬∞ east inclined(as at 2008-02-17) *Launch Date: 27 August 1994 Optus B3 was launched as a replacement for Optus B2. After the fairing failure that destroyed Optus B2, Hughes recommended reinforcement of the fairing. The Chinese chose not to follow the recommendations and instead added more rivets. The launch of Optus B3 was successful, but the next launch of the Long March 2E experienced another fairing failure and destroyed the Apstar 2 satellite. This satellite is owned by the Commonwealth Bank of Australia and leased back to Singtel Optus. It was replaced by Optus D2. Optus (and Defence) C1 right *Satellite Type: Space Systems/Loral (SS/L): LS-1300 *Launch Date: 11 June 2003 *Location: 156¬∞ east *Design Life: 15 Years *Equipment: 24 Ku band transponders, 4 (+1) Ka band transponders, 4 X band transponders, 6 UHF transponders Partially funded by the Australian Government (Defence Department) - Optus C1's use is shared between Defence and Telecommunications, in particular the supply of Television services to Australia. Mitsubishi Electric was the prime contractor responsible for manufacturing all the Optus C1 communications systems. D-Class right *Manufacturer: Orbital Sciences Corporation *Satellite type: Orbital STAR 2 platform *Design life: 15+ years The D1 and D2 satellites replace and expand the services provided by the B1 and B3 satellites respectively, which had both been operating beyond their design lifetimes. The D3 satellite is co-located with C1 to expand capacity. =Optus D1= *Location: 160¬∞ east *Launch Date: 2006-10-13 *Equipment: 24 Ku band transponders *Launch mass: 2350 kg D1 was successfully launched by an Ariane 5 ECA on 13 October 2006 at 20:56 UTC. It was the first satellite to sign contract for Launch Services Alliance mission assurance. Customers on D1 include the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), Special Broadcasting Service (SBS), the Seven Network, the Nine Network, Sky Television New Zealand and New Zealand's Kordia (formerly known as BCL). D1 also supports VSAT users. Kordia is leasing a full transponder for sublease to TVNZ (TV1 & TV2) and MediaWorks (TV3 & Bravo) for the Freeview service. The Kordia transponder will be on 12.4697 GHz. Incorrect configuration of New Zealand spot beam During in-orbit testing of the satellite, it was discovered that the New Zealand spot beam had been configured with horizontal polarisation instead of the expected vertical polarisation - as had been used on its predecessor Optus B1. As many existing receivers did not have the ability to receive horizontally aligned signals, Sky Television was unable to transfer services from Optus B1 to this beam as expected. Sky was instead assigned capacity on the more general Australia/NZ beam. Due to restrictions on broadcast rights (in terms of both broadcast licensing and copyright), the unencrypted Freeview service could not make a similar allocation switch and was set up as a horizontally-aligned service on the New Zealand spot beam. On 2007-07-31, Sky successfully performed an over the air software upgrade to all of its customer set-top boxes, enabling them to receive the horizontally-aligned signals from the New Zealand spot beam. Accordingly, Sky was able to return to their original capacity allocation. =Optus D2= *Location: 152¬∞ east *Launch date: 2007-10-05 *Equipment: 24 active Ku band transponders (including sixteen 150W transponders and eight 44W transponders). *Launch mass: 2375 kg D2 was successfully launched from the Guiana Space Centre by an Ariane 5 GS on 2007-10-05 at 22:02 UTC.

Eun-shik has a habit of finding himself in awkward situations that often embarrass him and sabotage his attempts to impress Eun-hyo. After serving a two-year mandatory military service, Eun-shik is transferred to the National University, where he plans to major in Law. He stays with 3 other roommates; most of them are typical college freshmen who are equally perverted. Eun-hyo, an aspiring national aerobic athlete, first notices Eun-shik, who is somewhat of an eccentric, in the college canteen while he stared at her tightly clasped thighs protruding from her lower mini-skirt. With a mischievous intentions, she spreads her legs tauntingly, and a glimpse of her white undergarments catches Eun-shik by surprise. Afterwards, their awkward encounters follow. Although Eun-hyo sympathizes with Eun-shik's one-sided love, she eventually picks the most handsome student in college, Sang-ok. While two-timing with another aerobic athlete, Sang-ok spends one night with Eun-hyo, which leads to an accidental pregnancy. Due to his wealthy and spoiled upbringing, he offers her money for an abortion emotionlessly. Insulted by his actions and his lack of responsibility, Eun-hyo runs away and tries to abort by herself. The doctor from clinic requires someone to accompany her during the procedure and recovery. At a loss of whom to confide in, she turns to Eun-shik for help, who is initially illusioned that they are going out on a date.

The provincial capital is San Antonio de Pal√© on the north side of the island; the other town is Mabana, formerly known as San Pedro. The roadstead is relatively safe, and some passing vessels take advantage of it in order to obtain water and fresh provisions, of which Annobon has offered an abundant supply. However, there is no regular shipping service to the rest of Equatorial Guinea, and ships call as infrequently as every few months. According to the 2015 census it had 5,314 inhabitants, a small population increase from the 5,008 registered by the 2001 census. The official language is Spanish but most of the inhabitants speak a creole form of Portuguese. The island's main industries are fishing and forestry.  Name  Annob√≥n derives its name from ' ( \\"Good Year\\"). It was named for the date of its discovery by the Portuguese on New Year's Day () in 1473. During the final years of the Francisco Mac√≠as Nguema administration, the island was called Pigalu and Pagalu, from the Portuguese ' (parrot).  Geography  Detailed map of Annob√≥n (left) Location of Annob√≥n in the Gulf of Guinea Annob√≥n is an extinct volcano about west of Cape Lopez in Gabon and southwest of S√£o Tom√© Island. The main island measures about long by wide, with an area of about , but a number of small rocky islets surround it, including Santar√©m to the south. Its central crater lake is named Lago A Pot and its highest peak is Quioveo, which rises . The island is characterized by a succession of lush valleys and steep mountains, covered with rich woods and luxuriant vegetation. Annob√≥n is often described as being \\"in the Gulf of Guinea\\", like the neighboring islands of S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe, but the formal boundary line for the Gulf of Guinea established by the International Hydrographic Organization actually runs north of it.  History  The island was discovered by the Portuguese on January 1, 1473; it obtained its name from that date (\\"New Year\\"). However, Spanish explorer Diego Ramirez de la Diaz first spotted the island in 1470 and named it San Antonio. It was apparently uninhabited until colonized under the Portuguese from 1474, primarily by Africans from Angola via S√£o Tom√© Island. These slaves (who the Portuguese called escravos de regate) are considered the first members of Annobonese society. Beginning in the early sixteenth century, many of these slaves who were now marrying Europeans gave birth to the next generations of Annobonese who were called forros (slaves about to be free). Forros began to develop a distinct identity and socio-economic powers. This period also saw the emergence of the Creole Annobonese language. The island was passed to Spain by the 1778 Treaty of El Pardo. The treaty granted Spain control of the Portuguese islands of Annob√≥n and Fernando Po (now Bioko) and the Guinea coast between the Niger and the Ogoou√© in exchange for Spanish acceptance of the Portuguese occupation of territories in Brazil west of the line established by the Treaty of Tordesillas. The Spanish colony thus formed would eventually be known as Spanish Guinea. The island's populace was opposed to the arrangement and hostile toward the Spaniards. After the handover and when the Spanish flag was hoisted to affirm Spanish sovereignty, the islanders revolted against the newcomers, in part because they were considered heretical for placing dogs on their flag. (The actual design represents lions.) They expelled them according to a tradition of throwing witches to the sea. A state of anarchy ensued, leading to an arrangement by which the island was administered by a body of five natives, each of whom held the office of governor during the period that elapsed until ten ships landed at the island. This autonomous government continued, with the island claimed by both Spain and Portugal, until the authority of Spain was re-established in the latter part of the 19th century. The island briefly became part of the Elobey, Annob√≥n and Corisco colony until 1909. The British erected a fort at \\"St Antony\\" in 1801, eventually legalized through a lease from the Spanish government in 1827. The base was used by the British to suppress the Atlantic slave trade. During the final years of the administration of Francisco Mac√≠as Nguema, the first president of Equatorial Guinea, the island was called Pigalu or Pagalu. The population felt prejudice against them in Equatorial Guinea and some began advocating separatist movements. In 1993, the central government isolated the island, expelling foreigners including humanitarian organizations. The population rebelled and attacked the governor's residence. The government replied with two extrajudicial executions. International pressure eased hostilities, and political prisoners were released. It was mostly due to this small island that Equatorial Guinea asked for observer status just after the Community of Portuguese Language Countries was formed in 1996, which led to a visit to Equatorial Guinea, in 1998, by the Portuguese foreign minister, Jaime Gama. Its historic, ethnographic, and religious identity is reflected in its provincial flag. In 2006, Equatorial Guinea achieved observer status with the hand of S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe, it kept lobbying to become a full member, contrary to international pressure that wanted to isolate the country due to human rights violations, becoming a full member in 2014 with the very active support of Portuguese-speaking Africa, with the Portuguese language being restored as an official language.  Flora and fauna  Originally, this small equatorial island from the Gabonese coast was uninhabited and had great biological diversity. With colonization, islanders used rafts or \\"cayucos\\" (canoe-like boats), and hunted humpback whales, whale calves, and other cetaceans with harpoons near to the island. Today the Annob√≥n white-eye (Zosterops griseovirescens) and the Annob√≥n paradise flycatcher (Terpsiphone smithii) are endemic passeri (songbirds), as is the S√£o Tom√© Island or Malherbi pigeon (Columba malherbii). There are 29 species of bird on the island as well as 2 bat species (1 endemic); reptiles (5 species endemics): 1 snake, 3 geckos, 2 scincid lizards, 3 marine turtles; river fish: 18 species (1 endemic); mosquitoes, scorpions, and huge centipedes. Introduced domestic animals include fish, guinea fowl, rats, dogs, and cats. The island has no indigenous mammalian predators. Sharks are found in the surrounding sea. There are 208 species of vascular plant (of which 15% are endemic) including the \\"point up\\" baobab, ceiba (used for cayuco construction), ficus, ferns and tree ferns, and great moss masses.  Administration  The capital of the province is San Antonio de Pal√© (formerly St Antony). The island has three community councils (Consejos de Poblados): Anganchi, Aual, and Mabana.  Demographics  The island's inhabitants are of mixed Portuguese and Angolan descent, with some Spanish admixture. The early anti-Spanish sentiment, combined with the isolation from mainland Equatorial Guinea and the proximity of S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe‚Äîwhich is just from the island‚Äîhas helped preserve the island's cultural ties with Portugal. Its culture is very similar to that of S√£o Tom√© and the Afro-Portuguese peoples throughout Africa. The population is Catholic, although with some form of syncretism, and religiosity remains a central feature of local lifestyle.lha de Ano-Bom estabelece liga√ß√£o da Guin√© Equatorial √† lusofonia- DW The island had an estimated population of 3000 through most of the 19th century.  Language  The island's main language is a Portuguese creole known as the Annobonese language (Fa d'Ambu) or Falar de Ano Bom (Portuguese for Annobon Speech).Government official website The Portuguese creole has vigorous use in Annob√≥n. It is common in all domains except government and education where Spanish is used. Spanish is not much spoken in Annob√≥n. Non-creolized Portuguese is used as a liturgical language by local Catholics. In February 2012, Equatorial Guinea's foreign minister signed an agreement with the IILP (Instituto Internacional da L√≠ngua Portuguesa) on the promotion of Portuguese in Equatorial Guinea. This note contains a link to the text of the protocol in PDF format. The adoption of Portuguese followed the announcement on 13 July 2007 by the President of Equatorial Guinea and a 2010 Constitutional Law which established Portuguese as an official language of the Republic. The Annobonese Juan Tom√°s √Åvila Laurel is a writer who has issued reflections on his home island. He writes in Spanish.  Economy  Annobon is of strategic importance to Equatorial Guinea as through its ownership the Equatorial Guinean government claims extensive maritime territory to the south of its neighbour, S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe (which itself lies to the south of Equatorial Guinea's main land mass). Oil in the Gulf of Guinea represents more than 80% of Equatorial Guinea's economy, though supplies from current reserves are predicted by some sources to run out before 2020. Although no drilling is currently taking place in S√£o Tom√©, there are estimated to be of oil within its marine borders. Equatorial Guinea claims the right to explore for and produce hydrocarbons in a huge area of sea surrounding Annob√≥n that stretches from 1¬∞N to almost 5¬∞S, and from 2¬∞E to 7¬∞E, an area larger than the entire land and sea borders of the rest of Equatorial Guinea.  Environment  According to many different sources,G. Wood, \\"Business and politics in a criminal state: the case of Equatorial Guinea\\", African Affairs Volume 103, Issue 413 Pp. 547-567. there is evidence of large-scale dumping of toxic waste on the remote island of Annobon, at least during the 1980s and 1990s. The German edition of Der Spiegel on 28 August 2006 reported that the government of Equatorial Guinea sold permits to UK and US companies to bury 10 million metric tons of toxic waste and 7 million metric tons of radioactive waste on the island of Annob√≥n. Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, president of Equatorial Guinea, supposedly receives 200 million US dollars per year for renewed permits, while the population of Annob√≥n lives in extreme poverty. The report also showed evidence that the whole island's ecosystem is about to collapse due to the massive waste dumping.

It was to be the next entry in the Metroid series of video games, and a sequel to the 2002 Game Boy Advance title Metroid Fusion. It was first seen in internal software list made by Nintendo in 2005 and a revelation at the Electronic Entertainment Expo convention in 2005 and 2006 was anticipated; it was not revealed in either year, and is the only game to date on the list that has not been revealed. A message in the 2007 video game Metroid Prime 3: Corruption was believed to contain a reference to Metroid Dread, but Corruption director Mark Pacini said this was a coincidence. Metroid series designer Yoshio Sakamoto confirmed that the game had existed, but that staff would start from scratch if development resumed. Critics expressed an interest in seeing the game or a similar 2D side-scrolling Metroid game released, and listed Metroid Dread in their \\"most wanted\\" list. The next side-scrolling Metroid game was Metroid: Samus Returns in 2017. History Metroid series designer Yoshio Sakamoto at the 2010 Game Developers Conference Metroid Dread first appeared in an official internal software list made by Nintendo in 2005 which listed \\"key DS games set to be announced in the future.\\" This led to the expectation that it would appear at the Electronic Entertainment Expo convention in both 2005 and 2006. It was to be a 2D side-scrolling video game and a sequel to the 2002 video game Metroid Fusion. IGN editor Craig Harris noted that Nintendo revealed it too early and that people should wait until next year. Rumors suggested that Metroid Dread was canceled or placed in development hell. Metroid Dread is the only game on the internal software list that has not yet been released. A message reading \\"Experiment status report update: Metroid project 'Dread' is nearing the final stages of completion\\" was found in the 2007 Retro Studios video game Metroid Prime 3: Corruption, which led to speculation that this was in reference to Metroid Dread. Corruption game director Mark Pacini denied a connection and stated that it was entirely coincidental. Wired writer Chris Kohler expressed skepticism over Retro's denial of a reference to Metroid Dread in Corruption; he noted that it would be believable if Pacini said that it was a joke, but the claim that it was a coincidence was not. When asked by Kotaku whether the Wii game Metroid: Other M (2010) was what became of Metroid Dread, Metroid series designer Yoshio Sakamoto said it was not. Sakamoto also denied Dreads connection with the Nintendo 3DS game Metroid: Samus Returns (2017), stating that it is a remake of Metroid II: Return of Samus (1991) and not something to do with Dread. GamesTM asked Sakamoto whether Dread ever existed; Sakamoto confirmed its existence but stated that if the staff went back to it, they would \\"start from scratch.\\" Sakamoto also stated that they were \\"waiting and watching and reading the comments to see what people are interested in before we make any comment on the project.\\" According to Sakamoto, questions about Metroid Dread were popular, especially in interviews following E3. In May 2010, Craig Harris stated that the story for Metroid Dread was completed and that he had seen it. He claimed that Nintendo was able to \\"bring it back at any time.\\" Research conducted by Unseen64 in 2015 indicated that a playable prototype was created around 2008 and shown to Nintendo Software Technology and Nintendo of America staff at E3 2009. According to Unseen64, the project was no longer called Metroid Dread at that point and had an art style similar to Metroid Fusion. In a 2018 interview with Hobby Consolas, Sakamoto said that the DS was not powerful enough to create the Metroid game that he had envisioned. Response Since its listing, critics have expressed an interest in Metroid Dread or a similar 2D side-scrolling Metroid title project being revived. Audrey Drake listed it as her second most-wanted thing at E3 2012, specifically developed by Retro Studios and released for the Nintendo 3DS with \\"Super Metroid-style gameplay.\\" IGN featured it in their \\"Life Support: Games in Danger\\" article. K. Thor Jensen included it in his list of \\"video games you will never, ever play.\\" He felt that Metroid: Other M was a disappointment and it made him nostalgic for Dread. Patrick Klepek noted that the possible cancellation of the game was not good for \\"old school Metroid fans.\\" Thomas East included Dread and its apparent reference in Corruption in their list of \\"11 amazing Metroid facts and secrets.\\" East added that he was hopeful for a possible 3DS release. Marc Zablotny, a writer for the Official Nintendo Magazine, included it in his 2013 wishlist. He used Kirby's Return to Dream Land, a game originally announced in 2005 and released in 2011, to show the possibility that Metroid Dread could still be made. He also stated that he was more interested in what Dread \\"stood for rather than the specific game itself.\\" Zablotny later included it in a list of the \\"15 more Nintendo Games you never got to play\\" and called it one of the most infamous examples of a cancelled Nintendo game. Nick Chester from Destructoid criticized Nintendo for its focus on titles such as the Brain Age series as opposed to a 2D Metroid game.

Early years  Herbert Macaulay was born in Broad St., Lagos on 14 November 1864 to the family of Thomas Babington Macaulay and Abigail Crowther. His parents were children of people captured from what is now Nigeria, resettled in Sierra Leone by the British West Africa Squadron, and eventual returnees to present day Nigeria. Thomas Babington Macaulay was one of the sons of Ojo Oriare while Abigail Crowther was the daughter of Bishop Samuel Ajayi Crowther, a descendant of King Abiodun. Thomas Babington Macaulay was the founder of the first secondary school in Nigeria, the CMS Grammar School, Lagos.  Education  Macaulay entered primary school in 1869 and from 1869 to 1877, he was educated at St Paul's Breadfruit School, Lagos and CMS Faji School, Lagos. From 1877 to October 1880, he attended CMS Grammar School, Lagos for his secondary education. He was a student at the school when his father died in 1878. In 1880, he joined his maternal uncle's trade steamer and embarked on a trade and missionary journey across the Niger River visiting Bonny, Lokoja, Gbebe and Brass. After going to a Christian missionary school, he took a job as a clerical assistant and indexer at the Department of Public Works, Lagos. Thereafter, with the support of the colonial administration, Macaulay left Lagos on 1 July 1890 to further his training in England. From 1891 to 1894 he studied civil engineering in Plymouth, England and was also a pupil of G.D. Bellamy, a borough surveyor and water engineer in Plymouth. In 1893, he became a graduate of the Royal Institute of British Architects, London. Macaulay was also an accomplished musician who received a certificate in music from Trinity College, London and a certificate in violin playing from Music International College, London. Career Upon his return to Lagos in September 1893, he resumed work with the colonial service as a surveyor of Crown Lands. He left the service as land inspector in September 1898 due to growing distaste for the British rule over the Lagos Colony and the position of Yorubaland and the Niger Coast Protectorate as British colonies in all but name. Other authors such as Patrick Dele-Cole have noted the abuse of office allegations (leveled by his British superiors) and pursuit of private gain controversy that clouded Macaulay's resignation as surveyor of Crown Grants.Kristin Mann, citing British Colonial Government dispatches, notes that Macaulay behaved dishonestly, by using \\"his position as Surveyor of Crown Lands to help friends acquire crown grants and persecute enemies by granting their land to others\\". She further writes that Macaulay \\"obtained crown grants under false names and then sold them at a profit\\". In October 1898, he obtained a license to practice as a surveyor. As a surveyor, his plans and valuations included E.J. Alex Taylor's house on Victoria Street, Henry Carr's residence in Tinubu, Akinola Maja's house and Doherty Villa in Campos Square. Private life Macaulay married Caroline Pratt, daughter of an African Superintendent of Police in December 1898. Their marriage came to an end in August 1899 upon Caroline's death during childbirth and Macaulay is reported to have vowed never to marry again. While Macaulay never remarried in the Church, he had mistresses from whom he had a number of children, as well as companionships which bore no children (Stella Davies Coker, daughter of JPL Davies and Sarah Forbes Bonetta, lived with Macaulay from 1909 until her death in 1916. They had a daughter named Sarah Abigail Idowu Macaulay Adadevoh. Sarah Abigail was named after her maternal grandmother Sarah Forbes Bonetta and her paternal grandmother Abigail Crowther). Macaulay was reportedly the first Nigerian to own a motor car. Though from a family of devout Anglicans, Macaulay embraced indigenous African religious traditions, was superstitious, and dabbled in the practice of magic. His personal papers contain notes from fortune tellers and diviners with instructions around taboos, divinations, sacrifices, and other occult practices. Macaulay was also a member of the Association of Babalawos (Ifa priests) of Lagos. Macaulay was a great socialite in Victorian Lagos. He organized concerts at his residence (named \\"Kirsten Hall\\" after his German Consul friend Arthur Kirsten) on 8, Balbina Street in Yaba. Macaulay was nicknamed \\"Wizard of Kirsten Hall\\" because of his ability to obtain classified information. Macaulay ran a network of informants who he paid handsomely. Many times, minutes from colonial government meetings would be leaked in newspapers that Macaulay was associated with. Whole sections of colonial government files and telegrams can be found in the Macaulay Papers at the Africana section of the Library at the University of Ibadan.  Opposition to British rule in colonial Nigeria  Prior to the beginning of the twentieth century, Macaulay associated with many Lagos socialites, worked as a private surveyor and had a moderate outlook about colonialism. However, by the end of the 1900s, he had begun to veer from his professional and social activities to become a political activist. He joined the Anti-Slavery and Aborigines' Protection Society. Macaulay was an unlikely champion of the masses. A grandson of Ajayi Crowther, the first African bishop of the Niger Territory, he was born into a Lagos that was divided politically into groups arranged in a convenient pecking order ‚Äì the British rulers who lived in the posh Marina district, the Saros and other slave descendants who lived to the west, and the Brazilians who lived behind the whites in the Portuguese Town. Behind all three lived the real Lagosians, the masses of indigenous Yoruba people, disliked and generally ignored by their privileged neighbours. It was not until Macaulay's generation that the Saros and Brazilians even began to contemplate making common cause with the masses. Macaulay was one of the first Nigerian nationalists and for most of his life a strong opponent of many colonial policies. As a reaction to claims by the British that they were governing with \\"the true interests of the natives at heart\\", he wrote: \\"The dimensions of \\"the true interests of the natives at heart\\" are algebraically equal to the length, breadth and depth of the whiteman's pocket.\\" In 1908 he exposed European corruption in the handling of railway finances and in 1919 he argued successfully for the chiefs whose land had been taken by the British in front of the Privy Council in London. As a result, the colonial government was forced to pay compensation to the chiefs. In 1909, he came out publicly against the prohibition of spirits into Nigeria which he felt will ultimately lead to reduced government revenues and thereafter increased taxation. Macaulay also found himself in opposition to the colonial government in three major issues that were prominent in Lagos life during 1900‚Äì1930. The issues included the proposed water rate, selection of the Oba of Lagos and the Imamate of the Lagos Central Mosque. Macaulay opposed colonial taxation to fund water supply in Lagos on the grounds of taxation without representation. He was a major supporter of the House of Docemo in Lagos. Largely because Lagos was not under indirect rule, the Oba of Lagos unlike many of its counterparts in other areas of the country was stripped of many of his traditional authorities. Macaulay supported the House of Docemo in its opposition to the water rate and colonial acquisition of Lagos lands. He also galvanized the Ilu Committee composed of the Oba of Lagos and traditional chiefs in Lagos to oppose some of the colonial policies. Macaulay's profile in Lagos was enhanced by the Oluwa Land case. Amodu Tijani Oluwa, a traditional chief, had challenged the compulsory acquisition without compensation of his family land in Apapa. He lost his appeal at the Supreme Court and took the case to the Privy Court Council in London. Macaulay was Oluwa's private secretary in the trip to London. Oluwa's case was supported by the Ilu Committee and the Oba who were interested in the protection of their family lands in Lagos. In London, Macaulay presented himself as Oluwa's private secretary and as a representative of the Oba and in the capacity he made statements which the colonial authorities felt were inimical to their interest. In 1920, the Eleko, Eshungbayi was ostracized by the British because he refused to disavow allegations against the colonial authorities made by Macaulay in London. To further his political activities, Macaulay co-founded the Nigerian Daily News, a platform he used to write opinion pieces such as Justitia Fiat: The Moral Obligation of the British Government to the House of Docemo. He also wrote a piece titled Henry Carr Must Go. From 1923 to 1938, he became a prominent figure in many important political issues in Lagos including the elections into the quinquennial elections into the Legislative Council, triennial elections to the Lagos Town Council, and the headship of the House of Docemo. In his political activities, he relied on the Lagos Daily News, the Lagos Market Women Association led by his ally, Alimotu Pelewura, the House of Docemo and many uneducated Lagosians. His political opinions divided many Lagos elites as he used the Daily News to publicly vilify his opponents and former friends such as Henry Carr, Macaulay became known and on 24 June 1923 he founded the Nigerian National Democratic Party (NNDP), the first Nigerian political party. The party won all the seats in the elections of 1923, 1928 and 1933.Though, the party's major function was to put candidates into the legislative council, it had a broader objective of promoting democracy in Nigeria, increasing higher Nigerian participation in the social, economic and educational development of Nigeria. Though, the party wanted to be national in outlook, Macaulay's strength of support was from the House of Docemo and therefore his preoccupation with the defense of the House of Docemo and his desire to control the party limited the growth of the party.  Support for British rule in colonial Nigeria  In 1931, relations between Macaulay and the British began to improve up to the point that the governor even held conferences with Macaulay. In October 1938 the more radical Nigerian Youth Movement fought and won elections for the Lagos Town Council, ending the dominance of Macaulay and his National Democratic Party. Legal problems Macaulay was barred from running for public office because of legal problems - he was convicted twice by the British Colonial Government in Lagos; the first time for fraud, and the second time for sedition. = Misappropriation of funds= After going into private practice as a surveyor and architect, Macaulay faced some financial difficulty and misappropriated funds from an estate he served as executor for. His actions were uncovered by the authorities who tried him and sentenced him to two years in prison. The historian Patrick Dele-Cole outlines evidence suggesting that Macaulay was unfairly persecuted at his 1913 trial. The prosecuting counsel, one Robert Irving, was Herbert Macaulay's tenant who may have pursued a private vendetta. Macaulay had obtained a court order to evict Robert Irving on 3 December 1912. Additionally, Macaulay's lawyers encountered severe difficulties putting up a solid defense in the course of the case: as an example Macaulay's lawyers were unable to find the police magistrate anywhere in Lagos to obtain bail. Other incidents include the acting Chief Justice fining Macaulay ¬£100 despite the five assessors in the court returning a not guilty verdict. Cole also underscores Macaulay's scrupulous transparency regarding the trust. According to Cole \\"the will of the testatrix was read in public at the request of Macaulay and the loan he obtained in order to clear the debts of the testatrix was explained to the beneficiaries of the will (Macaulay's niece was the principal beneficiary and she certainly did not engage Irving to prosecute the case), yet he was convicted of 'intent to defraud'\\". Finally, Cole notes that Macaulay's sentence of five years was \\"unusually severe\\". =Gunpowder Plot= Macaulay's second legal problem centered on what came to be the \\"Gunpowder Plot Case\\". When the Privy Council decided that the exiled Oba Eshugbayi Eleko could apply for a writ of habeas corpus from one judge to another, Lagos went wild with excitement because it indicated that the popular Oba would be reinstated. Macaulay's Lagos Daily News published a rumor that because of the Privy Council's decision, the British colonial government in Lagos planned to blow up Oba Eleko's vehicle. For the Gunpowder Plot Case Macualay was sentenced to six months in prison (at Broad Street Prison) with hard labor without the option for a fine. Macaulay was sixty-four years old at the time of this conviction and the imprisonment increased Macaulay's popularity within Nigeria. Feud with Henry Carr It is unclear how the fierce hatred between Macaulay and Henry Carr developed however their disputes are well documented. Carr believed that Macaulay lacked integrity and was exploiting the House of Dosunmu for personal gain. In Carr's diaries, he writes of Macaulay \\"Among all human monsters with whom we have been brought into contact none has displayed the devilish ingenuity of this man\\", concluding that Macaulay was a \\"crooked mind and dangerous fool\\". Carr abhorred the political reality that Macaulay, who was barred from partaking in politics because of his criminal convictions, was a political kingmaker through Macaulay's control of the NNDP. The level of the strife between both men was so caustic that in 1924, Macaulay published a malicious account titled \\"Henry Carr Must Go\\". In the slanderous publication, Macaulay falsely asserted that Carr's father, Amuwo Carr deserted his wife to settle in Abeokuta as a polygamist. This was untrue considering Amuwo Carr died in Abeokuta of poor health and was nearly blind. Macaulay's vicious attacks on Carr in the press framed the Lagosian public's perception of Carr as shy, distant, and aloof. Macaulay, on the other hand, believed Carr was behind political divisions in Lagos. He believed Carr was responsible for the government's stubborn position on the Oba Eleko land case. In the pamphlet \\"Henry Carr Must Go\\", Macaulay writes of Carr \\"He has been without any possible doubt whatsoever, the Head Centre, the King Pin, the very mainspring of what his own flatterers choose to call powerful influence or official support behind the renowned articulate minority on whose side Mr. Carr has along flung the whole weight of his official prestige, manifesting thereby an intolerable partisanship...deadly and detestable\\".  Twilight years and death  In 1944, Macaulay co-founded the National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons (NCNC) together with Nnamdi Azikiwe and became its president. The NCNC was a patriotic organization designed to bring together Nigerians of all stripes to demand independence. In 1946, Macaulay fell ill in Kano and later died in Lagos. Macaulay's reported last words were: > \\"Tell the National Council delegates to halt wherever they are for four days > for Macualay and then carry on. > Tell Oged to keep the flag flying\\" The leadership of the NCNC went to Azikiwe, who later became the first president of Nigeria. Macaulay was buried at Ikoyi Cemetery in Lagos on 11 May 1946. Nnamdi Azikiwe delivered a funeral oration at Macaulay's burial ceremony and Isaac Babalola Thomas, editor and proprietor of the Akede Eko was executor of Macaulay's Last Will & Testament. Macaulay papers at the University of Ibadan Library Like his political foe Henry Rawlingson Carr whose library and papers are at the University of Ibadan Library, Macaulay's private collection called The Macaulay Papers are at the African Section of the University of Ibadan Library. The Macaulay Papers include a vast assortment of political pamphlets, newspapers, and government documents. They also include personal papers, correspondences, diaries, and photographs.

Its capital is Mongomo. It borders the Equatoguinean provinces of Centro Sur to the west and Ki√©-Ntem to the north, with Gabon's Woleu-Ntem Province to the east and south. As of 2015, the population of Wele- Nzas was 192,017. History The earliest settlers of Wele-Nzas, and the only inhabitants of the region for nearly 15,000 years, were the Byele people. Bantu migration ultimately displaced the Byele, and during the 20th century the last of the Byele migrated to Cameroon. The Fang people ultimately became the predominant ethnic group in the province. As European explorers mostly avoided the interior of Equatorial Guinea, there are few accounts of the region in early European histories; even the Spanish governors of the region did not visit Wele-Nzas until the official formation of Spanish Guinea in 1926. Wele-Nzas has played an important role in post-independence Equatoguinean history as the home province of both of the country's presidents, Francisco Mac√≠as Nguema and Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo. From 1975 until the 1979 Equatorial Guinea coup d'√©tat, Mac√≠as led his totalitarian rule of the nation from his hometown of Nsangayong on the border with Gabon. Obiang has initiated several major infrastructure projects in the province, including a new airport and conference center in Mongomo. Oyala, the planned future capital city of Equatorial Guinea, is also being built in Wele-Nzas. Geography Mongomo is the largest city in the province; other major cities include Aconibe, A√±isoc, and Nsok. A major highway links Mongomo to the port city of Bata, and a border crossing near the city connects it to the Gabonese city of Oyem. The city of Mengomey√©n is home to the province's main airport, President Obiang Nguema International Airport. Two national parks, Altos de Nsork National Park and Monte Temel√≥n Natural Reserve, are located within the province.

His theatre plays include Soft Shoe Shuffle (1985) and Shooting Stars and Other Heavenly Pursuits (2000), which was adapted for BBC radio. Other radio plays include King Trash (2004). His first novel, Watching The Wheels Come Off, was published first in French by Rivagse/Noir (Quand Tout Se Fait La Malle) in 2009 then in English in 2010. In 2018 his trio of novellas ('Bait', 'Grist' & 'Security') was published by Unbound. Retrospectives of his work in television and cinema: NFT (London) 1980; MOMA (New York) 1990; American Cinematheque (LA) 1990; Munich (Germany)1999. Another retrospective at the NFT (London) is planned for May, 2020. He was awarded the degree of 'Doctor of Letters\\" by the University of the West of England Bristol in 2005.  Life and work  After qualifying as a chartered accountant and serving out his two years' National Service on the lower deck of a Royal Navy minesweeper, Hodges got a job in British television as a teleprompter operator. This allowed him to observe the workings of the studios, and gave him time to start writing scripts. One of these was Some Will Cry Murder, written for ABC‚Äôs Armchair Theatre series. Although never performed, it served to get him enough writing commissions to quit his job as a technician. After that, he quickly progressed to producer/director status, with series such as Sunday Break for ABC Television, World in Action for Granada Television and the arts programmes Tempo and New Tempo for Thames Television. He wrote, directed and produced two filmed thrillers, Suspect (1969) and Rumour (1970), again for Thames Television. These films formed the basis for the creation of Euston Films, the influential television production company that continued into the 1980s. These two films also led to Hodges being asked to write and direct Get Carter (1971), which has been described as \\"one of the great British gangster films of all time.\\" Hodges worked with Carter star Michael Caine again in Pulp (1972), before proceeding to make films such as the Michael Crichton adaptation The Terminal Man (1974) and the space opera Flash Gordon (1980). Some of Hodges later films include A Prayer for the Dying (1987), Croupier (1998) and I'll Sleep When I'm Dead (2003). Interspersed with his cinema work are some interesting and critically successful television films, including The Manipulators (1973), Squaring The Circle (1984; scripted by Tom Stoppard), Dandelion Dead (1993; scripted by Michael Chaplin), and The Healer (1994; scripted by G.

The word is said to have been coined when Prime Minister of Finland Ahti Karjalainen visited a Kenyan zoo in the 1970s.

Accessed on 15 January 2013. This was so popular that one Finnish magazine held a drawing competition of what the tankero would look like. The Finnish political cartoonist Kari Suomalainen drew a strip where Kalevi Sorsa meets Karjalainen and a strange-looking animal he is carrying on a leash. \\"Is that a tankero?\\" asks Sorsa, and the strange-looking animal replies \\"No, that's Ahti.\\" During the same period a certain number of jokes, based on English‚ÄìFinnish language misunderstandings, were current: for example a person mistakenly greeting a Crimean by calling him criminal. These jokes were labelled as \\"tankero jokes\\" and generally told with Ahti Karjalainen as the main character. The original meaning fell into disuse after Karjalainen's death, and today it is a slang word for something that is awkward or not properly developed, especially poor knowledge of the pronunciation or grammar of a foreign language. The most common use of the word tankero today is \\"tankero-englanti\\" or \\"tankero English\\", meaning poorly pronounced English.

It is located on the Joondalup line, 19 kilometres from Perth station serving the suburb of Padbury. History =Design and construction= At the time of the station's design, it was recognised by The Urban Rail Electrification Committee that the placement of bus services in close proximity or direct connection to rail infrastructure was of significant importance. This was evidenced by the Kelmscott and Armadale stations, and the then recently completed Cannington station. pages 2, 20 Accessed at J S Battye Library, Perth Under the Northern Suburbs Transit System Project, construction on the station was scheduled to commence on 16 November 1991, with completion expected by the end of December 1992. Warwick station being of a similar design was scheduled for construction in synchronisation with Whitfords station. The station was to include a number of facilities, including a bus concourse to connect with feeder bus services, information booths and offices for railway staff, amenities and services, as well as access services for mobility impaired passengers in line with design requirements of the time. Further to this, pieces of the Passenger Information Network installed at the station included previously unseen electronic displays on the upper bus decks designed to provide drivers with information so they could connect with appointed trains or communicate with bus depot control in the event of delays. North of the station a headshunt was laid for terminating trains. Even though the siding is in the middle of the Mitchell Freeway with no pedestrian access, Transperth was forced to fence the area in 2006 due to repeated graffiti attacks while trains were briefly in the siding.History of Stations on the Clarkson Train Line Right Track Car parking spaces were also included as part of the construction project, which included a significant number of on-grade parking bays on the eastern side of the station for commuter use. The design of the station also allowed for the possible extension of the upper bus deck in a northern direction towards Whitfords Avenue. This extension would provide for five additional regular bus bays, as well as additional pedestrian access if required.Accessed at Battye Library, Perth The most interesting part of the station was the upper bus deck. The deck was constructed of precast concrete that was formed off site, which was then transported to the site before being placed atop columns constructed as part of the stations foundations. Precast concrete flooring was then put in place, held in specially formed ridges running the length of the beams. This upper deck was the most expensive structural element of the station, and was the cause of significant attention and consideration as part of the design and construction process.

True to his reputation, Tony G launched many verbal assaults against his opponents, most notably when he eliminated Russian Ralph Perry in fourth place. Tony G started to provoke Perry when he was deciding how to play his hand before the flop. When Perry called Tony G's all-in with a worse hand, Tony G proceeded to ridicule and lecture him. Tony's comments were so scathing that it prompted commentator Gabe Kaplan to quip \\"I think Tony G is speaking more like a Lithuanian than an Australian\\" and \\"Tony G could singlehandedly reignite the Cold War\\". Guoga was more respectful of some other players, such as Doyle Brunson, calling Doyle his idol after eliminating him.

Alternative common names are weevil moth, pantry moth, flour moth or grain moth. The almond moth (Cadra cautella) and the raisin moth (Cadra figulilella) are commonly confused with the Indian-meal moth due to similar food sources and appearance. The species was named after being noted for feeding on Indian-meal or cornmeal and it does not occur natively in India as the aberrant usage of Indian meal moth would suggest. It is also not to be confused with the Mediterranean flour moth (Ephestia kuehniella), another common pest of stored grains. P. interpunctella larvae (caterpillars) are commonly known as waxworms. It is important to note that they are not the same species as the waxworms often bred as animal feed. Rather, they are a common grain-feeding pest found around the world, consuming cereals, fruits, and similar products. Substantial efforts have been taken in the United States to control the moth's damage to grain crops. The larvae of this species have the ability to bite through plastic and cardboard so even sealed containers may be infested. Once found, the moths are difficult to eradicate. The last instar larvae is also able to travel long distances before pupating; so an infestation site may be located far from the nearest pupation site. In addition to food sources, this species can reproduce and pupate on clothing and any source of clothing must be inspected to prevent reinfestation. Pantry moth life cycle, reproducing in a single cotton T-shirt inside a drawer  Distribution and habitat  Plodia interpunctella is found on every continent in tropical habitats, excluding Antarctica. Within the United States, the moth is most commonly found in Florida, where it thrives in the tropical habitat. The moth lives in a wide range of conditions, making it a persistent pest. It is often found at food storage facilities worldwide, specifically in grain bins or grain storage buildings.  Taxonomy and etymology  The Indian-meal moth is the only known living species of the genus Plodia. It is closely related to the genera Cadra and Ephestia, which include other pest species like E. kuehniella, also known as the \\"flour moth\\".References in Savela, Markku (2009): Markku Savela's Lepidoptera and Some Other Life Forms ‚Äì Plodia. Version of 9 April 2010. Retrieved 10 April 2010. The species has been described under a number of junior synonyms, which may occasionally still be found in non-entomological sources. * Ephestia glycinivora Matsumura, 1917 * Ephestia glycinivorella Matsumura, 1932 (unjustified emendation) * Plodia castaneella (Reutti, 1898) * Plodia glycinivora (Matsumura, 1917) * Plodia interpunctalis (H√ºbner, 1825) * Plodia latercula (Hampson, 1901) * Plodia zeae (Fitch, 1856) * Tinea castaneella Reutti, 1898 * Tinea interpunctalis H√ºbner, 1825 * Tinea interpunctella H√ºbner, [1813] * Tinea zeae Fitch, 1856 * Unadilla latercula Hampson, 1901 The common name, \\"Indian-meal moth\\", for this species was coined by Asa Fitch, an entomologist employed by the state of New York in the 19th century. In a report published in 1856, Fitch discussed the species, noting that the larvae had been observed to infest stores of cornmeal, which at the time was referred to as \\"Indian meal\\".Fitch, Asa (1856) First and Second Report on the Noxious, Beneficial and other Insects of the State of New York. C. Van Benthuysen, Albany, USA.  Description  Adults are 8‚Äì10 mm in length with 16‚Äì20 mm wingspans. The distal two thirds of their forewings are generally reddish brown in color with a copper luster. They can also be bronze or dark gray. The more proximal parts of the wings are yellow-gray or white- gray, with a dark band at the intersection between the proximal and distal regions. The hindwings, in general, are uniformly gray. The eggs of the Indian-meal moth are white, ovate, and very small. It is difficult to see them with the naked eye. Newly-hatched larvae are equally difficult to see. They are mostly off-white in color, have brown heads, and develop through five to seven larval instars. When these larvae mature, they measure about 12‚Äì14 mm long. Larvae also have three sets of legs near the head and five sets of prolegs protruding from the abdomen. The legs help the larvae move over long distances in order to find pupation sites. Food resources Indian-meal moths feed on plants, grains, and other human food products. = Plant-based foods = Moths feed on many plant-based foods including dry pet food (plant based), birdseed, cereal, soup mixes, bread, pasta, rice, flour, spices, dried fruits and nuts. There is strong evidence that the northern Manitoba wheat supports the development of the moth. Other optimal diets include sultanas, American yellow corn and almonds. Groundnuts and maize meal, on the other hand, result in a longer development time for the moths. = Non-plant foods = Indian-meal moths are also known to cannibalize larvae but this often leads to viral granulosis infections spreading through an Indian-meal moth population. Healthy larvae are picked more often than unhealthy larvae for cannibalism. Typically, cannibals do not eat closely related individuals which might share genes with them, but when given the choice between siblings and unrelated individuals, caterpillars tend to cannibalize their siblings. = Foraging flights = Though Indian-meal moths generally do not migrate over long distances, they do engage in long-distance foraging flights. These flights take place during the twilight hours during which blue light (400‚Äì475 nm) rather than UV light (10‚Äì400 nm) is dominant and attracts the moths. Blue light's role in the Indian-meal moth foraging behavior has recently been harnessed as a form of pest control since it is attractive to the moth.  Life history  = Eggs = Usually the life cycle of an Indian-meal moth colony starts in a location where grain is present. The temperature within a grain bin must exceed . The eggs of the moth are grayish white and have a length between 0.3 and 0.5 mm. Eggs can be laid directly on the food source singly or in groups of between 12 and 30. A mature female may lay between 100 and 300 eggs at a time. = Larvae = Larvae begin to hatch in approximately two to fourteen days. The larvae have between five and seven instars. Newly hatched larvae feed on grain while more mature larvae feed on grain germ. The larvae are an off-white color, but can be pink, brown, or greenish are about 12 mm long and have prolegs for movement. Fully-grown larvae are able to spin webs and leave silk threads in their path of travel. Mature larvae that make silk also make threaded cocoons. = Adults = The pupae are often seen on grain surfaces and on the walls of grain bins. The adults emerge in four to ten days. They then mate and the cycle begins again. The entire life cycle of this species ranges between 30 to 300 days. A typical life cycle is 50 days. Under optimal conditions a life cycle can be as short as 28 days but cooler winter months prohibit this. Seven to nine generations of moths can live in a year.Lyon, William F. (2006): Ohio State University Insect and Pest Fact Sheets ‚Äì HYG-2089-97: Indianmeal Moth. Version of 31 August 2006. = Diapause = Diapause is defined as a delay in animal development due to certain external factors and can end once the adverse environmental conditions wear off. The duration of diapause can vary in Indian-meal moths. Diapause is especially prevalent late in the breeding season. During the egg stage, if the temperature of the moth's environment exceeds , it can cause a delay in hatching. In the moth's early larval stage, temperatures of below can cause a similar diapause. Different strains of P. interpunctella have differing tendencies to enter diapause.

A biological control involves the use of other organisms to control pests. The gut enzymes released by this parasite into the Indian-meal moth larvae denature blood proteins and digest it. This, along with the larvae eating the moth, leads to its death.\\"Biological Control of Stored-Product Pests\\" Midwest Biological Control News (University of Wisconsin) = Diseases = * Baculoviruses are double-stranded DNA viruses commonly used as biological control agents for the Indian-meal moth and are considered parasites. They come from a family of viruses that are limited to insects as hosts. Baculovirus isolates have been often isolated from other Lepidoptera. At sub-lethal dosages, baculoviruses decrease reproductive capacity in terms of egg viability and production. = Immunity = Indian- meal moths are developing a resistance to many kinds of biological agents, such as the granulosis virus. Use of pest control agents can cause resistance to these agents to be selected for in populations of Indian-meal moths. In populations exposed to the granulosis virus, it was found that the moths were 96 times more resistant to the virus. This led to the prohibition of many such biological agents. Regulations prevent the use of many pesticides near food sources so these pests are highly suitable for control with natural predators. Mating = Male-male interactions =  Sperm competition  Females mate multiple times, so sperm competition could be an important aspect of male-male competition for being reproductively successful. Males have a limited number of sperm and allocate it depending on various factors. Male Indian-meal moths ejaculate a greater amount of sperm to females that have mated multiple times previously. This is to ensure a greater chance of success in sperm competition in the females' storage organs. Males also ejaculate more sperm when mating with a younger female.  Food and pupation site competition  The most common type of competition in Indian-meal moths is due to a lack of food. This competition can change the timing of male and female emergence, reducing the chance of early males finding females to mate with, which could encourage emigration. This is considered a form of male-male competition because males that emerge at an appropriate time are more likely to be reproductively successful with the surrounding females. Males are also involved in finding pupation sites. If the larvae do not find pupation sites in the food layer, they may wander long distances to find one. This competition to find a pupation site affects males more than it does females, it indirectly impacts females as well because it results in a delayed population of males to mate with. =Female-male interactions=  Female pheromones  In the Indian-meal moth, mating occurs a few days after the adult moth emerges from the silk cocoon. Mating rituals are largely limited to pheromones release by the female. There are four identified (via mass spectrometry techniques) primary pheromones in the female pheromone blend: (Z,E)-9,12-tetradecadienyl acetate, (Z,E)-9,12-tetradecadienal, (Z,E)-9,12-tetradecadienol, and (Z)-9-tetradecenyl acetate. These pheromones are attractants to male moths. Removing any one component of the blend reduces the activity of the pheromone and the number of males attracted. Other components of the pheromone blend are also known but their functions are unclear. It has been suggested the reason for having so many components to the pheromone is that it ensures species specificity. =Male pheromones= Male moths also release pheromones. After approaching the female from the back, the male releases a pheromone from wing glands located at the base of each forewing. These pheromones induce the female to remain stationary in the acceptance posture (raised abdomen between wings) which facilitates copulation. Copulation and multiple mating Indian-meal moths are known to mate multiple times. For males, it is vital to ensure paternity after copulation. To ensure this trait, males who mate with a female first (before any other males) will insert a large package of spermatophore, accessory gland fluids, and nutrients into the bursa copulatrix of the female during copulation. Other donations after the first mating are smaller in size. Even so, there is no change in postcopulatory behavior in females after this large donation (with respect to pheromone production and calling behavior).  Changes in fecundity  It has been observed in many insects that vital resources are tracked using odor plumes. For the Indian-meal moth these odors have other effects as well. The Indian-meal moth's fecundity and fertility was found to be enhanced in the presence of the odor of vital nutrients. This effect is thought to be genetic since it is not related to parental generations or previous experiences in the lifetime of the moth. Females also show a strong preference towards laying their eggs near the site of the odor. It was observed that without antennae, this effect is lost, suggesting that there are olfactory receptors in the antennae.  Interspecific courting  The Indian-meal moth often takes part in interspecific courtship especially with the almond moth (Cadra cautella). Successful mating between the species does not happen due to multiple isolation mechanisms. The main mechanism that has been identified is the male sex pheromone. This pheromone is a strong species recognition signal. It allows the almond moth to differentiate between members of its own species and members of the Indian- meal moth species. There are also mechanical barriers to insemination that render the species incompatible. Their courtship behaviors are also relatively incompatible. Thus, copulation rarely occurs. Even when courtship does continue to a later stage, the female of the other species rejects the male due to the wrong pheromone being released at the wrong time from scent scales. Even with these fail safes, some male almond moths are still excited by Indian-meal moth females. They may be able to successfully copulate, but insemination is not possible.  Pest status and pest control  Damage to sunflower seeds = Status = Indian-meal moth larvae can infest a wide range of dry foodstuffs of vegetable origin, such as cereal, bread, pasta, rice, couscous, flour, spices, dried fruits, and nuts. More unusual recorded foods include crushed red pepper, chocolate and cocoa beans, coffee substitute, cookies, dried mangelwurzel, and even the toxic seeds of jimsonweed (Datura stramonium). They have also been known to infest commercial pet food, such as cracked corn used for bird feed. They often leave webbing in the food they infest.Fasulo, Thomas R. & Knox, Marie A. (2009): University of Florida Featured Creatures ‚Äì Indianmeal moth, Plodia interpunctella H√ºbner. Version of December 2009.Grabe, Albert (1942): Eigenartige Geschmacksrichtungen bei Kleinschmetterlingsraupen [\\"Strange tastes among micromoth caterpillars\\"]. Zeitschrift des Wiener Entomologen-Vereins 27: 105‚Äì109 [in German]. PDF fulltext = Control = Hidden inside a single cotton T-shirt, pantry moths can pupate to adult form. After larvae or moths have been found, it is important to throw out all food sources not in very tightly sealed containers. Moth larvae can chew through plastic bags and thin cardboard, so even unopened packages may become infested. They are also notoriously difficult to get rid of, and can crawl on ceilings and spin cocoons in rooms other than where they hatched. Last instar larvae are able to travel significant distances before they pupate. When seeking the source of an infestation, the search thus cannot be limited to the immediate area where pupae are discovered. Pantry moths can use clothing (remaining hidden) to reproduce and pupate, so it is important to inspect any source of clothing material. None of the stages of the organism (eggs, larvae, adults) are temperature tolerant and can be killed by a week of freezing or by brief heating in a microwave or conventional oven when such treatment is practical. Scrubbing infested areas with a mixture of soap and water or vinegar is also effective. Nontoxic traps are available to monitor outbreaks. One type of trap is a triangular box with a pheromone lure and sticky walls inside. These traps are known as pheromone traps. Male moths are attracted by the female pheromone (the lure) and stick against the sticky walls inside the box.Klass, Carolyn (2009) Pesticide Management Education Program ‚Äì Indian Meal Moth. Version of February 2009. Moths often do not even need a lure, common glue traps sometimes work well to reduce the number of adults. The efficiency of such traps is highly doubtful as they only capture males, and usually only a fraction of them, while adult females, eggs and larvae are unaffected, enabling a possible reinfestation. Moths can be deterred from an area by using nontoxic pantry moth spray. It is most effective to treat the infestation by eliminating the source and any affected food items, interrupting their mating processes, and repelling them from the areas where dried food and grains are kept. It is recommended to first eliminate the source of infestation followed by larvae, eggs, and eventually moths.Cranshaw, Whitney (2011): Indian Meal Moth. Colorado State University Extension. Version 4/03. Reviewed 3/08. The caterpillars are parasitized by Habrobracon hebetor, a braconid wasp which is a potential biological control agent.Phillips, Tom (1995) Biological Control of Stored-Product Pests . Midwest Biological Control News Online 2(10). Additionally, blue to violet light can be very effective in drawing moths out, which suggests that the deployment of violet light could become another pest control tactic for these moths.

However, Mizuno has stated that she does not feel comfortable about those terms, as she doesn't want to label her work with words because it keeps changing and is influenced by many different genres. Mizuno has stated that her work is influenced by sh≈çjo manga works; this influence is exhibited through her use of bright colorization and the large eyes she provides for her characters.Mizuno, J: Cinderalla., pages 130-135. Viz Communications, 2002 Her art has a decidedly pop-art and psychedelic flair, and a sizable proportion of her published work is colored, rather than the black and white format typical of most Japanese comics. A part of Mizuno's oeuvre revolves around fairy tales, showing titles such as Cinderalla, Princess Mermaid and Hansel&Gretel.; The story behind this is that after the release of Pure Trance, Mizuno was approached by a Kinokuniya publisher who was interested in working with her because of her unique style. However, this publisher did not like the story of Pure Trance as it differed a lot from mainstream comics at the time. Because of this, he ask that she revise the original Cinderella tale in order to prove her story-telling skill and receive approval to write her own stories. Mizuno has stated that as she was just starting out her career as a professional artist, she decided to take the opportunity, and that while in hindsight she was not very comfortable with the situation, it was a good experience for her. Mizuno has participated in the Angoul√™me International Comics Festival and The Lakes International Comic Art Festival. In 2007 Mizuno's work was on display at the Merry Karnowsky Gallery in Los Angeles, in an exhibit titled Heart Throb and at Gallery Nucleus in Alhambra, California in an exhibit titled Tender Succubus. In 2014, Mizuno held an exhibition of her work titled Belle: the Art of Junko Mizuno at the Atomica Gallery in London. Merchandise In addition to her comics, Mizuno designs T-shirts, calendars, postcards, and other collectibles. Some of her designs were used in the documentary series Japanorama, which aired on BBC. Mizuno also provides the art that accompanies the horoscopes in Shojo Beat magazine. Last Gasp and Viz Comics are the English-language publishers of her work. A handful of objects have been produced from Junko Mizuno's designs.

ISA Server 2000 required Windows 2000 (any edition), and will also run on Windows Server 2003. In accordance with Microsoft's Support Lifecycle Policy, ISA Server 2000 was the first ISA Server product to use the 10-year support lifecycle with 5 years of Mainstream support and five years of Extended support. ISA Server 2000 reached End of Life on 12 April 2011. =ISA Server 2004= Microsoft Internet Security and Acceleration Server 2004 (ISA Server 2004) was released on 8 September 2004. ISA Server 2004 introduced multi-networking support, integrated virtual private networking configuration, extensible user and authentication models, application layer firewall support, Active Directory integration, SecureNAT, and improved reporting and management features. The rules based configuration was also considerably simplified over ISA Server 2000 version. ISA Server 2004 Enterprise Edition included array support, integrated Network Load Balancing (NLB), and Cache Array Routing Protocol (CARP). One of the core capabilities of ISA Server 2004, dubbed Secure Server Publishing, was its ability to securely expose their internal servers to Internet. For example, some organizations use ISA Server 2004 to publish their Microsoft Exchange Server services such as Outlook Web Access (OWA), Outlook Mobile Access (OMA) or ActiveSync. Using the Forms-based Authentication (FBA) authentication type, ISA Server can be used to pre- authenticate web clients so that traffic from unauthenticated clients to published servers is not allowed. ISA Server 2004 is available in two editions, Standard and Enterprise. Enterprise Edition contains features enabling policies to be configured on an array level, rather than on individual ISA Servers, and load-balancing across multiple ISA Servers. Each edition of ISA Server is licensed per processor. (The version included in Windows Small Business Server 2000/2003 Premium includes licensing for 2 processors.) ISA Server 2004 runs on Windows Server 2003 Standard or Enterprise Edition. Appliance hardware containing Windows Server 2003 Appliance Edition and ISA Server Standard Edition is available from a variety of Microsoft Partners. =ISA Server 2006= Microsoft Internet Security and Acceleration Server 2006 (ISA Server 2006) was released on 17 October 2006. It is an updated version of ISA Server 2004, and retains all features from ISA Server 2004 except Message Screener. ISA Server 2006 introduced new features including: * Support for Exchange Server 2007 (referred to as \\"Exchange 12\\" in the Microsoft ISA Server 2006 Evaluation Guide) * New configuration wizards for various tasks such as setting up a \\"site-to-site VPN connection\\", publishing SharePoint services, publishing websites, creating firewall rules. * Introduction of single sign-on for groups of published web sites. * Improvements to user authentication including the addition of LDAP Authentication support * Resistance to flood attacks, to protect the ISA server from being \\"unavailable, compromised, or unmanageable during a flooding attack.\\" * Performance features such as BITS Caching, Web Publishing Load Balancing and HTTP compression. ISA Server Appliance Edition Microsoft also offered ISA Server 2006 Appliance Edition. It was designed to be pre-installed onto OEM hardware (server appliances) that are sold by hardware manufacturers as a stand-alone firewall type device. Along with Appliance Edition, ISA server 2006 Standard Edition and Enterprise Edition were available in preconfigured hardware. =Microsoft Forefront TMG MBE= Microsoft Forefront Threat Management Gateway Medium Business Edition (Forefront TMG MBE) is the next version of ISA Server which is also included with Windows Essential Business Server. This version only runs on the 64-bit edition of Windows Server 2008 and does not support Enterprise edition features such as array support or Enterprise policy.

It is a dramatic work written for a large orchestra, a full choir, a boys' choir, a soprano soloist and a narrator. \\"Kaddish\\" refers to the Jewish prayer that is chanted at every synagogue service for the dead but never mentions \\"death.\\" The symphony is dedicated to the memory of John F. Kennedy who was assassinated on November 22, 1963, just weeks before the first performance of the symphony. Leonard Bernstein wrote the text of the narration himself, but struggled with his own motivation for the aggressiveness of the text. In 2003, after talks with Bernstein shortly before his death, Holocaust survivor Samuel Pisar added a new narration about his personal experiences and how his family suffered and perished in the Holocaust, and his subsequent struggle with his belief. The Bernstein estate allowed this version to be used only with Samuel Pisar as recitator before his 2015 death. Instrumentation The revised version is scored for: * speaker * soprano solo * mixed choir (SATB) * boys' choir * orchestra:Instrumentation, Boosey & Hawkes ** 4 flutes (3rd doubling alto flute, 4th doubling piccolo), 2 oboes, cor anglais, alto saxophone, clarinet in E-flat, 2 clarinets in B-flat and A, bass clarinet in B-flat, 2 bassoons, contrabassoon ** 4 horns, trumpet in D, 3 trumpets in C , 3 trombones, tuba ** 5 timpani, 4 percussionists playing: vibraphone, xylophone, glockenspiel, 3 side drums (snare drum, field drum, tenor drum), bass drum, Israeli hand drum, 2 suspended cymbals, 1 pair crash cymbals, finger cymbals, antique cymbals (E, G, B, C), tamtam, 3 bongos, 3 temple blocks, wood block, sandpaper blocks, rasp, whip, ratchet, triangle, maracas, claves, tambourine, chimes ** harp, piano, celesta ** strings consisting of first and second violins, violas, cellos, and double basses. Structure =I : Invocation ‚Äì Kaddish 1= The text begins with a narrator addressing \\"My Father\\" (i.e., God). He/she states that he/she wants to pray a kaddish. After the initial approach to the Father in prayer, a chorus sings his kaddish in Aramaic. At the end, the narrator repeats the final words of the prayer: Amen! Amen! Did You hear that, Father? Sh‚Äôlama raba! May abundant peace Descend on us. Amen. The speaker then questions why He would allow such disorder in mankind's lives, suggesting that surely He must have the power to change it. =II : Din-Torah ‚Äì Kaddish 2= The prayer escalates into a confrontation with the Father (who never replies in the symphony), and in a \\"certain respectful fury\\", accusing him of violating his promise with mankind. One of the more poignant texts from the symphony comes from this movement: Are You listening, Father? You know who I am: Your image; that stubborn reflection of You That Man has shattered, extinguished, banished. And now he runs free‚Äîfree to play With his new-found fire, avid for death, Voluptuous, complete and final death. Lord God of Hosts, I call You to account! You let this happen, Lord of Hosts! You with Your manna, Your pillar of fire! You ask for faith, where is Your own? Why have You taken away Your rainbow, That pretty bow You tied round Your finger To remind You never to forget Your promise? \\"For lo, I do set my bow in the cloud ... And I will look upon it, that I May remember my everlasting covenant ...\\" Your covenant! Your bargain with Man! Tin God! Your bargain is tin! It crumples in my hand! And where is faith now‚ÄîYours or mine? The speaker calms down, speaks softly and suggests that he comfort God. A soprano solo conveys a lullaby, intended to help the speaker rock God gently to sleep, after which the speaker will help God dream. =III : Scherzo ‚Äì Kaddish 3 ‚Äì Finale. Fugue-Tutti= The scherzo is a fast- tempo dream sequence. God has fallen asleep and the narrator paints a dream. God is no longer in control and the narrator has full power to bring God on this journey through his own imagination. The speaker begins by painting what God has made: This is Your Kingdom of Heaven, Father, Just as You planned it. Every immortal clich√© intact. Lambs frisk. Wheat ripples. Sunbeams dance. Something is wrong. The light: flat. The air: sterile. Do You know what is wrong? There is nothing to dream. Nowhere to go. Nothing to know. The narrator then proceeds to show God that he is in control of this dream. Now behold my Kingdom of Earth! Real-life marvels! Genuine wonders! Dazzling miracles! ... Look, a Burning Bush Look, a Fiery Wheel! A Ram! A Rock! Shall I smite it? There! It gushes! It gushes! And I did it! I am creating this dream! Now will You believe? A burning bush and gushing rock refer to some of the miracles described in the Book of Exodus. The narrator next places a rainbow in the sky, in parallel to the story of Noah, when God placed a rainbow in the sky to institute a new covenant with man. In loud triumph and anger, the speaker declares: Look at it, Father: Believe! Believe! Look at my rainbow and say after me: MAGNIFIED ... AND SANCTIFIED ... BE THE GREAT NAME OF MAN! After showing God the problems in the world, he helps God believe in the new arrangement. The music builds to an amazing climax, crowned with the entrance of a boy's choir singing the phrase \\"Magnified and sanctified be His great name, Amen\\" in Hebrew. The pace of the music slows down, as the narrator has finished his dream. He wakes God and God then confronts the reality of the image. The narrator, satisfied that God has seen His errors, beams: Good morning, Father. We can still be immortal, You and I, bound by our rainbow. That is our covenant, and to honor it Is our honor ... not quite the covenant We bargained for, so long ago. The narration ends with a commitment from both sides, God and Human, to \\"Suffer and recreate each other.\\" Though there is a resolution to the struggle, the music does not end triumphant and grand. Instead, it ends in a final kaddish by the choir and the final chord is dissonant, suggesting that all is still not right and more work must be done. Performance The symphony was first performed in Tel Aviv, Israel, on December 10, 1963, with Bernstein conducting the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra, Jennie Tourel (mezzo-soprano), Hanna Rovina (narrator) and the choruses under Abraham Kaplan. In this original version of the Kaddish Symphony, Bernstein specified that the narrator be female. The work was generally received with great enthusiasm in Israel. The American premiere of the work took place soon afterwards on January 10, 1964, in Boston with Charles M√ºnch conducting the Boston Symphony Orchestra, the New England Conservatory Chorus and the Columbus Boychoir, again with Tourel (mezzo), but now with Bernstein's wife, Felicia Montealegre as narrator. The American reactions to the work were decidedly mixed, ranging from highly favorable to vitriolic. In 1977 Bernstein revised the symphony, saying: \\"I was not satisfied with the original (version). There was too much talk. The piece is ... (now) tighter and shorter.\\" With the revision, Bernstein no longer specified the gender of the narrator, and recordings featuring both male and female narrators have been made. In the first recording below (which is of the original version for female narrator), the narrator was Bernstein's wife, Felicia Montealegre, whereas in the second and third recordings below (which were of the revised work), the narrators were men, Michael Wager and Willard White. The Kaddish Symphony was often narrated by Samuel Pisar until his death in 2015; he wrote a new text for it describing his experience with the Holocaust, when all of his family suffered, and most perished. Pisar wrote this version of the text for the Kaddish Symphony \\"in memory of Leonard Bernstein, a beloved friend.\\" The first performance in France took place in 1994, and was carried out by the Formation Symphonique of the Ch≈ìur et Orchestre des Grandes √âcoles with Mari Kobayashi as soloist and Michael Lonsdale as the narrator. In November 2017, Kaddish was performed in three concerts by the New York Philharmonic to commemorate Bernstein's 100th birthday at David Geffen Hall, with Tamara Wilson (soprano), Jeremy Irons (narrator), and Leonard Slatkin conducting.\\"Quixote rallies and Kaddish bristles at Philharmonic's Bernstein Festival\\" by George Grella, New York Classical Review, November 10, 2017 Recordings * Recording of the US premiere (first version) with Charles Munch conducting the Boston Symphony Orchestra, the New England Conservatory Chorus and the Columbus Boychoir with Jennie Tourel (mezzo-soprano) and Felicia Montealegre (narrator) (Kipepeo) recorded in 1964 and released in 2017 * Premiere studio recording (first version) with Bernstein conducting the New York Philharmonic, Columbus Boychoir and Camerata Singers with Jennie Tourel (mezzo-soprano) and Felicia Montealegre (narrator) (Columbia Masterworks, Stereo KS 6605) * Premiere recording (revised version), with Bernstein conducting the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra and Vienna Boys' Choir with Montserrat Caball√© (soprano) and Michael Wager (narrator) (Deutsche Grammophon 463462) * Gerard Schwarz conducting the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra, Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Choir, Liverpool Cathedral Choir and Liverpool Philharmonic Youth Choir with Yvonne Kenny (soprano) and Willard White (narrator) (Naxos 8559456) * Yutaka Sado conducting the French Radio Orchestra and Chorus with Karita Mattila (soprano) and Yehudi Menuhin (narrator) (Erato2564 69655-6) recorded in 1999 and released in 2008. * Leonard Slatkin conducting the BBC Symphony Orchestra and Chorus, the BBC Singers, London Oratory School Schola, with Ann Murray (soprano) and Jamie Bernstein (narrator) (Chandos CHSA 5028) References Category:Compositions by Leonard Bernstein Category:Jewish music Bernstein 3 Bernstein 3 Category:Compositions with a narrator Category:1963 compositions ","title":"Symphony No. 3 (Bernstein)"},{"id":"2369212","text":"Kellyanne Farquhar is a Scottish television actress.

West Ryde is located 16 kilometres north-west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the City of Ryde and is part of the Northern Sydney region. Ryde, North Ryde and East Ryde are separate suburbs. The suburbs of Denistone, Denistone West, Meadowbank and Melrose Park share the 2114 postcode with West Ryde.http://www1.auspost.com.au/postcodes/index.asp?Locality=‚äÇ=1&State;=&Postcode;=2114&submit1;=Search Australia Post - Postcode Search History West Ryde is an extension of Ryde, which was named after the 'Ryde Store', a business run by G.M. Pope. He adopted the name from his birthplace of Ryde on the Isle of Wight, UK.The Book of Sydney Suburbs, Compiled by Frances Pollon, Angus & Robertson Publishers, 1990, Published in Australia , page 235 West Ryde is one of 16 suburbs that form the City of Ryde. The City of Ryde is approximately from the centre of Sydney and occupies most of the land between the Parramatta and Lane Cove rivers. It is bisected from west to east by one of Sydney's busiest roads, Victoria Road. It is crossed north to south by another main road, Lane Cove Road, and is skirted on the north-west by the M2 Hills Motorway and Epping Road. At the time of the arrival of Europeans at Sydney Cove in January 1788, the Wallumedegal or Wallumede were the traditional owners of the area and they called it Wallumetta. This clan formed part of a large Dharug language group. =Early landholders= Throughout much of the nineteenth century, most of the land in West Ryde, Eastwood and Denistone was consolidated in a handful of large estates owned by a few of the colonial elites, notably the Blaxland and the Darvall families. Much of the land in this suburb lying to the west of the main northern railway line was originally granted to Dr William Balmain in the mid to late 1790s. Balmain was one of the assistant surgeons on the First Fleet, having sailed on the Alexander. He worked as a magistrate in the colony and, due to the shortage of money at that time, was paid with the labour of convicts to work on his land. However, it is not known how much clearing and cultivation was done during those years. In 1801 Balmain and his family returned to England, where he died in 1803. His heirs were Jane and John Henderson, his children by a convict woman, Margaret Dawson (Henderson was his mother's maiden name). While they were in England, the land was rented by the explorer Gregory Blaxland, who owned nearby Brush Farm. In 1818 the Balmain lands were sold to an ex-convict John Bennett. His nephew William was his heir. Soon after he inherited the land, William married Susan Brown. Initially the couple lived in John's old house which was near the intersection of Bellevue and Bigland avenues, but in 1836 they mortgaged part of their land to build a new house in what is now Meadowbank Park, Meadowbank. Major Edward Darvall and his family arrived in the colony in January 1840. He was a retired English army officer with strong family connections to the British East India Company. His wife Emily came from a long line of wealthy London merchants. In May 1840, the Darvalls leased Deniston Farm and of land from a Dr Forster, for a period of 12 years. However, the property was again advertised to let in The Sydney Morning Herald on 8 March 1849. In 1855 William and Susan Bennett sold all their land north of Victoria Road to Major Darvall. The Darvall property stretched from Shaftsbury Road to Ryedale Road and from Rowe Street to Victoria Road, a total of . They built a two-storey house, Ryedale House, during the late 1850s, now the site of St Columb's Anglican Church. The house was constructed of sandstone blocks. Ryedale House was moved to Paterson (near Maitland), NSW. It is believed the Ryedale Estate was so named because of its closeness to Ryde and because Major Darvall came from the Yorkshire dales. The nearest the house were planted with orchards, mainly citrus trees. The Darvalls lived in this house for nearly 70 years ‚Äì Edward until his death in 1869, his widow Jane until 1899, their son Anthony until 1910 and Anthony's widow Kate until 1922. =The railway and subdivision= In the 1880s, with the building of the railway line from Homebush to Hornsby, some estates were subdivided along its route. Landowners like Mrs Darvall sold parcels of their estates to the colonial government and by 1883 construction was well advanced. The railway bridge across the Parramatta River was completed in August 1886 and was followed by the opening of a single line track from Strathfield to Hornsby on 17 September 1886. Ryde (now called West Ryde) was one of the seven stations of this line and one of only two that were built of brick. The new railway platforms at both West Ryde and Eastwood did not service commuters. They were for freight. By the end of the nineteenth century, some Darvall land had been sold, yet the bulk of the Ryedale Estate remained intact. Anthony Darvall started subdividing the land after his mother's death. The first subdivisions were between Clanalpine and Rowe streets (Eastwood) in the north and between Anthony Road and West Parade in the south-east. Eventually Ryedale House and a small parcel of land were sold to the Anglican Church in the 1930s. The house was used as a rectory until the early 1970s when it was bought by private individuals who removed it, stone by stone, and re-erected it on a rural property in the Hunter Region. All that remains at the original site (apart from the old and new churches) is a small group of buildings, one of which is two-storey, with a blank end wall. This was a brick extension added to Ryedale House around 1900, probably when Anthony William and his family took up residence. Other twentieth-century subdivisions proposed included the Ryde New Township Estate in the Falconer and Hermitage Road area in 1906. By 1909 Ryde Heights, which was located on the southern side of Blaxland Road between Benson Lane and Melville Street was advertised as 'the pick of the district ‚Äì 10 special residential sites for high class houses overlooking the windings of the Parramatta River'. The sixth and last subdivision of the Darvall Estate was the Outlook Estate, in the Denistone area. The 124 homes sites were advertised for private sale in 1929. The houses were built during the 1930s and 1940s. =Naming of West Ryde= Subdivision plans up to 1936 still advertised the railway station in West Ryde as Ryde Railway Station. This had been a source of contention for some time. Owing to the distance from Ryde village and the growth of this new settlement west of Ryde, the use of the term Ryde for the railway station soon became anomalous. In 1908 the Ermington-Rydalmere Council tried unsuccessfully to persuade Ryde aldermen that the name should be Ermington. West Ryde as a locality was gradually evolving. It was officially designated a postal area in October 1926. West Ryde Public School was called Meadowbank until 1930. In 1929 an attempt was made to change the name of the station to West Ryde. This request, reiterated from time to time, was finally granted in October 1945. West Ryde has a busy commercial centre based around Victoria Road and the railway station. The beginnings of a commercial centre here followed the opening of the railway in 1886 and the subdivision of the Meriam Hill Estate on the eastern side of the railway in 1888. The railway hotel was built on the corner of Victoria and Ryedale Roads in 1892 and a handful of shops established themselves nearby in the following decade. West Ryde's shopping centre was transformed in the 1950s, on the initiative of Bill Graf, a developer with an eye on the rapidly developing residential area just to the west. It was here that the Dundas Valley Estate was emerging as the largest Housing Commission project in Sydney. In a period of three years, more than 40 new shops were built, as well as six banks, two restaurants, a service station and a new post office. =Ryde Pumping Station= The Ryde Pumping Station is a significant piece of infrastructure located in West Ryde. The Sydney Water Board had taken over the water supply for Sydney from the City Council in 1888. Almost immediately, a temporary pumping station was established at North Sydney. It was dismantled in 1892 when supply became available from a new station built in West Ryde that same year. By 1908 the station had switched to steam turbines, a first for the Board and possibly for Australia. The present Ryde Pumping Station was built on adjacent land and opened in September 1921. The old station ceased operating in 1930, its remaining plant was auctioned and the pump house was used as a store. The building was demolished in 1961. The Ryde Pumping Station, now fully electrically operated, supplies water to many Northern Sydney suburbs. It is the largest water pumping station in Australia.  Heritage listings  West Ryde has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * 135 Marsden Road: Riverview House, West Ryde * Victoria Road: Ryde Pumping Station Commercial areas West Ryde is home to a commercial area, close to West Ryde railway station and the Sydney Water Station, that pumps water to most of Northern Sydney. West Ryde Marketplace is a medium- sized shopping centre featuring a Woolworths supermarket, specialty shops and West Ryde Public Library. Since the new centre opened in 2005, it diverted many people from the ageing Top Ryde Shopping Centre, which subsequently closed and has now been redeveloped. Further building developments are rapidly advancing West Ryde shopping area busier with the arrival of the Coles Supermarket. Granny Smith festival is one of the grand community event happening at the start of spring every year. Transport West Ryde railway station is on the Northern Line of the Sydney Trains network. A bus interchange sits adjacent the station with services of 501, 520, 523 524, 534 and 543. At the , 50.7% of employed people travelled to work by car (either as a driver or as a passenger) and 35.5% by public transport . Housing The types of dwellings in West Ryde continues to shift away from the traditional separate houses and towards strata living. At the , 48.1% of occupied private dwellings were flats, units or apartments, 41.0% were separate houses and 9.7% were semi-detached (mostly town houses). The average household size was 2.6 people. West Ryde has a number of historical buildings including Addington, the second oldest extant building in Australia. The domestic architecture of the suburb largely consists of homes on quarter-acre blocks displaying most of the archetypical Australian styles, including Federation houses, Californian Bungalows, Depression-era houses of weatherboard or fibro with corrugated iron roofs, and 1960s red-brick housing. There is also a substantial number of Askin-era red-brick apartment blocks atop half-acre concrete expanses. In the past, West Ryde was a working-class suburb which was home to many factories, especially towards Meadowbank. However, the factories of the past are slowly succumbing to demolition, and the construction of waterfront apartments are taking their place, with views of Parramatta River and Sydney Olympic Park, thus the suburb is growing with affluence.  Demographics  At the , West Ryde recorded a population of 13,394. Of these: ; Age distribution : West Ryde residents' median age was 35 years, compared to the national median of 38. Children aged 0‚Äì14 years made up 16.6% of the population (national average is 18.7%) and people aged 65 years and over made up 12.1% of the population (national average is 15.8%). ; Ethnic diversity : 43.4% of people were born in Australia. The most common countries of birth were China 12.0%, South Korea 6.8%, India 6.2%, Philippines 2.6% and Hong Kong 2.5%. 40.7% of people only spoke English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Mandarin 12.1%, Korean 8.2%, Cantonese 7.4%, Arabic 3.0% and Hindi 2.4%. ; Religion: The most common responses for religion were No Religion 28.6% and Catholic 23.9%. ; Income : The average weekly household income in West Ryde was $1,677, above the national average of $1,438. ;Living arrangements : 71.5% of households were family households, 22.9% were single person households and 5.6% were group households.

Biography The eldest son of Robert Patterson (1750‚Äì1831), owner of a mill-furnishing business in Belfast established in 1786, Robert Patterson was born into a wealthy family. He was educated first at the Belfast Academy under the direction of a Dr. Bryce, and then at the Belfast Academical Institution. Here he won a prize for an essay on the natural history of Lough Neagh. When his father died in 1831, Patterson took over management of the family business, eventually marrying Mary Ferrar, one of whose ancestors had come to Ireland as a captain in Schomburg's Horse regiment. The newly-weds settled at No. 3 College Square North, Belfast, where most of his 11 children were born. At 19 Robert Patterson was one of seven young men who, on 5 June 1821, gathered at the house of Dr. James Lawson Drummond, at No. 5, Chichester Street to form the Belfast Natural History Society, which established the first museum in Ireland to be built by public subscription, at No. 7 College Square North. He served the society, later renamed, for more than fifty years, occupying every office. He was also a member of the Belfast Literary Society and the Royal Irish Academy. The Royal Society elected him a Fellow in 1859, Lists of Royal Society Fellows 1660-2007 and he was an early member of the British Association, serving as secretary to the Natural History section. Established as a significant naturalist in his thirties, Patterson had close links with Charles Darwin, Thomas Bell, Edward Forbes, William Yarrell and Charles Lucien Bonaparte. Patterson, FRS, MRIA died at his house in College Square North, Belfast, in February, 1879, after a fall. He is not to be confused with his second son, Robert Lloyd Patterson (1836-1906), or with his grandson Robert Patterson (1863-1931) who were also naturalists.

He is known for his work on Germanic mythology, on Baltic mythology, and other pre- Christian European pantheons; and for his championing of the solar theory, namely in the early years of his career, under the influence of Jakob Grimm. Later on, Mannhardt focused more on vegetation spirits from an evolutionist point of view, namely the primitive tree cult and its later developments.Rosa, Frederico Delgado, 2018. ¬´ Avant Le Rameau d‚ÄôOr : biographie de Wilhelm Mannhardt, pr√©curseur oubli√© de James Frazer ¬ª in B√©rose, Encyclop√©die en ligne sur l‚Äôhistoire de l‚Äôanthropologie et des savoirs ethnographiques, Paris, IIAC-LAHIC, UMR 8177. He was also a collector and carried out field work despite poor health. In 1865 he sent out questionnaires to 150,000 people. The questionnaires contained about thirty questions about agrarian customs especially during harvest time. A century later the questionnaires still served as a basis for folklore research. He was a forerunner of James Frazer's The Golden Bough (1890). Frazer acknowledged that, without Mannhardt's book, his own could scarcely have been written [The Golden Bough 1st. edition 1890, preface]. Like Frazer, his theories have subsequently been heavily criticized. See for example, von Sydow, C. W., \\"The Mannhardtian Theories about the Last Sheaf and the Fertility Demons from a Modern Critical Point of View\\" and ‚ÄúDie Begriffe des Ersten und Letzten in der Volks√ºberlieferung mit besonderer Ber√ºcksichtigung der Erntebra√ºche‚Äù, in \\"Selected Papers on Folklore\\", Copenhagen : Rosenkilde & Bagger, 1948, at pp. 89-105 and 146-165. In his books Mannhardt recorded an enormous number of magical and animistic beliefs behind agricultural customs. Twentieth and twenty-first century scholars, including von Sydow, his pupil Albert Eskerod and the British historian Ronald Hutton, have reinterpreted these beliefs as various forms of pretence or joke. The motives behind the pretences included scaring children away from the fields to protect the crops and celebrating the end of the harvest. According to the current orthodox view, there were no magical or animistic beliefs behind the customs.

Baltic mythology ultimately stems from Proto-Indo-European mythology. The Baltic region was one of the last regions of Europe to be Christianized, a process that occurred from the 15th century and into at least a century after. While no native texts survive detailing the mythology of the Baltic peoples during the pagan period, knowledge of the mythology may be gained from Russian and German chronicles, later folklore, by way of etymology, and comparative mythology.Puhvel (1989:222-229). While the early chronicles (14th and 15th century) were largely the product of missionaries who sought to eradicate the native paganism of the Baltic peoples, rich material survives into Baltic folklore. This material has been of particular value in Indo-European studies as, like the Baltic languages, it is considered by scholars to be notably conservative, reflecting elements of Proto-Indo- European religion. The Indo-European Divine Twins are particularly well represented as the Dieva dƒìli (Latvian 'sons of god') and Dievo s≈´neliai (Lithuanian 'sons of god'). According to folklore, they are the children of Dievas (Lithuanian and Latvia; see Proto-Indo-European *Dyeus).

One of the largest crowds was 8,127 when Gordon Rugby played Randwick in 1976. Gordon Rugby have been playing at Chatswood Oval since 1936. The approximate dimensions of the oval are 145 metres by 112 metres.  History  In 1898, the local council approved for five acres of land south of the railway station to be made a public park. This area was formerly a Chinese market garden with a large well in the centre. The oval was opened in 1900. In the season 1906‚Äì07 The Gordon District Cricket Club took up residence, previously known as the Willoughby District Cricket Club. The heyday of cricket for Chatswood Oval was up to the 1930s. Of note was Don Bradman's 201 runs scored at Chatswood Oval in April 1932, including 28 fours and two sixes in 171 minutes.

A completely undeveloped pinna is referred to as anotia. Because microtia and anotia have the same origin, it can be referred to as microtia-anotia. Microtia can be unilateral (one side only) or bilateral (affecting both sides). Microtia occurs in 1 out of about 8,000‚Äì10,000 births. In unilateral microtia, the right ear is most commonly affected. It may occur as a complication of taking Accutane (isotretinoin) during pregnancy.Pretest self assessment and review for the USMLE, pediatrics, 12th edition, question 84, general pediatrics Classification According to the Altman- classification, there are four grades of microtia: *Grade I: A less than complete development of the external ear with identifiable structures and a small but present external ear canal *Grade II: A partially developed ear (usually the top portion is underdeveloped) with a closed stenotic external ear canal producing a conductive hearing loss. *Grade III: Absence of the external ear with a small peanut-like vestige structure and an absence of the external ear canal and ear drum. Grade III microtia is the most common form of microtia. *Grade IV: Absence of the total ear or anotia.  Causes and Risk Factors  The etiology of microtia in children remains uncertain but there are some cases that associate the cause of microtia with genetic defects in multiple or single genes, altitude, and gestational diabetes. Risk factors gathered from studies include infants born underweight, women gravidity and parity, and medication use while pregnant. Genetic inheritance has not been fully studied but in the few studies available, it has shown to occur during the early stages of pregnancy. Diagnosis At birth, lower grade microtia is difficult to visually diagnose with a physical exam. While higher grade microtia can be visually diagnosed due to noticeable abnormalities. Infants that have noticeable abnormalities are closely monitored by physicians and hearing specialists. Treatment The goal of medical intervention is to provide the best form and function to the underdeveloped ear. =Hearing= Typically, testing is first done to determine the quality of hearing. This can be done as early as in the first two weeks with a BAER test (Brain Stem Auditory Response Test). At age 5‚Äì6, CT or CAT scans of the middle ear can be done to elucidate its development and clarify which patients are appropriate candidates for surgery to improve hearing. For younger individuals, this is done under sedation. The hearing loss associated with congenital aural atresia is a conductive hearing loss‚Äîhearing loss caused by inefficient conduction of sound to the inner ear. Essentially, children with aural atresia have hearing loss because the sound cannot travel into the (usually) healthy inner ear‚Äîthere is no ear canal, no eardrum, and the small ear bones (malleus/hammer, incus/anvil, and stapes/stirrup) are underdeveloped. \\"Usually\\" is in parentheses because rarely, a child with atresia also has a malformation of the inner ear leading to a sensorineural hearing loss (as many as 19% in one study). Sensorineural hearing loss is caused by a problem in the inner ear, the cochlea. Sensorineural hearing loss is not correctable by surgery, but properly fitted and adjusted hearing amplification (hearing aids) generally provide excellent rehabilitation for this hearing loss. If the hearing loss is severe to profound in both ears, the child may be a candidate for a cochlear implant (beyond the scope of this discussion). Unilateral sensorineural hearing loss was not generally considered a serious disability by the medical establishment before the nineties; it was thought that the afflicted person was able to adjust to it from birth. In general, there are exceptional advantages to gain from an intervention to enable hearing in the microtic ear, especially in bilateral microtia. Children with untreated unilateral sensorineural hearing loss are more likely to have to repeat a grade in school and/or need supplemental services (e.g., FM system ‚Äì see below) than their peers. Children with unilateral sensorineural hearing loss often require years of speech therapy in order to learn how to enunciate and understand spoken language. What is truly unclear, and the subject of an ongoing research study, is the effect of unilateral conductive hearing loss (in children with unilateral aural atresia) on scholastic performance. If atresia surgery or some form of amplification is not used, special steps should be taken to ensure that the child is accessing and understanding all of the verbal information presented in school settings. Recommendations for improving a child's hearing in the academic setting include preferential seating in class, an FM system (the teacher wears a microphone, and the sound is transmitted to a speaker at the child's desk or to an ear bud or hearing aid the child wears), a bone-anchored hearing aid (BAHA), or conventional hearing aids. Age for BAHA implantation depends on whether the child is in Europe (18 months) or the US (age 5). Until then it is possible to fit a BAHA on a softband It is important to note that not all children with aural atresia are candidates for atresia repair. Candidacy for atresia surgery is based on the hearing test (audiogram) and CT scan imaging. If a canal is built where one does not exist, minor complications can arise from the body's natural tendency to heal an open wound closed. Repairing aural atresia is a very detailed and complicated surgical procedure which requires an expert in atresia repair. While complications from this surgery can arise, the risk of complications is greatly reduced when using a highly experienced otologist. Atresia patients who opt for surgery will temporarily have the canal packed with gelatin sponge and silicone sheeting to prevent closure. The timing of ear canal reconstruction (canalplasty) depends on the type of external ear (Microtia) repair desired by the patient and family. Two surgical teams in the USA are currently able to reconstruct the canal at the same time as the external ear in a single surgical stage (one stage ear reconstruction). In cases where a later surgical reconstruction of the external ear of the child might be possible, positioning of the BAHA implant is critical. It may be necessary to position the implant further back than usual to enable successful reconstructive surgery ‚Äì but not so far as to compromise hearing performance. If the reconstruction is ultimately successful, it is easy to remove the percutaneous BAHA abutment. If the surgery is unsuccessful, the abutment can be replaced and the implant re-activated to restore hearing. =External ear= The age when outer ear surgery can be attempted depends upon the technique chosen. The earliest is 7 for Rib Cartilage Grafts. However, some surgeons recommend waiting until a later age, such as 8‚Äì10 when the ear is closer to adult size. External ear prostheses have been made for children as young as 5. For auricular reconstruction, there are several different options: # Rib Cartilage Graft Reconstruction: This surgery may be performed by specialists in the technique. It involves sculpting the patient's own rib cartilage into the form of an ear. Because the cartilage is the patient's own living tissue, the reconstructed ear continues to grow as the child does. In order to be sure that the rib cage is large enough to provide the necessary donor tissue, some surgeons wait until the patient is 8 years of age; however, some surgeons with more experience with this technique may begin the surgery on a child aged six. The major advantage of this surgery is that the patient's own tissue is used for the reconstruction. This surgery varies from two to four stages depending on the surgeon's preferred method. A novel one stage ear reconstruction technique is performed by a few select surgeons. One team is able to reconstruct the entire external ear and ear canal in one operation. # Reconstruct the ear using a polyethylene plastic implant (also called Medpor): This is a 1‚Äì2 stage surgery that can start at age 3 and can be done as an outpatient without hospitalization. Using the porous framework, which allows the patient's tissue to grow into the material and the patient's own tissue flap, a new ear is constructed in a single surgery. A small second surgery is performed in 3‚Äì6 months if needed for minor adjustments. Medpor was developed by John Reinisch. This surgery should only be performed by experts in the techniques involved. The use of porous polyethylene implants for ear reconstruction was initiated in the 1980s by Alexander Berghaus.Alexander Berghaus. Implantate f√ºr die rekonstruktive Chirurgie der Nase und des Ohres. Sammelwerk=Laryngo-Rhino-Otologie. Vol.86. 2007. Page 67‚Äì76. DOI=10.1055/s-2007-966301 # Ear Prosthesis: An auricular (ear) prosthesis is custom made by an anaplastologist to mirror the other ear. Prosthetic ears can appear very realistic. They require a few minutes of daily care. They are typically made of silicone, which is colored to match the surrounding skin and can be attached using either adhesive or with titanium screws inserted into the skull to which the prosthetic is attached with a magnetic or bar/clip type system. These screws are the same as the BAHA (bone anchored hearing aid ) screws and can be placed simultaneously. The biggest advantage over any surgery is having a prosthetic ear that allows the affected ear to appear as normal as possible to the natural ear. The biggest disadvantage is the daily care involved and knowing that the prosthesis is not real. Related conditions Aural atresia is the underdevelopment of the middle ear and canal and usually occurs in conjunction with microtia. Atresia occurs because patients with microtia may not have an external opening to the ear canal, though. However, the cochlea and other inner ear structures are usually present. The grade of microtia usually correlates to the degree of development of the middle ear. Microtia is usually isolated, but may occur in conjunction with hemifacial microsomia, Goldenhar Syndrome or Treacher-Collins Syndrome. It is also occasionally associated with kidney abnormalities (rarely life- threatening), and jaw problems, and more rarely, heart defects and vertebral deformities.

A harbourmaster (or harbormaster, see spelling differences) is an official responsible for enforcing the regulations of a particular harbour or port, in order to ensure the safety of navigation, the security of the harbour and the correct operation of the port facilities. Responsibilities Harbourmasters are normally responsible for issuing local safety information sometimes known as notice to mariners. They may also oversee the maintenance and provision of navigational aids within the port, co-ordinate responses to emergencies, inspect vessels and oversee pilotage services. The harbourmaster may have legal power to detain, caution or even arrest persons committing an offence within the port or tidal range of the port's responsibilities. An example of this is the team of harbourmasters employed by the Port of London Authority who are empowered to undertake an enforcement role. Actions that a harbourmaster may investigate include criminal acts, immigration, customs and excise, maritime and river safety and environmental and pollution issues. The police, customs, coastguard or immigration authorities will take over the handling of any offenders or incident once informed by the harbourmaster. Civilian and naval officers Harbormaster's shanty, Hingham harbor, Hingham, Massachusetts. A harbourmaster may either be a civilian or a commissioned naval officer of any rank. Historically all harbourmasters were naval officers; even today they must possess prior seafaring knowledge and experience through serving with either a merchant navy or armed navy. The terms naval and civilian are used here to distinguish who is employed by a military force and who is employed by a public or private port. =United Kingdom and Canada= In the United Kingdom, when a person has been appointed to superintend a dockyard port the officer serves in this capacity as the Queen's (or King's) Harbourmaster, and is entitled to fly a white-bordered Union Flag with a white central disc bearing the initials \\"QHM\\" (or \\"KHM\\" during the reign of a King) beneath a crown. Although legislation does not require it, most QHMs are serving officers in the Royal Navy. Equivalent positions also exist in Canada, where a Queen's Harbourmaster is known in French as capitaine de port de Sa Majest√© (literally \\"Her Majesty's Captain of the Port\\"). Nowadays the former post of Harbourmaster of the Port of London Authority, and indeed many other large ports, is Chief Harbourmaster, who command a team of harbourmasters because of the size of the port. =United States= In the United States, the Captain of the Port, a United States Coast Guard officer, is responsible for these duties in a pre-defined Captain of the Port zone which usually includes multiple ports and waterways leading to those ports, usually in federal waters. A US Captain of the Port, unlike the Canadian capitaine de port, is not normally considered to be a harbormaster, as harbormasters in the United States (as elsewhere) are usually local government officials responsible for safety and security in a harbor. The directives of harbormasters are subservient to the oversight of the Coast Guard.

Following the release of her first album in 1961, La Lupe moved from Havana to New York and signed with Tico Records, which marked the beginning of a prolific and successful career in the 1960s and 1970s. She retired in the 1980s due to religious reasons. Life and career =Early life and first recordings= La Lupe with Pacho Alonso (left) and Benny Mor√© (right), ca. 1959. All three were signed to the RCA Victor subsidiary Discuba. La Lupe was born in the barrio of San Pedrito in Santiago de Cuba. Her father was a worker at the local Bacard√≠ distillery and a major influence on her early life. In 1954 she participated on a radio program which invited fans to sing imitations of their favorite stars. Lupe escaped from school to sing a bolero of Olga Guillot's, called \\"Mi√©nteme\\" (Lie to Me), and won the competition. The family moved to Havana in 1955, where she was enrolled at the University of Havana to become a teacher. She admired Celia Cruz and like her, she graduated from teaching instruction before starting her professional singing career.Giro, p45. Lupe married in 1958 and formed a musical trio with her husband Eulogio \\"Yoyo\\" Reyes and another female singer. This group, Los Tropicuba, broke up along with her marriage in 1960. She began to perform her own act at a small nightclub in Havana, La Red (The Net), which had a clientele of distinguished foreigners. She acquired a devoted following, which included Ernest Hemingway, Tennessee Williams, Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir and Marlon Brando. She recorded her first album, Con el diablo en el cuerpo, in 1960 for Discuba, the Cuban subsidiary of RCA Victor. On the album she was backed by two different groups directed by Felipe Dulzaides and Eddy Gayt√°n. Her first television appearance on Puerto Rican television caused a stir due to her frenzied, vibrant performance, which reportedly shocked some viewers.Pedro Rojas 1988. Sleeve notes to La Lupe: too much, Charly Records LP HOT 123 =Exile and success= In 1962 she was exiled to M√©xico. She approached Celia Cruz and asked for her support to get work, and in turn, Celia recommended her to Mongo Santamar√≠a in New York. In New York City, Lupe performed at a cabaret named La Berraca and started a new career, making more than 10 records in five years. She married a second time, to salsa musician Willie Garc√≠a, with whom she had a son. That marriage also ended in divorce. Lupe's passionate performances covered the range of music: son montuno, bolero, boogaloo, venturing into other Caribbean styles like Dominican merengue, Puerto Rican bomba and plena. It was her recordings which brought Tite Curet Alonso into prominence as a composer of tough-minded boleros in the salsa style. For a good part of the 1960s she was the most acclaimed Latin singer in New York City due to her partnership with Tito Puente. She did a wide variety of cover versions in either Spanish or accented English, including \\"Yesterday\\", \\"Dominique\\" by The Singing Nun, \\"Twist & Shout\\", \\"Unchained Melody\\", \\"Fever\\" and \\"America\\" from West Side Story. Fred Weinberg, who was her favorite audio engineer, and also worked with Celia Cruz, Mongo Santamaria, Tito Puente, and many more of the Latin American greats, and a producer on several of Lupe's albums, called La Lupe \\"A talent hurricane\\" in the studio due to her intense singing and enthusiasm. The quality of her performances became increasingly inconsistent. There were persistent rumors of her drug addiction and her life was \\"a real earthquake\\" according to statements of close friends, although Fred Weinberg, who engineered, and also produced a vast amount of her albums, stated that \\"In all the years I worked with Lupe, not once did I ever see her on drugs, or using drugs...Heck, she never even drank liquor due to her strong belief in religion.\\"Rondon, C√©sar Miguel 2008.

University of North Carolina Press; p148 She ended some of her on-stage engagements being treated with an oxygen mask. Although she may have been poorly managed by her label Fania Records in particular, she managed and produced herself in mid-career, after she parted ways with Tito Puente. However, in the late 1960s her ephemeral career went downhill. The explosion of salsa and the arrival of Celia Cruz to New York were the determining factors that sent her into the background and her career declined thereafter. =Later years and death= A devout follower of Santer√≠a, she continued to practice her religion. Her record label Fania Records (which had previously acquired Tico) ended her contract in the late 1970s, perhaps simply because of her falling record sales. She retired in 1980, and found herself destitute by the early 1980s. In 1984 she injured her spine while trying to hang a curtain in her home; she initially used a wheelchair, then later a cane.La Lupe, a Singer, Is Dead at 53; Known as \\"Queen of Latin Soul\\" from The New York Times 7 March 1992 An electrical fire made her homeless. After being healed at an evangelical Christian crusade, La Lupe abandoned her Santer√≠a roots and became a born- again Christian.

The \\"Grand Union\\" name survived until the canal was bought by the Grand Junction in 1894 and became known as the Leicester Line of the Grand Junction. The larger Grand Junction Canal was subsequently bought by the Regent's Canal and from 1 January 1929 the whole network was known as the Grand Union Canal. Where clarity between the two Grand Unions is needed, the original Grand Union Canal is generally referred to as the Old Grand Union. History In 1793, an Act was passed for the Leicestershire and Northamptonshire Union Canal: this was intended to link the Soar Navigation near Leicester to the River Nene near Northampton, and thus to the Grand Junction Canal via the latter's Northampton Arm. The Leicestershire and Northampton union reached the village of Debdale by 1797, but in doing so had used up all of its money. James Barnes, an engineer working on the Grand Junction Canal, was asked in 1799 to find a route for the canal to reach the Grand Junction at Braunston. In 1802, he produced a revised proposal, to route the rest of the canal to Norton on the Grand Junction, with a branch to Market Harborough. Thomas Telford was then asked for his opinion, and he also proposed a change of destination to Norton, but via the town of Market Harborough. This was agreed upon, but by 1809, the canal had reached only Market Harborough, where construction came to an end again. The Grand Junction Canal Company were concerned about these delays to the opening of the important route to the east Midlands, which would bring traffic onto their canal from the River Trent and the Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire coalfields. They requested James Barnes and Thomas Telford to revisit the question of route once again, and they developed a plan for a canal to link the part of the Leicestershire and Northamptonshire Union Canal which had been built with the Grand Junction Canal, which had been fully open since 1805. Experience on the Grand Junction showed that broad boats caused delays as they could not pass in the tunnels, and so the Grand Junction was happy for the new canal to be built with only narrow locks, but with broad tunnels and bridges to allow passing of boats. With the Leicestershire and Northamptonshire route unfinished, a Bill was put to Parliament to authorise a new canal, known as the Grand Union Canal, from the Leicestershire and Northamptonshire Union Canal at Foxton, to Norton on the Grand Junction Canal. The Act received Royal Assent on 24 May 1810, entitled \\"An Act for making and maintaining a navigable Canal from the Union Canal, in the parish of Gumley, in the county of Leicester, to join the Grand Junction Canal near Buckby, in the county of Northampton; and for making a collateral Cut from the said intended Canal\\". The company had an authorised capital of ¬£245,000, and powers to raise a further ¬£50,000 if this proved necessary. Benjamin Bevan was employed as the engineer and construction began at Foxton. The terrain to be crossed was problematic for the canal engineers, as demonstrated by the several proposals made for routes. The core of the problem was the lack of river valleys or other obvious routes to take. The undulating countryside meant that the chosen route needed many twists and turns to maintain a level. However, the route does not keep as strictly to contours as the early canals of James Brindley did; the worst potential diversions were avoided by cuttings, embankments, and two significant tunnels, one of at Crick and another of at Husbands Bosworth, both of which were wide enough for narrowboats to pass. From the junction with the Leicestershire and Northamptonshire Union Canal, at Foxton, the new canal immediately climbed through the ten Foxton Locks, to its summit level. By late 1812, the Foxton flight was completed, and the canal to the eastern portal of Husbands Bosworth Tunnel was opened. The tunnel was completed by May of the following year, opening up of the main line. In addition, around of the branch to Welford was opened at this time. Further west, problems were encountered at Crick, where the rocks were unsuitable for tunnelling, and quicksands were found. A new route to the east of the village was authorised, and cost an extra ¬£7,000. At Watford, the canal descended through the seven Watford Locks to the same height as the summit of the Grand Junction Canal, allowing a level junction with it at Long Buckby (Norton Junction). To avoid a deep cutting and a short tunnel at Watford, the company eventually agreed to buy the land they needed from a Mrs Bennett, despite the cost of ¬£2,000 plus ¬£125 per acre (¬£312 per ha). She drove a hard bargain, insisting that she be allowed to keep a pleasure boat on the summit level, and that she should appoint the Watford lock keeper, to ensure that he would always be civil to her and her tenants, and would protect her property from damage by boatmen. The company agreed, providing that the lock keeper was suitably qualified. The main line of the canal was completed in 1814, and opened on 9 August. The Welford Arm, which was essentially a navigable feeder, since it connected to the reservoirs which provided the water supply, was not completed until November. The total cost of the project was around ¬£292,000, which rose by another ¬£13,500 the following year. The main line was long, with a level pound of between the locks at Foxton and those at Watford. The opening of the Grand Union Canal provided an additional source of water for the northern summit level of the Grand Junction Canal. Development The new canal was not a commercial success, mainly because there was little local traffic, and it relied on traffic passing through from other canals. The company correspondence shows large amounts of effort devoted to negotiations on rates, but it was not in a strong position, and coal was carried at around one third of the rate authorised by the enabling Act of Parliament. Pig iron and other heavy castings only raised d (0.6p) per ton per mile, whereas on the Monmouthshire Canal at the time, such cargoes were charged at 5d (2p) per ton per mile. Despite this, they had managed to repay most of their debts by 1826, and paid the first dividend to shareholders of one per cent. All loans had been repaid by 1836, and the dividend rose to 1.25 per cent in 1840. With the opening of the London and Birmingham Railway in 1838, and the prospect of lower tolls, men who were committee members of the Grand Junction Canal began buying shares in order to obtain financial control of the Grand Union. A close working relationship developed with the Leicestershire and Northamptonshire Union to help stave off competition from the railways, but toll receipts spiralled downwards, from ¬£7,551 in 1848 to ¬£3,108 in 1858, ¬£1,024 in 1875 and just ¬£742 in 1885. Dividends followed this trend, reaching 0.05 per cent in 1885. Costly repairs were carried out on both of the tunnels, which interrupted traffic while the work was done, and the company managed to build an ice-boat and a dredger, but by 1884, they were almost penniless. Takeover In late 1886 or early 1887, the Grand Junction company inspected the Grand Union Canal and the Leicestershire and Northamptonshire Union Canal, and then wrote to both, about the possibility of measures to improve and increase traffic. Both indicated they were prepared to sell out to the Grand Junction, who then offered ¬£5,000 for the two. The canals replied with a counter offer of ¬£25,000, since they had a large asset in their water supplies, but no agreement was made. In 1893, the company met with Mr Fellows, of the carrying company Fellows Morton and Clayton, who suggested that if the locks at Foxton and Watford were made wider, and the canal was dredged, conditions would be much better, and they would be able to run large steam boats, which would allow them to compete with the railways. After making enquiries, Fellows was offered both of the canals for ¬£20,000, and after further discussion with the Grand Junction company, they asked him to act as their agent and buy both. He negotiated a price of ¬£10,500 for the Grand Union, and ¬£6,500 for the Leicestershire and Northamptonshire Union, with ¬£250 to be paid to the clerk who acted for both companies. An Act of Parliament to authorise the takeover was passed in 1894, and the transfer of ownership took place on 29 September. After takeover, the canal became known as the Leicester Line of the Grand Junction Canal. The Grand Junction dredged the canals they had bought, and negotiated with the Leicester, the Loughborough, and the Erewash Canal, to fix tolls for through traffic. They then talked to Fellows Morton and Clayton again, and revived the plans to allow them to work wide-beam barges over the Grand Union route. Plans for an inclined plane at Foxton Locks were approved in July 1897, tenders were received in November, and the contract was given to J & H Gwynne & Co, based in Hammersmith. The design was by G.C. Thomas, the Grand Junction Canal's engineer, who had been assisted by his brother, and Gwynne's price was ¬£14,130. Two counterbalanced caissons could each hold two narrow boats or one wide-beam barge, and could raise or lower them the between the top and bottom of the lock flight in twelve minutes, compared to the seventy that using the locks took. Including land purchase, the total cost was ¬£39,224, which also included the provision of an engine house and steam engine to power the plane. The plane was completed and began operating on 10 July 1900. Thomas did not favour a second inclined plane, and so widening of the locks at Watford was authorised in early 1900, at a cost of ¬£17,000, but was deferred in March, until the work at Foxton was completed and the inclined plane was operational. In August they complained to Fellows Morton and Clayton that through traffic of coal had continued to decline, and they rebuilt the locks at Watford between November 1901 and February 1902. The work cost ¬£5,545, as they were not widened, and wide-beam craft were never able to use the canal. Despite the failure of the scheme, the company recommended to the Royal Commission held in 1906 that a number of other canals should be upgraded to take 80-ton barges, and suggested that several other inclined planes should be built. In November 1908, the locks at Foxton were re-opened for night-time working, and the inclined plane officially stopped working in November 1910, although it is known to have worked intermittently until at least 1912. It was dismantled in 1926 and sold for scrap in 1928. In an attempt to become more competitive, the Grand Junction company talked to the Regent's Canal company, and the idea of a much larger concern began to develop. An Act of Parliament was obtained in August 1928, which allowed the amalgamation of the Regent's Canal, the Grand Junction, the Warwick and Birmingham, the Birmingham and Warwick Junction and the Warwick and Napton Canals. As from 1 January 1929, the new company began operating, and the old Grand Union Canal became part of the (new) Grand Union Canal. Having raised ¬£881,000 to enable the route from Birmingham to London to be widened to take boats with a beam, and received Government grants to cover interest payments on loans of ¬£500,000, the work began in 1931. The company then decided they could get grants for widening the Foxton and Watford locks, and under an Act of Parliament obtained in 1931, bought the Leicester, the Loughborough and the Erewash Canals. The estimated cost of widening the two flights was ¬£144,000, but the Government refused to make a grant later that year, and the work was never carried out.

She was named after Ulysses S. Grant and owned by Messers Boyes, Richardson & Co. She had a timber hull with a length of 179.5 ft, beam of 34.5 ft and depth of 21.5 ft. While on her way from Melbourne to London, General Grant crashed into a cliff on the west coast of main island of the Auckland Islands of New Zealand, and subsequently sank as a result. Sixty-eight people drowned and only 15 people survived. Wreck She departed Melbourne on 4 May 1866 bound for London via Cape Horn, under the command of Captain William H. Loughlin. She was carrying 58 passengers and 25 crew, along with a cargo of wool, skins, 2,576 ounces of gold, and 9 tons of zinc spelter ballast. Included in the passenger list were a number of successful miners from the Australian gold fields. At 11pm on 13 May 1866, the Auckland Islands were sighted dead ahead. With only light winds the crew were unable to change course, and she collided against the cliffs and drifted into a large cave on Auckland Island's western shore. The rising tide and increasing swell caused the main mast to hit the cave roof repeatedly until the mast forced a hole through the hull; the ship sank on 14 May 1866. Although the weather remained calm, the boats were not launched immediately on the ship entering the cave as it was very dark, there was no obvious landing place, and pieces of spars and rock were falling down continually. Once daylight arrived the three boats on board were prepared for launch. The boats consisted of two quarter boats (each 22 feet long) and a long boat of 30 feet. One of the quarter boats was launched first and sent outside to see if landing could be made. The boat was expected to return for more people but instead waited outside the cave as no landing could be found. By this time the swell was increasing. The second quarter boat took a number of passengers and crew, including Mrs Jewell, to the first boat for transfer. The long boat was lying on the quarter deck and was filled with passengers. The ship was sinking fast and the long boat floated off General Grants decks. Unfortunately, the long boat was swamped with water just after getting clear of the ship. The second quarter boat stayed out of the danger area, but three people (David Ashworth, Aaron Hayman, and William Sanguily) were able to swim through the surf to the quarter boat. A total of fifteen people, including 9 crew and 6 passengers, survived the wreck. The captain did not leave the ship. Passengers and crew The list of those on General Grant includes: *William H. Loughlin of New York - Captain - Drowned at time of wreck *Bartholmew Brown of Boston - First officer - Lost at sea attempting to reach New Zealand *B. F. Jones of Massachusetts - Second officer - Drowned at time of wreck *Magnes Anderson of Sweden - Carpenter - Drowned at time of wreck *Keding - Steward - Drowned at time of wreck *William Newton Scott of Shields (also reported as W Newton Smith) - Able bodied seaman - Lost at sea attempting to reach New Zealand *William Ferguson - Able bodied seaman - Survived *Cornelius Drew - Able bodied seaman - Survived *Peter McNevin of Isaly - Able bodied seaman - Lost at sea attempting to reach New Zealand *Andrew Morrison of Glasgow - Able bodied seaman - Lost at sea attempting to reach New Zealand *David McLelland of Ayre, Scotland - Able bodied seaman - Died on the Island *Joseph Harvey Jewell - Able bodied seaman - Survived *William Murdoch Sanguilly - Able bodied seaman - Survived *Aaron Hayman (also reported as A.

They reached there at dark and then the next day made for the Auckland Island and Port Ross. They arrived there after three days and two nights. After exploring, the group found two huts at Port Ross and, on 13 July 1866 Musgrave's hut. The group split in two in order to keep watch for passing ships. After nine months ashore, four of the crew decided to attempt to sail to New Zealand in one of the quarter boats. They set sail on 22 January 1867 without a compass, chart, or nautical instrument of any kind and were never seen again. Another survivor, David McLelland, died of illness on 3 September 1867. He was 62. The ten remaining survivors moved to Enderby Island, where they lived on seals and pigs. On 19 November, they sighted the cutter Fanny, but she did not see their signals. The brig Amherst noticed their signals on 21 November 1867 and rescued the group. As a result of this shipwreck and two previous wrecks (Grafton and Invercauld), the New Zealand government established a network of castaway depots and regular visits by government vessels to the subantarctic islands to relieve further shipwreck victims. From as soon as 1868, General Grants cargo of gold attracted numerous recovery attempts, several of which proved deadly for the wreck seekers, but the exact location of the wreck has yet to be confirmed.

Founded in 1973 by Gordon and Rena Merchant, the company first traded on the Australian Securities Exchange in 11 August 2000. The name \\"billabong\\" is derived from the Wiradjuri word \\"bilaba≈ã\\" that refers to a \\"creek that runs only during the rainy season\\". As of September 2013, Von Zipper, and Element were two of the prominent brands that Billabong owns. Honolua Surf Company, Kustom, Palmers Surf, Xcel, Tigerlily, Sector 9 and RVCA were the company's other brands. In 2018 Billabong International Limited was acquired by Boardriders, Inc, owner of rival brand Quiksilver. From late 2012 onwards, following the company's decline in the period since 2008, Billabong International has been the subject of several protracted bidding and takeover processes in which the company's former United States chief Paul Naude has been a participant. During one period, Billabong used a corporate turnaround strategy to return the company to profitability, which it achieved in 2014. In December 2016, former chief executive Matthew Perrin was found guilty of fraud and forgery by a jury in the District Court in Brisbane, and was sentenced to jail in January 2017. History =Early history= Billabong was founded in the Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia in 1973 by Gordon Merchant. At first, he designed and created board shorts at his home and then sold them to local surf shops. Surfers soon realized the durability of Merchant's shorts that was the result of his triple-stitching technique. Merchant understood that his company needed to expand to achieve success, so Billabong started to sponsor contests, which increased the public's awareness of Merchant's products and the company expanded. By the 1980s, Billabong board shorts were present throughout Australia. Based upon his success in Australia, Merchant decided to export Billabong's products and, by the late 1980s, Merchant's board shorts were available in other countries, including New Zealand, Japan, and South Africa. In the 1990s, the surf industry as a whole grew significantly and Billabong was a part of this growth process. The company was first traded on the Australian Securities Exchange 2000, which provided the company with the funds to further expand and acquire other companies. =Acquisitions= A Billabong brand baseball cap As the company developed further, it acquired new brands and retail outlets to move beyond the wholesale business, and the first decade of the 21st century was a particularly active period of expansion for Billabong. Von Zipper, an eyewear brand, was acquired in early 2001 and the acquisition of skateboarding apparel and hard good brand Element was announced in July 2001. The acquisition of the Kustom surf shoe brand, as part of Billabong's purchase of the Australian Gold Coast-based Palmers Surf company, was disclosed in September 2004. The following year in December, an official press release was published to announce the acquisition of Nixon Inc., a watch and accessories brand in the board sports market. The acquisition of wetsuit and technical watersport accessories brand Xcel became effective on 1 September 2007, and Jodhi Meares's former Tigerlily brand was acquired shortly thereafter in December of the same year. The Tigerlily decision represented the first time that Billabong had acquired a brand focused exclusively on the 'girls' market, and the management intended to position the new addition so that it complimented the company's own 'Billabongs Girls' line. In 2008 Billabong continued with the consistent acquisition activity that occurred in 2007 and announced four acquisitions over four successive months. Following the acquisition of the Gold Coast store Kirra Surf in May, the company announced its acquisition of the retail operations of Quiet Flight, a retail company on the east coast of the US that had already been operating licensed Billabong and Element retail outlets in Times Square, New York City, US. The Quiet Flight deal resulted in the addition of 14 Quiet Flight and Surf Warehouse retail stores, most of which were located in Florida, US. Then in June 2008, the founders of the Sector 9 skateboard company accepted an offer from Billabong that also included the purchase of the Gullwing skateboard truck brand. Finally, in August, Billabong confirmed the acquisition of boardsport accessories brand DaKine, which specialises in backpacks, bags, gloves and accessories, in a press release that projected that \\"DaKine is expected to contribute approximately 4% of Billabong International Limited‚Äôs Group sales in the 2008-09 financial year\\". Billabong's retail expansion continued into late 2008 with the November purchase of the United Kingdom (UK)-based 13-store retail chain Two Seasons for an undisclosed sum. Billabong only announced a single acquisition in 2009 with the purchase of Swell, a US-based online retailer of boardsports brands, for an undisclosed sum. Billabong began 2010 with the signing of a ten-year licensing deal with popular skateboard company Plan B, and Plan B subsequently entered into a partnership arrangement with Element. In May 2010, Billabong's retail expansion continued with the acquisition of American surf retailer Becker Surf & Sport in May (the Becker deal included the business' online operations, but not its surfboard operations), followed by the purchase of prominent Canadian action sports retailer West 49 in late June. Further acquisitions were then announced in the remainder of 2010: the acquisition of apparel brand RVCA was confirmed in July and the label's founder Pat Tenore explained his decision in the Billabong press release: \\"One of the key things about Billabong is its respect for the creative independence of each of its brands and that level of flexibility will allow RVCA to maintain its identity while benefiting from the support of the wider Billabong group\\"; after RVCA, Billabong then returned to the retail market and ended the year with the October acquisition of the Australian retail stores Surf Dive ‚Äòn' Ski and Jetty Surf‚Äîfrom vendor General Pants Group‚Äîfor an undisclosed amount. =Collapse= On 16 February 2012, trading in Billabong shares was halted at the company's request because of reports of a 776 million takeover offer from TPG Capital, a United States private equity firm. On 17 February 2012, Billabong announced its intention to undergo a major restructure. Up to 150 stores closed. 400 full-time jobs will be lost internationally, including up to 80 in Australia. 48.5% of its Nixon watches and accessories brand name will be sold to Trilantic Capital Partners (TCP) to establish Nixon as a joint venture. The partial sale will give approximately US$285 (or A$265.78) million in net proceeds to Billabong. It is intended that proceeds from the sale will be used to reduce debt. In February 2012, TPG Capital made two takeover proposals which were both not accepted. Billabong announced that Gordon Merchant, who owns 15% of the company's shares, had rejected both the offers. On 27 August 2012, Chief Executive Launa Inman presented her four-year plan to try to return Billabong to positive sales growth and increase earnings. The plan included a range of measures with the key focus being on simplifying the business, leveraging its namesake brand, improving its supply chain and e-commerce offerings. The new initiatives are estimated to cost approximately $80 million. In September 2012 two private equity firms, TPG Capital and Bain Capital, were bidding for ownership of Billabong. =Takeover= The company was to finalise a takeover deal with either of two American private equity suitors; a refinancing deal was nearing completion as of 5 June 2013. However, on 4 June 2013, Billabong stated that it was unable to reach an agreement with US private equity funds Altamont Capital Partners and Sycamore Partners, 16 months after the first takeover move emerged. A media report published on 18 July 2013 conveyed that the takeover process had \\"exploded into acrimony\\", as two US hedge funds contested the offer from Altamont Partners that was accepted by the company on 16 July 2013. Acting together, the hedge funds claimed that they had made a superior offer to the one that was accepted, whereby a debt-for-equity swap was proposed that would result in a 60 percent stake in Billabong. As of 19 July 2013, Billabong rejected the claim from hedge funds Centerbridge Partners and Oaktree Capital, stating that the proposal in question was conditional and could therefore not be accepted. As of 23 August 2013, Billabong confirmed that is considering a rival deal from US hedge funds Centerbridge and Oaktree after the company had initially announced that plans to accept $US300 million loan from an Altamont-led consortium. The two hedge funds offered a higher price than Altamont, as well as a lower interest rate on a loan. Also as of this date, Billabong shares gained 6.8 percent, to 58.75 cents. A media report on 27 August 2013 stated that Billabong will be moving ahead with the $US325 million refinancing proposal from Altamont and Blackstone. As of the same date, Centerbridge and Oaktree were actively pursuing Billabong directors in relation to their deal that they believe is significantly superior to the accepted proposal. The consortium also claimed that they could finalise the details and a recapitalisation within a brief time period, and would allow acting, Altamont- installed boss Scott Olivet to remain if their offer succeeds. The company's chairman Ian Pollard explained: > We are nearing the end of a long process that has caused distraction, > impacted on staff morale and has been very costly. The company looks forward > to refocusing, reinvigorating its brands and rebuilding the business on a > solid, long-term financial footing. Pollard stated on 29 August 2013 that the chance of Billabong considering the Centerbridge and Oaktree consortium offer was low. At the time of the interview, Pollard explained that Billabong's board is still evaluating the proposal, but also stated that the board is hesitant to overlook the deal brokered with Altamont and Blackstone. As of 21 September 2013, Billabong's deal with Altamont was no longer valid, and the company was in the process of seeking approval from shareholders to finalise an arrangement with Centerbridge and Oaktree, and their affiliates. If brokered, the deal will mean that the Centerbridge and Oaktree consortium will control most of the company's senior debt, it will own up to 40.8 per cent of Billabong's shares and will also be entitled to install three representatives on Billabong's board. On 21 September 2013, the Centerbridge and Oaktree consortium appointed new chief executive Neil Fiske; as of this date, Billabong was also continuing the search for a buyer for the Canadian skateboard retail chain West 49. The company's sale of the West 49 retail chain was announced on 4 November 2013, with fashion retailer YM Inc. identified as the buyer. West 49 was sold for approximately CAD$9‚Äì11 million, Billabong has also entered into a two-year non-exclusive wholesale agreement with YM Inc. worth approximately CAD$34 million. The ownership of 92 West 49 retail stores, located across Canada was be transferred through the deal. In January 2014, Oaktree Capital Management and Centerbridge Partners refinanced Billabong's debt for a 40.8 percent ownership. Billabong International, announced that it was selling, with the help of Guggenheim Securities, its 51 percent stake in SurfStitch and its 100 percent stake in Swell. = Return to profitability = In 2000, the company was listed with sales of A$225 million that grew to A$1.7 billion in 2011. Profits of A$249 million were achieved in 2007. For the six months to 31 December 2011, Billabong experienced a 71 per cent drop in net profit to A$16.097 million. In early 2013, Billabong revealed earnings collapses across core business markets that \\"decimated its business\\". Losses in the December half are A$536.6 million. A late August 2013 media report stated \\"the Billabong label itself is now deemed essentially worthless, according to Billabong's accounts\\" following the declaration of an A$859.5 million loss for fiscal year 2013. Billabong's brands were worth A$90 million at the end of June 2013 and on the morning of 27 August 2013, the company stated that global sales of A$1.34 billion were down by 13.5 per cent in reported terms for 2012‚Äì13. The company returned to profitability in 2015‚Äîfor the 2014 earning reports‚Äîwith a net profit after tax around 25.7 million Australian dollars. This was first time the company became profitable since 2011.  Awards  In 2009, as part of the Q150 celebrations, Billabong was announced as one of the Q150 Icons of Queensland for its role as an iconic \\"innovation and invention\\". Teams Billabong sponsors teams of riders in different subcultures who play an ambassador-like role for both the brand and the corresponding lifestyle. As of 26 August 2013, a skateboard team is no longer listed on its website. Although surfing is continuing to gain popularity and therefore more money is being put into it and now Billabong sponsors hundreds of surfers.

The Japanese Association of Rosario (in Spanish, Asociaci√≥n Japonesa de Rosario, AJR; in Japanese, „É≠„Çµ„É™„Ç™Êó•Êú¨‰∫∫‰ºö Rosario Nihonjinkai) is a community devoted to the promotion of Japanese culture, located in Rosario, province of Santa Fe, Argentina. The Association was founded by immigrants from Japan and their descendants. History In 1920 a period of considerable Japanese immigration into Argentina began, with its peak in 1936 before World War II. Even before this date, more-or-less regular gatherings of Japanese people were organized at private houses. By 1918 a room was hired to serve as the seat of the nascent Association, opposite today's Central Post Office. In 1922 the AJR affiliated with the Japanese Association of Argentina. The seat of the AJR was moved then in 1933, 1938 and 1940. In 1940 World War II forced the AJR to dissolve. Yet some years later the Association re-assembled, this time with official status, acknowledged on 1 May 1949 by 50 members. Its authorities were: President Shiira Masateru, Vice-President Tomita Genkichi, and Secretary Teruya Toshio. The seat was located on 1240 Entre R√≠os St., home of Mr. Natsumoto Hideki. It was removed a few times afterwards, in 1951 and 1952. In 1953 the AJR proposed, agreed on, and funded the creation of a Pantheon for the deceased members, their families and the Japanese community in general. In 1957 a property at 1035 Iriondo St. was acquired. The seat of the Association was moved there in 1963, where it remains at present (2006). In the period that goes from 1968 to 1976 many works were done there: the construction of the Japanese Language School, the room for the housemaster, complete service infrastructure, a jud≈ç d≈çj≈ç, a gymnasium, a hall with a performing stage, etc. Activities The Japanese Association of Rosario provides facilities for a number of socio-cultural activities, such as classes of shod≈ç (brush calligraphy), origami, karate, and taiko drum playing, eisa dancing, and more prominently Japanese language classes. A large part of the structure is devoted to the Japanese Language School („É≠„Çµ„É™„Ç™Êó•Êú¨Ë™ûÂ≠¶Ê†° Rosario Nihongo Gakk≈ç), which has a teaching schedule compatible with international requirements, preparing students who wish to do so for the Japanese Language Proficiency Test. The school celebrates a yearly karaoke contest and a reading contest (whose selected winners may attend a national Japanese reading contest in Buenos Aires). The AJR has also hosted or sponsored picnics and sports contests, and participates representing Japan in the celebration devoted to the local immigrant communities (Encuentro y Fiesta Nacional de Colectividades), held in Rosario usually in November each year.

It consists of the village named San Juan La Laguna and three smaller aldeas (small villages) in the nearby mountain. The population is approximately 95% Tz'utujil. Agriculture is most important for the economy, with the service sector growing, especially as the number of tourists increase. The lowest elevation is the shore of Lago Atitl√°n at . The town is notably less popular among tourists and expats, as a local law prohibits outsiders from purchasing land within the municipality. Due to this, visitors to the town can enjoy a more \\"authentic\\" experience among the indigenous T'zutujil population. Local Economy San Juan La Laguna is similar to other towns along the lake, in that its population has traditionally subsisted off of the income from the fishing and agriculture industries. Before tourism came to the town around a decade ago, the women would be forced to climb the surrounding mountains to sell their textiles to other communities. Now, San Juan is home to Trama Textiles, a women's weaving co-op consisting of just over a dozen women who make textiles using the traditional Mayan art of backstrap loom weaving. As of 2020, they have partners all over the world who sell their good wholesale, casting a wide net for their products and profit. The fishing industry has taken a hit in recent years, with the lake's fish population steadily declining. This is in part due to the introduction of the non-native Black Bass 1958 in an attempt to attract more recreational fishing tourism. It has since caused disruption of the lake's natural ecosystem, causing the extinction of local bird and fish species. Most fishermen are still able to make a living by taking tourists out in their traditional boats, but worry about the future. The main crops of the area are the typical include the typical avocado, coffee, cacao, and corn, though the town is notably lacking in land due to the expropriation of it by the government in response to the global coffee trade boom in the mid-20th century. Ethnic History San Juan La Laguna is populated by an ethnic group called the Tz'utujil, one of 21 Maya ethnic groups. The Tz'utujil speak a language of the same name, Tz'utuijil, and share the coast of Lake Atitl√°n with another Maya ethnic group, the Kaqchikel. The Tz'utujil did not come to the region until the Late Postclassic period, during which they gained control of the entire lake. When the Kaqchikel arrived not long after, they were able to conquer some of the Tz'utujil territory due to their higher population numbers. In Pre-Columbian times, the Tz'utujil nation's capital was a town near Santiago Atitl√°n called Chuitinamit, which was conquered in 1523 by the Spanish conquistador, Pedro de Alvarado, with the help of the nearby Kaqchikel.[7] Today, the people of Santiago Atitl√°n claim to be the only portion of the Tz'utujil to speak the pure form of the language, which they refer to as \\"Ktz'oj'bal.\\" They claim that the townspeople of San Pedro La Laguna speak a dialect of Tz'utujil called \\"Pedrano,\\" while the inhabitants of San Juan La Laguna speak \\"Juanero.\\" [8] Post-Civil War The Guatemalan Civil War was fought between government forces and leftist rebels, the Revolutionary Organization of the People in Arms (ORPA) (Spanish: Organizaci√≥n Revolucionario del Pueblo en Armas). Spanning 36 years between 1960 and 1996, the war devastated the male population of Guatemala, leaving the women with few options to support themselves, their children, and the elderly. This is when the women's weaving cooperations of Guatemala sprouted into existence. San Juan hosts one such co- op, Trama Textiles, which employs just over a dozen women at any given time.

History A classically trained violinist, he began experimenting with electronic music aged 12, and gained his first drum and bass release in 1999. In the following years he released mostly for the legendary Moving Shadow imprint, and John B's Beta Recordings, having met John B at Durham University. After the completion of his philosophy degree, he went on to study an MA in electroacoustic composition at Durham. Perhaps unsurprisingly, his drum and bass grew increasingly experimental, and his debut LP (Pro Agonist, 2005) was released by Mike Paradinas' Planet Mu label, more commonly associated with the IDM scene. Unsatisfied with the possibilities of conventional DJing, Exile programmed his own performance tools (at first using Pure Data and running into difficulties, he then switched to Reaktor) to allow improvisational live sets, which led to official work for Native Instruments. In 2009 he contributed a cover of a Jamie Lidell song to the Warp20 (Recreated) compilation. He also toured the US in late 2009 supporting and collaborating live with Imogen Heap. In 2012, at Sonar Festival in Barcelona, he teamed up with Jamie Lidell, DJ Shiftee, Mr. Jimmy and Jeremy Ellis to form Mostly Robot, a new collaborative project.

It is related to similar rituals used on this day at other villages, in which the dogs were whipped or beaten. The ritual is thought to have pagan origins and was performed in order to prevent rabies. In dog spinning, a dog is suspended above water on a rope. The dog is turned repeatedly in a given direction to wind the rope, or is inserted into a loop of rope that has been twisted already. The dog is then released so that it spins rapidly in the opposite direction as the rope unwinds.  History  Historically the ritual was performed in many other parts of Bulgaria as well and although the exact practice varied regionally, e.g. whipping or beating the dogs instead of spinning them, it was performed on the same date and with the same goal. Reports of this type of ritual can be found as early as 1869.  Animal welfare concerns  The Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet reported protests at the Bulgarian Embassy in Stockholm about the cruelty of this tradition. These occurred as Bulgaria prepared to join the European Union in 2005. A reference in English is in a press release issued by the UK Green Party, issued on July 29, 2005. It includes a statement from Green Party MEP Caroline Lucas, vice- president of the RSPCA and the European Parliament's cross-party Animal Welfare Intergroup. Dr Lucas criticised it as being cruel to dogs, saying \\"Dog-spinning is a barbaric practice and must not be allowed to continue into the 21st century.\\" The \\"Sofia Echo\\" reported the practice in March 2011. The practice of the ritual was banned by the mayor of Tsarevo in 2006 after complaints by Bulgarian animal welfare organizations.–°–∏–≥–Ω–∞–ª –≤—ä–≤ –≤—Ä—ä–∑–∫–∞ —Å \\"—Ç—Ä–∏—á–∞–Ω–µ –Ω–∞ –∫—É—á–µ\\", 15.03.2005 (in Bulgarian) There have been reports of the practice continuing sporadically, and animal welfare organisations have tried to ensure this does not happen.

The school was founded in 1950 by the Marist Brothers originally in Canterbury Road, Camberwell, Victoria. A senior school campus was opened in Bulleen for years 9 to 12 with the Canterbury campus catering for years 4 to 8. With the school population growing the Junior School in Camberwell ceased accepting students in grades 4, 5 and 6 and took only Years 7 and 8. The college consolidated its campuses in 1993 and the Junior School was closed. Marcellin College is a member of the Associated Grammar Schools of Victoria (AGSV) and the Association of Marist Schools of Australia (AMSA). Marcellin College comes under the eastern region of Catholic Education Melbourne, the regional manager is Marwin Austerberry. History Marcellin College is a Catholic secondary school which was founded by the Marist Brothers to meet the educational needs of boys. Marcellin is owned and conducted by the Marist Brothers and it derives its inspiration from the traditions and spirit of the Brothers, the teachings of the Church and current educational theory and practice. The name Marcellin comes from the founder of the Marist Brothers, Saint Marcellin Champagnat. Marcellin Champagnat had very simple and yet rich directions for his schools. His schools were asked to provide opportunities for the young entrusted to their care and to encourage the students to develop their individual talents to the fullest. This is the challenge that Marist schools have endeavoured to meet for the past 200 years. The College motto is ‚Äì Virtute Ad Altissima, meaning ‚ÄòStrive for the highest with Virtue and Courage‚Äô. Student Leadership program There is an established Student Representative Council which allows students to be actively involved in various College matters to help organise functions and events relative to their student body. There is a SRC representative in each year level for each house for years 7 to 11. In year 12 there is a College Captain and two Vice Captains as well as House Captains and Vice Captains for their representative houses, who form the SRC Executive Committee. 2008 saw the introduction of various Academic Captains including LOTE and various Performing Arts Captains.

The Cathedral of San Salvador of Oviedo today displays an array of architectural styles, from Pre- Romanesque to Baroque, including Romanesque, Gothic and Renaissance parts. It began as a large Pre-Romanesque basilica in the present location of the Gothic cathedral, but nothing more is known about that first building, built by order of King Alfonso II of Asturias.  History  The cathedral was founded by King Fruela I of Asturias in 781 AD, and enlarged in 802 by his son Alfonso II of Asturias known as Alfonso the Chaste, who made Oviedo the capital of Kingdom of Asturias, and resided in Oviedo with his court. He created the See of Oviedo in 810. The present edifice was begun by Bishop Gutierre of Toledo in 1388, and the tower added by Cardinal Francisco Mendoza de Bobadilla in 1528. The cathedral was restored in the 12th century by Archbishop Pelagius of Oviedo, the chronicler. Bishop Fernando Alfonso (1296‚Äì1301) undertook another restoration of the chapter-house, and his successor, Fernando Alvarez (1302‚Äì1321), began the cloister. At the end of the 13th century Gutierre de Toledo began the new Gothic basilica, the principal chapel bearing his arms, though it was completed by his successor Guill√©n. Diego Ramirez de Guzm√°n (1421‚Äì41) built the two chapels of the south transept (now replaced by the sacristy), the old entrance to the church, and the gallery of the cloister adjoining the chapter-house. Alonzo de Palenzuela (1470‚Äì85) completed the other part of the transept. Juan Arias (1487‚Äì97) left his cognizance, the fleur-de-lys and four scallops, on the nave. Juan Daza (1497‚Äì1503) erected the grille of the choir; Valerano (1508‚Äì12) added the stained-glass windows. Diego de Muros, founder of the great college at Salamanca known as the Oviedo, had the crestings of the porch wrought by Pedro de Bunyeres and Juan de Cerecedo, while Giralte de Bruselas and Juan de Balmaseda completed in the years 1512 to 1517 the carving of the precious altarpiece ordered by Valeriano √ìrdo√±ez de Villaquir√°n. Crist√≥bal de Rojas (1546‚Äì56) affixed his coat-of-arms to the completed tower, with its octagonal pyramid, one of the marvels of Gothic architecture.  Building  The origins of Oviedo Cathedral date back to the late 8th century, when Asturian king Alfonso II of Asturias promoted the construction of a basilica at the core of the Kingdom of Asturias' newly- established royal court (regia sedes): what today conforms the oldest part of Oviedo's historic centre was then a political and religious complex that included a royal palace, several churches, monasteries, baths, stables, etc. This primitive basilica was consecrated to the Holy Saviour and the Apostles, and built in a typical pre-Romanesque Asturian style, with a straight-shaped sanctuary preceded by three aisles. In 910, the founding of the Kingdom of Le√≥n led to the translation of the royal court from its original location in Oviedo to the city of Le√≥n, at the southern side of the Cantabrian Mountains. However, the Oviedo settlement remained as an episcopal site, surrounded by a typical medieval town which would become an important stop in the northern branch of the Way of St. James. In this context, the old basilica founded by Alfonso II became a cathedral, undergoing successive changes during the Early and Late Middle Ages. The building known as C√°mara Santa (\\"Holy Chamber\\") is the most important surviving structure from the primitive pre-Romanesque royal complex: it is a two-story building with a rectangular plan, which shelters several burials in its lower floor and keeps a collection of royal treasures and relics in the upper floor, like the well-known Cross of the Angels (\\"Cruz de los √°ngeles\\") and the Victory Cross (\\"Cruz de la victoria\\"), both of them important symbols of the Asturian monarchy. During the 12th century, because of the constant flow of pilgrims and visitors, the C√°mara Santa was reformed: it was then when the aisle in the upper floor was decorated with an excellent group of late Romanesque column statues depicting the Apostles; additionally, a barrel vault was added, replacing the former ceiling made of wooden beams. Another Romanesque element is the \\"Torre Vieja\\" (\\"Old Tower\\"), a bell tower with pre-Romanesque foundations which was heightened with the addition of an arched gallery and a ribbed vault. Additionally, several archaeological evidences suggest the existence of a Romanesque cloister which would have preceded the current Gothic cloister. During the Late Middle Ages, Oviedo Cathedral underwent major changes, becoming the most important architectural workshop of Asturias: between ca. 1300‚Äì1550, the old pre-Romanesque basilica, as well as its presumed Romanesque premises, were demolished and replaced by a set of classic and flamboyant Gothic elements, including the chapter room, the cloister, the main chapel and the aisles, as well as the western facade and tower. The chapter room was probably built between 1293-1314: it is the cathedral's oldest Gothic structure, a diaphanous, square-plan hall covered by an eight-sided dome, under which several noble lineages decided to build their burials. The Gothic cloister was already a work in progress around 1300, although it wasn't finished until the mid-15th century: it was built thanks to the generous contributions of the Camara Santa's Brotherhood (established in 1344), several noble patrons and Castilian king Alfonso XI, as well as the money gathered by the bishop's tax collectors. It's a rectangular space surrounded by galleries, whose tracery windows reflect the evolution of the Gothic style, from early classic to late flamboyant. Portico of the cathedral At last, Oviedo episcopate decided to undertake the construction of a new church: this implied the gradual demolition of the old pre-Romanesque basilica, which was probably regarded as old fashioned and inconvenient. Bishop Gutierre de Toledo fostered the erection of his own private funerary chapel (destroyed during the Early Modern period) and the main chapel, a poligonal apse preceded by a square section: the late Gothic altarpiece and the Baroque ambulatory have modified the appearance of this sanctuary, whose walls were originally pierced by two levels of windows. The works evolved at a slow pace, and by 1451 only the main chapel had been concluded. However, during the second half of the 15th century this situation was reversed, and by 1500 both the transept and the three aisles were finished. According to some scholars, there must have existed a first, \\"general\\" draft inspired by certain French models, like the Bayonne Cathedral: in any case, this initial draft would be altered as the construction works progressed. By 1450, we find Nicol√°s de Bar and Nicol√°s de Bruselas, two master builders from Northern Europe, supervising the Oviedo workshop: apparently, it was during their direction when the new flamboyant style was introduced. After them, Spanish master builders Juan de Candamo (between 1458-1489) and Bartolom√© de Sol√≥rzano (between 1492-1498) assumed the direction of the cathedral workshop, building the central and side aisles, as well as the innovative vaults of the central aisle, with multiple ribs and detached tracery pieces. By 1500, the cathedral was almost finished, with exception of its western facade: that very year, master builder Juan de Badajoz \\"el Viejo\\" (\\"the Elder\\") became the new director of the episcopal workshop, starting the construction of a prominent narthex which would form a spacious passage, working as a covered street: it must be reminded that the original surroundings of Oviedo Cathedral were cluttered with houses, and the walkable areas were very narrow, so this street-like narthex provided an interesting, urbanistic solution. Initially, this narthex was going to be topped by two twin towers, but after 1507 the Oviedo episcopate decided to build only a tower, which would be erected over the narthex's Southern gate: despite traditional accounts, this decision did not respond to a lack of funds, because the cathedral was actually a well- financed workshop. Indeed, the erection of a huge, single bell tower instead of two smaller twin towers, was a popular solution during the Late Middle Ages in places like Southern Germany, Switzerland and the Atlantic coast of France. Oviedo Cathedral's magnificent tower was finished in 1551, after the consecutive intervention of master builders Pedro de Bueras, Pedro de la Tijera and Juan de Cerecedo \\"el Viejo\\" (\\"the Elder\\"): in 1575, lightning destroyed the original pierced spire, which was rebuilt by Rodrigo Gil de Honta√±√≥n combining Gothic and Renaissance elements. The main chapel's altarpiece, which combines statuary and paintings in a gilded, wooden frame, is an excellent example of the transition from Late Gothic to Renaissance. During the Early Modern period, Oviedo Cathedral received new additions, including the ambulatory (designed by Juan de Naveda and built in the first years of the 17th century), as well as the sacristy and several Baroque side chapels (Capilla de Santa B√°rbara, Capilla de los Vigiles, Capilla de Santa Eulalia de M√©rida). In the 18th century, the adjacent church of Santa Mar√≠a del Rey Casto‚Äîan old, pre-Romanesque basilica built by king Alfonso II as a funerary pantheon for the Asturian monarchy‚Äîwas torn down and replaced by a new, late Baroque chapel with exuberant decoration. The Early Modern period also saw the furnishing of the cathedral with several altarpieces. The major restoration of the cathedral complex was initiated with preliminary studies in 1995 at the request of the Principality of Asturias. Under the sponsorship of the Spanish National Plan for Cathedrals (), the complex was restored from 1998-2002 for a total budget of .  C√°mara Santa  The cathedral was also called Sancta Ovetensis; owing to quantity and quality of relics contained in the (). The Holy Chamber is the only surviving portion of the ancient high- medieval complex. It was built to keep such relics and treasures associated with the Asturian Monarchy as the Cross of the Angels, Victory Cross, and the Agate Box or Agate Casket. The chief feature of the cathedral is the \\"Camara Santa\\", with its venerable relics. Bishop Pelagius relates that the Agate Box, a coffer made by the disciples of the Apostles and containing the most precious relics of the Holy City, was taken from Jerusalem to Africa, and after residing in several locations was finally placed at Oviedo by Alfonso II. In the 16th century, Bishop Crist√≥bal de Sandoval y Rojas wished to open it, but could not, being overcome with religious fear.

He was the father of Monica Lovinescu, and the uncle of Horia Lovinescu, Vasile Lovinescu, and Anton Holban. He was elected to the Romanian Academy posthumously, in 1991. Biography Born in FƒÉlticeni, he was a graduate of the Boarding High School in Ia»ôi and of the University of Bucharest's Faculty of Classical Languages, and briefly worked as a highschool teacher of Latin in Ploie≈üti. He made his literary debut in the literary supplement of AdevƒÉrul, and became permanently featured in the periodical Epoca, as the author of pieces on SƒÉmƒÉnƒÉtorul writers (such as Mihail Sadoveanu, Ion Ag√¢rbiceanu, and Octavian Goga). At the time, Lovinescu was already taking a stand which would lead to the prolonged disputes with Nicolae Iorga and Garabet IbrƒÉileanu. He obtained his doctorate in Paris for his work on Jean-Jacques Weiss, and an additional history on the accounts 19th century French travelers gave of Greece. Both were praised by √âmile Faguet. In 1936, his candidacy for acceptance into the Romanian Academy was refused. Lovinescu was posthumously elected to the Romanian Academy. Views Building on the legacy of Titu Maiorescu, Lovinescu aimed to show that both the author and critic are never cut out from their social and cultural environments. He opposed Garabet IbrƒÉileanu's theory of selection (the compromise between individual genius and social requirement), proposing instead the idea that creation and demand occupy the very same moment in time. Lovinescu's analysis was backed by the views of Faguet, Jules Lema√Ætre, as well as Gabriel Tarde's notion of a group mind; it also adhered to the esthetical tenets of Impressionism. The main advocate of Modernism, Lovinescu rejected the preoccupation of Poporanism and the SƒÉmƒÉnƒÉtorul group had with rural themes, arguing in favour of novels with an urban setting. His SburƒÉtorul published works by a new generation of writers, realists to symbolists to early avant- garde: Camil Petrescu, Ion Barbu, Tudor Vianu, Liviu Rebreanu, Benjamin Fondane, Ilarie Voronca, Hortensia Papadat-Bengescu, and many others. The polemic with SƒÉmƒÉnƒÉtorul extended over decades: Lovinescu is also remembered for his rejection of Nicolae Iorga's thesis on the origin of the Romanian reignant Princes as an institution in Wallachia and Moldavia. While Iorga claimed that they had been a creation of peasant communities delegating power to their most able members, in a regional sphere that would have been virtually cut off from the rest of Europe, Lovinescu pointed out that some of the very first voivodes mentioned seemed to have been perfectly familiar with feudal relations, and well-integrated in European culture (for example, he pointed out that works at Curtea de Arge≈ü Monastery had unearthed the remains of a hospodar dressed in accordance with European fashion of the time).

The data are usually collected over time and over the same individuals and then a regression is run over these two dimensions. Multidimensional analysis is an econometric method in which data are collected over more than two dimensions (typically, time, individuals, and some third dimension). A common panel data regression model looks like y_{it}=a+bx_{it}+\\\\varepsilon_{it}, where y is the dependent variable, x is the independent variable, a and b are coefficients, i and t are indices for individuals and time. The error \\\\varepsilon_{it} is very important in this analysis. Assumptions about the error term determine whether we speak of fixed effects or random effects. In a fixed effects model, \\\\varepsilon_{it} is assumed to vary non-stochastically over i or t making the fixed effects model analogous to a dummy variable model in one dimension. In a random effects model, \\\\varepsilon_{it} is assumed to vary stochastically over i or t requiring special treatment of the error variance matrix. Panel data analysis has three more-or-less independent approaches: *independently pooled panels; *random effects models; *fixed effects models or first differenced models. The selection between these methods depends upon the objective of the analysis, and the problems concerning the exogeneity of the explanatory variables.  Independently pooled panels  Key assumption: There are no unique attributes of individuals within the measurement set, and no universal effects across time.  Fixed effect models  Key assumption: There are unique attributes of individuals that do not vary across time. These attributes may or may not be correlated with the individual dependent variables. To test whether fixed effects, rather than random effects, is needed, the (Durbin-Wu-)Hausman test can be used.  Random effect models  Key assumption: There are unique, time constant attributes of individuals that are not correlated with the individual regressors. Pooled OLS can be used to derive unbiased and consistent estimates of parameters even when time constant attributes are present, but random effects will be more efficient. Fixed effects is a feasible generalised least squares technique which is asymptotically more efficient than Pooled OLS when time constant attributes are present. Random effects adjusts for the serial correlation which is induced by unobserved time constant attributes.  Dynamic panel models  In contrast to the standard panel data model, a dynamic panel model also includes lagged values of the dependent variable as regressors. For example, including one lag of the dependent variable generates: :y_{it}=a+bx_{it}+\\\\rho y_{it-1}+\\\\varepsilon_{it} The assumptions of the fixed effect and random effect models are violated in this setting.
