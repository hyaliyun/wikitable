In November 2010, Brown joined Wynn Resorts, Ltd in advance of the organization's multibillion- dollar Cotai Strip Macau project. In November 2014 Brown was named president and CEO of Imperial Pacific Ltd's $7.1 Billion casino resort project in Saipan.http://www.asiagamblingbrief.com/intelligence/latest- headlines/3062-former-nagacorp-coo-mark-brown-to-head-saipan-casino Biography Mark Anthony Brown was raised in Brigantine, New Jersey and entered the gaming industry in the late 1970s at Atlantic City's Resorts International. By age 25, Brown was married with two sons and was quickly rising through industry ranks. After a long tenure as CEO of Trump Hotels, in 2005 Brown exercised a clause in his contract that allowed him to leave with a golden parachute if Donald Trump ever owned less than 35% of the company. He then moved to Macau (SAR of PRC) to lead the largest project in gaming industry history with the Sands Corporation. Brown served as CEO for Imperial Pacific gaming project in the United States territory of Saipan, with an exclusive gaming license and project scope of US$7.1 Billion. The initial phase of the project has broken US records for casino volume, with US$3.95 Billion in VIP gaming turnover during the month of September 2016. He retired in early January 2018. Management style In top industry circles, Brown is known for his ability to dominate through forthright and efficient communication. Employees have been quoted referring to Brown as ‚Äúa tremendous communicator.\\" ‚ÄúI rely on a few key people to keep me informed. They know I trust them‚Ä¶ when I need to know something‚Ä¶ I know I can call up Mark Brown‚Ä¶‚Äù said Donald Trump. Some feel Brown's greatest asset is his ability to relate to all forms of people. Despite an intimidating presence, Brown is friendly and down to earth, known for treating all employees equally. Brown has been quoted many times saying ‚ÄòWe can all throw our employee name tags into the ocean‚Äô, expressing his deep belief that all employees are of equal importance and should all be treated with the utmost respect.

Function  RGS14 is a member of the regulator of G protein signalling family. This protein contains one RGS domain, two Raf- like Ras-binding domains (RBDs), and one GoLoco motif. The protein attenuates the signaling activity of G-proteins by binding, through its GoLoco domain, to specific types of activated, GTP-bound G alpha subunits. Acting as a GTPase activating protein (GAP), the protein increases the rate of conversion of the GTP to GDP. This hydrolysis allows the G alpha subunits to bind G beta/gamma subunit heterodimers, forming inactive G-protein heterotrimers, thereby terminating the signal. Alternate transcriptional splice variants of this gene have been observed but have not been thoroughly characterized. Increasing the expression of the RGS14 protein in the V2 secondary visual cortex of mice promotes the conversion of short-term to long-term object-recognition memory.

In influenza virus-infected cells, the NS1 protein is physically associated with cleavage and polyadenylation specific factor 4, 30kD subunit.

The protein encoded by this gene is a receptor for opioid growth factor (OGF), also known as [Met(5)]-enkephalin. The endogenous ligand is thus a known opioid peptide, and OGFr was originally discovered and named as a new opioid receptor zeta (Œ∂). However it was subsequently found that it shares little sequence similarity with the other opioid receptors, and has quite different function.  Function  The natural function of this receptor appears to be in regulation of tissue growth, and it has been shown to be important in embryonic development, wound repair, and certain forms of cancer. OGF is a negative regulator of cell proliferation and tissue organization in a variety of processes. The encoded unbound receptor for OGF has been localized to the outer nuclear envelope, where it binds OGF and is translocated into the nucleus. The coding sequence of this gene contains a polymorphic region of 60 nt tandem imperfect repeat units. Several transcripts containing between zero and eight repeat units have been reported.  Mechanism of activation  The opioid growth factor receptor consists of a chain of 677 amino acids, which includes a nuclear localization sequence region. When OGF binds to the receptor, an OGF-OGFr complex is formed, which leads to the increase in the synthesis of the selective cyclin- dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor proteins, p12 and p16. Retinoblastoma protein becomes activated through the phosphorylation from CDKs, and leads to the progression of the cell cycle from the G1 phase to the S phase. Because the activation of the OGF receptor, blocks the phosphorylation of retinoblastmoa proteins, retardation of the G1 phase occurs, which prevents the cell from further dividing.  Therapeutic applications  Upregulation of OGFr and consequent stimulation of the OGF-OGFr system are important for the anti- proliferative effects of imidazoquinoline drugs like imiquimod and resiquimod, which are immune response modifiers with potent antiviral and antitumour effects, used as topical creams for the treatment of skin cancers and warts.  Structure  OGF contains a conserved N-terminal domain followed by a series of imperfect repeats.

Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.  Function  This gene is a member of the CLC family of voltage-gated chloride channels. The encoded protein is predicted to have 12 transmembrane domains, and requires a beta subunit called barttin to form a functional channel. It is thought to function in salt reabsorption in the kidney and potassium recycling in the inner ear. The gene is highly similar to CLCNKB, which is located 10 kb downstream from this gene.  Gene variants  CLCNKA encodes one of the two major chloride channels found in the kidney, the ClC-Ka channel (the other class being the ClC-Kb from CLCNKB). The CLCNKA gene is subject, like all genes, to variation due to single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), in which a single base (A, T, C, or G) is randomly replaced by another base. SNPs in the coding regions of CLCKNA may have consequent changes in the amino acid sequence of the ClC-Ka chloride channel leading to altered functional capacities and subsequent physiological alterations. Four SNPs (rs848307, rs1739843, rs1010069, and rs1805152) have been associated with increased salt-sensitivity by displaying an irregularly large increase in blood pressure following modest salt (Na+) intake, despite regular heart rate, blood pressure, and plasma renin levels before the salt ingestion. Of particular interest is a common SNP leading to the amino acid Arginine at the 83rd position to be replaced by Glycine. This variant is found to exist in approximately half of all caucasians, while a quarter of caucasians are homozygous for the allele. Although mainly studied in the context of caucasians, the SNP actually exists with a greater frequency in people of African descent, where the gene frequency is 70%. This SNP (rs10927887) was originally implicated in congestive heart failure after investigations into the heat shock protein HSPB7 showed that the CLCNKA gene was in linkage disequilibrium, meaning that the two genes are often not separated during recombination. The CLCNKA variant was then shown to be the cause of the pathology.  Pathology  The four SNPs found to be associated with salt sensitivity consequently predispose such cardiovascular problems as left ventricular hypertrophy and dysfunction of the endothelium. The Arg83Gly SNP specifically results in a large reduction in the flow of chloride ions through the ClC-Ka channel in the thin and thick ascending limb of the nephrons. Experimentally, the membrane potential at which the channels show no net movement of ions at a given chloride concentration drops significantly with the mutation, indicating altered function in situ. This manifests as a chronic salt wasting disorder similar to Bartter syndrome, as sodium reabsorption is coupled with chloride reabsorption. The salt loss results in a decreased blood volume and consequently hyperreninemia leading (via the end product angiotensin II and aldosterone) to increased vascular tone, heart rate, water reabsorption, and blood pressure, collectively referred to as cardiorenal syndrome. Being heterozygous for this Arg83Gly variant increases the risk of heart failure by 27%, while homozygosity increases the risk by 54%. The additive stress on the heart from increased blood pressure and heart rate often only manifests as a pathology with an additional cardiovascular problem such as hypertension. Treatment for the SNP associated hyperreninemia involves drugs to block the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone system to relieve the aforementioned stresses on the heart.

Function  DMRT1 is a dose sensitive transcription factor protein that regulates Sertoli cells and germ cells. The DMRT1 gene is located at the end of the 9th chromosome. This gene is found in a cluster with two other members of the gene family, having in common a zinc finger-like DNA-binding motif (DM domain). The DM domain is an ancient, conserved component of the vertebrate sex-determining pathway that is also a key regulator of male development in flies and nematodes, and is found to be the key sex-determining factor in chickens. The majority of DMRT1 protein is located in the testicular cord and Sertoli cells, with a small amount in the germ cells. This gene exhibits a gonad-specific and sexually dimorphic expression pattern, just like the related doublesex gene in fruit flies. Defective testicular development and XY feminization occur when this gene is hemizygous. Two copies of the DMRT1 gene are required for normal sexual development. When a DMRT1 gene is lost, the most common disease is chromosome 9p deletion, which causes abnormal testicular formation and feminization. The DMRT1 gene is critical for male sex determination; without this gene the default female characteristic takes over and male characteristic is slight or non-existent. When DMRT1 is knocked out in mice, the mice showed changes in both Sertoli and germ cells soon after formation of the gonadal ridge. The main defects associated with DMRT1 knockout were developmental arrest, excess proliferation of germ cells, and failure to undergo meiosis, mitosis, or migration. Thus, the knockout model shows that loss of the DMRT1 gene is associated with incomplete germ cell development leading to infertility, abnormal testicular formation, and/or feminization of the affected individual. Induced knockout of DMRT1 in adult male mice has been found to cause transdifferentiation of somatic cells in the testis to the equivalent cell types that would ordinarily be found in the ovary. Conversely, conditional expression of DMRT1 in the gonad of female mice caused the apparent transdifferentiation of ovarian somatic (granulosa) cells to the equivalent cell type (Sertoli) ordinarily found in males.

In humans, it is encoded by the USP18 gene. USP18 is induced by the immune response to type I and III interferons, and serves as a negative regulator of type I interferon, but not type III interferon. Loss of USP18 results in increased responsiveness to type I interferons and life-threatening autoinflammatory disease in humans due to the negative regulatory function of USP18 in interferon signal transduction. Independent of this activity, USP18 is also a member of the deubiquitinating protease family of enzymes. It is known to remove ISG15 conjugates from a broad range of protein substrates, a process known as deISGylation.  Structure  The USP18 gene consists of 11 exons that encode a 43 kDa protein. The USP18 protein adopts the characteristic hand-like structure of ubiquitin- specific-proteases (USPs), which consists of a finger, palm and thumb domain. At the interface of the palm and thumb domain lies the catalytic site composed of the cysteine protease triad (cysteine, a histidine and an aspartate or asparagine). The C-terminus of USP18 is primarily responsible for negative regulation of interferon-I signaling.  Function  Following its induction by type I interferons (IFN-Is), USP18 carries out three functional interactions: = Regulation of IFN-I signaling = USP18 inhibits IFN-I signaling by disrupting the receptor complex and the subsequent JAK-STAT signaling pathway. USP18 binds the IFN-receptor 2 subunit (IFNAR2), leading to the displacement of Janus kinase 1. and the dissociation of the cytokine- receptor complex. This process requires STAT2 to traffic USP18 to the receptor These events terminate signaling and draw cells into a refractory state with diminished sensitivity to future stimulation. = deISGylation = Using the isopeptidase domain, USP18 specifically deconjugates ISG15 (interferon- stimulated gene 15) from tagged proteins. This reaction is termed deISGylation, as the initial conjugation of ISG15 to newly-synthesized proteins is termed ISGylation, a process akin to ubiquitination. However, unlike other de-ubiquitinating enzymes, USP18 is specific to ISG15, and exhibits no cross-reactivity with ubiquitin. The consequences of ISGylation and deISGylation are incompletely understood. = Stabilization = USP18 is stabilized by ISG15, but independently of the ubiquitin-like conjugation. Without ISG15-mediated stabilization, USP18 is degraded at the proteasome. This relationship exists in human, canine and porcine USP18/ISG15, but is absent in murine systems.  Clinical significance  USP18-deficiency is a very rare primary immunodeficiency caused by mutations of the USP18 gene. The inheritance is autosomal recessive. The clinical disease presents in the perinatal period with life-threatening autoinflammation that mimics TORCH infections, but in the absence of infection. The severe inflammation results from a failure to regulate type I IFN activity, and is therefore considered a type I interferonopathy. This syndrome was initially described to result in death within weeks of birth. Fortunately, this previously-lethal condition was recently demonstrated to be curable with a Janus kinase inhibitor and intensive supportive care.

In other organisms, similar proteins may be involved in the establishment of cardiac smooth muscle cell diversity.  Role in development  Gata5 is a transcription factor. Gata5 regulates the proper development of the heart. Early in embryo development, Gata5 helps in making sure that there are enough heart muscle precursor cells produced to differentiate into the final myocardial cells. It also regulates other genes that are crucial to successful heart development. As pregnancy progresses, Gata 5 is involved in the specification of the heart tissue that becomes the ventricles. Problems can arise when Gata5 is overexpressed. This overexpression can lead to ectopic foci. Ectopic foci are also known as ectopic pacemakers. They are bundles of cells that can cause cardiac pacing that are located in places in the heart where they're not supposed to be. These cells can become excited before the heart is supposed to be excited. This causes the heart to beat and thus contract before it should. Oftentimes, this is not a big deal and the heart naturally reverts to its normal pacing. However, if it's caused by problems with development in the heart ‚Äì if Gata5 did not express properly in the embryo- then this can lead to constant ectopic foci problems. These problems include tachycardia (the heart beating too fast), bradycardia (the heart beating too slow), or ventricular fibrillation which is a serious condition where the ventricles of the heart aren't pumping consistently and can't get blood out to the body.

EMP3 is a member of the peripheral myelin protein gene family 22-kDa (PMP22), which is mainly responsible for the formation of the sheath of compact myelin. Although the detailed functions and mechanisms of EMP3 still remain unclear, it is suggested that EMP3 is possibly epigenetically linked to certain carcinomas.  Structure  The EMP3 structure based on the 163-amino acid sequence. Four yellow helices represent four transmembrane domains. EMP3 is a protein composed of a 163-amino acid sequence, which is expressed from its gene located on the band of the 19q13.3 in the Homo sapiens chromosome. EMP3 has the highest expression in the peripheral blood leukocytes compared to the expression in other body tissues. The protein is characterized by 4 transmembrane domains and two N-linked glycosylation sites in the first extracellular loop.  Function  EMP3 is a transmembrane protein which participates in cell to cell interaction and cell proliferation. Overexpression and silencing of EMP3 both interrupt the normal expression of the EMP3 gene, which induces the progression (and formation) of cancers. Based on these properties of EMP3 and the prognostic analyses on several types of tumors and cancers, EMP3 has a tumor-suppressor-like role in regulating differentiation, apoptosis and development of cancer cells. However, the detailed mechanism still needs to be investigated. = Tumorgenesis and carcinogenesis =  Primary breast carcinomas  The detailed functions as well as the mechanism of EMP3 in the development of various carcinomas have remained unclear. However, it was found that the levels of expression of EMP3 mRNA have a positive correlation in primary breast carcinomas. According to the study, EMP3 mRNA has a higher level of expression in the carcinoma compared to normal breast tissues. The overexpression of EMP3 has a significant correlation with histological grade III, lymph node metastasis, and strong Her-2 expression. Additionally, the hypermethylation on the promoter region of EMP3 has appeared in about 35% of the studies breast carcinoma cases. However, higher EMP3 expression levels occur in patients with both types of breast carcinomas, regardless of the promoter regions of EMP3 being hypermethylated or unmethylated.  Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)  Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which is mainly caused by the chronic infections of hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus, become one of the major causes of cancer mortality worldwide in the recent years. EMP3 expression in HCC tumor cells has a higher expression level than that it does in normal tissues at similar regions of the liver. It was also found that the HCC patients who have a relatively lower histological grade inversely possess a higher level of expression in EMP3. Then, the researchers found that knockdown (gene silencing) of EMP3 resulted in reduction of cell proliferation and arrest of cell cycle, which suggests a potential role of EMP3 in tumor- suppressing.  Brain cancer  EMP3 is found to play a large role in the progression of neuroblastomas and glioblastomas, which are two of the most common types of brain cancers. Both have fast carinogenesis result in a high rate of mortality. EMP3 is proposed as an oncogene whose overexpression in the progression correlated with glioblastoma (GBM). Reduction in EMP3 expression in CD44-high GBM cell lines promotes apoptosis of the cancer cell lines and disables potential tumorigenesis. One of the signaling activation pathway involving EMP3 in the progression of glioblastoma was identified in 2016. The pathway was identified as TGF-Œ≤/Smad2/3 signaling, in which the unregulated TGF-Œ≤ signaling promotes tumorigenesis in various human cells, especially CD44-high glioma cells. The interaction between EMP3 and the receptor of TGF-Œ≤ regulate the TGF-Œ≤/Smad2/3 signaling activation, which eventually suppresses cell proliferation and weakens tumorigenesis in glioblastoma.  Clinical significance  Due to the controversial effects of EMP3 on tumor suppression, the applicable treatments for certain carcinomas related to EMP3 are still unvalidated in humans. However, some animal experiments have showed a positive result on suppressing the tumorous tissues by modifying the EMP3 gene.

Function  Homeobox-containing genes are thought to have a role in controlling development. In Drosophila, the engrailed (en) gene plays an important role during development in segmentation, where it is required for the formation of posterior compartments. Different mutations in the mouse homologs, En1 and En2, produced different developmental defects that frequently are lethal. The human engrailed homologs 1 and 2 encode homeodomain-containing proteins and have been implicated in the control of pattern formation during development of the central nervous system. Engrailed (En) 1 is a homeobox gene that helps primarily regulate development in the dorsal midbrain and anterior hindbrain (cerebellum and colliculi) of humans. The expression of En1 is regulated until 13 days after fertilization by Fgf8, which controls the development of the forebrain and hindbrain. En1 is first expressed in this region on day 9.5 after fertilization for about 12 hours until En2 is expressed. After En2 expression, En1 is expressed again in other tissues such as somites and limb ectoderm throughout development. A knockout mouse model with the En1 homeobox deleted was developed; mice died less than 24 hours after birth because they refused to feed, although they had the physical ability. The brains of the mice were studied and most of the cerebellum, colliculi, and cranial nerves 3 and 4 were missing. There was clear deletion in the mid-hindbrain, isthmus, junction region that began at day 9.5 after fertilization.

Maitra was considered an influential figure in 20th century sarod playing and received the title Sangeetacharya. He was among those awarded the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award in 1971. Radhika Mohan Maitra came from a Bengali zamindar family that had a history of musicianship and of patronising that art. His grandfather, Lalit Mohan Maitra, was a player of the tabla, his father, Brajendra Mohan, played the sarod, and his mother learned the sitar. Among those who were patronised by his grandfather was Mohammed Amir Khan and it was he who acted as the guru and principal teacher of Radhika, although the pupil also learned other instruments and styles of music with his permission. In addition to his musical training, Maitra held an M.A. degree in philosophy, awarded by the University of Calcutta, and also a LL.B. law degree. He taught philosophy for a while and was also a noted musicologist with several books to his name. Maitra rose to prominence as a musician in the 1950s, when he was in demand for concerts both within India and elsewhere in the world. Aside from radio recitals, he performed in countries such as Afghanistan, Australia, China, New Zealand and the Philippines as part of cultural delegations organised by the Government of India, and he also performed in a non-government tour of the USA in 1975. It was from around that time that he gradually reduced his appearances, preferring instead to concentrate on teaching both the sarod and the sitar. His students were often obtained by a referral method, whereby a potential new pupil was introduced by someone who was already being taught by Maitra. Sometimes he would teach directly, and other times he would delegate the task to a student. In July 1944, Maitra married Lalita Chaudhuri, a lady from the \\"royal family\\" of Sushang.

Function  The Fanconi anemia complementation group (FANC) currently includes FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, FANCD1 (also called BRCA2), FANCD2, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG, and FANCL. Fanconi anemia is a genetically heterogeneous recessive disorder characterized by cytogenetic instability, hypersensitivity to DNA crosslinking agents, increased chromosomal breakage, and defective DNA repair. The members of the Fanconi anemia complementation group do not share sequence similarity; they are related by their assembly into a common nuclear protein complex. This gene encodes the protein for complementation group B. Alternative splicing results in two transcript variants encoding the same protein.  Gene  FANCB is the only gene known to cause X-linked Fanconi Anemia. In female carriers of FANCB mutations (one wild-type FANCB allele and one mutant FANCB allele) there is strong selection through X-inactivation for expression of only the wild-type allele. In contrast, males have only one FANCB allele. Only male patients with Fanconi anemia have ever been linked to FANCB mutations, and they make up about 4% of cases.  Protein  The FANCB gene product is FANCB protein. FANCB is a component of a \\"core complex\\" of nine Fanconi Anemia proteins: FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG, FANCL, FAAP100 and FAAP20. The core complex localises to DNA damage sites during DNA replication where it catalyzes transfer of ubiquitin to FANCD2 and FANCI. In particular, this reaction is necessary for the repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks, such as those formed by chemotherapy drugs cisplatin, mitomycin c and melphalan. Within the Fanconi anemia core complex, FANCB has an obligate interaction with FAAP100 and FANCL, to form a catalytic E3 RING ligase enzyme. FANCB creates a dimer interface within this subcomplex that is required for simultaneous ubiquitination of FANCD2 and FANCI. Electron microscopy imaging of the FANCB-FANCL-FAAP100 complex revealed a symmetry that is centred on FANCB, and biochemical investigation confirmed that the entire complex is a dimer containing two of each subunit. Further imaging reveals the overall architecture of the Fanconi Anemia core complex centres on FANCB protein. Meiosis FANCB mutant mice are infertile and exhibit primordial germ cell defects during embryogenesis. The germ cells and testicular size are severely compromised in FANCB mutant mice. FANCB protein is essential for spermatogenesis and likely has a role in the activation of the Fanconi anemia DNA repair pathway during meiosis.

Function  This gene is an ortholog of the Drosophila fat gene, which encodes a tumor suppressor essential for controlling cell proliferation during Drosophila development. The gene product is a member of the cadherin superfamily, a group of integral membrane proteins characterized by the presence of cadherin-type repeats. This gene is expressed at high levels in a number of fetal epithelia. Transcript variants derived from alternative splicing and/or alternative promoter usage exist, but they have not been fully described. The murine Fat1 knockout mouse is not embryonically lethal but pups die within 48-hours due to the abnormal fusion of foot processes of the podocytes within the kidney. These Fat1 knockout mice also showed partially penetrant but often severe midline defects including holoprosencephaly, microphthalmia-anophthalmia and in rare cases cyclopia. It has been shown that the EVH motifs in the cytoplasmic tail of mouse Fat1 interact with Ena/VASP and ablation of Fat1 by RNAi leads to decreased cell migration of rat epithelial cells The cytoplasmic tail of Fat1 has also been shown to bind the transcriptional repressor Atrophin in rat vascular smooth muscle cells At the carboxyl terminus of FAT1 lies a PDZ domain (PSD95/Dlg1/ZO-1) ligand motif (-HTEV). Zebrafish Fat1 was found to bind the protein scribble and regulate Hippo signalling Using the human SHSY5Y cell line as a model of neuronal differentiation, human FAT1 was shown to regulate Hippo kinase components with loss of FAT1 leading to nucleocytoplasmic relocation of TAZ and enhanced transcription of the Hippo target gene CTGF. The same study also showed FAT1 was able to regulate TGF-beta signaling FAT1 has been found to bind beta- catenin and regulate Wnt-signaling in colorectal cancer.  Structure  The human FAT1 cadherin gene was cloned in 1995 from a human T-leukemia (T-ALL) cell line and consists of 27 exons located on chromosome 4q34‚Äì35. Structurally the FAT1 protein is a single pass transmembrane protein with the extracellular portion consisting of 34 cadherin repeats, 5 EGF-like domains and a laminin-G like domain. The FAT1 protein once translated undergoes furin mediated S1 cleavage forming a non-covalent heterodimer before achieving cell surface expression although this processing is often perturbed in cancer cells which express non-cleaved FAT1 on the cell surface. FAT1 cadherin is multiply phosphorylated on its ectodomain but phosphorylation is not catalysed by FJX1. The ectodomain of FAT1 can also be shed from the cell surface by the sheddase ADAM10, with release of this ectodomain a possible new biomarker in pancreatic cancer. FAT1 has also been found to undergo alternative splicing in breast cancer cells undergoing epithelial-to-mesenchymal (EMT) transition with the addition of 12 amino acids in the cytoplasmic tail. Similar splice variants have also been described for murine Fat1 where alternative splicing of the cytoplasmic tail regulated cell migration.  Clinical significance  = Cancer = The FAT1 cadherin has been ascribed both as putative tumour suppressor or oncogene in different contexts.

Interphase  Structure of PDS5B (blue), WAPL (green) and IP6 (PDB 5HDT) (Ouyang et al., 2016) Cohesin loading begins in telophase and is mediated by NIPBL and its binding partner MAU2. In G1, WAPL forms a complex with PDS5 and removes cohesin from the DNA but it is reloaded by NIPBL-MAU2. The equilibrium between loading and release give cohesin a DNA residence time of 20 minutes. During DNA replication, a fraction of cohesin is acetylated and binds to Sororin making it resistant to WAPL and able to hold sister chromatids together. This is crucial for the maintenance of sister chromatid cohesion because onse the sister chromatids are separated, cohesion cannot be reestablished.  Prophase pathway  When a cell enters mitosis, Sororin is phosphorylated causing it to dissociate from cohesin meaning WAPL can remove cohesin from the DNA. A complex of SGOL1 and PP2A dephosphorylates cohesin at the centromere protecting it from WAPL-mediated release. Sister chromatid cohesion is therefore maintained at the centromeres where it is required for mitosis but lost on the arms. This removal of cohesin is known as the Prophase Pathway and results in the X-shape sister chromatids observed in chromosome spreads.  Mechanism  WAPL releases cohesin from DNA by opening the SMC3-RAD21 interface thereby allowing DNA to pass out of the ring. Opening of this interface is regulated by ATP-binding by the SMC subunits. This causes the ATPase head domains to dimerise and deforms the coiled coil of SMC3 therefore disrupting the binding of RAD21 to the coiled coil. It is not known how WAPL regulates the process of ATP binding.

Function  GABA is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain where it acts at GABAA receptors, which are ligand-gated chloride channels. Chloride conductance of these channels can be modulated by agents such as benzodiazepines that bind to the GABAA receptor. At least 16 distinct subunits of GABA-A receptors have been identified. GABA receptors are composed of 5 subunits with an extracellular ligand binding domains and ion channel domains that are integral to the membrane. Ligand binding to these receptors activates the channel.  Subunit selective ligands  Recent research has produced several ligands that are selective for GABAA receptors containing the Œ±3 subunit. Subtype-selective agonists for Œ±3 produce anxiolytic effects without sedative, amnesia, or ataxia. selective a3 agonists also show lack of dependence, and could make them superior to currently marketed drugs. = Agonists = * Adipiplon * PWZ-029 (partial agonist at Œ±3, partial inverse agonist at Œ±5) * TP003 (Selective full agonist at Œ±3) = Inverse agonists = * Œ±3IA  RNA editing  The GABRA3 transcript undergoes pre-mRNA editing by the ADAR family of enzymes. A-to-I editing changes an isoleucine codon to code for a methionine residue. This editing is thought to be important for brain development, as the level of editing is low at birth and becomes almost 100% in an adult brain. The editing occurs in an RNA stem-loop found in exon 9. The structured loci was identified using a specialised bioinformatics screen of the human genome. The proposed function of the edit is to alter chloride permeability of the GABA receptor. At the time of discovery, Kv1.1 mRNA was the only previously known mammalian coding site containing both the edit sequence and the editing complementary sequence. = Type = A to I RNA editing is catalyzed by a family of adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) that specifically recognize adenosines within double-stranded regions of pre-mRNAs and deaminate them to inosine. Inosines are recognised as guanosine by the cells translational machinery. There are three members of the ADAR family ADARs 1‚Äì3, with ADAR1 and ADAR2 being the only enzymatically active members. ADAR3 is thought to have a regulatory role in the brain. ADAR1 and ADAR 2 are widely expressed in tissues, while ADAR3 is restricted to the brain. The double- stranded regions of RNA are formed by base-pairing between residues in the close to region of the editing site, with residues usually in a neighboring intron but can be an exonic sequence. The region that base pairs with the editing region is known as an Editing Complementary Sequence (ECS). = Location = The editing site was previously believed to be a single nucleotide polymorphism. The editing site is found at amino acid 5 of transmembrane domain 3 of exon 9. The predicted double-stranded RNA structure is interrupted by three bulges and a mismatch at the editing site. The double- stranded region is 22 base pairs in length. As with editing of the KCNA1 gene product, the editing region and the editing complementary sequence are both found in exonic regions. In the pre=mRNA of GABRA3, both are found within exon 9. The other subunits of the receptor are thought not to be edited, as their predicted secondary structure is less likely to be edited. Also, alpha subunits 1 and 6 have a uridine instead of an adenosine at the site corresponding to the editing site in alpha subunit 3. Point mutation experiments determined that a Cytidine 15 nucleotides from the editing site is the base opposite the edited base. Using a GABRA3 mini-gene that encodes for exon 9 cotransfected to HEK293 cells with either ADAR1 or -2 or none, it was determined that both active ADARs can efficiently edited the site in exon 9. = Regulation = The mRNA expression of the alpha 3 subunit is developmentally regulated. It is the dominant subunit in the forebrain tissue at birth, gradually decreasing in prominence as alpha subunit 1 takes over. Also experiments with mice have demonstrated that editing of pre-mRNA alpha 3 subunit increases from 50% at birth to nearly 100% in adult. Editing levels are lower in the hippocampus = Conservation = At the location corresponding to the I/M site of GABRA3 in frog and pufferfish there is a genomically encoded methionine. In all other species, there is an isoleucine at the position. = Consequences =  Structure  Editing results in a codon change from (AUA) I to (AUG) M at the editing site. This results in translation of a methionine instead of an isoleucine at the I/M site. The amino acid change occurs in the transmembrane domain 3. The 4 transmembrane domains of each of the 5 subunits that make up the receptor interact to form the receptor channel. It is likely that the change of amino acids disturbs the structure, effecting gating and inactivation of the channel. This is because methionine has a larger side chain.  Function  While the effect of editing on protein function is unknown, the developmental increase in editing does correspond to changes in function of the GABAA receptor. GABA binding leads to chloride channel activation, resulting in rapid increase in concentration of the ion. Initially, the receptor is an excitatory receptor, mediating depolarisation (efflux of Cl‚àí ions) in immature neurons before changing to an inhibitory receptor, mediating hyperpolarisation (influx of Cl‚àí ions) later on. GABAA converts to an inhibitory receptor from an excitatory receptor by the upregulation of KCC2 cotransporter. This decreases the concentration of Cl‚àí ion within cells. Therefore, the GAGAA subunits are involved in determining the nature of the receptor in response to GABA ligand. These changes suggest that editing of the subunit is important in the developing brain by regulating the Cl‚àí permeability of the channel during development. The unedited receptor is activated faster and deactivates slower than the edited receptor.

The zinc finger-containing protein encoded by this gene is a widely expressed member of the FOG family of regulators of transcription factors. The family consists of the ZFPM1 and ZFPM2 genes in humans and Zfpm1 and Zfpm2 genes in mice. Its members may act as coactivators and/or corepressors to modulate the activity of GATA transcription factors. That is, the ZFPM2 protein appears able to interact directly with and thereby either enhance or repress the ability of GATA transcription factors to stimulate the expression of their target genes; the direction of ZFPM2's actions depends on the contexts of the promoter sections of the various GATA target genes. The ZFPM2 protein interacts primarily with the GATA4 but also with GATA2, GATA5, and GATA6 transcription factors. ZFPM2 protein's interaction with GATA4 is notable for controlling the embryonic development of various tissues, particularly the heart, diaphragm, and gonads. Correspondingly, ZFPM2 mutations are responsible for certain forms of congenital heart defects, congenital diaphragmatic hernias, and ambiguous genitalia in mice as well as humans.  Gene  The ZFPM2 gene is found in a wide range of animal species from flies to humans. The human gene is located on the long or \\"q\\" arm of chromosome 8 at position 23.1 (i.e. 8q23.1) and consists of 9 exons.https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/23414 The equivalent mouse gene, Zfpm2, is located on chromosome 15 and consists of 8 exons.https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/22762 Knockout of ZFPM2 is embryonic lethal in mice, with mice dying at embryonic day 12.5-15.5 due to congenital cardiac defects (thin heart ventricular muscle, common atrioventricular canal, and the tetralogy of Fallot malformation. ZFPM2 expression in mice is also required for normal development of the gonads, lung and diaphragm.  Protein  Both the human and mouse ZFPM2 proteins consists of 1151 amino acids and are expressed in various tissues. The human protein is expressed at relatively high levels in the adult ovary and uterine endometrium while the mouse protein is expressed at relatively high levels in the central nervous system cerebellum and, during the early stages of its development, the heart. Human ZFPM2 contains 8 zinc finger structural motifs and interacts directly with various members of the GATA transcription factor family to modify their ability to stimulate the expression of their target genes. For example, it has been shown to bind directly with the N-terminal zinc finger of the GATA4 transcription factor to inhibit its ability to stimulate the expression of a target gene in an in vitro model system. The extreme N terminal end of the ZFPM2 protein contains two domains, one of which interacts directly with the Mi-2/NuRD complex (i.e. nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylase complex or NuRD complex) and other of which binds CTBP1 or CTBP2 proteins. The NuRD complex and the CtBPs are classified as corepressors. that act to promote the ability of ZFPM2 to inhibit the ability of GATA proteins to stimulate the expression of their target genes.  Pathophysiology  ZFPM2 regulates the expression of certain GATA target genes by up-regulating or down-regulating the ability of the GATA transcription factors, primarily GATA3, GATA4, GATA5, and GATA6, to stimulate the expression of their target genes. Interactions with the NuRD complex or a CTBP can cause ZFPM2 to inhibit the ability of GATA3-6 proteins to stimulate the expression of their target genes.  Clinical relevancy  = Congenital heart disease = Mutations in the ZFPM2 gene are responsible for rare and sporadic cases of congenital heart disease. These include cases of Tetralogy of Fallot, truncus arteriosus, failure to from the pulmonary artery valve combined with ventricular septal defect, double outlet right ventricle, transposition of the great arteries, and interrupted aortic arch. Sporadic cases of Tetralogy of Fallot were also found in cases where the levels of Hypermethylation at CpG sites in the ZFPM2 gene promoter were greatly elevated; these cases were associated with decreases cardiac tissue levels of mRNA for ZFPM2. These cases likely reflect the role of ZFPM2 in promoting GATA4's function in the embryonic development of the heart. = Congenital diaphragmatic hernia = ZFPM2 heterozygous gene mutations are responsible for sporadic cases of congenital diaphragmatic hernias. This development disorder may be the underlying cause for the development of congenital lung dysplasia and pulmonary vascular disorder that leads to pulmonary hypertension. These defects are considered due to haploinsufficiency in ZFPM2 protein and consequential failure of GATA4 to promote normal lung development. = Sex development = Heterozygous mutations in the ZFPM2 gene are responsible for sporadic, very rare cases of a familial form of disorders of sex development, ambiguous genitalia. The disorder likely reflects haploinsufficiency of the ZFPM2 protein and consequential reduced regulation of GATA4 in promoting normal development of the gonads.

Plot summary A young boy, Jack-a-Boy, moved into Windsor Terrace with his family. He is loved by all the neighbours: the Professor, who lets him read books about Greek mythology; the old spinster, who gives him a makeshift toy dog; Miss Harris, with whom he would play the piano; the Woman Who Nobody Called On, whom he proffers to be a second-best mother. Once the boy throws a party and everyone helps him with the preparations. On another occasion he goes for a walk with Miss Harris and the Professor, who is allowed to hold his basket. Later, Miss Harris is summoned by the Professor to help him improve a makeshift map of the Peloponnesus with flowers. The following Summer the boy gets ill. Miss Harris has forgotten to bring him cattails and acorns according to his wish. The Woman Nobody Called On holds him in her arms. The Professor answers questions about Greek mythology. Finally the boy passes away. Subsequent to his death, the Professor ponders that the boy had Ancient Greece in his soul. He then returns to his work on Greek prosody and Miss Harris to her piano lessons.

It is a member of the BAX inhibitor motif containing (TMBIM) family and localizes to the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM), as well as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it plays a role in apoptosis through mediating mitochondrial morphology and cytochrome c release. Through its apoptotic function, GHITM may be involved in tumor metastasis and innate antiviral responses. Structure This gene encodes a 37 kDa protein which putatively contains six to eight transmembrane domains. As a member of the TMBIM family, GHITM shares a transmembrane BAX inhibitor motif, a semi-hydrophobic transmembrane domain, and similar tertiary structure with the other five members. However, unlike the other members, GHITM possesses a unique acidic (D) instead of a basic (H or R) residue near its second transmembrane domain, as well as an additional transmembrane domain that, after cleavage behind residue 57 (SREYA), signals for localization to the IMM. Nonetheless, it is possible that cleavage at different sites (XXRR-like motif (LAAR) in the N-terminal and a KKXX-like motif (GNRK) in the C-terminal) or alternative splicing may account for the protein‚Äôs observed localization to the ER.  Function  GHITM is a mitochondrial protein and a member of the TMBIM family and BAX inhibitor-1 (BI1) superfamily. It is ubiquitously expressed but is especially abundant in the brain, heart, liver, kidney, and skeletal muscle and scarce in the intestines and thymus. This protein localizes specifically to the IMM, where it regulates apoptosis through two separate processes: (1) the BAX-independent management of mitochondrial morphology and (2) the release of cytochrome c. In the first process, GHITM maintains cristae organization, and its downregulation results in mitochondrial fragmentation, possibly through inducing fusing of the cristae structures, thus leading to the release of proapoptotic proteins such as cytochrome c, Smac, and Htra2. Meanwhile, in the second process, GHITM is responsible for cross-linking cytochrome c to the IMM, and upregulation of GHITM is associated with delayed cytochrome c release, regardless of outer mitochondrial membrane permeabilization. Thus, GHITM controls the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria and can potentially interfere with the apoptotic process to promote cell survival. Moreover, GHITM may further plays a role in apoptosis through maintaining calcium ion homeostasis in the ER. However, while overexpression of the other TMBIM proteins exhibit antiapoptotic effects by decreasing calcium ion concentrations, and thus preventing mitochondrial calcium ion overload, depolarization, ATP loss, reactive oxygen species production, cytochrome c release, and ultimately, cell death, overexpression of GHITM produces the opposite effect.  Clinical significance  GHITM may be involved in tumor metastasis through its interactions with the Bcl-2 family proteins to regulate apoptosis. Its role as an apoptotic regulator may also associate it with innate antiviral responses. Overexpression of GHITM has also been observed to speed up the ageing process in HIV infected patients.  Interactions  GHITM has been shown to interact with cytochrome c.

Isocitrate dehydrogenases (IDHs) catalyze the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to 2-oxoglutarate. These enzymes belong to two distinct subclasses, one of which utilizes NAD(+) as the electron acceptor and the other NADP(+). Five isocitrate dehydrogenases have been reported: three NAD(+)-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenases, which localize to the mitochondrial matrix, and two NADP(+)-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenases, one of which is mitochondrial and the other predominantly cytosolic. NAD(+)-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenases catalyze the allosterically regulated rate-limiting step of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Each isozyme is a heterotetramer that is composed of two alpha subunits, one beta subunit, and one gamma subunit. The protein encoded by this gene is the gamma subunit of one isozyme of NAD(+)-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase. This gene is a candidate gene for periventricular heterotopia. Several alternatively spliced transcript variants of this gene have been described, but only some of their full length natures have been determined. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]  Structure  IDH3 is one of three isocitrate dehydrogenase isozymes, the other two being IDH1 and IDH2, and encoded by one of five isocitrate dehydrogenase genes, which are IDH1, IDH2, IDH3A, IDH3B, and IDH3G. The genes IDH3A, IDH3B, and IDH3G encode subunits of IDH3, which is a heterotetramer composed of two 37-kDa Œ± subunits (IDH3Œ±), one 39-kDa Œ≤ subunit (IDH3Œ≤), and one 39-kDa Œ≥ subunit (IDH3Œ≥), each with distinct isoelectric points. Alignment of their amino acid sequences reveals ~40% identity between IDH3Œ± and IDH3Œ≤, ~42% identity between IDH3Œ± and IDH3Œ≥, and an even closer identity of 53% between IDH3Œ≤ and IDH3Œ≥, for an overall 34% identity and 23% similarity across all three subunit types. Notably, Arg88 in IDH3Œ± is essential for IDH3 catalytic activity, whereas the equivalent Arg99 in IDH3Œ≤ and Arg97 in IDH3Œ≥ are largely involved in the enzyme's allosteric regulation by ADP and NAD. Thus, it is possible that these subunits arose from gene duplication of a common ancestral gene, and the original catalytic Arg residue were adapted to allosteric functions in the Œ≤- and Œ≥-subunits. Likewise, Asp181 in IDH3Œ± is essential for catalysis, while the equivalent Asp192 in IDH3Œ≤ and Asp190 in IDH3Œ≥ enhance NAD- and Mn2+-binding. Since the oxidative decarboxylation catalyzed by IDH3 requires binding of NAD, Mn2+, and the substrate isocitrate, all three subunits participate in the catalytic reaction. Moreover, studies of the enzyme in pig heart reveal that the Œ±Œ≤ and Œ±Œ≥ dimers constitute two binding sites for each of its ligands, including isocitrate, Mn2+, and NAD, in one IDH3 tetramer.  Function  As an isocitrate dehydrogenase, IDH3 catalyzes the reversible oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to yield Œ±-ketoglutarate (Œ±-KG) and CO2 as part of the TCA cycle in glucose metabolism. This step also allows for the concomitant reduction of NAD+ to NADH, which is then used to generate ATP through the electron transport chain. Notably, IDH3 relies on NAD+ as its electron acceptor, as opposed to NADP+ like IDH1 and IDH2. IDH3 activity is regulated by the energy needs of the cell: when the cell requires energy, IDH3 is activated by ADP; and when energy is no longer required, IDH3 is inhibited by ATP and NADH.

The shells of the species in this family are mostly globular in shape. Naticidae is the only family in the superfamily Naticoidea. It has been estimated that worldwide there are about 260‚Äì270 recent species of naticid snails. This group is assumed to have originated in the late Triassic or in the early Jurassic. Members of this family can be recognized by the shape of their shells, distinct appearance or by their predatory behavior. Distribution Naticids are widely distributed and occur worldwide. The greatest diversity of both species and genera is found in tropical regions. Even so, naticid snails are also plentiful in temperate, Arctic and Antarctic waters. Habitat Moon snails live on sandy substrates, at a great variety of depths depending on the species (from the intertidal zone to thousands of meters in depth). They are often seen ploughing along in the sand searching for prey. Life habits 50-second video of snails (most likely Natica chemnitzi and Cerithium muscarum) feeding on the sea floor in the Gulf of California, Puerto Pe√±asco, Mexico. Naticid boring in Stewartia from the Calvert Formation, Zone 10, Calvert Co., MD (Miocene). A moon snail (Naticarius orientalis) on the prowl at night. Found on the north coast of East Timor. Notocochlis gualteriana A fossil shell of Naticarius millepunctatus from the Nicosia Formation, Pliocene, Cyprus Naticids are predatory, feeding mostly on bivalves. They will also attack almost any other shelled mollusk they encounter in the sand, such as scaphopods and other gastropods, including other moon snails. Additionally, Conuber sordidum was shown to prey on the soldier crab Mictyris longicarpus (Crustacea) by drilling predation.Huelsken, T. (2011) First evidence of drilling predation by Conuber sordidus (Swainson, 1821) (Gastropoda: Naticidae) on soldier crabs (Crustacea: Mictyridae). Molluscan Research, 31(2), 125-131. To catch soldier crabs, C. sordidum uses the same behaviour as when hunting shelled molluscan prey. The moon snail envelops the prey and then bores a hole through the shell using its radula and an acid secretion. Once the shell is bored open, the proboscis is used to consume the flesh of the prey. The hole in the shell, which has a \\"countersunk\\" appearance with chamfered edges, and which varies in size according to the species, is a characteristic diagnostic sign of moon snail predation. In the breeding season, the female moon snail lays a rather stiff egg mass which includes sand and mucus. These objects wash up on sandy beaches fairly often, and are known by the common name \\"sand collars\\" because of their resemblance to an old-fashioned removable shirt collar or false-collar. Human Interaction In Korean cuisine, moon snails are called golbaengi () and eaten as golbaengi-muchim (moon snail salad). Moon snail shells are attractive and relatively large, and often popular in jewellery and ornamentation.  Taxonomy  = Traditional classification = Some authors have suggested a distinct separation of the Naticidae into four subfamilies: Ampullospirinae, Naticinae, Polinicinae and Sininae.Kabat A.R. 1991.

Function  This gene belongs to the protocadherin gene family, a subfamily of the cadherin superfamily. The encoded protein consists of an extracellular domain containing 7 cadherin repeats, a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic tail that differs from those of the classical cadherins. The gene is located in a major X/Y block of homology and its Y homolog (PCDH11Y), despite divergence leading to coding region changes, is the most closely related cadherin family member.

Function  The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the angiopoietin-like family of secreted factors. It is expressed predominantly in the liver, and has the characteristic structure of angiopoietins, consisting of a signal peptide, N-terminal coiled-coil domain, and the C-terminal fibrinogen (FBN)-like domain. The FBN-like domain in angiopoietin-like 3 protein was shown to bind alpha-5/beta-3 integrins, and this binding induced endothelial cell adhesion and migration. This protein may also play a role in the regulation of angiogenesis. Angptl3 also acts as dual inhibitor of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and endothelial lipase (EL), thereby increasing plasma triglyceride, LDL cholesterol and HDL cholesterol in mice and humans. ANGPTL3 inhibits endothelial lipase hydrolysis of HDL-phospholipid (PL), thereby increasing HDL-PL levels. Circulating PL-rich HDL particles have high cholesterol efflux abilities. Angptl3 plays a major role in promoting uptake of circulating triglycerides into white adipose tissue in the fed state, likely through activation by Angptl8, a feeding-induced hepatokine, to inhibit postprandial LPL activity in cardiac and skeletal muscles, as suggested by the ANGPTL3-4-8 model.  Clinical significance  In human, ANGPTL3 is a determinant factor of HDL level and positively correlates with plasma HDL cholesterol. In humans with genetic loss-of-function variants in one copy of ANGPTL3, the serum LDL-C levels are reduced. In those with loss- of-function variants in both copies of ANGPTL3, low LDL-C, low HDL-C, and low triglycerides are seen (\\"familial combined hypolipidemia\\").

The ASIC genes have splicing variants that encode different proteins that are called isoforms. These genes are mainly expressed in the central and peripheral nervous system. ASICs can form both homotrimeric (meaning composed of three identical subunits) and heterotrimeric channels. Structure and function This gene encodes a member of the ASIC/ENaC superfamily of proteins. The members of this family are amiloride-sensitive sodium channels that contain intracellular N and C termini, 2 hydrophobic transmembrane (TM) regions, and a large extracellular loop, which has many cysteine residues with conserved spacing. The TM regions are generally symbolized as TM1 (clone to N-terminus) and TM2 (close to C-terminus).

He spent most of his club career at West Bromwich Albion, where he played more than 300 league games and helped the club win two major trophies. He won two caps for Scotland. Career Born in Bridge of Allan, Stirlingshire, Hope played for West Bromwich Albion between 1959 and 1972, when they were a Football League First Division side. A cultured, scheming inside-forward, he was the general in the team's midfield throughout the 1960s. Together with Clive Clark on the wing, Hope provided the ammunition for players like Tony Brown and Jeff Astle. Hope enjoyed success during this period, winning the League Cup in 1966 and FA Cup in 1968. He scored Albion's first goal in European competition when he found the net against DOS Utrecht in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup on 2 November 1966. In April 1971, Hope was awarded a testimonial match against Athletic Bilbao, then managed by Ronnie Allen, who later had two short spells as Albion manager; the fixture was reciprocated in Spain a few weeks later for the benefit of Jos√© √Ångel Iribar. He moved to Birmingham City in 1972, spending time on loan in the NASL with Philadelphia Atoms and Dallas Tornado, and later played for Sheffield Wednesday and Bromsgrove Rovers. He went on to manage Bromsgrove and Burton Albion. He returned to West Brom as a scout in later years, and was appointed chief scout in 2000. Hope won only two full caps for Scotland, perhaps due to the abundance of Scottish midfield talent in this period.

KCNN2 is an ion channel protein also known as KCa2.2.  Function  Action potentials in vertebrate neurons are followed by an afterhyperpolarization (AHP) that may persist for several seconds and may have profound consequences for the firing pattern of the neuron. Each component of the AHP is kinetically distinct and is mediated by different calcium-activated potassium channels. The KCa2.2 protein is activated before membrane hyperpolarization and is thought to regulate neuronal excitability by contributing to the slow component of synaptic AHP. KCa2.2 is an integral membrane protein that forms a voltage-independent calcium-activated channel with three other calmodulin-binding subunits. This protein is a member of the calcium-activated potassium channel family. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for the KCNN2 gene. In a 2009 study, SK2 (KCNN2) potassium channel was overexpressed in the basolateral amygdala using a herpes simplex viral system. This reduced anxiety and stress-induced corticosterone secretion at a systemic level. SK2 overexpression also reduced dendritic arborization of the amygdala neurons. In a 2015 study, it was found that UBE3A, the protein maternally deleted in Angelman syndrome, marks KCNN2 for degradation in the hippocampus, and that UBE3A deficiency is associated with an increase in KCNN2 levels. KCNN2 operates through a negative feedback loop to reduce glutamatergic NMDA receptor activation when it itself is activated by that same receptor. Angelman syndrome therefore leads to a reduction in glutamatergic NMDA receptor activation, which impairs long-term potentiation of hippocampal neurons and thus fear conditioning.

Birth and early life Moothathu was born on 25 Edavam 989 Kolla era (1818 AD) in Vaikom, Travancore state and was adopted by a Moothathu family called Vattapalli Matom at Suchindrum to perform temple rites and rituals. The family lacked a male child who could do those duties. The family of Vattapalli Matom is the Tantri of the Suchindrum Thanumalayan temple from where one male member (usually the eldest) must perform the rites and rituals of the temple. It is said that up to the age of 11, Moothathu had only elementary knowledge of the alphabets but during his stay at Suchindrum, his knowledge in arts, literature and traditional sciences rose to great heights.

His self-portrait, which he had painted by looking at his image in a mirror was also well known. Learning Moothathu learned Ayurveda, a system of traditional medicine native to India. He was influenced by Vahata's (Vagbhata) Astangahridaya and started learning it. He learned Astangahrdaya in the Kollam Era 1018 (Kanni 2) and completed on the 29th of Thulam 1018 (1843 AD). He wrote Sri Rama Charitram Mahakavyam (1037 KOLLAM ERA), Thiruvitamcore Charitram (narrating the legends and facts up to the 1036 Kollam Era (1861 AD) i.e. up to the period of Maharaja Ayilyam Thirunal).Hradyapriya(1040 Kollam Era) 1865 AD and Sukhasadhakam(1057 Kollam Era) 1882 AD are two important works by Sri Pachu Moothathu on Ayurveda and can be considered as a pragmatic commentary of Vahata's Astangahridaya. He insisted in transferring the knowledge of Ayurveda to ordinary people and his book Sukhasadhagam is an attempt in this direction. He was the Kottaram Vaidyan (official ayurvedic physician) of Travancore and was awarded with the Veera Sringala by the maharaja, Ayilyam Thirunal.

Function  Msr is ubiquitous and highly conserved. Human and animal studies have shown the highest levels of expression in kidney and liver. It carries out the enzymatic reduction of methionine sulfoxide (MetO), the oxidized form of the amino acid methionine (Met), back to methionine, using thioredoxin to catalyze the enzymatic reduction and repair of oxidized methionine residues. Its proposed function is thus the repair of oxidative damage to proteins to restore biological activity. Oxidation of methionine residues in tissue proteins can cause them to misfold or otherwise render them dysfunctional.  Clinical significance  MetO increases with age in body tissues, which is believed by some to contribute to biological ageing. Moreover, levels of methionine sulfoxide reductase A (MsrA) decline in aging tissues in mice and in association with age-related disease in humans. There is thus a rationale for thinking that by maintaining the structureincreased levels or activity of MsrA might retard the rate of aging. Indeed, transgenic Drosophila (fruit flies) that overexpress methionine sulfoxide reductase show extended lifespan. However, the effects of MsrA overexpression in mice were ambiguous. MsrA is found in both the cytosol and the energy-producing mitochondria, where most of the body's endogenous free radicals are produced. Transgenically increasing the levels of MsrA in either the cytosol or the mitochondria had no significant effect on lifespan assessed by most standard statistical tests, and may possibly have led to early deaths in the cytosol-specific mice, although the survival curves appeared to suggest a slight increase in maximum (90%) survivorship, as did analysis using Boschloo's test, a binomial test designed to test greater extreme variation.

Although bin Laden was never indicted for the September 11, 2001 attacks, he had claimed responsibility for them in videos released to the public. Jihad in Afghanistan Bin Laden's wealth and connections assisted his interest in supporting the mujahideen, Muslim guerrillas fighting the Soviet Union in Afghanistan following the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. His old teacher from the university in Jeddah, Abdullah Azzam, had relocated to Peshawar, a major border city in the North-West Frontier Province of Pakistan. From there, Azzam was able to organize resistance directly on the Afghan frontier. Peshawar is only east of the Khyber Pass, through the Safed Koh mountains, connected to the southeastern edge of the Hindu Kush range. This route became the major avenue of inserting foreign fighters and material support into eastern Afghanistan for the resistance against the Soviets. After leaving college in 1979 bin Laden joined Azzam to fight the Soviet Invasion and lived for a time in Peshawar. According to Rahimullah Yousufzai, \\"Azzam prevailed on him to come and use his money\\" for training recruits.Rahimullah Yusufzai, executive editor of the English-language daily The News International, in a statement to Reuters in Peshawar on 29 December 2001. Yusufzai met bin Laden twice in Afghanistan in 1998. In the early 1980s, bin Laden lived at several addresses in and around Arbab Road, a narrow street in the University Town neighborhood in western Peshawar, Yusufzai said. Nearby in Gulshan Iqbal Road is the Arab mosque that Abdullah Azzam used as the jihad center, according to a Reuters inquiry in the neighborhood. By 1984, with Azzam, bin Laden established a Saudi Arabian funded organization named Maktab al-Khadamat (MAK, Office of Order in English), which funneled money, arms and Muslim fighters from around the Arabic world into the Afghan war. Through al- Khadamat, bin Laden's inherited family fortuneLawrence Wright estimates his \\"share of the Saudi Binladin Group\\" in about fall 1989 as \\"amounted to 27 million Saudi riyals - a little more than [US]$ 7 million.\\" Wright, (2006), p.145) paid for air tickets and accommodation, dealt with paperwork with Pakistani authorities and provided other such services for the jihad fighters. In running al-Khadamat, bin Laden set up a network of couriers traveling between Afghanistan and Peshawar, which remained active after 2001, according to Rahimullah Yusufzai. It was during this time that Bin Laden met his future al-Qaeda collaborator, Dr. Ayman al-Zawahiri, a member and later head of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad. Alleged CIA involvement Whether Osama bin Laden and his group are \\"blowback\\" from CIA's Operation Cyclone to help the Afghan mujahideen is a matter of some debate. Robin Cook, UK Foreign Secretary from 1997‚Äì2001 and Leader of the House of Commons from 2001-2003, has written that bin Laden was, \\"a product of a monumental miscalculation by western security agencies\\" and that the mujahideen that formed Al-Qaeda were \\"originally ... recruited and trained with help from the CIA\\". However, CNN journalist Peter Bergen, known for conducting the first television interview with Osama bin Laden in 1997, calls the idea \\"that the CIA funded bin Laden or trained bin Laden ... a folk myth. There's no evidence of this. ... Bin Laden had his own money, he was anti-American and he was operating secretly and independently. ... The real story here is the CIA didn't really have a clue about who this guy was until 1996 when they set up a unit to really start tracking him.\\" Break with Azzam Osama bin Laden was recruited to be part of Azzam's Maktab al-Khadimat (Services Bureau), the support network of Arab fighters in Pakistan that was helping resist the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. For a while, bin Laden worked at the Services Bureau working with Abdullah Azzam on Jihad Magazine, a magazine that gave information about the war with the Soviets and interviewed mujahideen. Although bin Laden and the other Afghan Arabs were considered a minor \\"sideshow\\" in the war, bin Laden did establish a camp in Afghanistan and, with other volunteers, fought the Soviets and Marxist Afghan troops. One of his most significant battles was the battle of Jaji, which was not a major fight, but it earned him a reputation as a fighter. As time passed, Ayman al-Zawahiri encouraged bin Laden to split away from Abdullah Azzam. This stemmed from al- Zawahiri's differences with Azzam such as their conflicting interpretations of the jihad. Some believe that al-Zawahiri's motive was driven by his desire to exploit bin Laden's finances as well as the ambition to control the fractured Egyptian jihadist movement and so al-Zawahiri favored an aggressive view. On the other hand, Azzam pushed for a limited and defensive conception of jihad, where it becomes obligatory only when the enemy enters the land of Muslims. This doctrine, however, proved ambiguous and invited several interpretations. Bin Laden began gravitating towards Zawahiri's position as he pursued a more expansive warfare strategy that allowed \\"insurrections against apostate Muslim regimes.\\" Azzam rejected this because he eschewed intra-Muslim conflict and the dispute finally led to a power struggle, which bin Laden won. By 1988, he finally broke away from his mentor, establishing al-Qaeda with the most extremist of the Muslim militants from Azzam's network and began a radical form of jihad that pursued the violent overthrow of governments in the Muslim world deemed apostate. Years later, in 1989, Azzam was blown up in a massive car bombing outside the mosque. Bin Laden is thought by some to be behind the assassination due to the rift about the direction of the jihad at that time.See, for example, Rohan Gunaratna, Inside Al Qaeda (NY: Berkley Books, 2003) 31. Others, however, doubt this claim; Ahmad Zaidan, for instance, author of the Arabic-language book Bin Laden Unmasked, told Peter L. Bergen in an interview, \\"I rule out totally that bin Laden would indulge himself in such things, after all, Osama bin Laden, he's not type of person to kill Abdullah Azzam. Otherwise, if he be exposed, he would be finished, totally.\\" Bergen also cites Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who speculates that there were more likely candidates than bin Laden: \\"It could be Hekmatyar, it could be KHAD, it could be the Mossad, the Egyptians [around Ayman al Zawahiri] ‚Ä¶ I met with Hekmatyar, an arrogant, self-centered person. I think Hekmatyar had a secret organization to eliminate his enemies.\\"Peter L. Bergen, The Osama bin Laden I Know (New York: Free Press, 2006) 97. Formation of Al-Qaeda By 1988, bin Laden had split from Maktab al-Khidamat because of strategic differences. While Azzam and his MAK organization acted as support for the Afghan fighters and provided relief to refugees and injured, bin Laden wanted a more military role in which the Arab fighters would not only be trained and equipped by the organization but also led on the battlefield by Arabic commanders. One of the main leading points to the split and the creation of al-Qaeda was the insistence of Azzam that Arab fighters be integrated among the Afghan fighting groups instead of forming their separate fighting force.The Osama bin Laden I Know by Peter L. Bergen, pp. 74‚Äì88. In 1990 Bin Laden returned to Saudi Arabia a hero of jihad, celebrated in the Saudi press as a pious, courageous warrior who, along with his Arab legion, \\"had brought down the mighty superpower\\" of the Soviet Union.Wright, Lawrence, Looming Tower: Al Qaeda and the Road to 9/11, by Lawrence Wright, NY, Knopf, 2006 p.146 However, at about the same time Iraq invaded neighbor Kuwait and bin Laden was alarmed at the prospect that foreign non-Muslim troops would enter the kingdom to fight Iraq. He met Saudi Prince Sultan, the Minister of Defense, and offered to help defend Saudi Arabia: > [Bin Laden:] I am ready to prepare 100,000 fighters with good combat > capability within three months. You don't need Americans. You don't need any > other non-Muslim troops. We will be enough. > [Prince Sultan:] There are no caves in Kuwait. What will you do when he lobs > missiles at you with chemical and biological weapons? > [Bin Laden:] We will fight him with faith.Douglas Jehl, \\"Holy War lured > Saudis as Rulers Looked Away\\", New York Times December 27, 2001 Bin Laden was rebuffed and publicly denounced Saudi Arabia's dependence on the U.S. military, demanding an end to the presence of foreign military bases in the country. Other Saudi Muslims were also greatly upset that non-Muslim troops would be on the same peninsula as the two holy cities of Mecca and Medina. Anti-government Islamist militants in Saudi Arabia were even more inflamed when the foreign bases remained after the Gulf War was over. Bin Laden's increasingly strident criticisms of the Saudi monarchy led the government to attempt to silence him. According to the 9/11 Commission Report, \\"with help from a dissident member of the royal family, he managed to get out of the country under the pretext of attending an Islamic gathering in Pakistan in April 1991.National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States\\" Another report has bin Laden retrieving his passport from the Saudi government to go to Peshawar in March 1992 to mediate the Afghan Civil War. In any case Hassan al-Turabi, leader of the National Islamic Front, had invited bin Laden to \\"transplant his whole organization to Sudan\\" in 1989. Bin Laden's agents had begun purchasing property in Sudan in 1990. Bin Laden moved to Sudan in 1992. Yugoslav wars (1991‚Äì1999) One of the former State Department officials described Bosnia and Herzegovina of that time as a safe haven for terrorists, after it was revealed that militant elements of the former Sarajevo government were protecting extremists include hard-core terrorists, some with ties to Osama bin Laden. In 1997, Rzeczpospolita, one of the largest Polish daily newspapers, reported that intelligence services of the Nordic- Polish SFOR Brigade suspected that a center for training terrorists from Islamic countries was located in the Bocina Donja village near Maglaj in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In 1992, thousands of volunteers joined an \\"all- mujahedeen unit\\" called El Moujahed, which was headquartered in Zenica in an abandoned hillside factory, a compound with a hospital and prayer hall. According to Middle East intelligence reports. Bin Laden financed small convoys of recruits from the Arab world through his businesses in Sudan. Among them was Karim Said Atmani who was identified by authorities as the document forger for a group of Algerians accused of plotting the bombings in the USA.Smith, Jeffrey. Washington Post, \\"A Bosnian Village's Terrorist Ties\\", March 11, 2000 He is a former roommate of Ahmed Ressam, the man arrested at the Canadian-U.S. border in mid-December 1999 with a car full of nitroglycerin and bomb-making materials.Canadian Security Intelligence Service, Summary of the Security Intelligence Report concerning Hassan Almrei, February 22, 2008.Baravalle, Giorgio. \\"Rethink: Cause and Consequences of September 11\\", 2004 He was convicted of colluding with Osama bin Laden by a French court.Assyrian International News Agency, \\"Jihadists find convenient base in Bosnia\\", August 17, 2005 A Bosnian government search of passport and residency records, conducted at the urging of the United States, revealed other former mujahideen who are linked to the same Algerian group or to other suspected terrorist groups and who have lived in this area 60 miles north of Sarajevo, the capital, in the past few years. Khalil al-Deek, was arrested in Jordan in late December 1999 on suspicion of involvement in a plot to blow up tourist sites; a second man with Bosnian citizenship, Hamid Aich, lived in Canada at the same time as Atmani and worked for a charity associated with Osama Bin Laden. In its June 26, 1997 Report on the bombing of the Al Khobar building in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, the New York Times noted that those arrested confessed to serving with Bosnian Muslims forces. Further, the terrorists also admitted to ties with Osama Bin Laden. In 1999 it was revealed that Osama bin Laden and his Tunisian assistant Mehrez Aodouni were granted citizenship and Bosnian passport in 1993 by the Government in Sarajevo. This information was denied by Bosnian government following the 9/11 attacks but it was later found out that Aodouni was arrested in Turkey and that at that time he possessed the Bosnian passport. Following this revelation new explanation was given that bin Laden \\"did not personally collect his Bosnian passport\\" and that officials at the Bosnian embassy in Vienna, which issued the passport, could not have known who bin Laden was at the time.BIN LADEN WAS GRANTED BOSNIAN PASSPORT, Agence France Presse September 24, 1999Outsiders Bring Islamic Fervor To the Balkans The Bosnian daily Osloboƒëenje published in 2001 that three men, believed linked to be linked to Osama Bin Laden, were arrested in Sarajevo in July 2001. The three, one of whom was identified as Imad El Misri, were Egyptian nationals. The paper said that two of the suspects were holding Bosnian passports. In 1998 it was reported that bin Laden is operating his terrorist network out of Albania. The Charleston Gazette quoted Fatos Klosi, the head of the Albanian intelligence service, as saying a network run by Saudi exile Osama Bin Laden sent units to fight in the Serbian province of Kosovo. Confirmation of these activities came from Claude Kader, a French national who said he was a member of Bin Laden's Albanian network. He claimed he had visited Albania to recruit and arm fighters for Kosovo.'The Charleston Gazette.' November 30, 1998 - Page 2A In 2000 bin Laden was operating from Kosovo planning the terrorist activities during the Insurgency in the Pre≈°evo Valley.'The Canberra Times'. April 28, 2000 - Page 8 Connections between bin Laden and National Liberation Army, an insurgent, guerrilla organization that operated in the Republic of Macedonia in 2001 were also drawn. According to the Washington Times the NLA was fighting to keep control over the region‚Äôs drug trafficking, which had grown into a large, lucrative enterprise since the Kosovo war and that in addition to drug money, the NLA also had another prominent venture capitalist, Osama Bin Laden. According to a document written by the chief commander of the Macedonian Security Forces, bin Laden was financing the rebel group through a representative in Macedonia. Osama Bin Laden, paid $6 to $7 million for the needs of the National Liberation Army through his representative. Osama Bin Laden was planning to gain control over Macedonia so that he could control the distribution of oil to the United States through the pipeline that was planned to stretch from Bulgaria to Albania ports.['Washington Times' June 22, 2001, \\"Bin Laden¬¥s new special envoys\\"] In Sudan Assisted by donations funneled through business and charitable fronts such as Benevolence International, established by his brother-in-law, Mohammed Jamal Khalifa, and especially by his stipend from the Bin Laden family business empire, bin Laden established a new base for mujahideen operations in Khartoum, Sudan to disseminate Islamist philosophy and recruit operatives in Southeast Asia, Africa, Europe, and the United States. Bin Laden also invested in business ventures, such as al-Hajira, a construction company that built roads throughout Sudan, and Wadi al-Aqiq, an agricultural corporation that farmed hundreds of thousands of acres of sorghum, gum Arabic, sesame and sunflowers in Sudan's central Gezira province. Bin Laden's operations in Sudan were protected by the powerful Sudanese NIF government figure Hassan al Turabi, but were not profitable.\\"His business career was a terrible failure\\" Wright, Looming Tower, (2006), p.196 While in Sudan, bin Laden married one of Turabi's nieces.Bin Laden uses Iraq to plot new attacks, Asia Times Online, By Syed Saleem Shahzad, 23 February 2002 Bin Laden continued his verbal assault on Saudi King Fahd, for example by financing an Advice and Reformation Committee in London that \\"sent faxes by the hundreds to prominent Saudis\\" denouncing the king and corruption in the kingdom. On 5 March 1994, the King retaliated by personally revoking his citizenship and sending an embassary to Sudan to demand bin Laden's passport so that he no longer travel. His family was persuaded to cut off his monthly stipend equivalent of about $7 million a year.Wright, Looming Towers (2006), p.195 By now Bin Laden was strongly associated with Egyptian Islamic Jihad (EIJ) who made up the core of al-Qaeda by this time. In 1995 EIJ attempted to assassinate Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak with the help of al-Gama'a al- Islamiya and the Sudanese intelligence service. The attempt failed and disastrous backlash ensued. The EIJ was abruptly expelled from Sudan and bin Laden pressured to go as well. He took a chartered flight to Jalalabad, Afghanistan and began building a network of contacts.Los Angeles Times, Fighters hunt former ally, December 6, 2001 Refuge in Afghanistan Sudanese officials, whose government was under international sanctions, offered to expel Osama bin Laden to Saudi Arabia in the mid-1990s provided that the Saudis pardon him. The Saudis refused because they had already revoked his citizenship and would not accept him in their country. Consequently, in May 1996, under increasing pressure from Saudi Arabia, Egypt and the United States, Sudan asked bin Laden to leave. Bin Laden was forced to make a distress sale of his assets in Sudan that left with almost nothing.Wright, Looming Towers (2006), p.213-222 He returned to Afghanistan on a chartered plane and flew to Kabul before settling in the Nazim Jihad compound in Jalalabad after being invited by Abdul Rasul Sayyaf, leader of the Islamic Union for the Liberation of Afghanistan, a member of the Afghan Northern Alliance. After spending a few months with these three leaders in the border region hosted by them, bin Laden forged a close relationship with selected leaders of Afghanistan's new Taliban government, notably Mullah Mohammed Omar. Bin Laden supported the Taliban regime with financial and paramilitary assistance and, in 1997, he moved to Kandahar, the Taliban stronghold. In Afghanistan, Bin Laden and al-Qaeda were able to raise some money from \\"donors from the days of the Soviet jihad,\\" and from the Pakistan ISI which paid them to train militants for the fight against India in Kashmir. This was done at the old al-Qaeda camps in Khost which the ISI had persuaded the Taliban to return to al-Qaeda control.Wright, Looming Towers (2006), p.250 Early aid for attacks Several years before bin Laden was well known outside of Saudi and Islamist circles, he assisted and/or funded what he believed to be physical jihad against impiety involving attacks on civilians. While still in Saudi Arabia in 1989, he angered the Saudi royal family by preaching for and financing assassinations of socialist leaders in the neighboring country of Yemen, his father's homeland, where the country was in the process of re- uniting under a coalition government.Wright, Looming Towers, (2006), p. 153‚Äì54 In 1992 or 1993, bin Laden sent an emissary, Qari el-Said, with $40,000 to Algeria to aid the Islamists there and warn them against compromise with the impious government. Making jihad merely \\"for politics, not for God\\" would be a sin, they were told; total war was the only solution. Total war did follow involving many massacres of civilians and a declaration of takfir of Algerians by one of the Islamist factions (the GIA).Kepel, Jihad, (2002), p. 272‚Äì73 An estimated 150,000‚Äì200,000 Algerians were killed by the end of the war, but the government prevailed over the Islamists. Abdullah Anas, an Algerian Islamist witness to the Al-Qaeda advice, later lamented, \`This simple argument destroyed us.\`Wright, Looming Towers, (2006), p. 189 Another unsuccessful effort by bin Laden was the Luxor massacre of November 17, 1997, which Swiss federal police are reported to have found was funded by Bin Laden.Jailan Halawi, \`bin Laden behind Luxor Massacre?\` Al-Ahram Weekly, May 20‚Äì26, 1999. The attack by six al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya militants dressed as policemen slaughtered 58 foreign tourists and four Egyptians at Luxor Temple. Its goal was to derail the nonviolence initiative between the Egyptian government and Egyptian-based al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya, the major Egyptian militant Islamist group, but the attack horrified the Egyptian public and turned it completely against Islamist terror. A later attack that did succeed, at least temporarily, was that on the northern Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif. While in Afghanistan, bin Laden helped cement his alliance with his hosts, the ruling Taliban, by sending several hundred of his Afghan Arab fighters along to help the Taliban overrun Mazar-e-Sharif.Rashid, Taliban, p. 139 The city fell, but journalists report it as a particularly gruesome conquest. For two days the Taliban drove their pickup trucks \\"up and down the narrow streets of Mazar-i- Sharif shooting to the left and right and killing everything that moved ‚Äî shop owners, cart pullers, women and children shoppers and even goats and donkeys.\\"Rashid,Taliban (2000), p.73. More than 8000 noncombatants were reported killed in Mazar-i-Sharif and later in Bamiyan.Goodson, Afghanistan's Endless War, (2001), p.79. Attacks on United States targets It is believed that the first terrorist attack involving bin Laden was the 29 December 1992, bombing of the Gold Mihor Hotel in Aden, Yemen. The attack was intended to kill American troops on the way to Somalia, but the soldiers were staying in a different hotel.Wright, Lawrence, Looming Tower, 2006, p.174 The bombs killed a Yemeni hotel employee and an Austrian national and also seriously injured the Austrian's wife. It was after this bombing that al-Qaeda was reported to have developed its justificiation for the killing of innocent people, such as the two bystanders at the hotel. According to a fatwa issued by Mamdouh Mahmud Salim (aka, Abu Hajer al Iraqi), the most Islamically knowledgeable of Al- Qaeda's members, the killing of someone merely standing near the enemy is justified because any innocent bystander, like the Yemeni hotel worker, will find their proper reward in death, going to Paradise (heaven) if they were good Muslims and to hell if they were bad or non-believers.testimony of Jamal al-Fadl, U.S. v. Usama bin Laden, et al. The fatwa was issued to al-Qaeda members but not the public. In 1998, Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri, (a leader of Egyptian Islamic Jihad), co-signed a fatwa (religious edict) in the name of the World Islamic Front for Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders, declaring: In response to the 1998 United States embassy bombings following the fatwa, President Bill Clinton ordered a freeze on assets that could be linked to bin Laden. Clinton also signed an executive order, authorizing bin Laden's arrest or assassination. In August 1998, the U.S. launched an attack using cruise missiles. The attack failed to harm bin Laden but killed 22 people. On 4 November 1998, Osama bin Laden was indicted by a Federal Grand Jury, and the United States Department of State offered a US$5 million reward for information leading to bin Laden's apprehension or conviction. In an interview with journalist Rahimullah Yusufzai published in Time magazine, 11 January 1999, Osama bin Laden is quoted as saying: Following the 2000 USS Cole bombing, Mohammed Atef was moved to Kandahar, Zawahiri to Kabul, and Bin Laden fled to Kabul, later joining Atef when he realised no American reprisal attacks were forthcoming.National Commission on Terrorist Attacks, 9/11 Commission, p. 191 September 11 attacks Aftermath of the September 11 attacks The Government of the United Kingdom stated that evidence linking Al- Qaeda and bin Laden to the attacks of September 11 is clear and irrefutable. However, a \\"White Paper\\" by the U.S. government, documenting the case against bin Laden and the Al Qaeda organization concerning the September 11 attacks, publicly promised by Secretary of State Colin Powell, was never published. So far, the U.S. Justice Department has not sought formal criminal charges against bin Laden (or anyone but Zacarias Moussaoui) for the 9/11 attacks. This has provided what some call \\"fodder for conspiracy theorists who think the U.S. government or another power was behind the Sept. 11 hijackings.\\"Bin Laden, Most Wanted For Embassy Bombings? By Dan Eggen Two separate indictments were made against bin Laden by two separate grand juries in 1998 for two separate terrorist acts, though no indictments have been filed against him for the events of 9/11. Bin Laden initially denied involvement in the September 11, 2001 attacks while praising them effusely, explaining their motivation, and dismissing American accusations of his involvement as an example of its hatred for Islam. On 16 September 2001, bin Laden read a statement later broadcast by Qatar's Al Jazeera satellite channel saying: > I stress that I have not carried out this act, which appears to have been > carried out by individuals with their own motivation.Fox News. \\"Pakistan to > Demand Taliban Give Up Bin Laden as Iran Seals Afghan Border.\\" 16 September > 2001. > God has struck America at its Achilles heel and destroyed its greatest > buildings, praise and blessing to Him.October 21, 2001 interview with Taysir > Alluni of Al Jazeera Bin Laden claimed the Taliban were being attacked by American forces > because of their religion, not just because of the presence of Osama bin > Laden ‚Ä¶ It is a known fact that America is against the establishment of any > Islamic state. In early November 2001, the Taliban government announced they were bestowing official Afghan citizenship on him, as well as Zawahiri, Mohammed Atef, and Shaykh Asim Abdulrahman.The Hindu, Taliban grants Osama citizenship, November 9, 2001 In November 2001, U.S. forces recovered a videotape from a destroyed house in Jalalabad, Afghanistan. In it Osama bin Laden discusses the attack with an old mujahideen friend Khaled al-Harbi in a way indicating foreknowledge of the attack. \\"We calculated in advance the number of casualties from the enemy;\\" and \\"We had notification since the previous Thursday that the event [the 9/11 attack] would take place that day.\\" The tape was broadcast on various news networks on 13 December 2001. Some have disputed this translation however. On 20 December 2001, German TV channel \\"Das Erste\\" broadcast its analysis of the White House's translation of the videotape. On the show Monitor, two independent translators and an expert on oriental studies found the White House's translation to be not only inaccurate, but also \\"manipulative\\". Arabist Dr. Abdel El M. Husseini, one of the translators, stated: \\"I have carefully examined the Pentagon's translation. This translation is very problematic. At the most important places where it is held to prove the guilt of Bin Laden, it is not identical with the Arabic.\\" Another bin Laden video was released on 27 December 2001, with much the same message as his first. America had accused him of organizing the attacks because of \\"Crusader hatred for the Islamic World. > Terrorism against America deserves to be praised because it was a response > to ‚Ä¶ the continuous injustice inflicted upon our sons in Palestine, Iraq, > Somalia, southern Sudan, and ‚Ä¶ Kashmir. Shortly before the U.S. presidential election in 2004, another taped statement was released and aired on Al Jazeera in which bin Laden abandoned his denials without retracting past statements. In it he told viewers he had personally directed the 19 hijackers,‚Äî\\"In the tape, bin Laden‚Äîwearing traditional white robes, a turban and a tan cloak‚Äîreads from papers at a lectern against a plain brown background.

The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the myosin superfamily. Myosins are molecular motors that, upon interaction with actin filaments, utilize energy from ATP hydrolysis to generate mechanical force. Each myosin has a conserved N-terminal motor domain that contains both ATP-binding and actin-binding sequences. Following the motor domain is a light-chain-binding 'neck' region containing 1-6 copies of a repeat element, the IQ motif, that serves as a binding site for calmodulin or other members of the EF-hand superfamily of calcium-binding proteins. At the C-terminus, each myosin class has a distinct tail domain that serves in dimerization, membrane binding, protein binding, and/or enzymatic activities and targets each myosin to its particular subcellular location. The myosin-1a protein is expressed by enterocytes, the epithelial cells that line the luminal surface of the small intestine. In these cells the myosin-1a protein localizes specifically to the brush border. Experiments indicate that the brush border population of the encoded protein turns over rapidly, while its head and tail domains interact transiently with the core actin and plasma membrane, respectively. A rapidly exchanging pool of the myosin-1a protein binds to the actin core bundle, which turns over on a much slower timescale.

The NDUFA1 protein is a subunit of NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone), which is located in the mitochondrial inner membrane and is the largest of the five complexes of the electron transport chain. Mutations in the NDUFA1 gene are associated with mitochondrial Complex I deficiency.  Structure  The NDUFA1 gene is located on the long q arm of the X chromosome at position 24 and it spans 5,176 base pairs. The NDUFA1 gene produces an 8.1 kDa protein composed of 70 amino acids. NDUFA1 is a subunit of the enzyme NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone), the largest of the respiratory complexes. The structure is L-shaped with a long, hydrophobic transmembrane domain and a hydrophilic domain for the peripheral arm that includes all the known redox centers and the NADH binding site. NDUFA1 is one of about 31 hydrophobic subunits that form the transmembrane region of Complex I. It has been noted that the N-terminal hydrophobic domain has the potential to be folded into an alpha helix spanning the inner mitochondrial membrane with a C-terminal hydrophilic domain interacting with globular subunits of Complex I. The highly conserved two-domain structure suggests that this feature is critical for the protein function and that the hydrophobic domain acts as an anchor for the NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone) complex at the inner mitochondrial membrane.  Function  The human NDUFA1 gene codes for a subunit of Complex I of the respiratory chain, which transfers electrons from NADH to ubiquinone. However, NDUFA1 is an accessory subunit of the complex that is believed not to be involved in catalysis. Initially, NADH binds to Complex I and transfers two electrons to the isoalloxazine ring of the flavin mononucleotide (FMN) prosthetic arm to form FMNH2. The electrons are transferred through a series of iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters in the prosthetic arm and finally to coenzyme Q10 (CoQ), which is reduced to ubiquinol (CoQH2). The flow of electrons changes the redox state of the protein, resulting in a conformational change and pK shift of the ionizable side chain, which pumps four hydrogen ions out of the mitochondrial matrix. Clinical significance Mitochondrial complex I deficiency (MT-C1D) is caused by mutations affecting the NDUFA1 gene. Complex I deficiency is a disorder of the mitochondrial respiratory chain that causes a wide range of clinical manifestations, from lethal neonatal disease to adult-onset neurodegenerative disorders. Phenotypes include macrocephaly with progressive leukodystrophy, non-specific encephalopathy, cardiomyopathy, myopathy, liver disease, Leigh syndrome, Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy, and some forms of Parkinson's disease. Mutations on the X chromosome that affect this gene have included the G94C mutation, which has been associated with lactic acidosis, hypotonia, increased beta-hydroxybutyrate/acetoacetate ratio, and complex I deficiency.  Interactions  NDUFA1 has been shown to have 7 binary protein-protein interactions including 3 co-complex interactions. NDUFA1 appears to interact with GOLGB1, TRIM63, and SMURF2.

As early as 1911, he began to play an active role in the Laberte-Humbert Fr√®res company. The Laberte workshop produced large range of instruments and bows consistent in quality, employed over 300 people by 1920. In addition, many skilled master makers worked for Laberte, including Camille Poirson, Charles Brugere, and Georges Apparut. The workshop owned a fine collection of instruments from all the famous makers including Antonio Stradivari, Guarneri del Ges√π, Giuseppe filius Andrea Guarneri, Francesco Ruggeri, Nicolas Lupot, Jacob Stainer, and Jean-Baptiste Vuillaume. They were meticulously examined and used as models for their own instruments. The workshop was disrupted in the war, and productions resumed after the war ended. The workshop continued for several years before it eventually closed down.Dictionnaire Universel del Luthiers - Rene Vannes 1951,1972, 1985 (vol.3) Family Marc Laberte was born into a family of violin makers. His great grandfather set up a workshop in Mirecourt around 1780. On 21 May 1904, he married Marie Adeline Josephine Th√©r√®se Drouin but she died on 15 December 1909. Before her death, she gave birth to Andr√© Emile Philippe Laberte; Philippe, as he was known, would become a violin maker like his father. After the death of his first wife, he married again, this time to Genevi√®ve Josephine Paule Francine Thouvenin on 15 April 1912 in Besan√ßon. They had a daughter on 6 June 1916 named Claude. Career Thanks to his efforts, the firm Laberte Humbert Fr√®res developed a production of high quality instruments alongside its \\"workshop-like\\" production. As a sign of legacy instruments bearing the Laberte Humbert label, with or without the round stamp that reads LH, are always of the highest standard. Those bearing the Marc Laberte label, with or without the reference to one of the instruments of his collection, are always made with careful attention to the choice of wood and craftsmanship. These best instruments were produced by a small team of skilled craftsman known as ‚Äúl‚ÄôAtelier des Artistes‚Äù. The list includes Joseph Aubry, Charles Brug√®re, and Camille Poirson, among many others, who worked with this special team of violin makers. Georges Apparut, who joined Laberte Humbert Fr√®res toward the end of 1902 and who remained with the firm for 21 years, was in charge of this ‚Äúartistic‚Äù production. The Workshop In 1915 Marc Laberte joined Fourier Magni√© (1868‚Äì1946) and established the new firm under the name \\"Laberte-Humbert Fr√®res, Fourier Magni√© R√©unis\\". A comprehensive catalogue, including the complete range of products and instruments in the lutherie field was published by the firm that same year. In 1927, the firm continued its development by buying the well- known trademark \\"A La Ville de Cremonne‚Äù from Paul Mangenot. One can find this mark stamped with its characteristic triangular shape on the inside back of many good Mirecourt violins of the 19th century. Included in the deal was the use of names such as Honor√© Derazey, Just Derazey, Paul Mangenot, and Didier Nicolas a√Æn√©, the last of whom was first to have used this trademark. Soon thereafter in that same year, a new catalogue including the recently acquired brands was published, this time under the name Laberte & Magni√©. This same catalogue includes two pages dedicated to the collection of antique Italian instruments belonging to Marc Laberte and the ‚Äúcopies‚Äù available for purchase that were made after the originals. On these instruments, the label of \\"Marc Laberte, Ma√Ætre Luthier\\" appears beside a reproduction of the Italian maker's label. In 1931, Laberte received the Grand Prix for the Stradivox Magn√©, a phonograph, which was produced in different versions. These attempts at diversification were made to help the firm withstand the increasing competition and recession effects during that period. Unfortunately, World War II brought despair on Mirecourt as well as the rest of Europe. The Laberte production ended entirely, as the stock and production tools were raided and stolen. By 1944 the firm resumed its activity, but the production never reached the same levels as prior to the war and eventually the difficult economic climate during the post war years, led to the unavoidable decline of the Laberte production. Philippe Laberte, Marc Laberte's son, joined the firm during this period and tried to maintain a production catered toward the high end of the market. Marc Laberte died in 1963.

Anderson had said that he could consider it one of his top five books.Locus: Poul Anderson interview This is one of many science fiction works written at this time on the theme of heightened intelligence. Plot summary At the end of the Cretaceous period, Earth moved into an energy-damping field in space. As long as Earth was in this field, all conductors became more insulating. As a result, almost all of the life on Earth with neurons died off, causing the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene extinction event. The ones that survived passed on their genes for sufficiently capable neurons to deal with the new circumstance. Now in modern times, Earth suddenly moves out of the field. Within weeks all animal life on Earth becomes about 5 times as intelligent. The novel goes through the triumphs and tribulations of various people and non-human animals on Earth after this event. The book opens with a lyrical description of a rabbit, stuck inside a trap, becoming able to reason his way out. This is a common theme in the book. Animal traps are based on the idea that the animals cannot reason their way out of them. When the animals get the ability to reason, they start escaping. Institutions which seemed to be vital to human society, such as a money economy and centralized government, disappear in North America; while Africans, with the assistance of now well armed gorillas, overcome colonial rule, and Chinese rebel against the Communist government. However, some of the means by which people cope with the \\"Change\\" are inventing new anti-scientific religions such as the Third Ba'al, or adopting pseudo-science. As humans develop interstellar travel, they discover no other races are as intelligent as they; other races developed pre- Change intelligence, and there was no environmental pressure to select for higher intelligence after that. Characters =Archie Brock= Archie Brock, one of the main characters in the story, is mentally disabled; when the earth moves out of the field he becomes a genius by pre-change standards. His character is central to the story. Halfway through the book he has taken over the farm that he worked on and, with the aid of his dog (who now understands simple English) and some escaped circus animals (two chimps and an elephant), they successfully run the farm together. Even though his intelligence has increased fivefold, so has everyone else's. He is still considered a relative simpleton, but has very much come to terms with that. In the end, when nearly all the humans leave Earth, he decides to stay behind as leader of a colony of now sentient animals and formerly mentally disabled people. =Dr. Peter Corinth= Physics researcher who spent a brief period at Los Alamos in WWII. He is one of the first to understand the change. After the change he experiences an emotional battle to stay loyal to his wife, although he has feelings for another woman in his office. He later becomes a pilot of the first spaceship able to explore the galaxy. As part of that exploration, he again crosses into the energy-damping field. His mind quickly becomes unable to work the complex controls, and he must wait for the ship to move back out of the field on its own. =Sheila Corinth= Wife of Peter Corinth. She is a housewife before the change. The first effect she goes through when the change begins is a philosophical realization that her life as a housewife is \\"better\\" than that of her non-conformist friends. Later on she begins to lose her sanity from having to deal daily with the existential crisis. Her story is typical of many people in the book who didn't have the intelligence before the change to know how bad their situations were. Later she goes into her husband's lab to use an electroconvulsive therapy machine there to destroy parts of her brain, bringing her IQ down to about 150, with which she is more comfortable. She leaves Peter, and in the last scene we see her introduced to Archie Brock's farm. =Felix Mandelbaum= Neighbor of the Corinths. Before the change he is a Jewish executive secretary of a local union. He is 50 years old and was born on the lower East Side of New York.

He represented Queens County in the Legislative Assembly of Prince Edward Island from 1806 to 1812. He was born at Breachacha Castle on the island of Coll, the son of Neil Rankin, the resident piper at the castle, and Catherine Maclean. He was trained as a piper but instead joined the army. In 1804, Rankin was named a temporary lieutenant in the New Brunswick Fencibles; later that year, he married Flora Morison. He was sent to Prince Edward Island in 1806, where he recruited additional men. In 1811, the Fencibles became the 104th Foot and later that year Rankin was made lieutenant. He also served as a justice of the peace. After being put on half pay, Rankin left the island in 1816 and settled on the Isle of Mull where he married Margaret Maclaine in 1818; his first wife had died in 1814. In 1820, he returned to Prince Edward Island with a group of immigrants. He was named high sheriff for the island and so was responsible for collecting quitrents for Lieutenant Governor Charles Douglass Smith. In 1829, he was named major for the island's militia. He ran unsuccessfully against William Douse, a land agent, for a seat in the provincial assembly in 1834. Rankin helped organize the tenants against the landowners; this eventually led to him being evicted from the farm that he had been renting and he moved to Charlottetown. He died there in 1852.

It is usually a public place that is not used for prayers at other times of the year. On the day of Eid, the first thing Muslims do in the morning is gather usually at a large open ground and offer special prayers, in accordance with the Sunnah (traditions of Muhammad). Although the usage of the term Eidgah is of Indian origin, it may be used for the musalla, the open space outside a mosque, or other open grounds where Eid prayers are performed, due to the lack of a specific Islamic term for a site of Eid observance. The Eidgah is mentioned in the famous Bengali poem by Kazi Nazrul Islam, O Mon Romzaner Oi Rozar Sheshe. Prescriptions in the Sharia The very first \\"Eidgah\\" was located at the outskirts of Medina nearly 1,000 footsteps from Masjid al Nabawi.(Mariful Had√Æth, Vol. 3, P.399), There are several scholarly opinions regarding praying at Eidgahs, prescribing it in the Sharia (Islamic law): *Complying with the Sunnah, performing of the Eid Salah at the outskirts of the town is better and more virtuous, than performing it in the town (i.e. in a mosque).(Fatwa Darul Uloom, Vol 5, P. 208) *The Eid Salah performed in the mosque is complete, but performing it in the Eidgah is Sunnah. To not perform Eid Salah in the Eidgah without a valid excuse, is contrary to the Sunnah.(Fatwa Darul Uloom, Vol. 5, P.2261) *The Eid Salah should be [performed in] a huge Jam'ah (congregation) on the outskirts of the town. In this way the brotherhood in Islam (i.e. among Muslims) is manifested. In the big cities it is difficult to have Eidgahs on the outskirts of the city, therefore a large open plain ground should be chosen for the Eidgah. Or if needed, the prayer can be performed in the mosque, which will be correct. But [people should try praying in an Eidgah] as far as possible, [since] one huge Jam'ah is superior to many small Eid [Jam'ahs].(Ahsanul Fatwa, Vol. 4, P. 119) *Performing of the Eid Salah in the Eidgah is [classified as] Sunnah al- Muakkadah (emphasized or substantiated Sunnah). Without any valid excuse, the one who does not perform his Eid Salah in the Eidgah is worthy of being reprimanded and taken to task and this kind of a person is a sinner. If the Eidgah is a distance away and it is inconvenient for the old and sick, then the Fuqaha (Islamic jurists) have given permission for them to perform Eid Salah in the mosque.(Fatwa Rahimiyah, Vol. 1, P.276) List of Eidgahs 14th-century Idgah, built during Tughlaq dynasty rule in Delhi Notable Eidgahs around the world include: *Moradabad Eidgah, Moradabad, Uttar Pradesh, India *Purani Idgah *Id Gah Mosque *Id Kah Mosque, Kashgar, Xinjiang, China *Dhanmondi Shahi Eidgah *Sylhet Shahi Eidgah *Kheri Eidgah *Mahoba Eidgah *Tumkur Eidgah *DMK Eidgah, Barpeta-Bongaigaon, Assam (India). *Sholakiya Eidgah Maidan, Kishoreganj *Gor-E-Shahid Eidgah, Dinajpur =Moradabad Eidgah= The Moradabad Eidgah, Located near by Moradabad railway station.

The shrine was founded over a century ago. It welcomes visitors from all over the world and frequently hosts ceremonies known as Milaad Paaks which are mainly series of sermons from scholars and religious materials presented in solo a capella by people called \\"reciters\\". At the largest of these gatherings (such as the Urs Paak), more than a million visitors crowd the main grounds and the surrounding streets. About four million followers from all over the country and about 500000 more from the United Kingdom are regular visitors to the shrine. The custodian of Eidgah Sharif, Shaykh Hafiz Muhammad Naqib-Ur Rehman, known to his followers as \\"Pir Sa‚Äôab\\", advances the mission and teachings of Eidgah Shareef with the assistance of his son Sahibzada Muhammad Hassan Haseeb Ur Rehman, known to the devotees as \\"Sa‚Äôab Ji\\". Pir Sa‚Äôab's ancestors, the previous custodians of the shrine, were all said to be Sufi masters directly from the lineage of Mughal Emperor Babur. In 1960 the family gifted the government with a large proportion of the land used to build Pakistan's capital city of Islamabad, not far from Rawalpindi.

Stereo Communications Corporation (P.R.). History =In the Virgin Islands= Isaac J. Bahr and George M. Arroyo applied to the Federal Communications Commission for a construction permit to build a new radio station at 106.1 MHz at Frederiksted on St. Croix in the United States Virgin Islands; the application was approved on November 12, 1971. The station began broadcasting June 10, 1973; it was the first radio station in Frederiksted, and the third FM in the Virgin Islands after outlets at Christiansted and Charlotte Amalie. Bahr became the sole licensee in 1976. The city of license was changed from Frederiksted to Christiansted in 1982. Bahr also filed to establish a television station on channel 27, but lost out to another applicant who was preferred on media diversity grounds. The station was an urban contemporary outlet, competing with a number of similar stations; this meant that the station struggled to hold an audience, and further, national advertising accounts showed little interest in the Virgin Islands. One on-air personality at the station was a young Wendy Williams, who started her media career as a DJ at WVIS; in a 2003 memoir, Williams described the station as \\"disorganized\\" and would return to the mainland eight months later after seeing an ad in Radio & Records magazine for a new station starting up in New York, WQHT (103.5 FM). WVIS lost its tower when Hurricane Hugo devastated the Virgin Islands in 1989. =Move to Puerto Rico= In 1995, WVIS was approved to move its city of license and transmitter from the Virgin Islands to Vieques in Puerto Rico, as part of a larger shift of allocations. The move would not come for years and almost did not happen. In August 2002, the FCC declared that WVIS, having been silent more than 12 months, had lost its license under the provisions of Section 312(g) of the Communications Act of 1934; the company sought review, asking the FCC to use discretion granted to it by a 2004 law change, as the facility had been operating intermittently at Christiansted due to damage from four hurricanes, one of which destroyed the station's tower. As a result of the intervening circumstances, and particularly the damage from hurricanes, the FCC in 2006 reinstated the deleted WVIS license on the condition that it file various applications that would have been necessary in the period‚Äîone of them to reflect owner Bahr's 2004 death. The station returned to the air in December 2007; it fully relaunched as Radio Joe on June 28, 2008, with the Radio Joe name in honor of the late Joseph Bahr. It then spent six months off the air after a September 2008 storm caused a power surge, damaging the antenna. WVIS lost electrical service to its transmitter site on Culebra in 2014 when the Autoridad de Energ√≠a El√©ctrica, the Puerto Rico electrical utility, shut off power to co- sited station WJVP, which owned the tower, for nonpayment; as a result, the station applied for and received special temporary authority to operate a low- power transmitter at the studios, located on the main island of Puerto Rico at Luquillo. The Culebra tower was blown down in Hurricane Maria three years later, and in the most recent extension filed in June 2020, V.I. Stereo noted that the hurricane and subsequent earthquakes had created an economic disaster that stalled attempts to locate a new site.

For a number of years before modern roads were built in Pacific County, Washington, the bay was used as the means of travel around the county, by powered and unpowered craft. This article discusses steamboat navigation on Willapa Bay. Operations Nahcotta Washington, 1893, railroad pier and steamboats at dock In 1858, Capt. James H. Whitcomb, a pioneer of the Oregon Territory, obtained a contract to carry mail from Willapa, Washington, a small settlement upstream from modern-day Raymond, where he had a donation land claim, across the Willapa Bay to Oysterville. He ran passengers, freight and mail on the route with the sloops Minerva and Pet, and later the steamboat Favorite. Later, he commanded the steamers Montesano and Tom Morris on Willapa Bay. His son, James P. Whitcomb, built Mountain Buck at Naselle in 1888, which was placed in towing service under his father's command.Newell, Gordon R., ed., H.W. McCurdy Marine History of Pacific Northwest, at page 73, Superior Publishing, Seattle, WA 1966 Another main route was from South Bend, Washington to Nahcotta, Washington, on the Long Beach Peninsula. At Nahcotta, the propeller steamers Shamrock and Reliable would meet the train at the end of the Nahcotta dock, and pick up passengers bound for South Bend across Willapa Bay.Faber, Jim, Steamer's Wake, pages 82-83 (including large photograph of Shamrock), Enetai Press, Seattle, WA (1985) Newell, Gordon, and Williamson, Joe, Pacific Steamboats, page 192 (with photo of Reliable), Bonanza Books, New York, NY (1963) In 1896, another steamer employed on the Willapa Bay run was the Edgar.Feagans, at 34, reprinting advertisement from the Washington Magazine Vessels alt=Shamrock and Reliable 1902 - 1925 In 1875, the steamer General Canby was launched at South Bend.

Reed. Much later, in 1925, when passenger traffic had fallen, Reliable's upper works were cut down and she was converted into a tug.Newell, Gordon R., ed. H.W. McCurdy Marine History of the Pacific Northwest, p. 81, Superior Publishing, Seattle, WA 1966 In 1903, Lauderback & Taylor of Willapa built the steam propeller Laurel for C.A. and James S.

The gamma subunit performs the function of phosphorylase b kinase enzyme, and the other subunits help regulate its activity. This enzyme is found in various tissues, although it is most abundant in the liver and muscles. One version of the enzyme is found in liver cells and another in muscle cells. The gamma-2 subunit produced from the PHKG2 gene is part of the enzyme found in the liver. Phosphorylase b kinase plays an important role in providing energy for cells. The main source of cellular energy is a simple sugar called glucose. Glucose is stored in muscle and liver cells in a form called glycogen. Glycogen can be broken down rapidly when glucose is needed, for instance to maintain normal levels of glucose in the blood between meals. Phosphorylase b kinase turns on (activates) another enzyme called glycogen phosphorylase b by converting it to the more active form, glycogen phosphorylase a.

The Calsarcin-1 isoform is a muscle protein expressed in cardiac muscle and slow-twitch skeletal muscle, which functions to tether calcineurin to alpha-actinin at Z-discs, and inhibit the pathological cardiac hypertrophic response. This differs from the fast- skeletal muscle isoform, calsarcin-2.  Structure  Calsarcin-1 is a 29.9 kDa protein composed of 264 amino acids.http://www.heartproteome.org/copa/ProteinInfo.aspx?QType=Protein%20ID&QValue;=Q9NPC6} Calsarcin-1 and calsarcin-2 are only 31% homologous (94 identical amino acids), exhibiting the highest homology at N- and C-termini. Calsarcin-1 binds to alpha-actinin, gamma-filamin, telethonin, ZASP/Cypher and calcineurin. The binding region of calsarcin-1 to alpha-actinin is localized to amino acids 153-200, and that of calsarcin-1 to calcineurin is amino acids 217-240.  Function  The function of calsarcin-1 in cardiac and slow-skeletal muscle has been illuminated through studies in transgenic animals. Mice lacking the MYOZ2 gene (MYOZ2-/-) are generally sensitized to calcineurin signaling in both muscle types. In slow-skeletal muscle, MYOZ2-/- show increased slow- twitch muscle fibers. In cardiac, MYOZ2-/- show induction of the fetal gene program typical of pathologic hypertrophy, however there was no evidence of hypertrophied morphometry at baseline. However, upon calcineurin activation or pressure overload-induced pathologic hypertrophy, MYOZ2-/- exhibited exaggerated cardiac hypertrophy, demonstrating that calsarcin-1 negatively modulates the function of calcineurin during pathologic hypertrophic remodeling. Additional studies supported these findings in demonstrating that adenoviral overexpression of calsarcin-1 attenuated Gq alpha subunit-stimuated hypertrophy and ANP induction, by Angiotensin II, phenylephrine and endothelin-1 agonists in neonatal cardiomyocytes. Overexpression of calsarcin-1 in mice (CS1Tg) was protective against Angiotensin II-induced pathologic cardiac hypertrophy, evidenced by preserved fractional shortening and contractility, as well as a blunted induction of the fetal hypertrophic gene program and significantly reduced expression of calcineurin-stimulated MCIP1.4 gene expression. Taken together, these studies strongly support a role for calsarcin-1 in suppressing pathologic cardiac hypertrophy.

In 1929, it diversified into importing steel and engineering equipment. In the mid-1930s production of drop forgings commenced with motor dealerships opening in other states.History Australian National Industries In the early 1940s, the largest forging plant in Australia was opened in Lidcombe, producing forgings for the aircraft and munitions industry. Activities expanded and diversified to include general engineering. In February 1951 John McGrath Industries Limited was listed on the Sydney Stock Exchange.

Discovery  Cingulin was originally discovered at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology (Cambridge, UK) by Dr. Sandra Citi, as a protein present in chicken intestinal epithelial cells, that co-purified with non-muscle myosin II and was specifically localized at tight junctions (zonulae occludentes).  Structure & interactions Cingulin is a homodimer, each subunit containing a N-terminal globular \\"head\\" domain, a long Œ±-helical coiled-coil \\"rod\\" domain and a small globular C-terminal \\"tail\\" region. This organization is highly conserved throughout vertebrates. However, cingulin homologs have not been detected in invertebrates. In vitro, cingulin can bind to and bundle actin filaments, and interact with myosin II and several TJ proteins including ZO-1, ZO-2, ZO-3, paracingulin and occludin. Moreover, cingulin forms a complex with JAM-A, a tight junction membrane protein. Most of cingulin protein interactions are through the globular head domain. Cingulin interacts with ZO-1 through an N-terminal ZO-1 interacting motif (ZIM) in its head region. The rod domain is involved in dimerization and interaction with the RhoA activator, GEF-H1. Cingulin has also been found to interact with microtubules (MTs) through the N-terminal head region, and these interactions was regulated by phosphorylation by the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK).  Function  The function of cingulin has been studied by knockout (KO), knockdown (KD) and over-expression approaches. Embryoid bodies derived from embryonic stem cells where one or both cingulin alleles were targeted by homologous recombination show apparently normal tight junctions, but changes in the expression of a large number of genes, including tight junction protein genes (claudin-2, claudin-6, claudin-7 and occludin) and transcription factors (including GATA4). Changes in the expression of claudin-2 and ZO-3 are also observed in cultured kidney cells (MDCK) depleted of cingulin by shRNA. In 2012, the phenotype of cingulin-knockout mice was described, proving that functional TJ in vivo can be formed in the absence of cingulin. Together with paracingulin, cingulin also was reported to regulate claudin-2 expression through RhoA-dependent and independent mechanisms. The role of cingulin in development has been studied by morpholino. oligonucleotide-mediated depletion in chicken, indicating that cingulin is involved in neural crest development. In early mouse and frog embryos, maternal cingulin is localized in the cell cortex. Through early mouse development, cytocortical cingulin in present from oogenesis (cumulus-oocyte contact sites) until 16-cells morulae stage (apical microvillous zones) during early embryogenesis; then maternal cingulin is degraded by endocytic turn-over from the 32-cells stage. Regarding the zygotic cingulin, it accumulates at the tight junctions from 16-cells stage, 10 hours after ZO-1 assembly. Furthermore, the synthesis of cingulin in early mouse embryos is tissue-specific and it occurs in blastocyst (up-regulated in trophectoderm and down-regulated in inner-cells). In Xenopus laevis embryos, maternal cingulin is recruited to apical cell-cell junctions from 2-cells stage.  Homologs  In 2004, a protein homologous to cingulin was discovered and named JACOP (also known as paracingulin, or cingulin-like 1 protein; CGNL1). Human diseases Although cingulin has been involved in regulation of RhoA signaling and gene expression in cultured cells and KO mice, nothing is known about the specific role of cingulin in human diseases. Cingulin expression has been studied in human carcinomas and shown to be expressed in adenocarcinomas and down-regulated in squamous carcinomas. Furthermore, histone deacetylase inhibitors, such as sodium butyrate, strongly upregulate its expression in some cultured cells. Cingulin, as other junctional proteins could be used as a marker of epithelial differentiation, and as a diagnostic marker to distinguish adenocarcinomas from squamous carcinomas.

His rise to power followed three years of anarchy and civil war and restored the state to its previous greatness. His reign witnessed the Carnatic Wars and the Seven Years' War.  Early life  Pratapsinha was born to Tukkoji, the Raja of Thanjavur and a concubine Annapurna. Initially, he was not expected to rule as he was not a legitimate son of the Raja. However, the early demise of the king's eldest son Ekoji II who died after ruling Thanjavur for a year and a period of anarchy which followed thrust Pratap Singh on the forefront of palace intrigues.  Period of Anarchy 1736‚Äì1739  Following Tukkoji's death in 1736, a period of anarchy followed. Ekoji, the king's eldest son and heir apparent succeeded to the throne but died after ruling Thanjavur for a year. However, in spite of his poor health, Ekoji offered a determined resistance to Chanda Sahib who invaded Thanjavur during the former's short reign and forced him to retreat to Tiruchirapalli. Ekoji died in 1737 succeeded by his wife Sujana Bai. Sayyid, the Governor of the Thanjavur Fort, rose into prominence during this period as a kingmaker and actively participated in court intrigues promoting one puppet ruler after another to the throne. He imprisoned Sujanbai in 1738 when the latter questioned his authority. Shahuji returned in 1738 and ruled for about a year. In February 1739, Chanda Sahib forced Shahuji to cede Karaikal to the French and in April, the Raja confirmed the Grant. In July 1739, Shahuji prevented the French from landing in Karaikal. This resulted in invasion of Thanjavur by Chanda Sahib who captured Shahuji and imprisoned him on the pretext that he was not the actual Shahuji but an impostor. The Dutch East India Company based at Nagapattinam sent home the following report on the events at Thanjavur:  Reign  Pratapsinha ascended the throne in 1739. He was the last ruler of Thanjavur to be referred in the official records of the English East India Company as \\"His Majesty\\". As soon as Pratapsinha ascended the throne he had to contend with the intrigues of the pretender Shahuji in the company of a treacherous Maratha noble Koyaji Kattigai.K. R. Subramanian, Pg 48 It was also evident that the conspirators were in league with Sayyid.K. R. Subramanian, Pg 49 So immediately after ascending the throne, Pratapsingh ordered the death of Sayyid. In 1748, the pretender Shahuji sent an envoy, first to PuducherryK. R. Subramanian, Pg 50 and then to Fort St. David to negotiate terms of alliance with the French East India Company. The British East India Company initially supported Pratapsingh but switched sides when Shahuji offered the fort of Devikottai at the mouth of the Coleroon river.K. R. Subramanian, Pg 51 The British sent two expeditions against Devikkottai which was defended by a garrison of 5,000 men. Their first attempt was a complete failure while the second ended in a truce. The second expedition was remarkable as the one in which Lawrence and Clive distinguished themselves.K. R. Subramanian, Pg 52 The War was brought to an end by the treaty of friendship between Pratapsingh and the Company. Devikkottai was made over to the English as per the provisions of the treaty. In the early part of his reign, Pratapsinha also had to deal with the imperious attitude of Dost Ali, the Nawab of the Carnatic. Pratapsinha was soon deposed by Dost Ali who took over the administration of Thanjavur. But a Maratha invasion from the north brought about the death of Dost Ali and the restoration of Pratapsingh. The Maratha troops left after making one Murari Rao the ruler of Tiruchirapalli with whom Pratapsinha was in bad terms. Soon afterwards, the Nizam of Hyderabad sent a formidable force to Thanjavur to exact tribute. Two other expeditions forced the Raja into submission. The third and final expedition of the Nizam of Hyderabad in 1742, resulted in the deposition of Murari Rao and the annexation of Tiruchirapalli. As a result of this campaign, Thanjavur was forced to become a vassal of Hyderabad and pay annual tribute. = The Seven Years' War = During the Seven Years' War, Pratapsingh supported the English with arms and supplies. At Lawrences' behest, the great Thanjavur general Manoji took Coillady from the French and captured Chanda Sahib and beheaded him.K. R. Subramanian, Pg 53 However, the confederacy broke when Nanja Raja realized that he had been deceived by Muhammad Ali who had promised to give him Tiruchirapalli as per an early arrangement.K. R. Subramanian, Pg 54 Pratapsingh supported his cause when the French under Dupleix tried to threaten him. Muhammad Ali and Murari Rao forged an alliance with the French. In 1758, Lally marched to Thanjavur from Karaikal in order to force Thanjavur into subjugation but was repulsed by Manoji. He had to retreat with an insignificant plunder at Nagore when an English fleet made its appearance off the coast at Karaikal. The Thanjavur troops supported by a small English contingent harassed the French who eventually succumbed to starvation. The British inflicted a crshing defeat on the French in the siege of Puducherry in 1761.K. R. Subramanian, Pg 55 This dealt a death-blow to the French power in India. = Loss of Independence = From the onset, the Nawab of Carnatic Muhammad Ali Khan Wallajah wasn't in good terms with Pratapsingh and desired to annex Thanjavur. However, for the sake of their common interests, Pratapsinha maintained an uneasy alliance with Muhammad Ali. Matters reached a boiling point after the Seven Years' War. However, their common ally, the British East India, averted a crisis by stepping in to mediate a truce in 1762. The Raja agreed to pay twenty lakhs as arrears and an annual tribute of four lakhs to the Nawab of Carnatic. In return, Coiladdy and Yelengadu were ceded to Thanjavur. Notwithstanding allegations of partiality on part of the British, this treaty practically ended Thanjavur's independence. = Border disputes with Ramnad = There were frequent border disputes with the state of Ramnad on the Aranthangi frontier. Actively supported by the Tondaiman of Pudukkottai, Manoji once led a large army into the territory of the Sethupathy of Ramnad and even captured Aranthangi. The Nawab of Carnatic who was the actual overlord to whom Thanjavur paid tribute, stepped in and stopped the Raja from pursuing further hostilities.  Death  Pratapsinha died on 16 December 1763K. R.

Function  The gene CHD8 encodes the protein chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 8, which is a chromatin regulator enzyme that is essential during fetal development. CHD8 is an ATP dependent enzyme. The protein contains an Snf2 helicase domain that is responsible for the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP. CHD8 encodes for a DNA helicase that function as a transcription repressor by remodeling chromatin structure by altering the position of nucleosomes. CHD8 negatively regulates Wnt signaling. Wnt signaling is important in the vertebrate early development and morphogenesis. It is believed that CHD8 also recruits the linker histone H1 and causes the repression of Œ≤-catenin and p53 target genes. The importance of CHD8 can be observed in studies where CHD8-knockout mice died after 5.5 embryonic days because of widespread p53 induced apoptosis.  Clinical significance  Mutations in this gene have been linked to a subset of autism cases. Mutations in CHD8 could lead to upregulation of Œ≤-catenin-regulated genes, in some part of the brain this upregulation can cause brain overgrowth also known as macrocephaly, which occurs in 15-35% of autistic children. Some studies have determined the role of CHD8 in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). CHD8 expression significantly increases during human mid-fetal development. The chromatin remodeling activity and its interaction with transcriptional regulators have shown to play an important role in ASD aetiology.

Reign  Tukkoji succeeded bis brother Serfoji I to the throne of Thanjavur on the former's death in 1728 and is believed to have reigned until 1736. However, the available records don't agree with each other. While the Tanjore Marathi inscriptions assign eight years to his rule the Madras Tamil manuscript assigns only 6 years. Tukkoji concluded the Marava war commenced by Serfoji I. Unlike his brother, however, he switched over to Bhavani Shankar's side and helped the latter attain the throne. Marathi inscriptions of this period record Tukkoji's aid to Meenakshi the Queen of Tiruchirapalli against the Palaiyakkarar who rose in revolt against her. He also fought against Chanda Sahib on the side of the Hindu rajas of South India. Chanda Sahib's first expedition in 1734 was bought off. But the second expedition in 1736 resulted in the fall of Tiruchirapalli. Tukkoji was a good linguist. He is also credited with having introduced Hindusthani music in Thanjavur. He wrote a work on music called Sangeetha Samamrita. His minister Ghansyama Pandit wrote a commentary on the Uttaramacharitra of Bhavabhuti.  Death and succession  Tukkoji died in 1736. He left behind one legitimate son Ekoji who succeeded to the throne on the death of his father. But he ruled for not more than a year. However he had a number of offspring from his concubines. A three-year-long period of anarchy followed his death. It came to an end only with the accession of Pratapsingh in 1739.

Function  SIM1 and SIM2 genes are homologs of Drosophila melanogaster single-minded (sim), so named because cells in the midline of the sim mutant embryo fail to properly develop and eventually die, and thus the paired longitudinal axon bundles that span the anterior-posterior axis of the embryo (analogous to the embryo's spinal cord) are collapsed into a \\"single\\" rudimentary axon bundle at the midline. Sim is a basic helix-loop-helix-PAS domain transcription factor that regulates gene expression in the midline cells. Since the sim gene plays an important role in Drosophila development and has peak levels of expression during the period of neurogenesis, it was proposed that the human SIM2 gene, which resides in a critical region of chromosome 21, is a candidate for involvement in certain dysmorphic features (particularly facial and skull characteristics), abnormalities of brain development, and/or mental retardation of Down syndrome.  Clinical significance  Haploinsufficiency of SIM1 has been shown to cause severe early-onset obesity in a human girl with a de novo balanced translocation between chromosomes 1p22.1 and 6q16.2 and has been suggested to cause a Prader-Willi-like phenotype in other cases. Additionally, studies in mice have shown that haploinsufficieny of Sim1 causes obesity that is due to hyperphagia and do not respond properly to increased dietary fat. Overexpression of SIM1 protects against diet induced obesity and rescues the hyperphagia of agouti yellow mice, who have disrupted melanocortin signaling. The obesity and hyperphagia may be mediated by impaired melanocortin activation of PVN neurons and oxytocin deficiency in these mice. It has been demonstrated that modulating Sim1 levels postnatally also leads to hyperphagia and obesity, suggesting a physiological role for Sim1 separate from its role in development.

Gene location  BCL11B is located on human chromosome 14p32.2. The mouse analogue is called Rit1 or Bcl11b and is located on mouse chromosome 12.  Function  This gene encodes a C2H2-type zinc finger protein and is closely related to BCL11A, a gene whose translocation may be associated with B-cell malignancies. The specific function of this gene has not yet been determined, but it could also be involved in some malignancies. Two alternatively spliced transcript variants, which encode distinct isoforms, have been reported. Recent research suggests that BCL11B is crucial for ameloblasts (the cells that produce tooth enamel) to form and work properly.  Interactions  BCL11B has been shown to interact with COUP-TFI.  Pathology  BCL11B is closely connected with immune regulation and for so its mutation can lead to a SCID phenotype. This so-called Immunodeficiency 49 (OMIM #617237) is classified as T-B+NK+ SCID. It is characterised by a lack of T lymphocytes and its malfunctioning specifically in proliferative response. On the other hand, B cells and NK cells counts and functions are not impaired. The symptoms of SCID caused by BCL11B mutation - apart from immunity defects - typically include teeth abnormalities, craniofacial dimorphism, different types of dermatitis. As well the intellectual development is significantly impaired. The disease has a very early onset and the only known treatment is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from a healthy donor. The immunodeficiency has a dominant negative mode of inheritance as all so far described patients suffering from it has been after sequencing identified as heterozygotes in the BCL11B gene.  Research projects  A mouse model based study showed, that Bcl11b also plays an important role in pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. Bcl11b gene knock-out in certain T cell population led to development of IBD. The mechanisms behind are supposed to be reduced suppressor activity of T regulatory cells and changes in cytokine environment. Bcl11b is suspected to interact with Foxp3 and IL10 gene promoters and thus impair its suppressive function in the intestines. Bcl11b (mouse analogue of human BCL11B) has been proven to contribute to malignant growth for example in case of mouse lymphomas. That is suspected to be caused by interaction with p53, a well-known tumor suppressor gene.

Structure Sodium/bile acid cotransporters are integral membrane glycoproteins. Human NTCP contains 349 amino acids and has a mass of 56 kDa.  Function  Bile acid:sodium symporters participate in the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids. Two homologous transporters are involved in the reabsorption of bile acids. One of these absorbs bile acids from the intestinal lumen, the bile duct, and the kidney with an apical localization (ileal sodium/bile acid cotransporter). The other is this protein and is expressed in the basolateral membranes of hepatocytes (NTCP). As a cotransporter, NTCP binds two sodium ions and one (conjugated) bile salt molecule, thereby providing a hepatic influx of bile salts. Other transported molecules include steroid hormones, thyroid hormones and various xenobiotics: =Hepatitis virus entry= NTCP is a cell surface receptor necessary for the entry of hepatitis B and hepatitis D virus. This entry mechanism is inhibited by myrcludex B, cyclosporin A, progesterone, propranolol, bosentan, ezetimibe, as well as NTCP substrates like taurocholate, tauroursodeoxycholate and bromosulfophthalein. =SLC10A1-deficiency= Individuals that lack functional NTCP have been identified. These individuals display highly elevated bile salt levels in plasma, but without a clear phenotype. In areas of the world with a high prevalence of HBV, there are multiple individuals who carry the NTCP p.S267F polymorphism on both alleles; this makes NTCP inactive as a bile acid transporter, but provides protection against HBV infection. NTCP-deficient mice have also been created. These mice have reduced hepatic bile salt uptake but plasma bile salt levels are less clearly elevated, as the rodent-specific OATP1a/1b transporters provide can partially replace the function of NTCP. Nevertheless, this NTCP-knockout animal model pointed to possible additional (non-HBV) aspects of NTCP-deficiency. NTCP-deficient mice are partially protected against the problems associated with a high-calorie diet, including excessive weight gain and to liver damage in cholestasis. These effects of NTCP deficiency have not yet been replicated in humans.

He succeeded his father, Biswa Singha. Under him the Koch kingdom reached its cultural and political zenith. Under his rule, and under the military command of his brother Chilarai, he was able to subjugate the entire Brahmaputra valley, including the Ahom kingdom; besides the Kachari, Tripura and Manipur kingdoms, as well as the Khyrem, Jaintia and others. This influence was halted when he faced Suleman Karranni of Bengal. He introduced a silver coin, called the Narayani, that greatly influenced the numismatics of Assam. He gave Srimanta Sankardeva the first royal patronage to Ekasarana Dharma. Ascension At the time of his father's death, Naranaryan and his step brother, Chilarai, were in Varanasi and another brother, Nara Singha, succeed the throne. Malladev, as he was then known, hastened back with Chilarai and with the help of their supporters among the courtier, took over the throne. Nara Singha was pursued, who escaped first to the Morung kingdom,Morung is the Terai region west of the Mechi river, to the west of the Koch kingdom. and thence to Nepal and finally Kashmir. Malladev ascended the throne in 1540, in the same year that his father had died, and acquired the title Narayan, which was to become the dynastic title of his succeeding kings. He issued coins, and his seal was made. He appointed his step-brother Chilarai (then known as Sukladhwaj) the yuvaraj (somewhat akin to \\"prime minister\\") and the commander-in-chief of the military. Kingdom expansion The Koch kingdom was a tributary the eastern Ahom kingdom and soon after his ascension began preparing to throw off the vassalage. A border tiff at Sala, just above Kaliabar escalated in 1546 with three step-brothers forging ahead into the Ahom kingdom, to meet with their deaths. After a series of battles with varying fortunes, the Koch army was defeated by the Ahoms, then under Suklenmung (1539‚Äì1552) who personally led the military, at the Battle of Pichala in 1547. This was followed by a period of calm and preparation. = Preparations = A section of Gohain Kamal Ali The preparations for a push east was made slowly and deliberately. After the reverses of Biswa Singha in 1547 due to logistics, and his own in 1547, he made calculated moves. He sent a diplomatic mission in 1555 to court of the new Ahom king Sukhaamphaa (1552‚Äì1603) to gather information about its state. Nara Narayan had his step- brother, Kamal Narayan, surreptitious lay a road (called Gohain Kamal Ali) along the foothills of the eastern Himalayas from the capital to the eastern frontier. He consolidated his alliance with the tribal groups, with the help of whom his father had established the kingdom and decreed that their religious practice should prevail north of the Gohain Kamal Ali.\\"He further instructed the Meches and the Koches living to the north of the Gohain Kamal Ali to follow their tribal customs, but in the territory south of this road as far as the Brahmaputra, Brahmanic rites were to be continued.\\" He also was able to receive the alliance of the Bhuyans, who were inimical to his father, Biswa Singha. Finally, in the later part of 1562 Chilarai, the commander, marched at the head of a 60,000 strong force, with Naranarayan at the rear. And as he marched, he obtained the support of the Mech , Kacharis, Bhutiya, Dafla, Bhuyans and Brahmins and reached Barnadi. Some princes of the erstwhile Chutiya kingdom also submitted their support. Naranarayan forced his way strongly into the Ahom kingdom, and set up camp at Majuli. = Conquests = By April 1563 the Ahom king Sukhaamphaa had to abandon his capital, which was then occupied by the Koch Koch army. The Treaty of Majuli was settled, which established the Koch hegemony in the Brahmaputra valley and extended the boundary in the east to Narayanpur. On the way back, Chalarai halted at Maibang, where the Kachari king, Durlabhnarayan (1525‚Äì1580) submitted without a fight. Chilarai established Gohain Kamal as a governor at Brahmapur (Khaspur) and left a contingent of soldier, who later came to be called Dehan. This was followed by the submission of the Manipuri king. The Jaintia king, gave fight and was slain, and his son was established as the king. After the Jaintia campaign, Chilarai marched against the Tippera kingdom. At Langai in 1567, the Tripura king, Ananta Manikya, was killed along with 18,000 of his soldiers, and his brother was placed on the throne. The Khairam raja, a Khasi chief of Nongkhrem, too submitted. Chilarai found a tougher foe in the Governor of Sylhet, allied with Suleiman Karrani then engaged in an expedition in Odisha; but he was killed after a prolonged three-day battle via a stratagem, and his brother was placed after extracting tribute from him. The two brothers then returned to their capital via Dimarua and Raha.  Division of the kingdom  In 1581 Raghu Deva, the son of his brother Shukladhvaj became the de facto ruler of the eastern part of his kingdom Koch Hajo, though under suzerainty of his uncle. After the death of Nara Narayan, he declared his independence. Nara Narayan's son Lakshmi Narayan succeeded him after his death, but only inherited the western part of his kingdom Koch Bihar. On 23 December 1596 Man Singh I married Nara Narayan's daughter Kshamadevi. Maharaj Nara Narayan is known as the 'Vikramaditya' of Kamrup. Nara Narayan was a noted patron of literature. Apart from Sankardeva, a galaxy of saints and scholars freely studied art, culture and literature at Coochbehar making it a centre of Vaishnavite learning and teaching. They also brightened Maharaja Naranarayan's Royal court. For the housewives, Madhabdeva wrote Janma Rahashya following the request of Kamalapriya,the wife of Chilarai. Chilarai, younger brother of Nara Narayan requested Ram Saraswati to translate the verses from the Mahabharata. He also encouraged asked Sridhar to write Jyotish Sastra. Following his request, Bakul Kayastha wrote Lilavati, a landmark on mathematics. During Nara Narayan's reign, Purushottam Vidyavagish wrote the Prayogaratnamala, a treatise on Sanskrit grammar. A scholar par excellence, Chilarai himself wrote an analytical annotation of poet Joydeva's Geet Govinda as Sarabatisar and left an indelible imprint in Sanskrit literature. Notes References .

Function  The correlation of anti-sperm antibodies with cases of unexplained infertility implicates a role for these antibodies in blocking fertilization. Improved diagnosis and treatment of immunologic infertility, as well as identification of proteins for targeted contraception, are dependent on the identification and characterization of relevant sperm antigens. The protein expressed by this gene is recognized by anti-sperm agglutinating antibodies from an infertile woman. Furthermore, immunization of female rats with the recombinant human protein reduced fertility. This protein localizes to the plasma membrane of germ cells in the testis and to the post-acrosomal plasma membrane of mature spermatozoa. Recombinant polypeptide binds GTP and exhibits GTPase activity. Thus, this protein may regulate GTP signal transduction pathways involved in spermatogenesis and fertilization. Two transcript variants of this gene encode the same protein.

Before the development of modern road and rail networks, transportation on the coast of Oregon was largely water-borne. This article focuses on inland steamboats and similar craft operating in, from south to north on the coast: Rogue River, Coquille River, Coos Bay, Umpqua River, Siuslaw Bay, Yaquina Bay, Siletz River, and Tillamook Bay. The boats were all very small, nothing like the big sternwheelers and propeller boats that ran on the Columbia River or Puget Sound. There were many of them, however, and they came to be known as the \\"mosquito fleet.\\" Routes and operations =Rogue River= The Rogue River meets the Pacific Ocean at Gold Beach, and flows all the way from the Cascade Mountains. R. D. Hume was a pioneering businessman at Wedderburn and Gold Beach, then known as Ellensburg. By 1881, he had established a fish cannery and built a steam schooner, Mary D. Hume, to support the cannery operation. Hume was still conducting steamboat operations on the Rogue River in 1901, and in that year, Capt. E.D. Burns built the sternwheel steamboat Rogue River in Portland, and brought her down the coast to compete against Hume's operation. Mary D. Hume passed through several owners and was still in operation as late as 1939, when she was the oldest commercial vessel in service in the Pacific Northwest. In November 1902, Burns succeeded in reaching deep inland on the Rogue to Agness, however, in returning to Gold Beach, on November 16, 1902 the boat struck a rock at Boiler Rapids, where, at least in 1966, her boiler was reported to be still visible. This was the only known effort to take a conventional vessel so far up the Rogue River. In 1903 the gasoline-powered Success was built at Gold Beach for the Rogue River service. R.D. Hume continued his interest in shipping out of the Rogue River, commissioning the construction in 1908 of two small gasoline- powered schooners, Enterprise (22 tons) and Osprey (43 tons) from Ellingson in Coquille. Hume died by 1912, as his estate is reported to have sold Enterprise and Osprey to someone from Portland.Newell, Gordon R., ed., H.W. McCurdy Marine History of the Pacific Northwest, at 2, 61, 70, 83, 92, 119, 147-49, 162, 190, 202, 207, 244, 268, 311, 340, 343-44, 363, and 554, Superior Publishing, Seattle, WA 1966 =Coquille River= Coquille River The Coquille River runs inland from Bandon. Before the era of railroads and later automobiles, the Coquille River was the major transportation route from Bandon to Coquille and Myrtle Point in southern Coos County. =Coos Bay= sidewheel steamboat Coos, sometime before 1895 Coos Bay is a large and mostly shallow harbor on Oregon's southwest coast, to the north of the Coquille River valley. It is the major harbor on the west coast of the United States between San Francisco and the mouth of the Columbia River. Two steamboat captains from the Columbia River began steamboat operations on Coos Bay in 1873. Inland riverboats were used to navigate the bay and the several rivers flow that flow into it. A mule-hauled portage was built between a shallow southern arm of Coos Bay and the Beaver Slough, a shallow north-extending branch of the Coquille River, in 1869; it was replaced in 1874 with a steam portage railroad. This connection established a convenient link between the steamboat operations of Coos Bay and those on the Coquille. Numerous steamboats were built over the ensuing decades. In 1912, a number of steamboats were wrecked, by collision, fire and grounding on the sandbar at the mouth of the bay. =Umpqua River= The Umpqua River runs from Reedsport up through Douglas County. Gardiner is a town near the mouth of the Umpqua where several river steamers were built. One of the Umpqua River's several branches eventually reaches Roseburg, although the head of navigation was Scottsburg. Captain Godfrey Seymour began steamboat operations on the Umpqua River with Raftsman, later adding Washington, Swan, and Enterprise. Swan was unique as the only steamboat to ever ascend as far as Roseburg on the Umpqua. This was in 1870, when the merchants of Gardiner were anxious to demonstrate the navigability of this river. Roseburg is 85 miles above the mouth of the river, and it took Swan 11 days to get there. This was sufficient to persuade Congress to allocate $70,000 for channel clearance of the Umpqua, even though no other steamboat ever again ran up to Roseburg.Timmen, Fritz, Blow for the Landing, at 189, 200-207, Caxton Printers, Caldwell, ID 1972 In 1906, the propeller steamer Juno (32 tons) was built at Marshfield and placed on the Umpqua River service by the Umpqua River Steam Navigation Company. *Scottsburg landing on Umpqua River, circa 1900, showing passengers and a number of small vessels =Siuslaw Bay and River= Siuslaw Bay is yet another large shallow bay on the Oregon coast, with its entrance about 24 miles north of the mouth of the Umpqua River. The Siuslaw River widens into the bay, which meets the ocean near the town of Florence. In 1890 or thereabouts, the Moonlight was placed in service on Siuslaw Bay and its various back channels. *waterfront of Florence, Oregon, on Suislaw Bay, 1927 =Yaquina Bay= Steamer Newport, with barge lashed on, and launch Beaver departing Newport for Yaquina, circa 1910 Yaquina Bay, like Coos Bay, is another shallow coastal bay on the Oregon Coast. The principal town on Yaquina Bay is Newport. Once the Oregon Pacific Railroad reached Toledo, on the east end of Yaquina Bay, tourists started coming to the bay from the Willamette Valley. The roads were bad or nonexistent at the time, so the only way to the seaside hotels at Newport was to cross the Yaquina Bay by steamer. Propeller steamboats did most of this service, however in 1872, the sidewheeler Oneatta was launched at Pioneer, ran on the bay for a while and then was transferred to the Columbia River, and in 1882, to Humboldt Bay.Newell, Gordon, and Williamson, Joe, Pacific Steamboats, at 47, Superior Publishing, Seattle WA 1958, state that Oneatta was transferred to Humboldt Bay and don't mention service on the Columbia River Later, Rebecca C. and Cleveland also ran on Yaquina Bay. =Siletz River= The Siletz River runs into the Pacific about 30 miles north of Yaquina Bay, near the town of Taft now part of Lincoln City. The first salmon cannery was established on the Siletz River in 1896 by Daniel Kern, a Portlander. This was Kerns Bros. Packing Co., on the north side of the river. Later that same year the post office of Kernville was established in the same location, where a small town later developed. Kern brought in the small steamer Tonquin, 64' long, built at Portland, to act as a cannery tender and supply vessel. Kern later sold his cannery to Elmore Packing, of Astoria, and went into the marine construction business. Much later, the Siletz Navigation Company operated on the Siletz, at least in the early 1920s. In 1923, Siletz (93 tons), described as a \\"strongly built diesel freighter\\" was launched at Kernville, Oregon, to serve local routes from the Siletz river entrance. This boat was probably more of an ocean-going vessel than the typical mosquito fleet craft, as she was sold to a Hawaii firm and voyaged there herself in 19 days without mishap. =Tillamook Bay= Bay Ocean, probably off the coast of Oregon Tillamook Bay was a large very shallow bay on the northern part of the Oregon Coast. In 1911, the yacht Bay Ocean was built in Portland to provide service from Portland to Tillamook Bay for a beach resort. Bay Ocean was designed by R.A. Ballin for the T.B. Potter real estate company, which was developing the (eventually ill-fated) resort at Bay Ocean Spit on Tillamook Bay. Bay Ocean was the largest motor passenger vessel built to that date on the Pacific Coast. She was long (150') and narrow (18' beam), with a clipper bow and bowsprit. She had three gasoline engines connected to a single shaft. She could accommodate 50 passengers on the Portland-Tillamook route but had difficulty on the run and only served in the summer. She was called up by the navy to function as a patrol boat in the First World War. After the war, Bay Ocean was sold to Crowley Launch and Tug Co., of San Francisco. *cannery tender Susan E. Elmore entering Tillamook Bay *steamers Harrison and Susan E. Elmore at dock in Tillamook Last operations Mosquito fleet operations in the Coos Bay area and Coquille River valley continued up into the 1930s, due to the lack of good roads and other more modern transportation in these areas. As possibly the extreme example, the small (14 tons) gasoline-propeller Welcome, built 1919, was on the run up the Coos River from Marshfield to Allegany until 1948. Steamboat graveyards When steamboat service ended on the Coquille, at least three steamers, Myrtle, Telegraph, and Dora were all beached on the river near Bandon.Marshall, Don, Oregon Shipwrecks, at 45,97 and 220, Binford & Mort, Portland, OR 1984 The Mary D. Hume, built in 1881, is still largely intact, lying on the shore at Gold Beach, Oregon. The wreck itself is on the National Register of Historic Places. The steam ferry Roosevelt, which used to run on Coos Bay, was photographed abandoned near Marshfield in 1941. *wreck of Roosevelt, steam ferry, near Marshfield List of vessels A large number of boats of all types were built on these waters, powered by various means, including steam, gasoline, and diesel engines.

It is the site of the Barvikha Sanatorium, the health resort of the President of Russia. During the Soviet era, Barvikha was known as the site of the most desirable state dachas for government officials and leading intellectuals, and many of Russia's wealthiest individuals have built private luxury dachas here since the late 1990s. Geography The village lies on the Rublyovo-Uspenskoye road leading to the west from Moscow, just outside the Moscow Ring Road and the boundaries of the city of Moscow. There is a Barvikha rail station on a spur of the Belarus direction of the Moscow Railway, first opened at the current site in 1927. Barvikha is surrounded by a zone of pine forest nature preserve on the south bank of the Moscow River. History Two villages, Lutskaya () and Shulgina () existed in the area where modern Barvikha now stands. Later they grew and merged into a settlement, which was originally called Samynki (), after the Saminka River, on which the settlement stood. Over time, the name changed to Borikha () and later‚Äîto Barvikha. By 1890, the population of the village consisted of almost 100 people. Sanatorium Dmitry Medvedev and Hugo Chavez at Barvikha Castle Barvikha contains the Barvikha Sanatorium, a well-equipped medical center which treated several Russian leaders. The sanatorium was designed by architect Boris Iofan, and completed in 1935. It was designated as a clinic for leading government officials suffering from illnesses of digestion and metabolism; it was there that Bulgarian leader Georgi Dimitrov died in 1949. In 1944 and 1945, writer and Communist Party official Aleksandr Shcherbakov was treated at Barvikha for cardiac illness. He died of heart failure in 1945. In 1952, Shcherbakov's death became one of the issues in Doctors' Plot affair. The deputy director of the medical department of the sanitarium, Roman Ryzhikov, was arrested and interrogated, but later released. In 1961 the American singer Paul Robeson was treated there for several months. Today the sanatorium is owned by the Administration of Affairs of the President of the Russian Federation. It provides deluxe accommodations and high-quality medical services. Its grounds include a lake that offers fishing and swimming in the summer. The first President of Russia, Boris Yeltsin, made frequent stays at the sanatorium during his second presidential term and retirement. From 1996 until his death in April 2007, his primary residence was the Gorki-9 () presidential dacha on the Rublyovo-Uspenskoye Road, not far from Barvikha. This allowed quick access to the sanatorium's medical facilities. Dachas The Rublyovo-Uspenskoye Road, colloquially known as the Rublyovka, has long been a site for dachas. During the Soviet period, prominent officials and intellectuals often used state-owned dachas in the vicinity of Barvikha. Writer Aleksey Tolstoy and his family occupied a state-owned dacha in Barvikha from 1938 through his death in 1945. Development Beginning in the late 1990s, Barvikha has become a popular site for the dachas of wealthy residents of Moscow. In contrast to the traditional wood-built dachas, these new, privately owned cottages are often much larger and include mansion-like residences with full amenities and private security. The rapid development has substantially increased property values and has generated some friction with long-term local residents. The Barvikha Luxury Village, a high-end shopping center including Ferrari and Harley-Davidson dealerships, opened in 2005. Deposed national leaders In December 2012, the town was called a \\"magnet for deposed leaders given asylum in Russia\\" by a New York Times writer, who suggested that Barvikha might become the new home of Syria‚Äôs president, Bashar al-Assad. Former leaders in the town reported by the NYT included Askar Akayev, formerly the president of Kyrgyzstan, Aslan Abashidze of Adjara, and the wife and family members of Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá. After fleeing his country in the wake of the Euromaidan protests in 2014, former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych reportedly moved into a $52 million residence in the town as well.

It is an N-glycosylated transmembrane 72 kDa glycoprotein containing eight leucine-rich repeats. 5T4 is often referred to as an oncofetal antigen due to its expression in foetal trophoblast (where it was first discovered) or trophoblast glycoprotein (TPBG). 5T4 is found in tumors including the colorectal, ovarian, and gastric. Its expression is used as a prognostic aid in these cases. It has very limited expression in normal tissue but is widespread in malignant tumours throughout their development. One study found that 5T4 was present in 85% of a cohort of 72 colorectal carcinomas and in 81% of a cohort of 27 gastric carcinomas. Its confined expression appears to give 5T4 the potential to be a target for T cells in cancer immunotherapy.

Function  Centromere and kinetochore proteins play a critical role in centromere structure, kinetochore formation, and sister chromatid separation. The protein encoded by this gene colocalizes with inner kinetochore plate proteins CENP-A and CENP-C in both interphase and metaphase. CENP-H is required for the localisation of CENP-C, but not CENP-A, to the centromere. However, it may be involved in the incorporation of newly synthesised CENP-A into centromeres via its interaction with the CENP-A/CENP-HI complex. CENP-H localizes outside of centromeric heterochromatin, where CENP-B is localized, and inside the kinetochore corona, where CENP-E is localized during prometaphase. It is thought that this protein can bind to itself, as well as to CENP-A, CENP-B or CENP-C. Multimers of the protein localize constitutively to the inner kinetochore plate and play an important role in the organization and function of the active centromere-kinetochore complex. CENP-H contains a coiled-coil structure and a nuclear localisation signal. Studies show that CENP-H may be associated with certain human cancers.

While Lillian Gish portrayed a prostitute in The Enemy, this was acceptable as prostitution was not explicitly barred so long as it was not forced (i.e., white slavery) and aspects of her work were not shown in the film.

She is Professor of History at the University of Oslo and was acting Director of Peace Research Institute Oslo from 1992 to 1993. Waage is an expert on the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict and Norway‚ÄìIsrael relations. Career Waage took the Cand.philol. degree at the University of Oslo in 1987 and the Dr.philos. degree in 1997, both in history. She became a professor at the University of Oslo in 2007. Before this, Waage worked at the Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO), mostly as a researcher but also as acting director (September 1992 ‚Äì April 1993) and deputy director (1996‚Äì2005).University of Oslo Waage has produced foundational contributions to Norwegian scholarship on Norway's role in the Oslo process of Israeli- Palestinian negotiations during the early to mid-1990s.Hilde Henriksen Waage, Peacemaking Is a Risky Business: Norway‚Äôs Role in the Peace Process in the Middle East, 1993‚Äì96 (Oslo: PRIO, 2004) She has also been critical of the doctoral thesis of former Norwegian State Secretary Jan Egeland, who was intimately involved with the Oslo negotiations, and has used the Oslo process to demonstrate what she calls \\"the limits of third-party mediation by a small state in highly asymmetrical conflicts,\\" in contradiction to Egeland's thesis.Postscript to Oslo: The Mystery of Norway's Missing Files , Journal of Palestine Studies, Vol. XXXVIII, No. 1 (Autumn 2008) Part of the Oslo process involved the famous back-channel negotiations, which were mediated by Norway. In 2001, Waage was commissioned by the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) to conduct a comprehensive study of this back channel. In order to carry out the research, she was granted privileged access to all relevant, still- classified files in the ministry‚Äôs archives. The MFA had been at the heart of the Oslo process, but when Waage set to work at the archives she was surprised to discover \\"not a single scrap of paper for the entire period from January to September 1993‚Äîprecisely the period of the backchannel talks.\\" Such documentation does exist, and has been quoted by Israeli accounts of the Oslo process, but attempts to uncover it have failed, and significant amounts of documentation held by, inter alia, former Foreign Minister Johan J√∏rgen Holst has been refused access to. Waage and others speculate that such documentation has been kept hidden for party-political reasons, to avoid upsetting Israeli and US sensitivities about Israel's stance during the Oslo process, and for the vested interests of the Norwegian officials involved: Waage describes Norway under the guidance of Terje R√∏d-Larsen, his wife Mona Juul, Jan Egeland and Johan J√∏rgen Holst as \\"Israel's helpful errand boy.\\" Waage divides her country's role at Oslo into two phases. In the first, \\"the Norwegians played only the role of a very modest facilitator\\"; however, during the second, from May 1993 after the Israelis upgraded the status of the Oslo talks: Waage also comments about the real power that Norway had in the meetings. She in the last paragraph of her paper \\"Postscript to Oslo\\" says that: > Without the power to impose solutions, and above all dependent on the > stronger party, the weak state mediator in unequal contests must rely > heavily on ‚Äúprocess symmetry,‚Äù where the two sides are treated with absolute > equality, provided with exactly the same accommodations, allotted exactly > the same amount of time to make their case, and so on. The Norwegians went > to great lengths to achieve this symmetry (as did the Americans in their > mediating efforts between Palestinians and Israelis, albeit for different > reasons). The problem with process symmetry is that it cannot address the > power asymmetry that inevitably distorts the outcome of negotiations. > Process symmetry and the entrie [sic] facilitative exercise can create a > sense of equality between adversaries and the illusion of genuine > communication, even trust. The Norwegians believed that through dialogue and > a gradual building of trust, an irreversible peace dynamic would be created > that could push the process forward to solution. The problem with this > entire approach is that the issue is not one of trust, but of power. The > facilitative process masks that reality. In the end, the results that can be > achieved by a weak third-party facilitator are no more than the strong party > will allow. Short of unusual generosity or truly far-sighted vision, such a > solution can only be unbalanced and unfair, and therefore ultimately > unsustainable. The question to be asked is whether such a model can ever be > appropriate. Critics Waage was criticized both by With Israel for Peace and in Twitter for her moderate approach of how security forces should deal with terrorists.

It is involved in protein, nucleic acid, carbohydrate, and lipid metabolism, as well as in the control of gene transcription, growth, development, and differentiation. Zinc cannot passively diffuse across cell membranes and requires specific transporters, such as SLC39A7, to enter the cytosol from both the extracellular environment and from intracellular storage compartments. ZIP7 is a membrane transport protein of the endoplasmic reticulum.

Function  TFEB is a master gene for lysosomal biogenesis. It encodes a transcription factor that coordinates expression of lysosomal hydrolases, membrane proteins and genes involved in autophagy. Upon nutrient depletion and under aberrant lysosomal storage conditions such as in lysosomal storage diseases, TFEB translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, resulting in the activation of its target genes. TFEB overexpression in cultured cells induces lysosomal biogenesis, exocytosis and autophagy. Viral- mediated TFEB overexpression in cellular and mouse models of lysosomal storage disorders and in common neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington, Parkinson and Alzheimer diseases, resulted in intracellular clearance of accumulating molecules and rescue of disease phenotypes. TFEB is activated by PGC1-alpha and promotes reduction of htt aggregation and neurotoxicity in a mouse model of Huntington disease. TFEB overexpression has been found in patients with renal cell carcinoma and pancreatic cancer and was shown to promote tumorogenesis via induction of various oncogenic signals. Nuclear localization and activity of TFEB is inhibited by serine phosphorylation by mTORC1 and extracellular signal‚Äìregulated kinase 2 (ERK2). mTORC1 phosphorylation of TFEB occurs at the lysosomal surface, both of which are localized there by interaction with the Rag GTPases. Phosphorylated TFEB is then retained in the cytosol by interaction with 14-3-3 proteins. These kinases are tuned to the levels of extracellular nutrients suggesting a coordination in regulation of autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis and partnership of two distinct cellular organelles. Nutrient depletion induces TFEB dephosphorylation and subsequent nuclear translocation via the phosphatase calcineurin. TFEB nuclear export is mediated by CRM1 and is dependent on phosphorylation. TFEB is also a target of the protein kinase AKT/PKB. AKT/PKB phosphorylates TFEB at serine 467 and inhibits TFEB nuclear translocation. Pharmacological inhibition of AKT/PKB activates TFEB, promotes lysosome biogenesis and autophagy, and ameliorates neuropathology in mouse models of Juvenile Batten disease and Sanfilippo syndrome type B. TFEB is activated in Trex1-deficient cells via inhibition of mTORC1 activity, resulting in an expanded lysosomal compartment.

Biography Churikova was born in Belebey, Bashkir Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, RSFSR, USSR. In the early 1950s Inna moved with her mother to Moscow. Inna was bent on becoming an actress from an early age: as a schoolgirl she studied at the drama studio attached to the Stanislavsky Theatre and later, after a few failures, entered Shchepkin Drama School. She debuted in filming whilst a first-year student, in minor episodic roles. Inna Churikova became famous thanks to the films V ogne broda net (No Path Through Fire) (1968), and especially the triumphal Nachalo (The Debut) (1970) by the then beginning film director and her future husband Gleb Panfilov. Her other most remarkable works were in the films: Tot samyy Myunkhgauzen (The Very Same Munchhausen) (1979) written by Grigory Gorin and directed by Mark Zakharov, Voenno-polevoy roman (Wartime Romance) (1983) by Pyotr Todorovsky, Rebro Adama (Adam's Rib) (1990) by Vyacheslav Krishtofovich, God sobaki (The Year of a Dog) (1993) by Semyon Aranovich, Plashch Kazanovy (Casanova's Raincoat) (1993) by Aleksandr Galin, Kurochka Ryaba (Ryaba My Chicken) (1994) by Andrei Konchalovsky, and Shirli-Myrli (What a mess!) (1995) by Vladimir Menshov. For her role in Wartime Romance, she won the Silver Bear for Best Actress at the 34th Berlin International Film Festival, and won the Nika Award in 1991 in the Best Actress category for her role in Rebro Adama. Inna Churikova is also a renowned stage actress, mainly working in Lenkom theatre with director Mark Zakharov, as well as a non-repertory theatre star. Together with her husband and son, Churikova was a co-screenwriter for the historical feature Romanovy: Ventsenosnaya semya (The Romanovs: An Imperial Family) (2000), in which rather than appear on screen, she dubs the English actress Lynda Bellingham starring as the tsarina Aleksandra Fyodorovna.

A professor at the University of Oslo since 1996, he has published several books on the history of ideas, including Norwegian nationalism and national socialism, as well as general Norwegian World War II history. Born at Str√∏mmen, he took the cand.philol. degree in 1981. His main inspiration for studying history was Jens Arup Seip and his inclination towards incorporating the history of ideas in general history. He published his first major work in 1983‚Äîthe book Fra Marx til Quisling. Fem sosialisters vei til NS. The book is a portrait of five Norwegian socialists who in the interwar period became national socialists: Eug√®ne Olaussen, Sverre Krogh, Halvard Olsen, Albin Eines and H√•kon Meyer. He then turned to Norwegian 19th-century history with the 1984 book 1880-√•rene. 10 √•r som rystet Norge, marking the 100th anniversary of the introduction of parliamentarianism in Norway. Crossing 19th-century history with liberalism was the 1988 thesis Anton Martin Schweigaards politiske tenkning, on the ideology of politician Anton Martin Schweigaard. This work earned him the dr.philos. degree. He subsequently wrote two other works on right-wing extremism and national socialism in Norway: Hitler eller Quisling? Ideologiske brytninger i Nasjonal Samling 1940‚Äì45 (1989) and Solkors og solidaritet. H√∏yreautorit√¶r samfunnstenkning i Norge ca. 1930‚Äì1945 (1991). One thread from the latter book‚Äîwelfare policy‚Äîwas followed in the 1993 Verdenskrig og velferd. Britiske, tyske og norske sosialpolitiske planer under annen verdenskrig. S√∏rensen also contributed to the Norsk krigsleksikon 1940‚Äì45, a 1995 encyclopaedia on World War II in Norway. He was promoted to professor at the University of Oslo in 1996. S√∏rensen is an elected member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters since 2010. In 1993 and 1997 he biographed Fridtjof Nansen and Bj√∏rnstjerne Bj√∏rnson respectively. This was a gateway to the topic of nationalism, and S√∏rensen headed a research project on the emergent Norwegian national identity in the 19th century. The project resulted in the 1998 book Jakten p√• det norske. Perspektiver p√• utviklingen av en norsk nasjonal identitet p√• 1800-tallet; S√∏rensen was the editor and wrote the opening chapter, Hegemonikamp om det norske, where he identified fourteen distinct projects of nation building in Norway between 1770 and 1945. Between 2001 and 2003, S√∏rensen was a co-editor, together with Trond Berg Eriksen, of the work Norsk id√©historie. S√∏rensen wrote volume three of the work, Kampen om Norges sjel 1770‚Äì1905, and co-wrote the sixth and last volume Et lite land i verden together with Trond Berg Eriksen. In 2004 he was the co-editor of Et rettferdig oppgj√∏r? with Hans Fredrik Dahl, a work on the legal purge in Norway after World War II. Historien om det som ikke skjedde, published in the same year, revolves around various counterfactual history events. Two years later, he published Den store sammensvergelsen. Historien om det hemmelige selskapet Illuminatus og dets mange ugjerninger, about the many theories concerning the secret society Illuminati. In 2010, he published a book on totalitarian ideologies, entitled Dr√∏mmen om det fullkomne samfunn. S√∏rensen is also considered an international expert on the Donald Duck universe, and was behind the publishing of the complete, thirty-volume works of Carl Barks in Norwegian, Swedish and Danish in 2004. S√∏rensen's expertise also includes the world of The Phantom, and he was actively involved with the publishing of twenty volumes chronicling the different generations of Phantoms, each separate volume featuring a scholarly article, written by S√∏rensen, summarising the relevant historical themes.

This gene is a member of the synapsin gene family. Synapsins encode neuronal phosphoproteins which associate with the cytoplasmic surface of synaptic vesicles. Family members are characterized by common protein domains, and they are implicated in synaptogenesis and the modulation of neurotransmitter release, suggesting a potential role in several neuropsychiatric diseases. The protein encoded by this gene shares the synapsin family domain model, with domains A, C, and E exhibiting the highest degree of conservation. The protein contains a unique domain J, located between domains C and E. Based on this gene's localization to 22q12.3, a possible schizophrenia susceptibility locus, and the established neurobiological roles of the synapsins, this family member may represent a candidate gene for schizophrenia. The TIMP3 gene is located within an intron of this gene and is transcribed in the opposite direction.

SEMA7A is a membrane-bound semaphorin that associates with cell surfaces via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) linkage. SEMA7A is also known as the John- Milton-Hagen (JMH) blood group antigen, an 80-kD glycoprotein expressed on activated lymphocytes and erythrocytes.[supplied by OMIM] SEMA7A is expressed in various adult tissues such as adipose, colon, esophagus, heart, brain, spleen, testis, lung, ovary, and uterus. Development SEMA7A promotes axonal growth and is involved in mesoderm derived somite formation. Murine embryonic Sema7A expression is highest on day 7, which is indicative of its role on the differentiation of germ layer structure. Embryonic Sema7A expression is noticeable at all developmental stages as well as in the newborn and adult thymus, indicative of a development T-cell role. In wild type neurons, addition of Sema7A under in vitro conditions promotes elongation and branching in a dose dependent manner. Unlike the majority of semaphorins, SEMA7A enhances axonal growth and is imperative for proper embryonic axonal tract formation. Limited expression of SEMA7A is found in the hindbrain as opposed to an abundance of SEMA7A expression found in both the cranial and trunk neural crest cells, which indicates an involvement in migration and differentiation. Sema7A -/- mice show defects in olfactory tract development. Tumorigenesis In normal breast tissue, mRNA expression of SEMA7A is low or not expressed, but activation to re-express SEMA7A occurs in these adult tissues to cause pleiotropic effects which increase tumorigenesis. Tumor cell growth, EMT, lung metastasis and angiogenesis have been linked to increased Sema7a expression in murine models. Increased SEMA7A expression correlates with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. Tumors increase SEMA7A expression in an involuting environment, but knockout of SEMA7a in mouse models undergoing involution decreases lymphangiogenesis. Genetics This protein is known to have eight variants in the extracellular region: seven lie within the Sema domain and one within the PSI domain. Molecular biology This protein forms dimers.

The olfactory receptor proteins are members of a large family of G-protein-coupled receptors arising from single coding-exon genes. Olfactory receptors share a 7-transmembrane domain structure with many neurotransmitter and hormone receptors and are responsible for the recognition and G protein-mediated transduction of odorant signals.

(Gastropods are a taxonomic class of animals which consists of snails and slugs of every kind, from the land, from freshwater, and from saltwater.) The paper setting out this taxonomy was published in the journal Malacologia. The system encompasses both living and extinct groups, as well as some fossils whose classification as gastropods is uncertain. The Bouchet & Rocroi system was the first complete gastropod taxonomy that primarily employed the concept of clades, and was derived from research on molecular phylogenetics; in this context a clade is a \\"natural grouping\\" of organisms based upon a statistical cluster analysis. In contrast, most of the previous overall taxonomic schemes for gastropods relied on morphological features to classify these animals, and used taxon ranks such as order, superorder and suborder, which are typical of classifications that are still inspired by Linnaean taxonomy. In the Bouchet & Rocroi taxonomy, clades are used between the rank of class and the rank of superfamily. The clades are unranked. Bouchet and Rocroi use six main clades: Patellogastropoda, Vetigastropoda, Cocculiniformia, Neritimorpha, Caenogastropoda, and Heterobranchia. The first three of these major clades have no nesting clades within them: the taxonomy goes immediately to the superfamily level. Within the Caenogastropoda there is one extra clade. In contrast, within the Heterobranchia, for some of the nudibranch groups there are six separate clades above the level of superfamily, and in the case of most of the land snails, there are four clades above the level of superfamily. In some parts of the taxonomy, instead of \\"clade\\", Bouchet and Rocroi labelled groupings of taxa as a \\"group\\" or an \\"informal group\\". A clade must by definition contain only one lineage, and it was considered to be the case that these \\"informal groups\\" may either contain more than one lineage, or only contain part of a lineage. Further research will eventually resolve these questions. Since the publication of this taxonomic system in 2005, various proposals for changes have been published by other authors, for more information see changes in the taxonomy of gastropods since 2005. In 2017 this taxonomy was superseded by a revised taxonomy \\"Revised Classification, Nomenclator and Typification of Gastropod and Monoplacophoran Families\\" by Philippe Bouchet & Jean-Pierre Rocroi, Bernhard Hausdorf, Andrzej Kaim, Yasunori Kano, Alexander N√ºtzel, Pavel Parkhaev, Michael Schr√∂dl and Ellen E. Strong in Malacologia, 2017, 61(1‚Äì2): 1‚Äì526. The authors have reverted to adopting the traditional ranks above superfamily: order, subclass, as this was preferred by many users.Revised Classification, Nomenclator and Typification of Gastropod and Monoplacophoran Families; Malacologia 61(1-2):1-526. 2017 Context Systems of classification such as this one are primarily of value to malacologists (people who study mollusks) and other biologists. Biological classification schemes are not merely a convenience, they are an attempt to show the actual phylogeny (the evolutionary relatedness) within a group of organisms. Thus a taxonomy such as this one can be seen as an attempt to elucidate part of the tree of life, a phylogenetic tree. The Bouchet & Rocroi 2005 system of gastropod taxonomy was laid out in a book-length paper entitled \\"Classification and Nomenclator of Gastropod Families\\", which was published in the journal Malacologia and which was written in collaboration with J. Fr√Ωda, B. Hausdorf, W. Ponder, √Å. Vald√©s and A. War√©n. This system supersedes the system of Ponder and Lindberg from 1997. Subsequent revisions by other authors have been made since the publication of this paper. The taxonomy set out by Bouchet & Rocroi is an attempt to get one step closer to representing this part of the evolutionary history of the phylum Mollusca. Bouchet & Rocroi's classification system is a hybrid of the pre-existing, more traditional Linnaean taxonomy along with some more recent far-reaching revisions which are based on molecular work and use clades as taxa, (see cladistics). In the past, the taxonomy of gastropods was largely based on the morphological characters of the taxa, such as the shell characteristics (including the protoconch) in shelled species, and the internal anatomy, including the structure of the radula and details of the reproductive system. Recent advances are based more on the molecular characteristics of the DNA and RNA. This shift in emphasis has meant that the newer taxa and their hierarchy are subject to debate, a debate that is not likely to be resolved soon. This proposed classification has tried to integrate the results of recent molecular work by using unranked clades for taxa below the traditional rank of class (class Gastropoda) but above the rank of superfamily (replacing the ranks subclass, superorder, order, and suborder), while still using the traditional Linnaean ranks for superfamilies and all taxa below the rank of superfamily (i.e., family, subfamily, tribe, genus, subgenus, and species. The clades have been given names which are similar to, or in some cases the same as, traditional Linnaean names for taxa above the level of superfamily. Whenever monophyly (a single ancestry) has not yet been tested and confirmed, or where a traditional taxon of gastropods has already been discovered to be paraphyletic (that it excludes some of its descendants) the term \\"group\\" or \\"informal group\\" has been used. Both Linnaean taxa and clades are invalid if it turns out they are polyphyletic, in other words if they consist of more than one lineage. In this taxonomy 611 valid families are recognized. Of these, 202 families are exclusively fossil, and this is indicated here with a dagger ‚Ä†. Superfamily names are standardized so that they all end in the suffix \\"-oidea\\", also commonly used for superorders and subclasses, replacing the \\"-acea\\" ending found especially in the older literature. Classification of families into subfamilies however is often not well resolved, and should be regarded as the best possible hypothesis. The publication Bouchet & Rocroi (2005) also includes a nomenclator of about 2400 suprageneric taxa (taxa above the level of genus) of gastropods, from the subtribe to the superfamily. A full bibliographic reference is provided for each taxon, giving the name of the authority, the original publication, the date of that publication, the type genus for the taxon, its nomenclatural status, and its validity under the rules of the ICZN. Since the publication of this taxonomic system in 2005, various changes have been published by other authors, for more information see changes in the taxonomy of gastropods since 2005.  Main clades, groups and informal groups  Here the information is displayed in the form of a cladogram (an evolutionary tree of descent.) It is worth bearing in mind however that this taxonomy is provisional: many of the taxa are still only known as \\"groups\\" or \\"informal groups\\", and these are very likely to be changed as more information becomes available. This cladogram is based on the following information. The list format used below makes clear which taxa are informal groups rather than clades: * Paleozoic molluscs of uncertain systematic position * Clade Patellogastropoda * Clade Vetigastropoda * Clade Cocculiniformia * Clade Neritimorpha Paleozoic Neritimorpha of uncertain systematic position Clade ‚Ä†Cyrtoneritimorpha Clade Cycloneritimorpha * Clade Caenogastropoda Caenogastropoda of uncertain systematic position Informal group Architaenioglossa Clade Sorbeoconcha Clade Hypsogastropoda *Clade Littorinimorpha *Informal group Ptenoglossa *Clade Neogastropoda *Clade Heterobranchia Informal group Lower Heterobranchia Informal group Opisthobranchia *Clade Cephalaspidea *Clade Thecosomata *Clade Gymnosomata *Clade Aplysiomorpha *Group Acochlidiacea *Clade Sacoglossa *Group Cylindrobullida *Clade Umbraculida *Clade Nudipleura Clade Pleurobranchomorpha Clade Nudibranchia *Clade Euctenidiacea *Clade Dexiarchia Clade Pseudoeuctenidiacea Clade Cladobranchia *Clade Euarminida *Clade Dendronotida *Clade Aeolidida Informal group Pulmonata *Informal group Basommatophora *Clade Eupulmonata Clade Systellommatophora Clade Stylommatophora *Clade Elasmognatha *Clade Orthurethra *Informal group Sigmurethra  Taxonomy  In the following, more detailed list, indentation is used only for the ranks of superfamily and family.

In humans, Neuropeptide FF peptides are encoded by the NPFF gene. Two genes encoding two different receptors (NPFF1 and NPFF2) and two precursors (NPFFA and NPFFB) have been cloned in several mammalian species.  Function  Neuropeptide FF (NPFF) and RFamide related peptides issued from two precursors interact with good affinity with two subtypes of G protein-coupled receptors, namely NPFF1 and NPFF2 subtypes and are involved in several physiological functions such as cardiovascular regulation, hormonal control, macrophage activation, body temperature homeostasis and pain modulation. Processing of the NPFFA precursor at basic proteolytic sites should generate a NPFF-containing peptide with three additional N-terminal amino acids different between species, and a NPSF (SLAAPQRFa)-containing peptide, the length of which depends on the species. NPFFB, identified as a precursor for RFamide-related peptides (RFRPs, also called GnIH for gonadotropin inhibitory hormone), contains a LPLRFa-containing peptide and a peptide sharing with NPFF the same C-terminal PQRFamide motif, such as NPVF (VPNLPQRFa) in human. NPFF and opioid systems have been shown to interact at several levels, from animal behavior to receptor molecules. Nociception is the physiological function in which this interaction has been the most extensively studied but reward, locomotion, feeding and intestinal motility are also affected. Endogenous opioids are necessary for the analgesic properties of spinally injected NPFF while endogenous NPFF peptides are involved in the process of analgesic tolerance/hyperalgesia induced by chronic opioid treatment.

MARCO is a class A scavenger receptor that is found on particular subsets of macrophages. Scavenger receptors are pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and are most commonly found on immune cells. Their defining feature is that they bind to polyanions and modified forms of a type of cholesterol called low- density lipoprotein (LDL). MARCO is able to bind and phagocytose these ligands and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), leading to the clearance of pathogens as well as causing downstream effects in the cell that lead to inflammation. As part of the innate immune system, MARCO clears, or scavenges, pathogens and leads to inflammatory responses. The scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) domain at the end of the extracellular side of MARCO is responsible for ligand binding and the subsequent immune responses. MARCO expression on macrophages is also associated with diseases since Alzheimer's disease is associated with decreased response within the cell when a ligand binds to MARCO.  Cell expression  Certain subtypes of macrophages are likely to express MARCO, but the receptor is also present on circulating monocytes, dendritic cells, and B cells. MARCO is typically present on the macrophages in the marginal zone of the spleen and the medullary lymph nodes, but it is also found in the liver. Dendritic cells increase expression of MARCO when exposed to certain pathogens, which leads to an increase in phagocytosis by the dendritic cell. When ligand binds to MARCO on dendritic cells, the cytoskeleton of the cell is altered, allowing for the formation of the long arms that also increase the phagocytic ability of dendritic cells. Macrophages that constitutively express MARCO are within the spleen marginal zone and medullary lymph nodes. Certain interactions between the macrophage and bacteria up-regulate its expression, as well as stimulating the expression of MARCO on tissue macrophages.  Function  = Phagocytosis = The primary function of scavenger receptors is to phagocytose pathogens, but they are also able to participate in cell‚Äìcell recognition and are important in initiating inflammatory responses. MARCO, being a PRR, is able to bind to a wide variety of bacteria, making it an important receptor for immunity against bacteria. Both soluble LPS and entire bacteria are able to bind to MARCO. MARCO is also able to bind to both acetylated LDL (AcLDL) and oxidized LDL (OxLDL), as well as to B cells in the marginal zone of the spleen and apoptotic cells. Since MARCO is able to recognize and phagocytose pathogens and apoptotic cells, expression of MARCO increases the phagocytic ability of the cell. MARCO operates independently of opsonization. = Inflammation = MARCO does not directly cause an inflammatory response, but it helps other receptors interact with PAMPs, so they may initiate inflammation. One way MARCO does this is by tethering a pathogen to other proteins on the cell that do cause an inflammatory response. These proteins could be other PRRs such as TLR2. These receptors may then lead to the activation of NF-Œ∫B which allows for the production and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Through phagocytosis, MARCO also brings pathogens into the cell so that there are more pathogens available to intracellular compartments containing receptors such as TLR3, NOD2, and NALP3 that are capable of initiating an inflammatory response.  Structure  leftMARCO is a transmembrane protein that has five domains. The first domain is within the cell, called the cytoplasmic domain. Moving into the cell membrane is the transmembrane domain, which is followed by the spacer domain located outside of the cell, then the collagenous domain, and finally the SRCR domain. The SRCR domain is necessary for MARCO to bind to ligands. Other members of the class A scavenger receptors tend to have alpha helical coiled coil domains, but MARCO does not. The C-terminal SRCR domain of MARCO plays a key role in the ability of the receptor to bind and take up ligand, enhance downstream inflammatory responses, and adhere to surfaces. The SRCR domain is where the ligand binds to MARCO. There are two highly conserved arginine amino acids, called the RxR motif, that are crucial for the binding of the ligand.  Associated diseases  The activity of MARCO on microglia, the macrophages of the brain, is associated with Alzheimer's disease. One primary characteristic of Alzheimer's disease is the presence of numerous senile plaques in the brain that contain amyloid beta peptides (AŒ≤). Initially, the microglia clear the AŒ≤ which binds to receptors such as MARCO. As the disease progresses, however, their ability to clear AŒ≤ decreases, resulting in AŒ≤ accumulation. This accumulation of AŒ≤ occurs early on in Alzheimer's disease, harming the brain as AŒ≤ is neurotoxic. MARCO also interacts with formyl peptide receptor (FPR2) to form a complex that causes the microglia to release pro-inflammatory cytokines which leads to inflammation that results in damage to neurons.

This gene encodes a member of the RING zinc finger protein family found in striated muscle and iris. The product of this gene is localized to the Z-line and M-line lattices of myofibrils, where titin's N-terminal and C-terminal regions respectively bind to the sarcomere. In vitro binding studies have shown that this protein also binds directly to titin near the region of titin containing kinase activity. Another member of this protein family binds to microtubules. Since these family members can form heterodimers, this suggests that these proteins may serve as a link between titin kinase and microtubule-dependent signal pathways in muscle. The protein encoded by the Trim63 gene is also called MuRF1. MuRF1 is the name most commonly used in the literature, and it stands for \\"Muscle RING Finger 1.\\" Structurally, there are two closely related MuRFs, MuRF2 and MuRF3. These also have TRIM codes: MuRF2 is TRIM55; MuRF3 is TRIM54. Interactions Trim63/MuRF1 has been shown to be an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Its major substrate is Myosin Heavy Chain. MuRF1 is upregulated during skeletal muscle atrophy ‚Äì and thus the degradation of myosin heavy chain, which is a major component of the sarcomere, is an important mechanism in the breakdown of skeletal muscle under atrophy conditions. MuRF1 has been shown to be upregulated during denervation, administration of glucocorticoids, immobilization, and casting (when a cast is applied to a limb, in order to immoblize it). All of these treatments cause skeletal muscle atrophy. TRIM63 has been shown to interact with Titin, GMEB1 and SUMO2.

Scinderin is an actin severing protein belonging to the gelsolin superfamily. It was discovered in Dr. Trifaro's laboratory at the University of Ottawa, Canada. Secretory tissues are rich in scinderin. In these tissues scinderin, a calcium dependent protein, regulates cortical actin networks. Normally secretory vesicles are excluded from release sites on the plasma membrane by the presence of a cortical actin filament network. During cell stimulation, calcium channels open allowing calcium ions to enter the secretory cell. Increase in intracellular calcium activates scinderin with the consequent actin filament severing and local dissociation of actin filament networks. This allows the movement of secretory vesicles to release sites on the plasma membrane.
