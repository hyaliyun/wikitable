It is based on the true story of Marie Heurtin (1885-1921), a girl who was born deaf and blind in late 19th century France. The film won the Variety Piazza Grande Award at the 67th Locarno International Film Festival. Story In 1897, Marie Heurtin, the daughter of a humble artisan and his wife, is born deaf and blind and unable to communicate with the world around her. Desperate to find a connection with Marie and avoid sending her to an asylum, the Heurtins send her to the Larnay Institute in central France, where an order of Catholic nuns manage a school for deaf girls. There, the idealistic Sister Marguerite sees in Marie a unique potential and, despite her Mother Superior's skepticism, vows to bring the wild girl out of the darkness into which she was born. =Background= Marie's Story is based on the true story of Marie Heurtin, who continued her education at the institute and lived there until her death at the age of 36. Some online sources say that Marie had a sister named Martha, who was also deaf and blind, who joined Marie at the institute.

Each year teams of students work to produce code capable of performing in a game that can be deployed on the SPHERES. This game generally contains elements such as docking with objects, moving objects, and destroying targets within a bounded area while monitoring fuel usage. Initial stages of the competition occur online (with virtual SPHERES) with free team registration in the United States, Australia and for ESA member countries and limited registration for international teams. Teams are traditionally monitored by adult mentors and code submitted through the MIT website. Finalists compete in a live championship aboard the ISS. An astronaut conducts the final competition while communicating to teams through a live feed. History The Zero Robotics competition was created by NASA Astronaut Gregory Chamitoff when he was working with the SPHERES and realised that the coding interface would be suitable for high school students. Drawing inspiration from FIRST Robotics, Zero Robotics became a competition that emphasised building science, technology, engineering, and maths skills with a component of cooperation between schools and nations. Its inaugural competition was held in 2009, expansion to the entire US in 2010 and internationally in 2013. It currently includes schools from the US, Russia, ESA affiliated stateshttps://www.romania-insider.com/romanian-team-nasa-zero-robotics/ and Australia.http://www.abc.net.au/radio/sydney/programs/drive/zero- robotics/8643694  Tournaments  The Zero Robotics competition is divided into two types of tournaments. * High School Tournament: Among students aged between 14 and 18 years. The tournament takes place between September and December each year. This is an international event open to teams from the USA, Australia, Russia, ESA member states and select international teams. * Middle School Summer Program. This is dedicated to younger students. It is a five- week program in which students learn to program through a simplified graphical interface. The program will take place in locations \\"to be determined\\" based on where there is a strong geographic presence of the team members.https://www.mercurynews.com/2017/07/21/summer-program-aims-to-send- students-coding-projects-to-space/ Additionally some countries, notably Australia and Italy, choose to hold preliminary competitions to fit better into the school year and/or filter the schools going onto the International Competition. The Finals of the Zero Robotics competition aboard the ISS Objectives of tournaments  Participants compete together to win a technically challenging game, motivated by a problem of current interest to DARPA, NASA and MIT. Depending on the challenge, students must program their satellites to complete certain objectives (to avoid obstacles, collect virtual objects, destroy targets, etc.) while preserving the primary resources (fuel, energy charges, etc.) and complete the challenge within certain limits of time and space for writing code. The student's software must be able to control factors such as the speed of the satellite, the rotation, the direction of travel, and many others, to be able to find the perfect algorithm to achieve the purpose and meet the challenges in the shortest possible time than their opponents. The difficulty lies in the fact that the programs are autonomous in the sense that submitted code will last for the duration of the competition (and across multiple matches) and you can not control or modify their execution. Additionally there is a limit on the programmable memory of the SPHERES, limiting the available coding practices. SPHERES internal components  Physics  Participants in Zero Robotics are encouraged to learn and/or improve their knowledge related to basic physics, since optimal algorithms require precise control over forces influencing the speed of the SPHERES. However, students report that \\"good results [can be obtained] by working exclusively through imposition of the satellite coordinates\\".  Programming  Participants in the challenge Zero Robotics learn to program in either C / C++, or MATLAB, or (in the middle school competition) Scratch. Within these languages there are different APIs to enforce the main parameters of the movements of the satellite. A specialised IDE is offered online on the official website of the competition where students are able submit and save their code.

The \\"RMS\\" prefix stands for Royal Mail Ship, as she carried overseas mail under a contract between Orient Line and Royal Mail. Otranto was in service until 1957, when she was sold for scrap. The ship was named after the town of Otranto in Apulia in southern Italy. She was Orient Line's second ship of that name. The first was a 1909 passenger liner that in 1914 became the armed merchant cruiser and in 1918 was lost as a result of a collision. In the Second World War the second Otranto was converted into a troop ship and a Landing ship, infantry. She took part in the invasions of French North Africa (Operation Torch), Sicily (Operation Husky) and Italy (Operation Avalanche). Building and details Vickers Armstrong built Otranto in its Barrow-in-Furness shipyard and launched her on 9 July 1925. She was long between perpendiculars, had a beam of and a draught of . Her tonnages were , and 12,228 tons under deck. She had twin propellers driven through reduction gears by six steam turbines that between them developed 3,722 NHP. Six double-ended and two single-ended boilers supplied steam at 215 lbf/in2 to the turbines. 56 corrugated furnaces with a combined grate surface area of heated her boilers. Career In 1926 Otranto was slightly damaged when she struck a rock at Cape Grosso, Greece during a heavy rainstorm. Otranto accidentally collided with the Japanese steamer in August 1928, heavily damaging her. In May 1932 she played a small part in the rescue of the passengers and crew of the French ocean liner in the Gulf of Aden. On 4 August 1932 she collided with the Thames barge Why Not in the Thames Estuary at Thameshaven, Essex, England; Why Not sank. When World War II broke out in 1939 the Admiralty requisitioned Otranto and had her converted into a troop ship. In 1942 she was modified to carry landing craft as a Landing ship, infantry. She took part in the invasion of French North Africa later that year and the landings in Sicily and Salerno in 1943. She was subsequently reconverted back into a troop transport and served as such until released from government service in 1948. Otranto then resumed her pre-war role as a passenger liner, now refitted to carry 1,412 tourist-class passengers. In February 1957 she made her final voyage, from the UK to Sydney, Australia via Cape Town, South Africa. She was sold for scrap in June.

After Min's fall, he initially submitted to Southern Tang (which had conquered Min), but eventually, taking advantage of Southern Tang's inability to fully control the region, took the southern part of the former Min realm under his own control, albeit in nominal submission to Southern Tang. After Southern Tang's repeated defeats by Later Zhou, he also nominally submitted to Later Zhou's successor state Song.  Background  Liu Congxiao was born in 906, at the very end of the Tang dynasty. He was from Yongchn (Ê∞∏Êò•, in modern Quanzhou, Fujian), which was known as Taolin () early in his lifetime. His father Liu Zhang () died in his youth, and he became known for serving his mother and older brother piously. He was said to be somewhat educated in literature, and was a particularly avid reader of military strategies.History of Song, vol. 483.Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms, vol. 93.  Rebellion against Zhu Wenjin and subsequent service to Yin/Min  As of 944, Liu Congxiao was serving as an army officer in the army of his home prefecture Quan Prefecture (Ê≥âÂ∑û, in modern Quanzhou). By that time, the state that Quan had been ruled by, Min, ruled by the imperial Wang family, had been broken apart by civil war and political strife‚Äîand now was under the reign of the usurper general Zhu Wenjin (who had assassinated the emperor Wang Xi (Emperor Jingzong), with Zhu's hold on the throne being Min contested by Wang Xi's brother Wang Yanzheng, who had earlier declared himself emperor of a breakaway state of Yin.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 284. After seizing the Min throne, Zhu sent the general Huang Shaopo () to Quan to serve as its prefect. Liu, however, was discontented, and he stated to his colleagues Wang Zhongshun (), Dong Si'an (), and Zhang Hansi: His colleagues agreed. In winter 944, they held a feast at Liu's house, and they gathered the soldiers below them whom they deemed reliable and strong. Liu spoke to them and stated (falsely, as it stood): The soldiers became roused by his words and followed him in attacking Huang. They climbed over the walls of the headquarters and killed Huang. Liu then took the prefectural government seal and presented it to Wang Jixun (), a nephew of Wang Yanzheng's who resided at Quan, asking Wang Jixun to serve as acting prefect. Liu himself took the title of \\"Commander of the Army Against the Bandits\\" (). He boxed Huang's head and had the officer Chen Hongjin deliver it to Wang Yanzheng's capital Jian Prefecture (Âª∫Â∑û, in modern Nanping, Fujian). Wang Yanzheng commissioned Wang Jixun to be the prefect of Quan, and Liu, Wang Zhongshun, Dong, and Chen to be commanders of the army. Hearing of Huang's death, Zhu sent the generals Lin Shouliang () and Li Ting'e () to attack Quan. Wang Yanzheng, hearing the news, sent the general Du Jin () to aid the Quan army. However, even before Du arrived, Liu led the Quan army and engaged Zhu's army, killing Lin in battle and capturing Li. Subsequently, Zhu was assassinated by his officer Li Renhan (), who surrendered Fu to Wang Yanzheng, who then took the title of Emperor of Min. However, a subsequent rebellion led by Li Renda at Fu wrested that region away from Wang Yanzheng, and Wang Yanzheng's capital Jian Prefecture then came under attack by the Southern Tang general Cha Wenhui (). During the Jian siege, Wang Yanzheng ordered Quan to send a 5,000-men detachment to Jian to help defend the city; that detachment was commanded by Dong and Wang Zhongshun.  As Southern Tang subject  In fall 945, Jian fell to Southern Tang forces, and Wang Yanzheng surrendered. (Wang Zhongshun died in the battle, and Dong Si'an took the remnants of his army and fled back to Quan.) Initially, virtually the entire former Min domain submitted to Southern Tang's emperor Li Jing, including even Li Renda, who, however, continued to hold actual control of the Fu region. In spring 946, Liu Congxiao, alleging that, given the threats posed by Li Renda's army and that Wang Jixun was alienating the Quan soldiers by improper rewards and punishments, forced him to yield the command to Liu himself. Liu himself then attacked and defeated Li Renda in a battle, and then reported the news of the victory to Li Jing. Li Jing summoned Wang Jixun to the Southern Tang capital Jinling and commissioned Liu as the prefect of Quan, but also sent a detachment to Quan, apparently to both help defend it and to watch over Liu.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 285. In fall 946, the Zhang Prefecture (Êº≥Â∑û, in modern Zhangzhou, Fujian) officer Lin Zanyao () rebelled against Southern Tang and killed the general Chen Hui (), whom Li Jing had sent to Zhang, and Chen's monitor of the army Zhou Chengyi (). Liu launched an army and expelled Lin from Zhang; he had Dong take over Zhang. Li Jing then commissioned Dong as the prefect of Zhang. (After Dong declined the position on grounds of naming taboo‚Äîbecause his father was named Dong Zhang ()‚ÄîLi Jing renamed the prefecture Nan Prefecture (), and so Dong accepted.) Meanwhile, Li Renda had refused to yield actual control of Fu, leading to a Southern Tang expedition against him, commanded by the general Wang Chongwen (). Li Renda sought aid from Wuyue's king Qian Hongzuo. Meanwhile, Li Jing ordered Dong and Liu to lead forces to reinforce Wang Chongwen. It was said, though, that partly as a result of that, Wang's army was bogged down and unable to siege the city effectively‚Äîas both Liu and Wang Jianfeng () were arrogant and not following Wang Chongwen's orders, while the civilian officials Chen Jue, Feng Yanlu, and Wei Cen () were also disrupting Wang Chongwen's command structure. In spring 947, the joint forces of Li Renda and Wuyue defeated the Southern Tang siege army, which then scattered‚Äîapparently, as a result of both Liu and Wang Jianfeng not wanting to see the army regroup and take Fu‚Äîending Southern Tang's attempt to take actual control over Fu.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 286. Liu returned to Quan, and then held a feast for the commanding general of the Southern Tang detachment, stating to him: Seeing that Liu was effectively wanting to chase him out, the Southern Tang general found no choice but to take his army and leave Quan. Li Jing could not think of a way to control Liu, and therefore had to be content with keeping him nominally as a subject, and granted him the honorary title of acting Taifu (). In 949, Liu's older brother Liu Congyuan (), who was serving as Dong's deputy at Nan (Zhang), poisoned Dong to death and took over the control of the prefecture. Li Jing, finding no good way to deal with the situation, established a Qingyuan Circuit with its headquarters at Quan, and made Liu its military governor (Jiedushi).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 288. Not long after, he granted Liu honorary chancellor designations, and created him the Duke of E. Later, that title was upgraded to Prince of Jinjiang. Liu was said to be frugal and hardworking as the ruler of the region. He usually wore civilian clothes, and placed his prefect uniform on at the door of his headquarters, putting it on only when he was to hear official matters and taking it off whenever unnecessary, to show humility and attentiveness to his civilian origin. Wang Yanzheng had two daughters who lived at Quan because they had married men from there, and Liu honored and treated them well. He also made sure that each year, knowledgeable individuals were selected for the imperial examinations. In 958, during a campaign that Southern Tang's northern neighbor Later Zhou was waging against Southern Tang, Liu had his officer Cai Zhongyun (), disguised as a merchant, travel to Later Zhou to submit a petition to be the subject of Later Zhou's emperor Guo Rong. However, soon the war ended (with Li Jing ceding the territory north of the Yangtze River to Later Zhou and submitting to Guo as a subject), and when Liu submitted another petition, asking to establish a liaison office at Later Zhou's capital Kaifeng and directly submitting to Later Zhou. Guo, citing the fact that Li Jing had already submitted and that Liu had been a long-time Southern Tang subject, refused, instead encouraging him to remain faithful to Li Jing.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 294.  As dual subject to Southern Tang and Song  In 960, the Later Zhou general Zhao Kuangyin seized the throne from Guo Rong's son and successor Guo Zongxun, ending Later Zhou and starting a new Song dynasty as its Emperor Taizu. Later in the year, Liu Congxiao submitted a petition to the new Song emperor, offering to be a subject,Xu Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 1. and thereafter offered tributes. Around the same time, though, Li Jing, while also offering to be a Song vassal but fearing the possibility of Song military action against Southern Tang, decided to move his capital from Jinling to Nanchang, and did so in 961.Xu Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 2. Liu, however, thought that movement of the capital was targeting him and feared a Southern Tang campaign against him, and therefore sent his nephew Liu Shaoji () to offer tributes to Li, while at the same time continued to send tributes to the Song emperor through Wuyue. The Song emperor sent an emissary, intending to comfort him, but before the emissary could arrive in Liu's territory, Liu had died from a tumor on his back, apparently in 962. Li Jing's son and successor Li Yu bestowed posthumous honors on him. As Liu Congxiao was sonless, he adopted both Liu Shaoji and another nephew, Liu Shaozi (both of them biological sons of Liu Congyuan) as his sons. The Xu Zizhi Tongjian indicated that after his death, as Liu Shaoji was at the Southern Tang court, Liu Shaozi took over as acting military governor, but was soon seized by the officer Chen Hongjin, who falsely accused Liu Shaozi of wanting to submit to Wuyue and delivered Liu Shaozi to Southern Tang, while supporting Zhang Hansi as the new acting military governor.

Phillips occupied Fort Gibson. Upon hearing reports of no Confederate activity in all directions Philips sent the fort's livestock to graze. A Union sentry failed to scout a mountain road and Confederate forces therefore descended on the livestock.Phillips' Official Report Battle Unwilling to move against the fort directly the Confederates maintained a strong position 5 miles away along the Arkansas River. Colonel Phillips dispatched his available mounted forces against the Confederates which succeeded in retaking most the livestock. The Confederates made a strong attack against the Union sortie and were able to drive them back nearly surrounding two companies. Colonel Phillips then personally led a force of infantry with an artillery battery from the fort. Reinforced by the mounted infantry already in the field, Phillips was able to stop the Rebel attack. The Confederates held briefly in a forest until they were routed and withdrew beyond the Arkansas River. Phillips dispatched his cavalry to give chase to this Confederate force. Meanwhile word was received of a second Confederate force attempting a river crossing. Phillips returned to the fort with the infantry and artillery to counter this feint.The Union Army: Cyclopedia of battles p.424 The Rebels fired one volley and withdrew having failed to draw away enough Union forces from the original Confederate attack on the livestock. Aftermath Eight days later Colonel Phillips' supply train was attacked at Fort Gibson. Phillips successfully defeated the attack and saved the supply train. In July 1863 troops from Fort Gibson marched south to win the battle of Honey Springs. Fort Gibson would remain in Union control for the rest of the war.

It is also named Grey Nuns Hospital of Montr√©al (not to be confused with Grey Nuns' Hospital located south of Place d'Youville). The building was completed in 1871. In 2007, it was bought by Concordia University and refurbished. It now serves as co-ed housing for 598 undergraduate students on the Sir George Williams Campus within the neighbourhood redevelopment project Quartier Concordia. A crypt containing the graves of 276 nuns and other individuals is located in the basement. Among them was Mother Marie-Marguerite d'Youville, the first native-born Canadian to be declared a saint. In 2010 her remains were removed and relocated to her 1701 birthplace of Varennes, a community on the South Shore. In 2011, it was designated one of the National Historic Sites of Canada. History The building was constructed in the nineteenth century to serve as a motherhouse for the Sisters of Charity of Montreal, formerly called The Sisters of Charity of the H√¥pital G√©n√©ral of Montreal and more commonly known as the Grey Nuns of Montreal, a Canadian religious institute of Roman Catholic religious sisters, founded in 1737 by Saint Marguerite d'Youville. Construction Individuals involved in the design and construction include: *Alcibiade Leporhon, architect *Joseph Venne, architect *Victor Bourgeau, architect *Maurice Perrault and Albert M√©nard, architect *Alphonse Pich√©, architect *Maurice Payette, architect *Albert Deschamps, engineer Description Grey Nuns Motherhouse (1850-1885) by John Henry Walker (1831-1899) The site is rectangular, bordered by Rene Levesque Boulevard at the south, Guy Street at the east, St. Catherine Street at the north, and Saint Mathieu at the west. It is enclosed with stone walls and metal fencing. Within this area are a main, large, H-shaped building of stone construction, various smaller buildings, and grounds containing numerous trees, gardens, statues, and pathways. The architectural style is a superb example of convent architecture of the 19th century. This is achieved by combining Neoclassical and Romanesque Revival styles. The main building has an H-shape, is large, and of stone construction. It is 4 stories tall, with the exception of the west wing, which is 5 stories tall. Its central part is rectangular and contains a chapel with an octagonal tower and spire. The windows and dormers are regularly placed. As a Concordia student residence Now called the Grey Nuns Building by Concordia University, the site has become a student residence. In 2007, it was bought by Concordia for $18 million and refurbished for $15 million. The university initially announced that it would become the faculty of fine arts, but later decided to turn the site into residences. It serves as co-ed housing for 598 undergraduate students on the Sir George Williams Campus within the neighbourhood redevelopment project Quartier Concordia. The entire site is owned by Concordia except for a basement crypt. The main entrance that was once on St-Mathieu Street is now located on Guy Street. The renovations undertaken have made space available for 355 new beds for resident students. There is a total of nearly 600 residence beds. The chapel has become a reading room that can accommodate 230 students. There are 14 group study rooms, a daycare facility, and a cafeteria area allowing resident students the choice of preparing meals. Crypt Basement crypt where around 300 nuns are buried In the basement there is a crypt in which 276 people are buried, 232 of whom were Grey Nuns who had lived at the motherhouse. It is held in trust for the sisters, who are permitted to enter it. The crypt it is off limits to students and others, but can be viewed through a window in a locked door. Originally, there were plans to transfer all of the buried remains to √éle St. Bernard, a site owned by the Grey Nuns and the location of Manoir d‚ÄôYouville. However, the health department of Quebec would not permit the tombs to be opened and the bodies exhumed. This was because some of the sisters buried there had died of infectious diseases. Among the buried are the nieces and a son of Mother Marie-Marguerite d'Youville. In 2010, the remains of d'Youville were removed and transferred to her birthplace of Varennes for burial.

Guth, was a notable architect of government railroad projects in Germany in the mid-1800s. Graduating from school in 1879, the younger Guth worked as an architect for two years and decided to immigrate to the United States. Following his father in railroad design, he first worked for the New York, Pennsylvania and Ohio Railroad based in Cleveland, Ohio. Guth soon switched to the Northern Pacific Railroad in Brainerd, Minnesota, and left there to join the Burlington Railroad in Lincoln, Nebraska.

Gruenfeld is an American social psychologist whose work examines the way people are transformed by the organizations and social structures in which they work. She is the author of numerous papers on the psychology of power and group behavior. She is the Joseph McDonald Professor of Organizational Behavior at the Stanford Graduate School of Business, and is also a Codirector of the Executive Program for Women Leaders at the same institution. Work Gruenfeld was a graduate student of Robert S. Wyer and the late Joseph E. McGrath at the University of Illinois. Her doctoral research on status and integrative complexity in decision-making groups, in part examining U.S. Supreme Court decisions, were awarded prizes by the American Psychological Association and the Society of Experimental Social Psychology. Her analysis of U.S. Supreme Court decisions took into consideration both the justices' status in their group as well as their ideological preferences, demonstrating that as justices gained power on the court or entered into majority coalitions their written opinions tended to become less complex and nuanced. = Theory of Power = Together with Dacher Keltner of the University of California, Berkeley, and Cameron Anderson also at Berkeley, Gruenfeld has developed a theory of power that aims to present an integrative account of the effects of power on human behaviour, suggesting that the acquisition of power has a disinhibiting effect regarding the social consequences of exercising it. Lawsuit In 2015, Poets & Quants, a blog that covers MBA programs around the world, made public a wrongful termination suit filed by Gruenfeld's estranged husband, James A. Phills, who had been another professor at the business school. Phills alleged his firing was driven by the affair that Gruenfeld was having with the dean of the business school, Garth Saloner, apparently with the knowledge of the Stanford's Provost, John Etchemendy.

Early life, education, and career Fant was born in Jacksonville in 1968 to an established family; the Fant Family first moved to the area in 1920 and started First Guaranty Bank in 1947,The Florida Times-Union by Simon Barker-Benfield, February 25, 1999 \\"First Guaranty Moving to Mandarin\\". which his father later ran. He attended Washington and Lee University, receiving his bachelor's degree in 1990, and then the University of Florida College of Law at the University of Florida, receiving his Juris Doctor in 1994. Upon graduation in 1994, Fant returned home and was elected to serve on the board of First Guaranty Bank, and he began managing the operations of the company in 2001. Fant worked in trust administration and corporate management until 2003, when he was named president and Chief Executive Officer of the Bank.Jacksonville Business Journal, May 23‚Äì29, 2003 \\"Weiss gives high marks to First Guaranty Bank\\". He remained President until 2009 when he was promoted to Chairman. In 2010, Fant turned over daily management, and his employment with the bank came to a close in 2012. The bank had performed well earlier in Fant's leadership,Jacksonville Business Journal, May 23‚Äì29, 2003 ‚ÄúWeiss gives high marks to First Guaranty Bank\\"The Florida Times-Union, January 17, 2005, \\"Area banks get top marks from financial firm\\" but by 2012, the bank had failed because it had acquired a number of troubled loans and had received a number of poor financial stability ratings from independent firms, and it was in negotiations to be purchased by CertusBank. However, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation stepped in at that point and the bank went into FDIC receivership. Fant began working with CenterState, which ended up as the owner of First Guaranty Bank, as a senior legal counsel and on the advisory board. Fant opposed the federal takeover of mortgage companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2008 stating that they would become a long term taxpayer burden.The Florida Times-Union, Letter to the Editor by Jay Fant, August 3, 2008 \\"Recent crisis proves America's financial system remains sound\\" He also opposed the government bailouts of larger banks at the expense of smaller banks like his that did not participate in sub-prime residential lending. Fant was active in the Tea Party movement in 2009. Florida House of Representatives =2014 election= Leading up to the 2014 elections, incumbent State Representative Daniel Davis declined to seek a third term in the legislature. In October 2013, Fant announced his candidacy for his seat. He faced attorney Paul Renner in the Republican primary, and both candidates agreed on the need to expand the Port of Jacksonville, to attract jobs to the state, and to provide more school choice to parents. Fant also called for increased assistance and incentives to veterans, noting, \\"I have a proposal that would encourage vets, when they come back and retire from the military, to start their businesses in Florida, and they'll get some breaks on the licensing fees to do that.\\" During the campaign, Fant incorrectly claimed endorsements from the National Rifle Association and Florida Right to Life, neither of which had made an endorsement in the contest, though they gave both candidates \\"A\\" ratings. Fant's campaign corrected the video, which the candidate had made during an interview with The Florida Times-Union's editorial board. Ultimately, the contest proved to be close and hard-fought, with Fant finishing just three votes ahead of Renner, prompting a manual recount. The recount lowered Fant's margin to just two votes but uncovered no additional errors, and Renner conceded to him. Renner was elected to the Florida House in another district a few months later. In the general election, Fant faced only write-in opposition, and easily won his first term in the legislature with nearly 100% of the vote. =Tenure= During his tenure, Fant sat on the House Judiciary Committee, Criminal Justice Subcommittee, Finance & Tax Committee, Government Operations Subcommittee, Insurance & Banking Subcommittee, Education Committee, Government Accountability Committee, Government Operations & Technology Appropriations Subcommittee, Justice Appropriations Subcommittee, Local, Federal and Veterans Affairs Subcommittee, Ways and Means Committee and Civil Justice & Claims Subcommittee. Fant sponsored a bill to improve access to online property especially in the management of wills and estates. It ultimately became law. Fant supported the Enterprise Florida and Visit Florida programs. He opposed gun control laws. In 2017 Fant declared his candidacy for Attorney General in the upcoming election, but he withdrew in June 2018. Personal life Fant is married and has four children.

The film stars Jerry Orbach, Leigh Taylor-Young, Jo Van Fleet, Lionel Stander, Robert De Niro and Irving Selbst. The film was released on December 22, 1971, by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Plot Kid Sally Palumbo (Jerry Orbach) grows jealous of his older, mobster boss Baccala (Lionel Stander), who has little respect for the crew Palumbo commands. Baccala allows Kid Sally to supervise a six-day bicycle race (for the purposes of keeping the money generated), and among the 12 Italian cyclists brought into the city is Mario Trantino (Robert De Niro), a budding thief. When the bicycle race does not take place due to outside interference, Sally is demoted to serving Baccala as a chauffeur, and Trantino stays in New York City to run his own cons, including masquerading as a priest. Kid Sally's mother Big Momma (Jo Van Fleet) urges him to take down the old, entrenched mobsters in power, but it appears the only fatalities are in his own camp, and the increase in violence draws the attention of the city police.

Built in 1838, it is the oldest surviving structure in Galveston as recently as 2014 and is on the National Register of Historic Places. History The Menard House is named for its first owner, Michel B. Menard, a Canadian-born trader, real estate investor, and a founder of Galveston. Menard built on outlot block 37, indicating a location outside of Galveston city limits. The Menard House was fabricated, then shipped from Maine in parts. The combination of a dearth of carpenters in 1830s Texas and excess cargo space in Texas-bound ships made prefabricated buildings economically viable. Menard probably started building the house in 1837 for his second wife, Catherine Maxwell. She died in the summer of 1838, the same year construction was completed. Houston co-founder and Galveston City Company investor John Kirby Allen purchased the property in 1838, but died that July. By 1843, a cousin had deeded the property to Menard's third wife, Mary Jane (Clemens) Riddle Menard. She lived in the house until her death in December 1843. Michel Menard married Rebecca Mary Bass and adopted her two children. In 1850, she bore him his only child, Doswell Menard. Around this time, Menard added two wings to the house, which later became the venue for Galveston's first Mardi Gras ball in 1853. Four years after Michel Menard died in 1856, Rebecca Menard married Colonel J.S. Thrasher, former United States Consul at Havana, Cuba. Edwin Ketchum purchased the house from the Menard family in 1880 and the Ketchum family kept the house well-maintained until 1977. Restoration The Galveston Historical Foundation and the National Trust for Historic Preservation bought the Menard House in June 1992. In 1994, Pat and Fred Burns of Houston acquired the deteriorating building, then completed its restoration in 1995. The Menard House opened for the 1995 Historic Homes Tour, hosting 6,500 visitors for the event. The Menard House suffered no serious damage during Hurricane Ike.Schmidt (2009), p.4.

History  The citadel was called \\"nuova\\" (new) to distinguish it from the older Cittadella Vecchia on the seaward side of the city. The Cittadella Nuova is located on the extreme opposite side of the city walls of Pisa in Lungarno Fibonacci, on the south bank of the river Arno between the Ponte della Vittoria and the Ponte della Fortezza. Construction began in 1440 during the first period of Florentine rule. In the course of the Pisan revolt and battles which led to the Florentine reconquest of the city, the fortress was damaged and had to be restored by architect Giuliano da Sangallo. This new reconstruction was designed to stand against forces using cannon - one of the first fortresses in Italy to do so. Inside the fortifications of the Cittadella Nuova, there is an extensive garden created at the beginning of the nineteenth century by architect Giovanni Caluri for the Livornese shipping- magnate, Domenico Scotto. The Scotto brother had acquired the fortress in 1798 when grand-duke Leopold I of Tuscany put it up for sale and quickly began work on the construction of a palace with a vast green space. Legend has it that the enormous plane tree which rises in the middle of the garden, was planted during a theatrical performance by Carlo Goldoni, but in reality he died before the Scotto family acquired the garden. In the 1930s, the area became a public garden and was used for shows, theatrical performances, concerts and as an open-air cinema in summer - a role which it retains to this day. The Scotto family's palace was largely destroyed during the Second World War and the garden grew ever more degraded until 2008 when it was largely reconstructed and refitted.

The saga contains an elaborate description of associated customs, the seeress's behavior, and material culture, such as her distinctive clothing. Saga of Erik the Red According to the saga, times were tough in Greenland; hunters caught few animals, and some simply didn‚Äôt return at all. In the Scandinavian settlement lived a woman by the name of √ûorbj√∂rg, a seeress who people called 'the little v√∂lva' (meaning 'little, or lesser, seeress'). She had nine sisters, all of whom held the gift of prophecy but √ûorbj√∂rg had outlived them all.Kunz (2000: 658). Every winter, √ûorbj√∂rg visited each farm to which she was invited in the district. She regularly received invitations from those who wanted to know their future, or the future of their farms. One winter, √ûorkel, a major farmer, invited √ûorbj√∂rg to his farm, and he and his family began making preparations for her arrival: > {  Sephton translation, 1808: :A high seat was prepared for her, and a > cushion laid thereon in which were poultry-feathers. : :Now, when she came > in the evening, accompanied by the man who had been sent to meet her, she > was dressed in such wise that she had a blue mantle over her, with strings > for the neck, and it was inlaid with gems quite down to the skirt. On her > neck she had glass beads. On her head she had a black hood of lambskin, > lined with ermine. A staff she had in her hand, with a knob thereon; it was > ornamented with brass, and inlaid with gems round about the knob. Around her > she wore a girdle of soft hair, and therein was a large skin-bag, in which > she kept the talismans needful to her in her wisdom. She wore hairy calf- > skin shoes on her feet, with long and strong-looking thongs to them, and > great knobs of latten at the ends. On her hands she had gloves of ermine- > skin, and they were white and hairy within. : :Now, when she entered, all > men thought it their bounden duty to offer her becoming greetings, and these > she received according as the men were agreeable to her. The franklin > Thorkell took the wise-woman by the hand, and led her to the seat prepared > for her. He requested her to cast her eyes over his herd, his household, and > his homestead. She remained silent altogether. : :During the evening the > tables were set; and now I must tell you what food was made ready for the > spae-queen. There was prepared for her porridge of kid‚Äôs milk, and hearts of > all kinds of living creatures there found were cooked for her. She had a > brazen spoon, and a knife with a handle of walrus-tusk, which was mounted > with two rings of brass, and the point of it was broken off.Sephton (1880: > 12-13).  Kunz translation, 2000: :A high seat was set for her, complete > with a cushion. This was to be stuffed with chicken feathers. : :When she > arrived one evening, along with the man who had been sent to fetch her, she > was wearing a black mantle with a strap, which was adorned with precious > stones right down to the hem. About her neck she wore a string of glass > beads and on her head a hood of black lambskin lined with white catskin. She > bore a staff with a knob at the top, adorned with brass set with stones on > top. About her waist she had a linked charm belt with a large purse. In it > she kept the charms which she needed for her predictions. She wore calfskin > boots lined with fur, with long, sturdy laces and large pewter knobs on the > ends. On her hands she wore gloves of catskin, white and lined with fur. : > :When she entered, everyone was supposed to offer her respectful greetings, > and she responded by according to how the person appealed to her. Farmer > Thorkel took the wise woman by the hand and led her to the seat which had > been prepared for her. He then asked her to survey his flock, servants and > buildings. She had little to say about all of it. : :That evening tables > were set up and food prepared for the seeress. A porridge of kid‚Äôs milk was > made for her and as meat she was given the hearts of all the animals > available there. She had a spoon of brass and a knife with an ivory shaft, > its two halves clasped with bronze bands, and the point of which had broken > off.  } After the tables were cleared, √ûorkel asked √ûorbj√∂rg what she thought of the estate and the household's conduct, and how soon he could expect a response to his questions about the future, as everyone was eager to know. √ûorbj√∂rg said she would not provide a response until having spent a night at the farm. Late the next day, people at the farmestead provided her with \\"things she required to carry out her magic rites.\\" √ûorbj√∂rg asked if any woman present knew var√∞lokkur (Old Norse 'ward enticers, ward songs'), chants necessary to carry out magic rites. No woman present knew the charms. The people of the household asked around the settlement until a woman named Gudrid (introduced earlier in the saga) responded that, \\"I have neither magical powers nor the gift of prophecy, but in Iceland my foster-mother, Halldis, taught me chants she called ward songs\\".Kunz (2000: 659). √ûorbj√∂rg responded that this was more than she expected. Gudrid, however, says that because she is a Christian woman, she intends to take no part in the seeress's activities. √ûorbj√∂rg, undaunted, says, \\"It could be that you could help the people by so doing, and you'd be no worse a woman for that. But I expect Thorkel to provide me with what I need.\\" √ûorkel urged Gudrid to assist the seeress, and she agreed. Together the women \\"formed a warding ring around the platform raised for sorcery, with √ûorbj√∂rg perched atop it.\\" Gudrid successully sang the chants, impressing those in attendance with the beauty of her voice. √ûorbj√∂rg thanked Gudrid for her assistance, and said that earlier the spirits refused to do her bidding, but that the spirits had been attracted to Gudrid's beautiful voice. The seeress said that she can now see clearly into the future, and that the hardships the farmers faced would clear up as spring arrives, and that the sickness that plagued the people there would also soon improve. For her help, the seeress provided special insight for Gudrid, predicting her future, and wished her well. The ceremony over, farmers approached the seeress to learn what was in store for them. The saga informs the reader that she provided answers for them, and that \\"little that she predicted did not occur\\". After, a retinue arrived to escort her to another farm.Kunz (2000: 659-660). Scholarly reception According to philologist Rudolf Simek, while Saga of Erik the Red may be an embellished literary narrative, details regarding the seeress, such as the high seat, staff, and the circle appear to derive from historical practices in Germanic paganism.

Technical characteristics  The Ponte della Vittoria is 122.4 metres long, with a maximum height of 12.25 metres and three arches with a maximum span of 49 metres. It is made of reinforced concrete. Two false shoulders emphasise the join with the riverside balustrade with concrete cassons faced with stone. History In the Fascist period, various public works were planned for the city of Pisa, of which only the bridge on the site of the Ponte della Vittoria which connected the station and the Politeama was actually built. The construction was completed in 1931, but the bridge collapsed on the evening of 22 December 1934, before it had even been inaugurated. The cause of the collapse was linked to the excessive pomp required by the Fascist architecture of the period: in fact, it was caused by the excessive load resulting from the large quantity of marble statues. The bridge was rebuilt a few years later only to be destroyed during the Second World War and was quickly rebuilt again by the Sogene between February 1949 and March 1950, on behalf of the Ministry of Public Labour.

He has produced tracks featuring artists such as A$AP Ferg, Young Thug, Lolo Zouai, SZA, MIA, and Big Sean.  Career  In 2013, Stelios Phili composed the runway music for En Noir's Spring/Summer 2014 show. In early 2014, he composed the music for designer Mark McNairy's Fall/Winter 2014 show. According to an interview with MTV Rap Fix, Phili met the rapper A$AP Ferg while working at GQ in 2013. The two began collaborating after fellow A$AP Mob member A$AP Nast passed along one of the producer's beats, which would later become the A$AP Ferg song, \\"Ja-Rule,\\" featuring Big Sean. In 2014, Phili produced the first single from A$AP Ferg's mixtape, Ferg Forever. The song, \\"Doe-Active,\\" was met with positive reviews. Pitchfork Media described the song as \\"a minimalist beat that could've slid right into Yeezus,\\" Stereogum called it \\"a total nutso banger,\\" and Complex named it a \\"certified banger, with club-destroying drums.\\" Phili's production was featured on four additional tracks on Ferg Forever. In 2015, Phili produced DonMonique's debut EP, Thirst Trap. The New York Times described it as \\"full of transfixing slo-mo production by Stelios Phili somewhere between modern-day Internet-rap sparseness and the hard, murky slap of mid-1990s New York street rap.\\" In 2017, Phili began collaborating with New York-based artist Lolo Zoua√Ø. Their first collaboration, \\"High Highs to Low Lows,\\" topped Spotify's Fresh Finds Best of 2017 list. In 2018, Phili produced the Young Thug and Elton John collaboration, \\"High.\\" According to Rolling Stone, the song came together after Phili read an interview with Elton John, who expressed his admiration for Young Thug. After Phili built a new beat around an edited version of the \\"Rocket Man\\" a cappella, 300 Entertainment A&R; Geoff Ogunlesi played the song to Young Thug. On September 24, 2018, \\"High\\" was released on his EP, On the Rvn. The song was awarded Best New Music by Pitchfork Media, with The Fader describing the song's reception as \\"swift and rapturous\\" and \\"a return to iconoclastic form for Young Thug.\\"  Musical Style  Phili's production style is described as fresh and understated. In the article, \\"10 Rap Producers You Might Not Know (But Should),\\" Pigeons & Planes writes: \\"Stelios Phili is one of those producers you can recognize from the jump‚Äîhe utilizes a unique collection of sounds that is both muted and aggressive: murky synths and pillowy cymbal taps are cut by a fierce snare, or a saxophone seamlessly transforms into an electric guitar.

Niebla and Vermilacinia (Ramalinaceae) from California and Baja California. Sida Miscellany 14 The epithet \\"pumila\\" is in regard to the dwarf form of the thallus, in contrast to V. combeoides. Distinguishing Features Vermilacinia pumila is classified in the subgenus Vermilacina in which it is distinguished by its small hemispherical thallus of densely compacted, erect but curved stubby branches (crowded together, touching) not more than 1 cm high, and generally 1‚Äì2 mm in diameter. This is in contrast to the taller and narrower, loosely aggregate branches (not touching) of V. combeoides, 2‚Äì4 cm high, and not more than 1 mm in diameter. The branches of V. pumila are slightly inflated above the mid region, which seems related to its thinner cortex, about 50 ¬µm thick, in contrast to the more or less uniform branch diameter of V. combeoides which has a cortex two and one-half to four times as thick (125‚Äì200 ¬µm). Vermilacinia pumila seldom produces the terminal apothecia that is generally characteristic of V. combeoides; instead, its branches frequently bifurcate into narrower lobes that abruptly taper to a pointed apex. Both species have most of the same lichens substances but notably differ in their chemotype profiles. The lichen substances include unknown terpenes referred to as T3, T4 and T5, bougeanic acid, zeorin and (-)-16 Œ±-hydroxykaurane with salazinic acid occasionally present. The unknown T4 compound, found only in some species of subgenus Vermilacinia, was present in all specimens of V. pumila studied, in contrast to not always present in V. combeoides. Zeorin was often absent in V. combeoides but always present in V. pumila. The T5 compound was found only in V. combeoides. Vermilacinia pumila appears intermediate between V. combeoides and V. robusta by its slightly inflated branches, which in V. robusta are of similar length to V. combeoides, but usually more inflated, from 1‚Äì6 mm in diameter, with a cortex about 100‚Äì120 ¬µm thick.

Only the ruins of Crossley remain, though the town and its surrounding area have been converted into the Crossley Preserve - a hiking and nature area. History Crossley originated as a clay-mining town in the late 1800s, and remained active until the early 1900s. The clay was used to produce terracotta pottery, bricks, and pipes. The land at Crossley, owned by the Crossley Clay Works, was acquired in 1914 by the George C. Crossley Company. It was sold in the 1920s to the Cypress Land Company, who later sold it to the New Jersey Natural Lands Trust. Crossley Preserve The New Jersey Natural Land Trust establish the Crossley Preserve on of land at the abandoned townsite. The densely forested Pine Barrens of New Jersey surround the area. The preserve contains historic and cultural sites, and is used for environmental education, recreation, and endangered species protection. A portion of the Thomas F. Hampton Memorial Trail follows an abandoned \\"donkey\\" railroad once located at Crossley. The narrow gauge railway was used to haul clay--mined from open pits--to Crossley, where it was then loaded onto rail cars of the former Pennsylvania Railroad. The mine pits have since formed into ponds. Flora and fauna along the trail include the Pine Barrens tree frog, pitch pine, scrub oak, laurels, and Atlantic white cedar. Signs have been placed along the rail trail informing visitors about fire control, endangered plants (including the state endangered Pickering's morning glory, and the federally threatened Knieskern's beaked- rush), Pine Barrens ecology, and research on endangered pine snakes and corn snakes. The signs also identify artifacts and features of the ruins of Crossley.

Once an independent municipality, it was annexed by Cleveland after a referendum in 1923. The area covers 12.5 square miles and is bounded by West 117th Street to the east, the Rocky River Valley to the west, Brookpark Road to the South, and the streetcar suburb of Lakewood to the north. The Cleveland City Planning Commission traditionally divides West Park into four subneighborhoods: Jefferson, Kamm's Corners, Bellaire‚ÄìPuritas, and Hopkins.Until 2014, Bellaire‚ÄìPuritas and Hopkins were known as Puritas‚ÄìLongmead and Riverside respectively. History Up until the 1600s, the area of West Park had no name. West Park was part of the vast, forest-covered wilderness that once blanketed most of the eastern half of the present United States and it followed the pattern of settlement from Native American civilizations to migration from eastern colonists.A History of Ohio, Eugene H.

The dates for these events will sometimes differ among various authors or sources, depending on whether the date elected is for the original citizen petition, or the official approval and designation by the County Commissioners, or the first formal meeting of their Council. =Naming of West Park= The name West Park was named after one of its early settlers, John M. West. West was born in 1811 in County Leitrim, Ireland. He immigrated to America with his parents in 1826. In the 1840s he married Frances O'Brien who was born in County Roscommon, Ireland.\\"West, John M.\\", Early Settlers and Their Legacies, History of the West Park Neighborhood, Cleveland, Cuyahoga County, Ohio, last modified June 17, 2004. http://www.westparkhistory.com/history/settlers.htm In about 1842, John West bought a 600-acre farm in Rockport Township, situated along the south side of Lorain Avenue and extending roughly from present West 137th to West 143rd Streets.Gary Swilik, \\"Meet the REAL Founder of West Park!http://www.westparkhistory.com/history/realwest.htm last modified August 7, 2013. As of 2014, the red brick home he built still stands at 3684 West 138th Street. John and Frances West had a family of eight children in the house, raising six of them to adulthood.Some sources incorrectly claim West Park was named for \\"Benjamin West\\". An early researcher got it wrong years ago and the error has been repeated ever since. For example, see Iezzi, History of Rockport Township and The City of Fairview Park From Its Origins to 192, 6. The West Farm included a 25-acre \\"front yard\\" and an artificial lake complete with rowboats. This park-like wooded preserve, located at present West 138th Street and Lorain Avenue, came to be called \\"West Park.\\" Thus, John M. West is not the founder of West Park nor its first settler, but he did create the estate from which the city of West Park took its name. City of West Park West Park existed as a separate municipality for approximately nine years and eight months but during that brief period it was a fully functioning city. It had a two-story brick city hall on Lorain Avenue near West 157th Street which housed the mayor's office, all city departments, and police headquarters. The West Park police department consisted of a chief, two sergeants and 12 officers. The fire department boasted two fire stations, a chief, a captain, three lieutenants, 20 men, and a motorized fire engine. West Park also claimed a well-developed public school system with nine schools, one of them a high school with 300 students (the old John Marshall High School at the corner of W. 152nd and Lorain Avenue) and 2650 pupils and 94 teachers overall.Detroit Board of Education, The Detroit Educational Bulletin (Detroit, MI., 1922), 27. The city's total property evaluation in 1922 was $27,000,000. =Annexation to Cleveland= In the early 1920s, a campaign began to annex West Park to the city of Cleveland, its immediate neighbor to the east. Miss Carrie Norton, stated, \\"Annexation is inevitable, and the logical moment has arrived.\\" Cleveland was then the fifth largest city in the country, having annexed many of the smaller communities around it. Over the years, the citizens of Newburgh, South Brooklyn and Collinwood, among others, voted to merge with the City of Cleveland. By 1922, Cleveland wanted to add West Park to the list. The majority of people in West Park liked the idea. Mayor George C. Reitz stated he'd no longer be mayor of West Park, but \\"I'm going to be a resident of Cleveland.\\" Some of the issues that persuaded West Parkers to want to become a part of the city of Cleveland was Cleveland's promise to lower taxes and public transportation fares, update utilities and infrastructure, as well as offer a better safety force and lower-cost schools. The tax rate in West Park was $2.78 while Cleveland's rate was $2.49. Cleveland pledged to provide West Park with street car service for a $.05 compared to the current fare of $.07 ¬Ω and cut water bills in half. Cleveland also claimed to provide a superior school system for a lower cost per pupil. They also promised better police protection, more paved streets, better lighting, and increased public service. In spite of all the claims, street car service was the main issue in the annexation battle. The matter came to a vote on November 7, 1922. Annexation won by a vote of 2,011 to 1,077. West Park became Cleveland's new ward 33. The public property and services were taken over by Cleveland, and West Park became a part of Cleveland on January 1, 1923. West Park was the last independent city to be annexed by Cleveland. West Park in the 21st Century West Park in the 21st century is more defined as west of W. 130th Street to the Metroparks and the Rocky River Valley. It seems more suburban than urban, with trim brick bungalows and Tudors, and thriving retail areas. There is a collection of mostly Irish-oriented bars and restaurants near Kamm's Corners. One of them, P.J. McIntyres‚Äô Irish Pub is owned by Patrick and Rebecca Campbell, former principal dancers from the Lord of the Dance. The building also houses an Irish dance academy. In 2019, the Cleveland Public Library appointed an architectural team to renovate and build an addition on the system‚Äôs West Park Branch Library, as part of a 10-year, $100 million plan to update 27 branches throughout the city. The project, funded by a tax increase in 2017, which won by a near 70% margin, should be completed by 2029 when the system will invest an additional $65 million into renovations of the Main Library in downtown Cleveland. The neighborhood has been the site for the ‚ÄúHooley,‚Äù an outdoor, family-oriented party that features Irish dance, music, food and drink. Celebrating its 10th Anniversary in 2019, the Hooley (Irish for a ‚Äúlively gathering‚Äù) is traditionally opened either by the Cleveland Police Pipe and Drums or the Cleveland Firefighters Memorial Pipe and Drums. Local politicians, jazz and rock bands, and children's programs complete the day. West Park also celebrates the annual Greek Festival, a three-day event with live Greek music, dancing and Greek food, served in tents set up in the neighborhood. Sponsored by the George Varouh Cretan Club of Cleveland, the clubhouse is also available to event-goers.

In some reissue prints, the film goes by the alternate title Stabbed in the Circus. Plot Krazy comes to watch the circus with a female mink. The act being performed is the flying trapeze. Because their seats are on a balcony, the trapeze can get close to them. And because of this, the acrobat flirts and momentarily takes the mink. While the mink and the acrobat are swinging together, Krazy, who is quite annoyed, conjures a huge needle. Krazy pricks the acrobat in the rear which cause that performer to fall off the bar. Krazy, however, gets arrested by two cops who witness his deed. Krazy is taken to a courthouse. But instead of charging him, the judge calmly tells him he cannot do what he did. Back in the circus, the acrobat and the mink are still swinging together. The mink, for some reason, becomes fed up with him, and therefore pushes him off the trapeze. Upon dropping on the safety net, the acrobat gets catapulted for a few miles. In the courthouse, Krazy is still standing around, attending the session. In no time the acrobat, after a long airborne trip, falls through the roof and into the room. Upon getting back up, the acrobat takes a large piece of lumber, and aims to assault Krazy. After some chase, the acrobat crashes and gets stuck in the judge's desk. Krazy, using a shovel from the room, scoops some burning coals from a stove and pours them into the acrobat's trousers. The acrobat runs hysterically, and even carries away the judge. Momentarily the mink comes to the scene and hugs Krazy.

It was established by the Coral Gables Woman's Club in 1927.  History  Douglas Entrance, site of the original Coral Gables library. The library opened its doors in November 1927, mainly by the efforts of Mrs. Don Peabody, then president of the women's club. The library opened in a room of the Douglas Entrance with 300 books and furniture provided by The Coral Gables Corporation, courtesy of George Merrick, the founder of the city of Coral Gables. By 1937, the library had 9,000 volumes, outgrew the original site, and moved into the Coral Gables Woman's Club location at 1001 East Ponce de Leon Boulevard, Coral Gables, Florida. The librarian at that time was Mrs. Cyrus Kitchen, although she only held the post for about six months, due to ill health. Upon her resignation, Miss Margaret Beaton (from Flagler Memorial Library) became the librarian. The library is supported by the City of Coral Gables, and by 1949 had over 27,000 volumes on its shelves. During the mid 1950s the library contained 35,000 volumes and 5,000 pamphlets. Thus, the Woman's Club, working together with the city of Coral Gables, steered the library to be operated by the city because it was becoming too big a responsibility for the club. The city accepted the proposal and officially, in July, 1954, the Coral Gables Library became a municipally operated library. Architecture and current building Current library building. By the late 1960s the library needed a bigger venue. Therefore, groundbreaking began in 1968 for the 28,000 square-foot-structure built to replace the smaller former library structure on Ponce de Leon Boulevard, and the building was inaugurated in 1969. This building on University Drive and Segovia Street (Coral Gables, FL) is still home to the library. In 1966 the library became part of the Miami-Dade Public Library system. The current library building was built from native keystone, quarried in the Florida Keys. The building's Spanish influence is apparent, conforming to Coral Gables' guidelines for Mediterranean design. It was designed by Edward T. Rempe, AIA, and his associate, Wray G. Succop, AIA.Blanchard, P. (1969). From 300 Books to a New Library. \\"The Miami Herald\\" 5-B http://www.miamiherald.com The library's interior is a blend of Spanish and contemporary influence.

It is remarkable for having continued working into the early 20th century.  Hetton Colliery  The Hetton colliery railway opened in 1822 with steam traction. Although once thought to date from this time, Lyon is now thought to have been built by the colliery in 1851-52. Its designer is thought to be an engineer named Young. A descendant, David Young, now works on the restoration of steam engines at Beamish. Lyon would have been of archaic design by 1852. The view has been put forward that it was one of a pair of replicas built by Sir Lindsay Wood (1834‚Äì1920) from interest in his father Nicholas Wood's earlier designs. The other example was destroyed by a boiler explosion in 1858/1859.  1882 rebuilding  It was extensively rebuilt in 1882. This included modern features, such as paired Salter spring balance safety valves.  Late service  Photograph appearing in the 1905 Railway Magazine The locomotive continued in service at Hetton colliery until either 1908 or 1912. This was already remarkable at the time and a photograph of it was published in the Railway Magazine in 1905. It has worked out its last days at the Colliery driving machinery in the pit sawmill.  Preservation  In 1925, the Stockton and Darlington Railway celebrated its centenary. The LNER organised a cavalcade of locomotives to commemorate this. Locomotion No. 1 was propelled by a dummy petrol engine in its tender, but Lyon was steamed and ran under its own power, leading the cavalcade of fifty three locomotives. The locomotive became part of the initial collection of the National Railway Museum at York. In 1974 was loaned to the new Beamish Museum where it was initially displayed in the Colliery and latterly at the Waggonway, together with working replicas of contemporary locomotives. In 2006 it was moved to the Locomotion museum at Shildon, but returned to Beamish in May 2011.  Dating  There is some debate over the locomotive's original construction date, and even its name. Lowe (1975) gives the name as Lyons, but most current sources favour Lyon. Both are probably derived from the name of Hetton Lyons Colliery, which closed in 1960 and is now the site of an industrial estate and a country park. The Hetton colliery railway used steam locomotives from the outset; four built in 1820 and one in 1822. They were developments of George Stephenson's earlier Killingworth design. These were of 0-4-0 arrangement with two vertical cylinders, one above each axle, and the wheels coupled by drive chains. They used steam springs for suspension, there not yet being a way of forging an adequate steel spring to carry the weight of a locomotive. For many years, before and during preservation, it was thought that Lyon was one of this original group of locomotives, built in 1822. Lowe describes four named 1820 locomotives and an unnamed 1822 locomotive, which he identifies as this one, the only one to be preserved. Its designers were held to be George Stephenson and Nicholas Wood. It is now thought to have first been constructed in 1852, some years after Stephenson's death. The design is little changed from Stephenson locomotives of the 1820s (i.e. before Rocket) and this confused early researchers. The use of either the single flued boiler or the vertical cylinders were obsolete by Rocket. One distinctive difference from these locomotives was the enlarged smokebox with an easily opened door, providing more space for and easier cleaning of ashes.  Vertical-boilered Lyons  The vertical-boilered Lyons in 1901 Two quite separate locomotives, Lyons and Eppleton, were built at the colliery much later on, similar to those also built locally by Head Wrightson. These were small vertical-boilered well tank, with chain drive from a small vertical engine. Lyons locomotive was described in The Locomotive Magazine in 1901. Lowe's view is that Lyon dates from 1822 and the Lyons he describes is this later locomotive with a vertical boiler and chain drive,.

This may often take the form of a simile. One can distinguish the literary joining of terms derived from the vocabularies of sensory domains from synaesthesia as a neuropsychological phenomenon. Panchronistic tendencies It has been suggested that, in the tradition of Romantic poetry, the sensory transfer consisting in the synaesthesic metaphor tends to be from a lower (less differentiated sense) to a higher sense. In this respect, the sequence of senses from low to high is generally taken to be touch, taste, smell, sound, then sight. This observation was named a panchronistic tendency by Stephen Ullmann since he saw the lowest levels of sense having the poorest vocabulary. Upwards transfers are thought to have strong emotional effects, but downwards transfers generally witty effects.  Rhetorical synaesthesia as simile  Examples of synaesthesic simile: * \\"his words cut the air like a dagger\\" (Oscar Wilde, The Picture of Dorian Gray) * \\"thy voice is like wine to me\\" (Oscar Wilde, Salome)  Rhetorical synaesthesia as transmodal modification  When a modifier which would normally apply to one sense is used collocating a noun evocative of another sense, this is known as transmodal modification. Examples include: * \\"mauve Hungarian music\\" (Oscar Wilde, An Ideal Husband)  Rhetorical synaesthesia as transmodal predication  When a noun evoking one sense is linked with a predicate evoking another, this is known as transmodal predication. Examples include: * \\"My nostrils see her breath burn like a bush.\\" (Dylan Thomas, When all my Five and Country Senses See) * \\"the silence that dwells in the forest is not so black\\" (Oscar Wilde, Salome)  Synaesthetic polysemy  When a linkage of two senses depends upon a pun, this is known as synaesthetic polysemy.

Halsey (1915‚Äì1999) was an influential abstract artist in the American Southeast, particularly in his home state of South Carolina. He was represented by the Bertha Schaefer Gallery in New York City (1948‚Äì53). His mural studies for the Baltimore Hebrew Congregational Temple were included in Synagogue Art Today at the Jewish Museum, New York City (1952). His work was included in the annual International Exhibition of Watercolors, the Art Institute of Chicago (1939, 1941‚Äì43). He had work in the Whitney Museum's Annual Exhibition of Contemporary American Sculpture, Watercolors and Drawings (1953). A mid-career retrospective was held at the Greenville County Museum of Art in 1972 and then traveled to the Gibbes Museum of Art (formerly the Gibbes Art Gallery), Charleston, South Carolina, and the Florence Museum, Florence, South Carolina. Early life William Halsey was born in Charleston, South Carolina. His talent was evident at an early age, and he was encouraged by his mother, Eleanor Loeb Halsey. His first instructor was the local artist Elizabeth O'Neill Verner, who had studied at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and was one of the leading artists in the Charleston Renaissance. Another early influence was the local artist Edward I. R. Jennings, who had studied in New York City with Arthur Wesley Dow. It was from Jennings that the young Halsey learned about what was happening in the realm of modern art. After high school Halsey attended the University of South Carolina for two years. Realizing he was only interested in art, he sought another place to study where he could maintain his singular focus. He moved to Boston to study at the Boston Museum School (now called the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston). His courses at the school were rigorous and included anatomy, perspective, composition, and drawing. He developed an interest in fresco and became sufficiently trained to be able to teach this technique at the school. He attended the school from 1935 to 1939. In 1939 upon completing his study at the Museum School of Fine Arts, he was awarded a James William Paige Fellowship for 24 months of study and travel in Europe. With the outbreak of World War II on the horizon, Europe was not an option. As an alternative he was allowed to go to Mexico. He and his new wife, Corrie McCallum, sailed for Veracruz and then settled in Mexico City. The change of location to Mexico had a profound influence upon the young artist. Surrounded by weaving, pottery, and the colorful scenery in Mexico, he was drawn to this country and its ancient cultures. This interest only became deeper and more profound during his life. Return to Charleston The young couple returned to South Carolina along with their first child, Eleanor Paige Halsey. Halsey took a teaching position as the director of the art school at the Telfair Academy (now the Telfair Museum of Art) in Savannah, Georgia. In 1945 the family, which now included their son, David Ashley Halsey, moved back to Charleston. Halsey became the director of the art classes held at the Gibbes Art Gallery (now Gibbes Museum of Art). Halsey chose to settle and to continue his artistic career in his hometown. A third child, Louise McCallum Halsey, was born in 1949. During that time he befriended Merton Simpson, a young African-American teenager with an immense amount of talent. Due to segregation, Simpson was not allowed to take art classes at the Gibbes Museum where Halsey taught, so Halsey provided private instruction. After Simpson graduated from high school in 1949, Halsey, his wife Corrie McCallum, and former director of the Charleston Museum Laura Bragg sponsored Merton Simpson's first solo art show. Two receptions for the art show were held, \\"one for whites and one for whites who didn't mind coming to a reception with blacks.\\" In his later works Halsey used fabrics from Africa that were packing materials around sculptures Simpson imported and sold in his gallery. The two artists maintained a lifelong friendship. In 2006 in a tribute for the catalog William Halsey: Mastery of the Modern, Merton Simpson wrote \\"I had the good fortune of growing up in Charleston when he was the top artist in the region, what a blessing.\\" Exhibitions and awards Halsey was chosen for many honors throughout his long career. While still a student at the Museum School of the Arts, Boston, a painting of his was selected for an exhibition at the Art Institute of Chicago. In 1939, having just graduated, he was offered a one-man exhibition at the Berkshire Museum in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, where he also completed a series of frescoes. The Gibbes Museum in Charleston gave Halsey a one-man exhibition in 1940 that traveled to the Norfolk Museum and the Lynchburg Art Gallery in Virginia. In 1972 the Greenville County Museum of Art in Greenville SC curated an exhibition and published an accompanying monograph, \\"William M. Halsey: Retrospective\\". The monograph covered four decades of work by this artist whom the director of the Greenville County Museum of Art, Jack A. Morris Jr, described as \\"a pioneer of abstract painting in the South and a nationally recognized talent.\\" In 1953 Halsey, his wife Corrie McCallum, and local sculptor Willard Hirsch joined together to form the independent Charleston Art School which they operated from 1953-64. The school offered classes to all ages in both 2D and 3D processes. In 1965 Halsey started his university teaching career, as the founding faculty for the studio art program at the College of Charleston. During that time among the many students he taught, Brian Rutenberg was one who graduated and went on to establish his career in New York City. Halsey taught at the college from 1965 to 1984. In 1984 upon his retirement from teaching at the College of Charleston, the gallery at the Simons Fine Arts Center (now the Halsey Institute) was named in his honor. Mark Sloan, director and chief curator at the Halsey Institute, has chosen to focus on work by contemporary under-known artists with significant exceptions like a recent exhibition of prints by Jasper Johns and work by Shepard Fairey. Halsey was awarded an honorary degree from the College of Charleston in 1995. In 1999 he received posthumously the Elizabeth O'Neill Verner Governor's Award for the Arts, for Lifetime Achievement, which is the highest award in the arts given in South Carolina.

Career KIRO radio journalist Shannon Drayer interviews Seattle Mariners player Dee Gordon after a game in Oakland, California, on August 30, 2018. In 1997, Drayer was working as a barista at a Starbucks coffee shop when a customer encouraged her to submit a tape for a sports radio contest at KJR, a Seattle sports radio channel. As one of the finalists, Drayer started getting fill-in spots covering Washington Huskies men's basketball, the Seattle SuperSonics, the Seattle Seahawks, and the Mariners for KJR for four years. In 2003, KOMO radio hired Drayer to cover the Mariners beat for their radio station full-time. She covered the Mariners beat for six years for KOMO before being hired by KIRO. Since 2009, Drayer has served as KIRO's clubhouse reporter, interviewing players and coaches before and after the game for the radio station. She also writes a Mariners blog for the KIRO website. =Role as female sports reporter covering male athletes= Drayer said in an interview that while she loved baseball, she knew she could not play or manage because she was female, and had initially dismissed journalism as a career option because when she was in college in the late 1980s, \\"pretty much the only women who were working in sportscasting were ex- beauty queens and basketball players.\\" When she was hired for the Mariners beat by KOMO, Drayer became one of the first female sports journalists in the United States to travel with the team on their airplane. Drayer has said her gender was not an issue in the clubhouse, and that as long as she did her job as a reporter professionally, she was treated the same as male colleagues. Generally, players have treated her with respect, opening doors for her and ensuring she has a chance to ask her questions, she said. Personal Drayer moved around the United States a lot as a child. She played trumpet in the University of Washington marching band. After receiving a degree in drama from the University of Washington, she spent a year in New York pursuing acting career before moving back to Seattle.

In 19331934 it became Orange Free State Command, and then may have become Central Command around 1939.The Officers commanding the new Commands were usually Brigadiers all units in those areas fell under them as far as training, housing, administration , discipline and counter insurgency was concerned. Dan Pienaar served as officer commanding from 04 January 1935 to January 1937, before being transferred to take command of the Roberts' Heights and Transvaal Command at Voortrekkerhoogte which he commanded from 17 October 1938 to May 1940. On 3 September 1939 the command included the 4th Infantry Brigade (including Regiment President Steyn, RLW, Regiment de Wet, and 4 Field Company SAEC, a pioneer battalion, and an artillery regiment, the Orange Free State Field Artillery (O.V.S. Veld Artillerie in Afrikaans). The OVSVA may have later become the Orange Free State Artillery, and later, in turn, 6 Field Regiment South African Artillery.

The base was first used by the 4th Marines in late April 1966. In mid-July ƒê√¥ng H√† was used by the Marines as a helicopter base and logistics area. Numerous US marine and army units rotated through the base, and several artillery units were based there. During 1968 units of the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) made repeated attacks on the base, on one occasion destroying its ammunition dump. During these attacks, and in other actions in the general area the PAVN suffered heavy casualties. By January 1972 the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) 3rd Division had assumed responsibility for the defense of ƒê√¥ng H√† and the area north of Highway 9. During April 1972 the PAVN made repeated assaults on Dong Ha and it fell on the 28th.

The base was first used by the 3rd Battalion, 4th Marines in late April 1966. 2nd Battalion, 4th Marines was deployed by air to the base on 29 May in Operation Reno to support Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) forces in sweeps around ƒê√¥ng H√†. During this period the U.S. Air Force (USAF) installed a Combat Skyspot radar system at the airfield, 6 USAF radar technicians were killed in an ambush on 5 June 6 km south of the base. The Marines departed ƒê√¥ng H√† on 8 June. On 22 June the Marines' \\"Task Force Charlie\\" comprising two Force Reconnaissance Companies, Companies from 2nd Battalion 1st Marines and 3/4 Marines and Battery H 3rd Battalion, 12th Marines deployed to ƒê√¥ng H√† and Cam L·ªô. In mid-July ƒê√¥ng H√† was used by the Marines as a helicopter base and logistics area in support of Operation Hastings and Marine Aircraft Group 16 (MAG-16) established a forward base here at this time. Following the completion of Operation Hastings on 3 August, the Marines kept a force at ƒê√¥ng H√† comprising 2/4 Marines, elements of the 3rd Engineer Battalion, Marine logistics troops, MAG-16 and the Army's 220th Assault Helicopter Company and these forces were immediately used to launch Operation Prairie. On 10 October the 3rd Marine Division established a forward headquarters at ƒê√¥ng H√† to counter an expected People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) attack through the DMZ. ƒê√¥ng H√† became an increasingly important forward base supporting USMC operations along the DMZ and its airfield was lengthened to accommodate Lockheed C-130 Hercules transports. In addition a LCU/YFU offloading facility operated by the Naval Support Activity Detachment, Dong Ha was developed to receive supplies ferried from the C·ª≠a Vi·ªát Base. On 12 April 1967 the 9th Marines moved their headquarters to ƒê√¥ng H√†. On the night of 27/8 April the base was hit by more than 50 PAVN 140mm rockets. On the early morning of 18 May more than 150 140mm rockets hit the base killing 11 Marines and wounding 91. In mid-May BLT 3/4 Marines was landed by air at ƒê√¥ng H√† to participate in Operation Hickory. ƒê√¥ng H√† was intended to form a supporting base for the McNamara Line and supported USMC forces engaged at Con Thien. On 26 August the base was hit by 150 PAVN artillery and rockets in 3 separate attacks destroying 2 helicopters and damaging 24 others. On 3 September PAVN rockets hit the ammunition dump and fuel storage facility causing a huge explosion that damaged 17 helicopters of HMM-361 and wounded 77 Marines. Marine aviation units based at ƒê√¥ng H√† during this period included: *Marine Aircraft Group 16 Forward: **HMM-163 detachments (December 1966 ‚Äì January 1967) **HMM-164 detachments (July 1966 ‚Äì March 1967, July‚ÄìNovember 1967) **HMM-263 detachments (August 1966 ‚Äì April 1967, August‚ÄìOctober 1967) **HMM-265 detachments (April‚ÄìJune 1967) **HMM-361 detachments (June‚ÄìNovember 1967) **HMM-363 detachments (April‚ÄìJune 1967, August‚ÄìNovember 1967) **VMO-2 detachments (July 1966 ‚Äì November 1967) *Marine Air Support Squadron 2 - operated a Direct Air Support Center (DASC) and multiple Air Support Radar Teams in support of the 3d Marine Division. 3 September 1967 attack convinced the Marines that ƒê√¥ng H√† was too vulnerable to PAVN artillery and rocket attack to continue to be used as a helicopter facility and the Marines moved their units back to Phu Bai and Marble Mountain while the logistics base was moved to the new Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã Combat Base. Army units based at ƒê√¥ng H√† during this period included: *Battery F, 26th Artillery *Battery G, 29th Artillery *1st Battalion, 44th Artillery (1966‚Äì70) *Battery G, 65th Artillery (1966‚Äì70) *2nd Battalion, 94th Artillery (October 1966 ‚Äì March 1968) =1968= 2/4 Marines search Dai Do village, May 1968 CH-46A Sea Knight near ƒê√¥ng H√†, 5 May 1968 On 15 January 3 Marine Division moved its headquarters from Phu Bai to ƒê√¥ng H√†. On 26 February the base hit by more than 400 PAVN artillery and mortar rounds resulting in 1 Marine killed and several wounded, two Army observation aircraft were destroyed as well as ammunition and diesel storage facilities. On 29 April the PAVN 320th Division attacked An Binh, north of ƒê√¥ng H√†, this drew two Battalions of the ARVN 2nd Regiment into a running battle and the 1st Battalion 9th Marines was sent into support the ARVN resulting in a 7-hour long battle that left 11 Marines, 17 ARVN and over 150 PAVN dead. The following day the 3rd Battalion 9th Marines arrived to support the Marine/ARVN force and was ambushed north of Cam Vu, 20 Marines and 41 NVA were killed. Also on 30 April, a PAVN unit opened fire on a US Navy Clearwater patrol from entrenched positions near Dai Do, 2.5 km northeast of ƒê√¥ng H√†. It was later discovered that four PAVN Battalions including the 48th and 56th from the 320th had established themselves at Dai Do. The Battle of Dai Do lasted until 3 May and resulted in 81 Marines and over 600 PAVN killed. The PAVN engaged US and ARVN forces elsewhere around ƒê√¥ng H√† from 4‚Äì6 April, on the evening of 6 April the 2nd Brigade 1st Cavalry Division was deployed into Tru Kinh and on 9 April was ambushed by a PAVN force resulting in 16 U.S. dead for the loss of 80 PAVN. On 10 April a night attack north of Nhi Ha was broken up by air, artillery and naval support, 159 NVA were killed. After this the 320th had broken into small groups and was moving back towards the DMZ, from 9‚Äì17 May the 2nd Brigade reported killing 349 PAVN for the loss of 28 killed. While it seemed that the 320th had abandoned their attempts to take ƒê√¥ng H√† this was just a temporary lull. On 22 May a unit from the 320th ran into a Company from 3rd Battalion 3rd Marines between Con Thien and Gio Linh and was caught in the open by Marine artillery and air support. East of Con Thien the 1st Battalion 4th Marines encountered another PAVN unit setting off a two-day battle as the PAVN tried to escape back through the DMZ resulting in 23 Marines and 225 PAVN killed. On 25 May in actions at Dai Do and Nhi Ha 350 PAVN were killed. In two actions at Tru Kinh on 26 May over 56 PAVN were killed for the loss of 10 Marines, while the ARVN killed 110 PAVN north of Thuong Nghia. On 27 April the Marines killed 28 PAVN and by 30 May the 320th was attempting to escape through the Marine and ARVN cordon. Total PAVN losses in the second Battle of ƒê√¥ng H√† were over 1000 killed. On 14 May PAVN artillery destroyed 150 tons of munitions in the base's ammunition dump. On 20 June the base's ammunition dump was destroyed by PAVN artillery fire closing the entire logistics facility for 6 days. In August another artillery attack killed 2 Marines and wounded 3 others and destroyed 6 vehicles. On 30 October 48 artillery rounds hit the base killing 1 Marine. Army units based at ƒê√¥ng H√† in this period included: *1st Battalion, 11th Infantry (November 1968) =1969‚Äì71= In September 1969 as part of Operation Keystone Cardinal the 3rd Marine Division began its withdrawal from Vietnam and by early October the Marines had handed over control of their tactical area of operations (including the ƒê√¥ng H√† base) to the 1st Brigade, 5th Infantry Division and the ARVN 1st Division. In 1970 the Marines 5th 175mm Gun Battery kept its command post at ƒê√¥ng H√† under the operational control of the 108th Artillery Group with its 175mm guns at Camp Carroll and 8in guns at FSB A-2. A small number of Marines remained at ƒê√¥ng H√† as part of the ANGLICO unit supporting the ARVN 1st Division. Units based at ƒê√¥ng H√† in this period included: *3rd Battalion, 1st Infantry (April 1971) *4th Battalion, 3rd Infantry (April 1971) *6th Battalion, 33rd Artillery (1969 ‚Äì February 1970) *2nd Battalion, 94th Artillery (1970‚Äì71) =1972= By January 1972 the ARVN 3rd Division had assumed responsibility for the defense of ƒê√¥ng H√† and the area north of Highway 9. At the start of the Easter Offensive on 30 March 1972 the 25th Marine Brigade was deployed to ƒê√¥ng H√† to support the 3rd Division. By 1 April the PAVN had broken through the ARVN defensive positions along the DMZ and north of the Cam Lo River and fragmented ARVN units and terrified civilians began withdrawing to ƒê√¥ng H√†. By 11:00 on 2 April the ARVN 20th Tank Battalion moved forward to ƒê√¥ng H√† to support the 3rd Marine Battalion and 25th Marine Brigade in and around the town and defend the crucial road and rail bridges across the Cua Viet River. Marine ANGLICO units called in naval gunfire to hit PAVN forces near the bridges on the north bank of the river and destroyed 4 PT-76 amphibious tanks east of ƒê√¥ng H√†. More tanks were hit by a Republic of Vietnam Air Force A-1 Skyraider before it was shot down. At midday PAVN tanks attempted to force the road bridge but 6 tanks were destroyed by fire from the ARVN 20th Tank's M48s. At approximately 1 pm Captain John Ripley, an adviser to the Vietnamese Marines, swung under the road bridge and spent 3 hours installing demolition charges to destroy the bridge. The bridge was blown up at 16:30 and the damaged railway bridge was destroyed around the same time temporarily halting the PAVN advance. Naval gunfire and a Boeing B-52 Stratofortress strike were soon directed at PAVN forces gathered on the northern bank. At 18:00 a USAF Douglas EB-66 Destroyer was shot down west of ƒê√¥ng H√† and a no fire zone was imposed around the area allowing the PAVN to capture the Cam Lo Bridge intact. Over the next two weeks PAVN forces kept up a barrage of artillery, mortar and small arms fire on the ARVN positions and infiltrated small units across the river in boats. On 7 April the Marines withdrew from ƒê√¥ng H√† leaving the defense to the 1st ARVN Armored Brigade, 20th Tank Battalion, the 4th and 5th Ranger Groups and the 57th Regiment. On 18 April the PAVN 308th Division attacking from the southwest attempted to outflank ƒê√¥ng H√† but were repulsed. On 28 April the commander of the 20th Tank Battalion withdrew from ƒê√¥ng H√† to deal with a PAVN force threatening the √Åi T·ª≠ Combat Base, seeing the tanks leaving the soldiers of the 57th Regiment panicked and abandoned their positions leading to the collapse of the ARVN defensive line. In late October the ARVN began attacks north of Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã to try to regain positions along the south bank of the Cua Viet River. The attacks were met with a stiff PAVN response and were stopped at the Th·∫°ch H√£n River. A further attack from the coast by the Vietnamese Marines in November made limited gains. As the ongoing peace negotiations would soon lead to a ceasefire, the South Vietnamese Joint General Staff sought the most advantageous battlefield positions possible and so ordered a further effort to regain the south bank of the Cua Viet River. In mid-January 1973 an attack by the Marines succeeded in recapturing the Cua Viet Base but was stopped some 5 km east of ƒê√¥ng H√†. On 27 January in accordance with the provisions of the Paris Peace Accords a ceasefire in place took effect across South Vietnam. Current use The base has been turned over to housing and shops and a large ceremonial square.

Created in 2010 by Sam Khandaghabadi as a regular gathering for wrestlers who wanted to perform edgier acts for adults, Hoodslam quickly became a popular event in the Bay Area, attracting over 1,000 attendees at each monthly performance. Hoodslam performances combine the athleticism and tropes of professional wrestling with more bizarre, absurd characters, as well as profanity, sexuality, and public consumption of drugs and alcohol, which are not considered appropriate at mainstream professional wrestling events.  History  Sam Khandaghabadi, founder of Hoodslam, wrestling as The Dark Sheik Hoodslam was founded by Sam Khandaghabadi, who had been wrestling at other venues under the name The Sheik but was fed up with needing to keep his act appropriate for children. He called together other wrestlers he had met on the West Coast and convinced them to come to the Victory Warehouse in Oakland, the place where he lived and where underground metal shows were regularly performed, promising them that profanity and sexuality would be allowed. 15 wrestlers participated in the first Hoodslam, for which Khandaghabadi did not charge admission. The gathering continued to be held monthly until May 2011, when the landlord of the Victory Warehouse complained about the noise and partying surrounding the event. However, in June 2011, slam poet Jamie DeWolf invited Khandaghabadi and the other Hoodslam wrestlers to perform as part of his underground variety art show, Tourettes Without Regrets, at a larger warehouse venue in Oakland, the Oakland Metro Opera House. The popularity of their performance ensured them a regularly monthly spot at the Oakland Metro - on the same night as Oakland's First Friday art gathering - which continued to attract large crowds. In October 2014, for the first time, the 1,000-person venue sold out before the show began. Starting in early 2015, an offshoot of Hoodslam, called \\"Beachslam\\", began promoting shows in Santa Cruz, California and Knightsen, California featuring many of the same performers and characters as Hoodslam--as well as several new, regional or experimental characters.  Style and characteristics  The Stoner Brothers, a popular duo at Hoodslam, wrestling Bat Manuel and El Chupacabra According to Khandaghabadi, Hoodslam, unlike traditional professional wrestling, is a form of performance art: because the wrestlers do not need to appeal to a young audience and do not have to pretend that their act is real, they can unleash their creativity in a more sophisticated way, simultaneously demonstrating their athleticism and poking fun at the absurdity of professional wrestling. Hoodslam wrestler A.J. Kirsch states that the tagline of the event, \\"This Is Real,\\" is a tongue-in-cheek reference to the obvious absurdity of the show, which features wrestlers dressed as popular video game characters Ken and Ryu, as well as an \\"invisible\\" wrestler, Charlie Chaplin, whom the real wrestlers pretend to battle. Unlike the characters and story lines, however, the physical prowess of the performers is real, and their moves are difficult and dangerous. As the show unfolds, the performers chant, \\"fuck the fans,\\" which, according to O.J. Patterson, is a \\"unifying war chant\\" that functions as \\"part reminder not to take things too seriously and part demand for hedonistic excess.\\"  Notable performers  WWE Tag Team Champions Paul London and Brian Kendrick holding the decapitated corpse of Hoodslam's donkey mascot, Butternuts at a May 2015 event. Many former WWE and ECW wrestlers have made appearances at Hoodslam: since 2013, Brian Kendrick, Paul London, Sinn Bodhi, Shelly Martinez, Gangrel, Sonny Onoo and Mustafa Saed have performed on the Hoodslam stage. Other current AEW, WWE, and independent personnel who have appeared at Hoodslam include: Peter Avalon, Leva Bates, Shotzi Blackheart, MVP, Joey Ryan, Christina Von Eerie, and Drake Younger.

On January 13, 2015, he succeeded state Senator Dan Patrick of Houston, who successfully ran for Lieutenant Governor of Texas. Background Bettencourt holds a Bachelor of Science degree from Texas A&M; University in College Station. He studied industrial distribution in the College of Engineering. He and his wife, the former Susan Sladic (also born 1958), have two children, Henry and Christina Bettencourt. The Bettencourts are affiliated with Saint John Vianney Roman Catholic Church. Political career =Harris County Tax Assessor-Collector= From 1998 to early in 2008, Bettencourt was the Tax Assessor-Collector of his native Harris County, the third largest county in the United States. In that capacity, he established a website that included on-line tax bills and the first on-line automobile registration and property tax payment plan in Texas. Under his management, the number of taxing jurisdictions served by the Assessor's office increased from forty-four to sixty-five. He kept the same $25 million budget throughout his decade in office. Bettencourt is known as \\"The Tax Man\\" for his work as Assessor-Collector and his push to lower property tax rates. Bettencourt was elected in 1998 as the first-ever Republican Tax Assessor- Collector in Harris County's history, serving ten years in total. By 2000, his Voter Registration Department had scrubbed the voter rolls of 50,000 deceased and felon voter registrations, of which 500 actually had someone still voting in 1994, 1996, and 1998 elections. In 2002, Bettencourt's office released an audit of the 2001 City of Houston elections showing 2,098 people voting illegally in those elections. While automating voter registration procedures, Bettencourt won reelection in 2000, 2004, and 2008, and set the highest record vote total, 607,085, in a contested major party race of any Republican office holder to date for Harris County in 2004. The Democratic Party and plaintiffs filed suit and requested a temporary restraining order against the Voter Registrar Bettencourt after the 2008 election, asking a Federal Judge to block the counting of 7000+ provisional ballots from the November 2008 election. However, the temporary restraining order was denied by the Judge. All 7000+ provisional ballots were reviewed by Election Officials, and either rejected or accepted and then electronically counted. Soon after he won a third term in the 2008 general election over a retired educator, Democrat Diane Trautman, Bettencourt resigned from office. He announced after Thanksgiving Day that he would instead launch Bettencourt Tax Advisors, LLC, through which he has continued a fight for lower property taxes for residential and commercial customers in Houston and statewide. Trautman questioned the timing of Bettencourt's decision, and asked the Harris County Commissioners Court to consider her as his successor. The Commissioners Court, by a four-to-one margin, instead chose the Hispanic businessman Leo Vasquez to fill Bettencourt's seat until a special election could be held in 2010. =Texas State Senate= 2014 election Bettencourt ran for the Texas State Senate in 2014 again enlisted the help of top Republican Strategist Allen Blakemore. In the Senate race, Bettencourt carried the support of former Harris County Republican chairmen Gary M. Polland and Jared Woodfill as well as Richard J. Trabulsi, Jr., the chairman of the political action committee, Texans for Lawsuit Reform, and pastor Rick Scarbough of Vision America. After victory in a contested primary on March 4, 2014, Bettencourt won his Senate seat with 123,416 votes (71.8 percent) in the general election held on November 4, 2014. A Democratic candidate, Jim Davis, trailed with 45,162 votes (26.3 percent), and a Libertarian held the remaining 1.9 percent of the ballots cast. Tenure Bettencourt's District 7 encompasses parts of Houston and these smaller Harris County communities: Bunker Hill Village, Hedwig Village, Hunters Creek Village, Jersey Village, Piney Point Village, Spring, and Tomball. The district is so Republican that voters by a ten-to-one margin chose the Republican primary election on March 4, 2014, rather than the Democratic slate. Bettencourt said that he will work in the Senate to keep down property taxes. In the special legislative session in 2017, Bettencourt, the chairman of the newly-established Senate Select Committee on Government Reform, introduced legislation to limit the ability of local government in Texas to raise property assessments for property tax purposes. Bettencourt's bill was backed by Governor Greg Abbott and Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, but opposed by local officials who said the legislation would impair the ability of cities, counties, and special districts to pay for services but would net little tax relief to individual homeowners.Peggy Fikac, \\"Senators rip S.A. as bill on taxes advances: Panel approves measure limiting cities' abilities,\\" San Antonio Express-News, July 23, 2017, pp. 1, A21. Bettencourt has also warned of serious pension liability problems in Texas and has proposed long-term market-based reforms which he claims will not impact those nearing retirement and have already paid significantly into the pension systems.\\"Future shock,\\" San Antonio Express-News, April 16, 2017, p. F2. 2018 reelection Bettencourt won reelection to the state Senate in 2018, despite the overall Democratic sweep of Harris County. He polled 177,668 votes (57.8 percent) to 123,994 ballots (40.3 percent) for the Democrat David Romero. Another 5,866 votes (1.9 percent) went to the Libertarian Party choice, Tom Glass. Tenure He authored a bill that the Texas Senate passed on May 2, 2019 that would move bond, debt and tax elections to November where voter turnout is higher and the bill also places a limit on the wording length of propositions explaining the purposes of a bond election. =Conservative talk radio host= Bettencourt is a conservative talk radio host on KSEV, owned by his predecessor Dan Patrick. =Other political activity= Bettencourt is also a conservative political activist, and a television commentator. He is a former treasurer of the Texas Republican Party and vice chairman and treasurer of the Harris County party organization. He was a delegate to the 2000, 2004, and 2008 Republican National Conventions. He was a presidential elector for Mitt Romney in 2012.

Developed in 1953 to replace the ROKS-2/3 flamethrowers used during World War Two, it was kept in the inventory well into the 1980s. This model was designed as a lightweight, manpack flamethrower with three upright cylinders and a bipod-mounted flame gun. It differed from Western flamethrowers in that it used special ignition cartridges to expel the thickened fuel mixture rather than an inert gas. During the 1960s, the weapon was manufactured by the People's Republic of China. It was replaced in Soviet service by the RPO \\"Rys\\" and RPO-A Shmel incendiary rocket launchers in the 1980s. The LPO saw service in the Vietnam War. Viet Cong forces were reported to have used the flamethrower at the 1967 ƒê·∫Øk S∆°n massacre. At least one was used in an attack on the USMC base at Con Thien (also in 1967), and there were several captured ones on display in Saigon in 1972. The United States Congress in 2011 cites an Irish Times article, reporting that the Irish Republican Army had an estimated 6 units of this model of flamethrower (prior to 2001).

Khodorkovsky states that his organisation advocates democracy and human rights. The first initiative took the form of a foundation whose stated purpose was to \\"build and strengthen civil society in Russia\\", established in 2001. Khodorkovsky relaunched Open Russia in September 2014 as a nationwide community platform as part of a group of activities called \\"Open Media\\".Khodorkovsky website, accessed 9 February 2018 In 2017 the organisation was listed as undesirable by Roskomnadzor, and its website banned in Russia. History =First initiative= This first incarnation of Open Russia has been described by The Guardian as a charitable organization. Its board included Henry Kissinger and Lord Jacob Rothschild. According to the Moscow Times, the earlier incarnation of Open Russia funded ‚Äúmany philanthropic projects, including educational projects for young people, the Federation of Internet Education, the Club of Regional Journalism and projects of human rights NGOs.‚Äù After Khodorkovsky's arrest in 2003, his deputy Leonid Nevzlin took over Open Russia. He was succeeded by Nikolay Bychkov. By 2005, Open Russia had 23 regional affiliates. On February 24, 2005, Russia's Federal Tax Service initiated an inspection of Open Russia, its third such probe in 12 months, which in the opinion of Open Russia was meant \\"to sully the only structure left in the hands of Mikhail Khodorkovsky.‚Äù The first incarnation of Open Russia closed in 2006 when Russian authorities froze its bank accounts. =Second initiative= Open Russia was re-launched on September 20, 2014, as ‚Äúa nationwide community platform designed to bring together all Russians interested in creating a better life for themselves and their children‚Äù during videoconference supporting marches against Putin's policies, with nearly all of the regional locations experiencing Internet connection problems just moments before the conference, sabotage and storming the halls\\" The online relaunch ceremony was attended by prominent Russian activists and √©migr√©s, including Sergei Guriyev and Yevgeny Chichvarkin. The Guardian reported that Khodorkovky's relaunch of Open Russia ‚Äúappears to break his promise to steer clear of politics, which he made after being pardoned by president Vladimir Putin in December.‚Äù The New York Times stated, however, that Khodorkovsky had in fact ‚Äúagreed to stay out of politics until August, when he would have been released anyway. Now freed from that commitment, he is making clear that prison has, if anything, emboldened him in his desire to change his country.‚Äù Objectives The new Open Russia declared that it would focus on several key areas including independent media, political education, the rule of law, and support for political prisoners. Also featured is an extensive Reforms Program aimed at reforming law enforcement and the Constitution to ensure justice and democracy. In addition, Open Russia endorses free and fair elections, and, while staying out of direct political involvement, will lend support to candidates who also promote fair elections. Interviewed in an October 2014 article in the Wall Street Journal, Khodorkovsky said he planned to use Open Russia to push for a constitutional conference that would shift power away from the presidency and toward the legislature and judiciary. This stems, from Khodorkovsky's opinion, from the root cause of Russia's problems - namely the absence of the rule of law. Activities On September 13‚Äì14, 2014, Open Russia presented talks by Lyudmila Ulytskaya, Arina Borodina, and Dmitry Olshansky. The foundation's Open Lecture projected a series of live talks that toured across Russia. To date there have been seven online forums hosted by Open Russia on topics ranging from healthcare reform to combating corruption. Open Russia reported that it will support twenty-five candidates in the upcoming September parliamentary elections. Although it has yet to choose the candidates it will support, the organization has stated it already has two candidates from the Parnas party it is considering. =Russian State ban= In mid 2017 Open Russia was designated as an undesirable organisation by the office of the Prosecutor General of Russia, effectively banning its activities in Russia. In December 2017 Roskomnadzor added the website of the organisation to a registry of blocked sites. Reactions The forums have attracted the attention of law enforcement who, at times, have cut off internet service for particular speakers. The Guardian noted that in September 2014 ‚ÄúRussian state media appeared to enforce a blackout on news coverage of Khodorkovky‚Äôs project.‚Äù According to Khodorkovky's spokeswoman Olga Pispanen, the project's website was targeted by distributed denial of service attacks. Also, some activists were reportedly prevented from joining the ceremony in Nizhny Novgorod and Yaroslavl. The first forum featured by Open Russia, on September 20, 2014, had over 70,000 viewers. Political analyst called Open Russia a ‚Äúsorely needed‚Äù project that represented an ‚Äúantidote‚Äù to the current realities of Russian life. The New York Times noted that when Khodorkovky made his first U.S. appearance since his release from prison, he was praised for his resolve. The Times continued their praise, noting \\"notion of prison as cleansing the soul and ennobling the spirit is a powerful motif in Russian literature\\", citing Dostoyevsky and Solzhenitsyn. In April 2015, masked Russian police raided Open Russia's Moscow office suspecting the organization of ‚Äúpreparing banners, leaflets and posters‚Äù with plans to distribute the material at an opposition protest. Open Russia responded by stating that the group ‚Äúwas not planning to take part‚Äù in the protest. In May 2015 the Russian Justice Ministry requested the Prosecutor General to launch a probe into Open Russia's activities. The Justice Ministry has demanded Open Russia label itself a \\"foreign agent\\". In August 2015, however, a Moscow court ordered investigators to return confiscated documents and ordered a retrial.

The son of George and Eliza Hutton, he was born in St. John's and was educated at Saint Bonaventure's College, at St. Dunstan's College and at the French college at St. Pierre. He later studied music in England for three years around 1900. Hutton began work as a bookkeeper for Hearn & Company in 1879 and then, in 1883, opened a musical supply business. Until 1894, he ran the business out of his home. In 1880, he became organist and choirmaster for the Roman Catholic cathedral in St. John's.

He was a prominent general in several wars, but his most noted contribution was his critical role in suppressing Pugachev's Rebellion.  Biography  Michelsohnen was born in Reval in the Governorate of Estonia to a family of noble rank. His early military career saw him serve as a cavalry officer in many conflicts: the Seven Years' War, the Russo-Turkish War of 1768‚Äì74, and the war against the Bar Confederation. By the end of 1773 Michelsohnen held the rank of Lieutenant-ColonelSince April 24th 1772. List of Military Department's Officers, SPb. ‚Äî1776. of the Saint-Petersburg Regiment of Carabineers, and, after the new force arrived in rebel-occupied territory, was given command over a force of soldiers to fight against the rebels led by Yemelyan Pugachev, who by this time had gained a fearsome reputation and defeated several expeditions sent against him by the government. Soon enough events turned around due to Michelsohnen's exceptional resolve, especially his indefatigability when confronting followers of the rebellion, whom he crushed wherever he encountered them. His most decisive action was at the Battle of Kazan, where he led the relief force to the besieged city. By the time Michelson had arrived on July 13, Pugachev's army had already surrounded the city's Kremlin where the remaining defenders and loyal citizens had taken refuge. Michelsohnen launched a determined strike on the rebels, and thereafter pursued them across the right bank of the Volga River. He refused to relent, and as the rebels attempted to regroup near Tsaritsyn, drove his small army of under 5,000 men to engage Pugachev near Chyorny Yar on August 25, where he annihilated a force of 10,000 rebels, killing 2,000 and capturing 6,000 more, suffering only 90 casualties to his forces in the process. Michelsohnen had managed to end any major threat of the rebellion reemerging and assaulting the Russian interior. For his services in suppressing the revolt, Catherine the Great awarded Michelsohnen with numerous honors: an estate in Vitebsk Governorate, the Gold Sword for Bravery with Diamonds, and the rank of full colonel. On 12 February 1775 Michelson has been given the Cross 3rd class of the Order of St. George (no mention of the Pugachev's uprising has been made in the decree). In 1775 he commanded the Military Order Cuirassier Regiment, then the Life-Cuirassier Regiment the following year. In 1778 he was promoted to major general, and awarded the Order of St. Alexander Nevsky, in 1781 he was given the honorary post of major in the Life-Guard Horse Regiment, and in 1786 was made a lieutenant general. With the outbreak of war against Sweden, Michelsohnen was given command of a corps in the army of General Valentin Platonovich Musin-Pushkin. In 1797 he was promoted to General of Cavalry. In 1803 he was given command of the Belorussian Military Governorate, managing the civil administration of Mogilev and Vitebsk Governorates. In 1805 he was entrusted with command over forces assembled on Russia's western borders, and the next year command over the Dnieper Army, destined for the campaign against the Turks. For successfully completing the first part of the campaign, he was awarded the Order of St. Andrew. While his army occupied Moldavia, General von Michelsohnen died suddenly at Bucharest. His body was transported back to Ivanovo (today in Pskov Oblast), the estate awarded to him by Empress Catherine after the Pugachev Rebellion. His grave was razed in the aftermath of the Russian Revolution.

It went to 10 editions and was published until the 1960s. Its main author was identified as the Perth Branch of the Royal Mint of Great Britain. Most editions had a list of major contributors, which included government officials in Western Australia. The preface indicated the general focus to be:Page 2 of seventh edition > ...The owners and operators of Prospecting Areas, Leaseholds, Batteries and > Treatment Plants in remote Mining Districts where facilities are few and > conditions difficult... Similar and earlier guides In the era of earlier gold rushes, similar guides had appeared in the 1890s in other states, and in other countries similar books had appeared. Origins The Perth Mint's Anthea Harris, at a conference in 1999, summarised the origins of the book:Anthea Harris (1999) http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/128690/20130223-0000/conferences.alia.org.au/shllc1999/papers/harris.html The Perth Mint also has a more recent online summary:http://blog.perthmint.com.au/2012/06/26/hints-to-prospectors/ How The Perth Mint helped diggers find gold in the 1930s > In the 1930s, gold production was at an all time low and the gold price had > risen so much that the value of the gold in a sovereign was worth more than > its ¬£1 token value.

During its rise, it comprised, at various points, the Northern, Upper West and Upper East regions of present-day Ghana. Since Ghana's independence in 1957, the Kingdom just like all of Ghana's kingdoms and tribal states has assumed a traditional, customary role. Oral histories of the Kingdom tell that it was founded by a warrior named Tohazie (c. 1250), who arrived in present- day northern Ghana in the 11th century with his cavalry men from east of Lake Chad, stopping in Zamfara, present-day northern Nigeria, and in the Mali Empire, before settling in northern Ghana. These histories tell of numerous conflicts with neighbouring peoples throughout this early period until the early 18th century, when the capital of the kingdom was moved to the city of Yendi. Around this time, Islam arrived to the kingdom, and a period of peace and increased trade with neighbouring kingdoms began. In 1888, the Kingdom of Dagbon was partitioned between the German and British empires, and in 1899 this split became organised into the territories of German Togoland and the Gold Coast. Following World War I, eastern Dagbon became part of British Togoland. The Gold Coast achieved independence in 1957 as Ghana. The result of interference of British and German imperialism significantly was a kingdom that was robbed of its once invaluable traditional artifacts, beautiful way of life and a divided Kingdom whose wounds would not completely heal till the second decade of the 21st Century. The Kingdom of Dagbon since around the 1920s has been characterised by repeated succession disputes and conflict mainly from British and German Imperial interference in Dagbon's succession. Several incidents have occurred, including in 2002 when the King of Dagbon Yakubu Andani II, of the Andani royal family, was murdered by supporters of the Abudu royal family. As of January 2014, a regent (installed in 2006) has acted as sovereign of the kingdom until a new ruler is chosen. Today, the king of Dagbon's court remains at the city of Yendi. The kingdom is divided into territorial chiefdoms, categorised from divisional to village chieftaincies. The monarch of Dagbon is known as the Ya Naa (also spelt Ya Na, Ya-Na, Yaa Naa). On 18 January 2019, a new Yaa Naa, Abubakari Mahama, was chosen in Yendi by the Dagbon state's kingmakers. This was after a peace initiative by the Committee of Eminent Chiefs, headed by Asantehene Otumfuo Osei Tutu II. He was enskinned on 26 January 2019 in Yendi. The end of the dispute made the celebration of the Damba festival possible again after 17-year break. The festival was celebrated in November 2019. History The First Kingdom of Dagbon, from the mid 15th century to the late 17th century, is known to history almost entirely through oral tradition, especially drum chant. The Second Kingdom, from around 1700 to 1900, is better known, because, in addition to drum chant, there are other sources of information, some of them independent of events in Dagbon itself. = Founding and First Kingdom (1400s‚Äì1600s) = The Kingdom of Dagbon, in the homeland of the Dagomba people, was founded in the 11th century. Accounts of the kingdom's origins, rulers and wars of conquest are preserved in drum histories. These histories narrate the story of Tohazhie, the \\"Red Hunter\\", who left Tunga, east of Lake Chad, with a small band of cavalry men into Zamfara, present-day Nigeria, before moving on to Mali. Tohazhie married the daughter of the king of Mali, Pag Wabga, and fathered a son, Kpogon-umbo. After serving briefly in Mali, Kpogonumbo and his followers came into conflict with the rising Songhay Empire in western Africa, and reprisal attacks from the Songhay forced Kpogonumbo and his followers southward. Kpogonumbo then seized power and ruled over Biun in Gurma. His son, Naa Gbewaa (or Bawa), left Biun with some of his followers to settle at Pusiga in the northeastern corner of Ghana, where he ruled until he became blind. Naa Gbewaa's son, Zirili, succeeded him, but succession disputes between three of Zirili's younger brothers‚ÄìTohagu, Sitogu and Mantabo‚Äìled to the kingdom's demise. Naa Gbewaa remains in the histories of the kingdoms of Dagbon and the kingdoms of the Mamprugu and Nanumba, as their first king, founding their ruling dynasties through these sons. Naa Gbewaa's son Sitogu settled briefly at the town of Gambaga before moving south to Namburugu, near Karaga, where he founded the Dagbon state. The king became known as Ya Naa, meaning \\"king of strength\\". As Sitobu moved south, he encountered groups of indigenous peoples. such as the Konkomba, Nafeba, Basare and Chamba, who did not have centralised political structures, except for the office of the tengdana or tindana‚Äìthe earth priest, literally translated as \\"owner of the land\\". The tengdana presided over ritual ceremonies and acted as a mediator between the people and the gods of the land. Sitobu's son, Naa Nyagsi (r. 1416-1432) succeeded him and embarked on a war of expansion, killing many of the tengdana and holding sway over the indigenous people. Naa Nyagsi established his capital at Yendi (Yendi Dabari), located in the area of Diyali, near Tamale, and developed a stable political organisation by installing his sons, brothers and uncles as rulers over the conquered people. The surviving tengdamba continued to function as earth priests, while some members of the Konkomba were assigned roles in the military. = 18th century and Second Kingdom (1700‚Äì1888) = In about 1700, the capital was relocated from Yendi Dabari to a new city (also known as Yendi) in the east because of incessant wars with the Gonja people. A major confrontation at Daboya dealt a lot of damage to the Dagomba people. Naa Tutugri retaliated by defeating the Gonja near Yen Dabari, but his successor, Naa Luro, though victorious over the Gonja in a later battle, could not stand the sustained warfare and relocated the capital to Yendi. The Gonja followed eastward, but in 1713, Naa Zangina finally halted the Gonja attacks when he decisively defeated them and killed their chief, Kumpatia, at Sang near Yendi. Naa Zangina not only is reputed to be the first Muslim ruler of the Dagbon, but is also credited with encouraging trade. With the relocation of the capital to Yendi and the return of peace, a Muslim community emerged at the Ya Naa's palace at Yendi. The Dyula, of Mande origin, led by Sabali-Yarla, and the Hausa Muslims, led by the Kamshe Naa, bolstered Islamic influence in the kingdom. Beginning with the Sabali-Yarna, and later the Kamshe Naa, these peoples became responsible for the Ya Naa's protective prayers. At the Ya Naa's palace, Muslim titles, a sign of the integration of Muslim elders into the political structure, included the Walgu Naa, who made sure that the Ya Naa had his portion to \\"Drink the Qur'an\\"; the Nayil Liman, the imam of the Ya Naa, and the Yidan Kambala, were also credited with the imamship. The extension of trade with the Dyula, and later with the Hausa, linked the Dagbon state with neighbouring kingdoms, like the Fezzan, Egypt, and the Bight of Benin. By 1788, Yendi was said to be bigger than Kumasi and Salaga. It was culturally closer to, and was the result of, other Sahelian kingdoms, especially to the Mossi Kingdoms, Mali Empire, Songhai Empire, and Hausa Bakwai, with which Dagbon were major trading partners for salt, kola nuts, and slaves. = Colonisation (1888‚Äì1957) = Dagbon resisted colonisation as it had a well organised and powerful army. In 1888, Dagbon became part of a neutral zone, stretching from Yeji to Yendi, that was established to forestall conflict between the Germans and the British. The area was later parceled between the two powers, and Yendi, where the Yaa Naa resided, came under German control, separating him from his people in the west. In 1896, the Germans clashed with the Dagomba at the Battle of Adibo and destroyed Yendi and made away with valuables. It was a massacre, as the 7,000-man, poorly equipped Dagomba army merely rushed with their bows and arrows at the 100-man well-armed German army. In 1899 the British and the Germans split Dagbon between German Togoland and the Gold Coast. Following World War I, eastern Dagbon became part of the British-administered mandated territories established by the League of Nations and reunited with the west, allowing the Yaa Naa to resume control of his people. The British implemented indirect rule, in which Dagomba chiefs administered local government. This policy perpetuated Dagomba dominance over the Konkomba. The British largely neglected the economic development of Dagbon. To pay the head tax the British imposed, Dagomba had to migrate to the southern Gold Coast to work in mines and on cocoa plantations. The Kingdom of Dagbon enjoyed a distinct constitutional position before it became part of the British Togoland. = Recent history = Today, the Yaa Naa's court remains at Yendi. The kingdom is divided into territorial chiefdoms, categorised from divisional to village chieftaincies. Certain chieftaincies, such as Karaga, Savalugu and Mion, are reserved for the sons of the former Yaa Naa, and their occupancy qualifies one to test for the Namship, or head chiefdom, at Yendi. Lesser chieftaincies are reserved for grandsons. Succession to the Nam has always rotated among the three royal houses, now reduced to two‚Äìthe Andani and the Abudu. Over the past century, the Dagomba have faced repeated succession disputes and conflict. Following the death of Yaa-Na Mahama II in 1954, a succession dispute erupted into violence. The federal government sent troops to Yendi and intervened to decide the succession. Ethnic tension has also plagued northern Ghana. Violence flared between the Dagomba and their Konkomba subjects over land use and ownership in 1914, 1917, the 1940s and the 1980s. During the 1990s ethnic tension once again racked the region. Twelve people were killed in Tamale in 1994 when police fired at a group of Dagomba who had attacked some Konkomba. In March 2002, Ya Naa Yakubu Andani II, from the Andani house, was murdered together with forty-two of his elders in a war by supporters of the Abudu house. After eight years, on 10 April 2010, around thirty to forty people were arrested for the murder in Yendi and parts of Accra in preparation for prosecution. As of January 2014 a successor has not been installed, and a regent (installed in 2006) has acted as sovereign of the kingdom until a new ruler is chosen. On 16 November 2018, a Mediation Committee that was led by Otumfuo Osei Tutu II finalized its plan to resolve the conflict in Dagbon. It was agreed that the Abudu Royal family perform the funeral rites of the late Yaa Naa Mahamadu Abdulai from 14‚Äì28 of December 2018. Next was to be the funeral of the late Yaa Naa Yakubu Andani II, from 4‚Äì19 January 2019. Both obsequies took place at the old Gbewaa Palace in Yendi.

He started his professional career with Wolverhampton Wanderers, before joining Southampton for five years. He then had three years with Halifax Town, for whom he made over 100 appearances followed by a short spell at Hereford United, before winding up his career in non-league football. Playing career Kemp was born in Salerno, Italy, to an Italian mother and an English army father. He joined Wolverhampton Wanderers as a 15-year-old apprentice in April 1961, signing as a professional in May 1963. He made three Football League appearances for the Wolves before Ted Bates signed him for Southampton in June 1965 for a fee of ¬£5,000. He made his debut at The Dell playing at inside-left against Preston North End on 27 November 1965, when George O'Brien was ill with hepatitis. He scored the Saints' second goal with a \\"brave header\\" in a 5‚Äì2 victory, and retained his place in the forward line for the next three matches before losing his place to Norman Dean. Southampton finished the 1965‚Äì66 season as runners-up in the Second Division, gaining promotion to the top division. Kemp spent two years in the reserves as a forward before being converted into a wing-half with goal-scoring ability in March 1968. On 24 August 1968, he returned to the first team replacing Hugh Fisher at right-half, scoring the opening goal in a 2‚Äì1 victory over Wolverhampton Wanderers. He retained his place for the remainder of the season, making a total of 37 appearances with four goals as Southampton finished seventh and qualified for European football for the first time, in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup. Although Kemp made one appearance in the Fairs Cup, he lost his place to Fisher in November, with his final first-team appearance coming on 31 March 1970. Known as \\"Fiery Fred\\" and described as \\"a delightfully tippy-toed runner\\", Kemp's \\"crowd-pleasing surges down the right wing\\" were not popular with his teammates, including Joe Kirkup and Ken Jones, who considered that the team needed the more defensively-minded Fisher at right-half to allow Terry Paine the freedom to operate on the right wing. Paine himself considered that Kemp's runs \\"didn't warrant all that energy\\" and, while exciting the crowd, they became \\"infectious\\" and began to \\"rub off on the other players\\" to the detriment of the team. Following the signing of Brian O'Neil in the summer of 1970, Kemp was no longer required and was sold to Blackpool in November for a fee of ¬£35,000. Kemp stayed only a year at Blackpool before moving on to Halifax Town in December 1971. He stayed at The Shay for 2¬Ω years, during which time he was a virtual ever-present making 111 league appearances with 10 goals. In the 1974 close season, Kemp was signed by Colin Addison for Hereford United but before the season started Addison was replaced by John Sillett who recruited Terry Paine as his assistant. Kemp considered Paine as his \\"nemesis\\" and, after only 13 appearances, left the club to rejoin Addison in South Africa at Durban City in March 1975. By the following spring, Kemp was back in England and joined Telford United as team captain for a season before his retirement in the summer of 1977. Later career While at Telford, Kemp played charity football in Wolverhampton and worked part-time selling furniture to offices and schools. The business expanded and Kemp's son-in-law, the former Fulham midfielder, John Marshall joined the family business. Kemp now lives close to Wolves' training base at Compton.

Harrison previously represented the 60th District from 2010 to 2012. History Harrison was born in Anderson, Indiana, in 1965, and moved to Florida in 1983 to attend the University of South Florida. He graduated with his bachelor's degree in political science and then attended the Fredric G. Levin College of Law at the University of Florida, receiving his Juris Doctor in 1990. In 1996, he was elected to the Tampa Palms Community Development District, defeating incumbent Bob Doran, and in 1999, he was elected to the Tampa City Council as the first city councilman elected to represent New Tampa since it had been incorporated into the city. Harrison was re-elected in 2003 to his second and final term on the City Council, and served as the Chairman Pro Tempore of the Council from 2004 to 2007. Upon leaving the City Council, he was appointed by then-Governor Charlie Crist to the Tampa Bay Area Regional Transportation Authority, a position that he held from 2007 to 2010. Florida House of Representatives In 2010, incumbent State Representative Ed Homan was unable to seek re-election due to term limits, so Harrison ran to succeed him in the 60th District, which stretched from Lake Magdalene to Thonotosassa and Mango. He faced Ramon Stroud in the Republican primary and defeated him handily, winning 59% of the vote. In the general election, he faced Russ Patterson, the Democratic nominee and a retired United States Air Force officer. Harrison campaigned on a plan to create jobs in the state, supporting a regional transit system and declaring, \\"Florida's economy depends on quality job creation, and low taxes encourage job creation.\\" He ended up defeating Patterson by a wide margin, winning his first term in the legislature with 56% of the vote. When the state's legislative districts were redrawn in 2012, Harrison was moved into the 63rd District, where he ran for re-election. He won the Republican primary unopposed and faced Mark Danish, a middle school science teacher and the Democratic nominee, in the general election. Harrison earned the endorsement of both the Tampa Bay Times and the Tampa Tribune, with the Times praising him as \\"a moderate voice at the state and local level for his north Tampa constituents,\\" and the Tribune calling him \\"conscientious and industrious\\" as a lawmaker Despite the fact that he significantly outraised Danish, he ended up losing his campaign for re-election by 728 votes, receiving 49% of the vote to Danish's 51%. Harrison ran against Danish again in 2014, though this time Danish was the incumbent and Harrison the challenger. He campaigned on his experience creating jobs, calling for \\"job creators\\" to be setting the agenda in the legislature, and noting, \\"I know what it takes to start a business from scratch.\\" Once again, Harrison won the endorsement of the Tribune, but was passed over for the endorsement of the Times, which endorsed Danish, praising him for his \\"willingness to work with Republicans on behalf of his district.\\" Ultimately, the 2014 rematch was not as close or as contentious as the initial 2012 campaign, and Harrison unseated Danish with 53% of the vote.

Its performances are based on traditional Egyptian music, featuring the simsimiyya and tanbura instruments. History El Tanbura was formed in Port Said in the late 1980s by Zakaria Ibrahim, the organizer. His aim was to revive traditional Egyptian music. In 1989, a small nucleus of veteran performers recruited by Zakaria came together to form the fledgling El Tanbura group, augmented by younger singers. In the formative years, El Rayis Imbabi, one of the group members, was responsible for passing key repertoire from Port Said's past to the younger members. By 1996 the group's reputation had spread to Paris and a series of performances resulted in El Tanbura's first international CD, La Simsimiyya de Port Said, recorded live at Institute Du Monde Arabe. A second disc Between the Desert and the Sea (named by Songlines Magazine as one of the all-time Top 50 world music albums) followed a decade later as the group began a long association with producer Michael Whitewood and the UK record label 30 IPS. The band performed to both public and critical success at the Barbican's Ramadan Nights festival in 2006 and across mainland Europe in 2007, also finding time to collaborate with the film-makers 1 Giant Leap on 2008's \\"What About Me?\\" In 2009, the latest album of El Tanbura, Friends of Bamboute, celebrating the band's 20th anniversary, was published. Early in 2011 the band participated in the Egyptian revolution, campaigning for social, political and cultural reform in Egypt and performing for the protesters in Cairo's Tahrir Square. Following the Revolution El Tanbura performed at WOMAD Abu Dhabi and returned to London in a show curated for the Barbican featuring the band alongside fellow musical revolutionaries Azza Balba, Mustafa Said and Ramy Essam. The band won the Roskilde Festival World Music Award for Zakaria's El Mastaba Centre for Egyptian Popular Music at WOMEX 2011 in Copenhagen. Instruments used =Simsimiyya= This instrument is largely specialized to the people of this region of the Arab world, despite it making appearances in other desert communities as well. The simsimiyya is a five-stringed instrument of the lyre family. Originally, the body was made of wood in a bowl/box shape, covered with stretched goat or camel skin. The strings, once various intestinal parts, are now made of wire. Sometimes a can was used as an \\"amplifier.\\" The instrument has five strings and is tuned using diatonic notes with a neutral third, minor third, or major third. The minor third is the most common tuning variation. The names of the strings are Buma, Duka, Watar, Huseini, and Sararah. The playing is largely rhythmic, given that there is an emphasis within the group on percussion. The form is predominantly call and response, and an appreciative and active audience is expected. The repertoire selectively features songs from a variety of sources: the radio, folk tunes, and songs from the Bedouin community. The simsimiyya is a fisherman's instrument; it is related to instruments in Ethiopia, Sudan, Yemen, and Saudi; and the Bedouin people of Sinai consider the simsimiyya as part of the Red Sea musical territory. In modern contexts, it has been found in other coastal communities along the Red Sea. =Tanbura= The tanbura is a large six-string lyre. It was often used in private healing ceremonies during the 19th century following the Egyptian conquest of Sudan. The Tanbura is very similar to the Simsimiyya. However, compared to the Simsimiyya, the strings of the Tanbura are softer and it has the addition of tuning pegs which can expand melodic range and nylon replacing dried animal gut strings, allowing for more refined tuning and intricate performances. The Tanbura became one of the fundamental instruments of El Tanbura. There are many performances with the Tanbura featured on Between the Desert and the Sea, which was played by Mohamed Shohib. =The Siren= The origins of both instruments are traced in Zakaria Ibrahim's short documentary film called The Siren, which often shows at Egyptological events coinciding with El Tanbura tour dates. Albums =La Simsimiyya de Port Said= This first album of El Tanbura was published in 1999. =Ahwa Qamar= This album was published in 2003. It was the gathering of the band's most requested songs from their weekly concerts at Port Said's Meqma Caf√©. It was produced by the El Mastaba Center for Egyptian Folk Music in Cairo studio. The album material can be found in the soundtrack to Philippe Dib's film El Tanbura: Capturing a vanishing spirit. =Between the Desert and the Sea= This is the third album of El Tanbura and was released in 2006. It involved a mix of Egyptian folk melodies, Sufi verses and sea shanties from antiquity. El Tanbura used the Arabian grooves to play with the sound of the simsimiyya and underpinned. =Friends of Bamboute: 20th Anniversary Edition= This is the latest album of El Tanbura and was released in 2009. The album was produced to celebrate their two decades as the guardians of simsimiyya. It was recorded in Cairo and on location in Port Said, and recounts tales of the 19th century Bambutiyya merchants who frequented the old-time caf√©s and smoking dens along the path of the Suez Canal and also showcases devotional Sufi songs from the Egyptian Delta.

W. 1996. Niebla and Vermilacinia (Ramalinaceae) from California and Baja California. Sida Miscellany 14 The epithet, reptilioderma, is in regard to the outer surface of the cortex appearing like the skin of a reptile, especially the brown snake, Pseudechis australis, the color of the thallus cortex often turning brown when stored in a herbarium. Distinguishing Features Vermilacinia reptilioderma is classified in the subgenus Vermilacinia in which it is distinguished from related species by features of the cortex and secondary metabolites (lichen substances). The thallus is generally divided into slender whip-like cylindrical branches, usually numbering less than 20 that arise from a holdfast. The cortex is conspicuously rugose (with short wavy or sinuous ridges) above the mid region. Lichen substances are triterpenes referred to as T1 and T2, known only from several other species in the subgenus Vermilacinia in the central region of Baja California. Also present are zeorin and (-)-16 Œ±-hydroxykaurane typically found in the genus. The triterpenes T1 and T2 correspond to their Rf values on thin-layer chromatography plates and were determined by mass spectrometry to have a formula of C30H50O2 (T1) and C30H50OO (T2). Salazinic acid, often found in most related species, was not reported. Pycnidia commonly develop on cortical ridges along margins of branches or on the rim of crater like depressions that commonly form between the branch margins. The occurrence of pycnidia appears associated with the rugose cortical condition. Apothecia occasionally develop terminally on a branch, usually few in number, or often apothecia apparently fail to fully develop, and aggregates of aborted apothecia then form near apex on short narrow lobes off the main branch. Vermilacinia reptilioderma is similar to V. cedrosensis, with which it often occurs, but differs by its thicker persistent rugose cortex, 45‚Äì75 ¬µm thick. Vermilacinia cedrosensis has a pale yellow green cortex, appearing pitted and also white due to the cortex eroding or thinning out (instead of becoming thicker) towards apex, from 0‚Äì60 ¬µm thick; the white medulla often exposed; V. cedrosensis also lacks the T1 and T2 compounds. Another similar species, V. paleoderma, generally differs by the rigid branches and cup shaped apothecia as opposed to saucer-shaped apothecia in V. reptilioderma, but the species are probably best distinguished by their lichen metabolites. Vermilacinia paleoderma, like V. cedrosensis, does not have the T1 and T2 triterpenes, which appear to displace the appearance of zeorin and (-)-16 Œ±-hydroxykaurane on thin-layer chromatography plates.  Taxonomic History Vermilacinia reptilioderma was described in 1996. It was subsequently treated as a synonym of Niebla cedrosensis (= Vermilacinia cedrosensis) in the Lichen Flora of the Greater Sonoran DesertBowler, P. and J. Marsh. 2004. Niebla. ‚ÄòLichen Flora of the Greater Sonoran Desert 2‚Äô: 368‚Äì380 without justification. The genus Vermilacinia differs from Niebla in the absence of chondroid strands, by the lack of cortical ridges that define branch margins, and by producing terpenes and bourgeanic acid not found in Niebla.Spjut R.

Using a patented combination (EP 1181034 B1, EP 1980263A1, US 8,435,520 B2 Patent EP 1980263A1Combinations of immunosuppressive agents for the treatment or prevention of graft rejections United States Patent Application 20110142953-A1US8435520) consisting of transgenic organs/cells and immunoadsorption (elimination of antibodies from the recipient) and a special combination of immunosuppressive drugs hyperacute and delayed xenograft rejection should be prevented and long-term survival of a xenograft should be enabled and realized. In times of massively increasing shortage of donor organs and yet major problems with artificial hearts (cable connections, batteries, strokes and infections) this makes xenotransplantation highly interesting in the area of organ/cell transplantation. By using an almost unlimited source of porcine organs (heart, kidney, lung, cornea, (liver rather improbably) and cells (pig islet cellsPreclinical and clinical xenotransplantation Umfassende DFG-F√∂rderung f√ºr die Medizin der TU Dresden) against diabetes, nigrostriatal brain cells against Morbus Parkinson, stem cells, bone/-marrow, skin etc.) not only in Europe, but also worldwide many people could be helped with animal cells or with the replacement of a whole organ.

During his judicial career, Stamler was credited with having \\"handed down decisions of both statewide and national impact\\" on matters of significant public and social importance. Career before the bench Born in Elizabeth, New Jersey on November 19, 1911, Stamler graduated from Cornell University in 1933 and earned his juris doctor degree from Harvard Law School in 1935. He entered private practice after being admitted to the bar, with a five-year break during World War II, when his activities included serving with the United States Navy as the captain of a ship that performed air-sea rescue duty in the North Atlantic. Resuming his practice after the war, Stamler focused on chancery and federal court cases, in addition to teaching law at Rutgers University. In 1940, shortly after marrying the former Lillian Spitzer, Stamler moved to Summit, New Jersey, where he became a longtime resident. Active in his hometown, Stamler argued successfully before the New Jersey Supreme Court on behalf of the city in a 1958 case in which Summit was given approval to build low-income housing in the face of opposition from residents who were against the plan. Reflecting on his legal career after he had announced his retirement from judicial service, he cited the case as one that he was proudest of handling, saying that it was a matter in which the city had sought to provide affordable housing to residents \\"before it became the thing to do\\". A registered Republican, Stamler was nominated as a Superior Court Judge by Governor of New Jersey Richard J. Hughes as part of package of 42 nominations issued in September 1966 that was the largest single group of nominations in state history to that time, including 20 Superior Court judges evenly distributed by party affiliation.Staff. \\"42 Judge Posts Filled By Hughes; Nominations Must Be Acted or by Jersey Senate\\", The New York Times, September 13, 1966. Accessed January 24, 2018. \\"Gov. Richard J. Hughes today nominated 20 judges to the State Superior Court and 22 judges to other courts in the state.\\" In order to be able to accept the judgeship, Stamler had to give up his 30-year private practice of law, which had been based in Newark. Significant cases  Some of Stamler's best-known cases involved matters such as noise from airplanes and religion in the classroom, where there was little or no legal precedent to guide him. Stamler issued a 1969 opinion in a case regarding noise from business jets operating at Morristown Municipal Airport, brought by residents and governments of surrounding municipalities, in which he set a curfew limiting takeoffs and landings during overnight hours. The judge refused to allow a group of airlines and airline industry organizations to register their objections in the case saying that he hoped that \\"the giants of industry will see the wisdom of slowing the cross-country speed of their important executives, and will take a close, concerned look at the little people of this country\\" who were the ones dealing with the impact of noise and ticket prices. Stamler's curfew, prohibiting takeoffs or landings by jets after 9:00 PM and before 7:00 AM most days and limiting flights by jets to a two-hour window on Sundays, was overturned by Superior Court Judge Gordon L. Brown who found Stamler's curfew to be in conflict with a decision made by the United States Supreme Court earlier that year in the case of City of Burbank v. Lockheed Air Terminal, Inc. in which the court rejected a similar curfew imposed by the city of Burbank, California on Hollywood Burbank Airport limiting overnight flights on the basis of the fact that airports were subject to federal oversight by the Federal Aviation Administration under the terms of the Noise Control Act of 1972.Staff. \\"Court Ends Antinoise Curfew On Jets at Morristown Airport\\", The New York Times, November 9, 1973. Accessed January 24, 2018. \\"A Superior Court Judge today lifted a curfew imposed in 1970 on the landings and take‚Äêoffs of jet aircraft at Morristown Municipal Airport. He acted after a lengthy trial in which nearby residents complained of the aircraft noise. The ruling by Judge Gordon L. Brown was based on a United States Supreme Court decision last May that ruled that Burbank, Calif., could not adopt an ordinance limiting the hours of jet air traffic.... In 1970, Superior Court Judge Joseph H. Stamler, sitting in Morristown, prohibited jet take‚Äêoffs and landings between 9 P.M. and 7 A.M. on Monday through Saturday and allowed jets to come into and leave the airport for just two hours on Sunday.\\"City of Burbank v.

Board of Education of Netcong, New Jersey regarding a matter in which the school board of the Netcong School District in Netcong, New Jersey had a policy providing for voluntary readings at the start of the school day at Netcong High School of prayers that had been published in the Congressional Record, as they had been given at the start of daily sessions in Congress by the Chaplain of the United States House of Representatives. The board presented the program of voluntary readings as being intended to be inspirational remarks for the students, rather than as prayer in the schools.State Bd. of Ed. v. Bd. Of Ed. Of Netcong, NJ, Justia, decided February 9, 1970. Accessed January 24, 2018. \\"The implementation of the resolution has occurred in the following way: At 7:55 A.M. in the Netcong High School gymnasium, immediately prior to the formal opening of school, students who wish to join in the exercise either sit or stand in the bleachers. A student volunteer reader, assigned by the principal on a first come, first serve basis, then comes forward and reads the 'remarks' (so described by defendants) of the chaplain from the Congressional Record, giving the date, volume, number and body whose proceedings are being read.\\" In his decision, Judge Stamler prohibited what he described as a \\"subterfuge [that] is degrading to all religions\\", arguing that by taking what were \\"beautiful prayers\\" and referring to them merely as \\"remarks\\", the school district was working to \\"peddle religion in a very cheap manner under an assumed name.\\" The New Jersey Supreme Court unanimously affirmed Stamler's decision and an appeal filed by the district in the case was rejected by the United States Supreme Court. In a case brought by the American Civil Liberties Union, Stamler issued an opinion in April 1970 in which he ruled that the provision of busing by the West Morris Regional High School District to private school students was improper based on the fact that the 14,000 private school students who lived in school districts (usually large cities) where busing was not provided were denied the protections of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\\"West Morris Reg. Bd. Of Ed. v. Sills\\" Justia. Accessed January 24, 2018. In June 1971, the New Jersey Supreme Court unanimously overturned Stamler's decision and upheld the constitutionality of the program, allowing 106,000 students from private schools to receive busing through their local school district at the start of the 1970-71 school year in September. In his decision, Chief Justice Joseph Weintraub emphasized that the legislature had made busing for private school students subject to the same rules and regulations as for public school students residing in the same district.Staff. \\"Jersey High Court Backs Parochial‚ÄêSchool Busing\\", The New York Times, June 26, 1971.

Today's decision overruled Superior Court Judge Joseph Stamler, who declared in April 1970, that private‚Äêschool busing programs violated the equal‚Äêprotection clause of the 14th Amendment.\\" Stamler rejected a proposal for a six-day rock festival to be held in the summer of 1970 on a site in Walpack Township in Sussex County, leading to the passage of standards for similar events that requires planning for traffic and safety between the organizers and local authorities, and sets limits on duration. Stamler stated that any positive benefits from such an event must be weighed against the \\"health, safety and welfare of the young, and the potential harm to the public\\".\\"Proposed rock fete hits stone wall\\", Pocono Record, July 14, 1970.

Stamler rejected the district's claim that a significant majority of parents had supported the program and allowed the suit filed by the parents to proceed, saying that the protections afforded under the First Amendment would be unnecessary if majority rule would prevail in such circumstances, noting that the protections were intended to protect the religious freedoms of \\"the one person who is sincere in a conscientious religious conviction\\".Sullivan, Ronald. \\"Judge in Jersey Clears a Suit on Sex Education\\", The New York Times, March 4, 1971. Accessed January 24, 2018. \\"The Valents, who are Roman Catholics, contend that compulsory sex education violates First Amendment guarantees of the free exercise of religious freedom....

He said the amendment had been adopted to \\"protect the 1 per cent, the one individual, the one person who is sincere in a conscientious religious conviction.'\\" A 1972 judgement against United States Mineral Company of Stanhope, New Jersey that assessed a fine of $250,000 for emitting excessive air pollution on 360 days in a single year was the largest such fine assessed against a polluter of this kind in the United States to that point.via Associated Press. \\"Firm fined $250,000\\", Courier News, September 25, 1972.

Personal life A resident of the Stony Creek section of Branford, Connecticut, Stamler died at the age of 86 on October 16, 1998, after what was described in his obituary as a \\"long illness\\". He had maintained a second home there since his days as a judge and would write opinions there, in addition to relaxing by fishing and lobstering. He was married to Lillian Spitzer Stamler and had two sons. Stamler's brother Nelson was a Republican Assemblyman and State Senator, who also served in Superior Court. His nephew, John H.

Alan Henning was shown at the end of David Haines's beheading video, released on September 13, 2014, and referred to by \\"Jihadi John\\" as the next victim. A video of Henning's beheading was released by ISIL on October 3, 2014. *Peter Edward Kassig (February 19, 1988 ‚Äì 2014), also known by the name Abdul-Rahman Kassig which he assumed in captivity, was 26 years old at the time he was beheaded. He was the adopted child of Ed, a school teacher, and Paula Kassig, a nurse. On October 1, 2013, as he was on his way to Deir Ezzour in eastern Syria to deliver food and medical supplies to refugees, Kassig was taken captive by ISIL. While in captivity, Kassig ‚Äì formerly a Methodist ‚Äì converted to Islam and changed his name to Abdul-Rahman Kassig, sometime between October and December 2013. On October 3, 2014, his parents released a video in which they stressed that his conversion to Islam was not forced, and that his path to conversion began before he was taken captive. On November 16, 2014, ISIL posted a video showing \\"Jihadi John\\" standing over a severed human head. (transcript of the video, largely based on the original English subtitles) The beheading itself was not shown in the video. The White House later confirmed the person killed was Kassig. * ISIL claimed that U.S. hostage Kayla Mueller was killed in the Jordanian airstrike on Raqqa on 5 February 2015. However, some experts believe that she may have been killed before the date of the video's release, in order for ISIL to try to drive a wedge between the U.S. and Jordan by blaming her death on the Jordanian airstrikes. Shortly thereafter President Obama confirmed the death of Mueller by ISIL.Peter Foster, \\"US female hostage held by Isil is dead, confirms Obama,\\" The Telegraph, 10 Feb 2015\\"Kayla Mueller, American ISIL hostage, is dead,\\", Al Jazeera America, February 10, 2015Rukmini Callimachi, \\"Death of Kayla Mueller, ISIS Hostage, Confirmed by Family and White House,\\", New York Times, FEB. 10, 2015 * On November 19, 2015, Chinese national Fan Jinghui (Ê®ä‰∫¨Ëæâ\\"Ë¢´ISÊâ£Êäº‰∏≠ÂõΩ‰∫∫Ë¥®‰∏∫Ê®ä‰∫¨Ëæâ Âú®‰∫¨‰ªé‰∫ãÂπøÂëäË°å‰∏ö.\\" Sina.

It was first described by Gordon in 1935. It occurs in the tropical and subtropical Atlantic Ocean and is a cleaner shrimp, operating a cleaning station to which fish come to have parasites removed. Description Lysmata grabhami can grow to a length of . Its appearance is distinctive; the antennae are white as are the third pair of maxillipeds; the body is yellow, with a continuous white dorsal stripe running from head to telson, bordered with a longitudinal red stripe on either side; the legs are yellow, and the external branches of the uropods have a white stripe on the outer edge. Distribution Lysmata grabhami occurs in shallow water on either side of the tropical and sub-tropical Atlantic Ocean. It is typically found in reef environments. In the West Atlantic it is found on the coast of North America, the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico and around Bermuda. In the East Atlantic it occurs in the Canary Islands, Madeira and Cape Verde. Ecology Lysmata grabhami is a cleaner shrimp; in common with certain other shrimps and certain small fish, it has established behaviours involving cleaning stations to which larger fish come to have their external parasites removed. The shrimp waves its long white antennae to attract a fish, the fish poses, extending a fin or opening its mouth, the shrimp hops onto the fish and picks at the parasites until the fish disengages. The shrimp may occupy a single cleaning station for extended periods. Client fish include groupers, parrotfishes and tangs. This is a symbiotic arrangement, the client fish benefits from having its parasites removed and the shrimp benefits from the extra nutrition it receives. Six species of shrimp from three different families have developed this practice, a case of convergent evolution. In aquaria Lysmata grabhami is sometimes kept in a reef aquarium, but its sister species from the Pacific, Lysmata amboinensis, is seen much more often in the trade. Both species will clean other fish in the aquarium.

(n√©e Anna-Mae Harkness) is a fictional character in the legal drama series How to Get Away with Murder. Series creator Peter Nowalk is responsible for creating and developing the character, and American actress Viola Davis portrays Keating since the show's inception. Annalise is introduced as a high-profile criminal defense attorney and law professor at Middleton University who maintains social prestige and navigates through a complex personality. The series' main narrative starts when Annalise chooses five of her students to work with her and they get in the middle of a murder case. Throughout the series' course, Annalise is very protective of her students, who become her allies, and is balancing between her personal life and the public scrutiny.  Characterization  On February 25, 2014, it was announced that Viola Davis was cast in the show's leading role of Professor Annalise Keating. Annalise is introduced as a self-sufficient and confident woman who seems to have a perfect life and is respected for her professionalism, who people both fear and admire. Throughout the series, she experiences emotional changes and her alcohol addiction increases as she gets involved in multiple crimes with her associates.  Story lines  = Background = Annalise was born Anna Mae Harkness, the daughter of Ophelia and Mac, and the sister of Celestine and Thelonious. Her father was absent during much of her life. As a child, she was sexually abused by her uncle Clyde, who was living with them. Ophelia saw Clyde leaving her room and realized what had happened, which led her to take her children away and burn down the house with Clyde inside. At law school, Annalise started a relationship with Eve Rothlo, but they broke up after Annalise fell in love with Sam Keating, who was married and left his wife to marry Annalise. = Season 1 = This season is set chronologically before and after the murder of Sam Keating. In flashbacks, Annalise is introduced as a criminal defense teacher at Middleton University who chooses students Laurel Castillo, Michaela Pratt, Connor Walsh, Asher Millstone, and Wes Gibbins to work exclusively in her law firm, where she is assisted by associates Frank Delfino and Bonnie Winterbottom. The body of Lila Stangard, a student who had been missing for months, is found and eventually it is revealed that Annalise's husband Sam was having an affair with Lila before she died. Lila's best friend Rebecca Sutter gets romantically involved with Gibbins while the local police department is investigating both Sutter and Lila's ex-boyfriend Griffin O'Reilly. When Sam starts suspecting that Rebecca is aware of his affair with Lila, he becomes violent towards her and attacks her one night when she tries to transfer his laptop data to a flash drive. Gibbins, Walsh, Pratt and Castillo appear to help Rebecca and during the showdown Michaela pushes Sam over the banister and onto the floor below. Sam is presumed dead, and the five ponder their next move, only to have Sam leap up and attack Rebecca. Wes clobbers Sam on the head with a trophy, killing him. The five burn his body in the woods under Annalise's complicity, who is aware of the murder and helps them to build up an alibi. In flash-forwards, Annalise deals with the police investigating Sam's whereabouts, which Annalise makes it looks connected to Lila's death by making their affair public. Sam's sister Hannah Keating arrives in town searching for the truth and accusing Annalise of lying. The remains of Sam are found and Annalise incriminates her lover Nate Lahey as a way to avoid her student's arrest. However, she tries to help him go free by offering him a number of a fellow lawyer. She calls her mother to counsel her throughout this moment, though they have multiple arguments. One night, Wes calls her frightened and asks her to go to his apartment. There, she finds him and the others and learns that they strapped Rebecca with tape and locked her in the bathroom. Subsequently, the group takes Rebecca to the Keatings' household's basement, where they keep her while trying to build a case against her, framing her of killing Lila, a theory that they start believing when multiples proofs show up. When they decide to let her go after not finding anything concrete, Rebecca is gone. Annalise blames Wes for her whereabouts, whilst in fact she and Frank hid the body of Rebecca, who was killed by someone unknown to them. =Season 6= In flash-forwards, Annalise is shown to be dead under unknown circumstances with a funeral being held in her honor. In the present, Annalise has to deal with an FBI investigation and ultimately charges of being responsible for the deaths of Sam Keating, Ronald Miller, Asher Millstone, Rebecca Sutter, ADA Emily Sinclair and Caleb Hapstall. With the FBI pressuring the Keating 3 and faced with her own demons, Annalise is left reevaluating her choices in life; ultimately Annalise is exonerated after an impassioned closing argument in which Annalise confesses the crimes she has committed and opens herself up to the world for the first time.

It was one of the first companies to develop PC-based software for authoring and viewing virtual reality (VR) environments. Company history The company was founded in Chicago in 1991 by former McKinsey & Company consultant Edward R. LaHood, who derived the name VREAM from the phrase \\"virtual reality dream.\\" LaHood was joined by co-founders Ken Gaebler.\\"Ken Gaebler: Executive Profile and Biography\\", Bloomberg Businessweek. Retrieved 2014-11-30. and Dan Malven\\"The May Report: August 6, 1999\\", Ron May (columnist). Retrieved 2014-11-30. in 1993. In 1991, LaHood created VREAMScript, a scripting language for virtual reality environments that allowed for the definition of complex 3D objects, environment attributes, object attributes, and triggers for cause- and-effect relationships. The company then created a PC-based authoring tool, the VREAM Virtual Reality Development System, to build virtual reality environments and an accompanying runtime player, the VREAM Runtime System, that allowed end users to experience the virtual environments, moving through them in real-time while interacting with the rendered, virtual objects. The VREAM Virtual Reality System, which included the VREAM Virtual Reality Development System and the VREAM Runtime System, was released for purchase in December, 1992, with a $1,495 price point and with support for a wide range of immersive devices, including the Power Glove. Initial Impact Prior to 1992, rendering real-time 3D graphics had only been possible on high-end workstations, and creating a real-time 3D graphics simulation required strong programming skills. The growing power of PCs, driven by such innovations as the Pentium chip (introduced by Intel in March 1993), made bringing virtual reality simulations to the PC a possibility, and LaHood's strong programming skills allowed him to be first to market with a PC-based virtual reality authoring solution that could be used by non-programmers. (LaHood was not, however, the first to bring virtual reality to the PC; that credit goes to Sense8 founders Patrice Gelband and Eric Gullichsen who, earlier in 1992, introduced WorldToolKit, a VR programmer's library that allowed developers to build \\"virtual world\\" applications that ran on desktop computers.\\"WORLDTOOLKIT Version 1.01 Program Description\\", ibiblio. Retrieved 2014-11-30.) Due to its accessibility to non-programmers and those who could not afford high-end workstations, VREAM's software quickly became popular in the hobbyist virtual reality community. It was used for architectural walkthroughs, manufacturing training, game development, engineering prototyping, data visualization and other simulations. The software was even used in the treatment of fear of public speaking, acrophobia \\"Communications of the ACM 40, 8 (Aug. 1997), 34-39, Overcoming Phobias By Virtual Exposure\\".

A notable services client was Burger King, which hired VREAM to build a \\"restaurant of the future\\" for its franchisee conference. VREAM also created virtual reality product demonstrations for Bombardier Recreational Products for their Sea-Doo and Ski- Doo lines. Web-Based VR In 1994, based on the emergence of the World Wide Web and at the suggestion of co-founder Malven, the company recast its runtime player as a plug-in for Netscape Navigator, dubbing it WIRL.

The introduction of VRML, backed by SGI and other companies, lessened the future potential of VREAM's proprietary VREAMScript language. To mitigate its risks, VREAM adopted the approach of supporting both VRML and VREAMScript in its software products. In May 1995, VREAM rebranded the next generation of its VR authoring software as VRCreator, and touted its support for \\"multi-participant VR...across the World Wide Web.\\"\\"Powerful Virtual Reality Software Now Available -- VREAM Ships VRCreator Beta Systems\\".

She is also considered as the first female head of state in Asia. Being come to known first as the consort of King Chora Naga,son of King Valagambahu of Anuradhapura, she is infamous for killing at least 6 of her husbands or consorts by poisoning them. The second husband of her,Kuda Tissa, was actually the son of the brother of Chora Naga and rose to the throne as his legal successor. But her other husbands who rose to the throne as the King of Sri Lanka were not his legal successors and were only the husbands of then present legal successor,Anula. They are (in chronological order) Siva I, Vatuka, Darubhatika Tissa and Niliya, who ruled the country within just one year. After the death of her final husband Niliya, she became the sole ruler of the country for about 5 years thus becoming the first known Queen of Sri Lanka, but was the real power behind the King during the tenures of all of her husbands, also. At the end of her tenure, she was deposed by Mahakuli Mahatissa's second son, Kutakanna Tissa. The Mahavamsa states that Kutakanna Tissa had Anula burned on a funeral pyre. Other sources indicate that Anula was burned alive in the palace where she had committed her murders.She was from the House of Vijaya. * Sivali of Anuradhapura (35 AD) Sivali was the second known Queen within Sri Lankan history and succeeded her brother Chulabhaya.

They produced oatmeal paper and paid their taxes with it.Dong-A ilbo, January 1, 1936, 51st page Monastic identity of the lay monks was seen as antisocialist, and the villages have ceased to exist. Buddhist communities have been repressed by communist governments in Asian countries. The local communities had survived through colonial period without serious pressure from outside. Origins and history The mountains of northern Hamgy≈èng Province were traditionally inhabited by the Jurchens, a semi-nomadic Tungusic people. In the mid-fifteenth century, King Sejong conquered the region as far north as the Tumen River, which even today marks Korea's northern border, and established Korean colonies in the area. Many Jurchens accepted Korean hegemony and played crucial roles in frontier defense against other Jurchen tribes more hostile to Korean presence. By the sixteenth century, the Jurchens living under Korean rule were often married to ethnic Koreans and had become increasingly agricultural. They were also economically and militarily linked to the central Korean state. At the same time, they retained close contacts with independent Jurchens across the Tumen. By the late sixteenth century, however, conflicts over land between indigenous Jurchens and Korean settlers were increasingly frequent. The Jurchen chieftain Nitanggae rebelled in 1583, severely undermining the Korean state's control of the area. The crisis was exacerbated by the large-scale Japanese invasion in 1592 during which Kat≈ç Kiyomasa conquered large parts of Hamgy≈èng, leading to a breakdown of the Korean administration and major conflicts between Jurchens and Koreans. Beginning in around 1590, independent Jurchen chieftains such as Nurhaci and Bujantai were competing for hegemony over their cousins in Korean territory. Having routed Bujantai in 1607, Nurhaci successfully removed most Jurchens in northern Hamgy≈èng into his newfound kingdom north of the Tumen between 1607 and 1609. Nurhaci's Jurchens would eventually adopt a new Manchu identity in 1635 and go on to conquer China, founding China's final imperial dynasty. Nurhaci and his successors continued to demand the forcible \\"repatriation\\" of Jurchens in Korea until 1644, although some Jurchens successfully evaded deportation and remained in Korea with the support of sympathetic Korean authorities. It is generally agreed that the Jaegaseung were descendants of these Jurchen communities who avoided capture, assimilated into Korean society. Culture Jaegaseung girls and women were notorious in mainstream Korean society for always exposing their breasts even in public, which was considered scandalous by other Koreans.

Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 22 Nov. 2014 This network may have helped his brothers in gaining commissions from prominent patrons. The absence of signed and dated work by Gerard from his English period may indicate that he worked in the successful workshop of his brother Pieter Andreas. Gerard left England for Paris where he is known to have been active from around 1747, although he may have moved there before this time. His move to Paris may be related to the fact that his brother Pieter Andreas Rijsbrack was no longer able to work as he was suffering from consumption from which he died in London in October 1748. Fishing bird, swans and fish Gerard Rijsbrack was successful in France where he enjoyed royal patronage. Like his compatriot Pieter Boel in the 17th century, Rysbrack received various commissions to produce paintings for the menagerie at Versailles.Claudia Salvi, Le grand livre des animaux de Buffon, Renaissance Du Livre, 2002 In Paris, p. 174-175 The artist also received a royal commission for overdoor paintings of hunting scenes for the Chateau de la Muette, originally the hunting lodge of the French king but used by Louis XV to entertain his mistresses. Rijsbrack received 700 pounds for each hunting piece between 1749 and 1751. Between 1748 and 1751 he also made paintings for the king‚Äôs mistress Madame de Pompadour, destined for the Ermitage of Pompadour and the Palace of Versailles. He received 4,460 pounds for his paintings for the Ermitage.Geerard Rysbrack, peintre de Louis XV et de Mme de Pompadour at Connaissances de Versailles He is said to have died blind and impoverished in Antwerp to where he had returned at the end of his life. Work Deer hunt He is known mainly for his still lifes, game pieces and hunting scenes. He is also reported to have painted mythological subjects. In his compositions of hunting scenes for Mme Pompadour representing respectively a wolf hunt and a deer hunt, he stayed close to compositions by French painters Fran√ßois Desportes and Jean-Baptiste Oudry. The paintings were primarily intended to leave for posterity images of the king‚Äôs hounds. The identity of each dog (12 depicted in the deer hunt and 13 in the wolf hunt) is recorded in a memorial on the animal paintings of Rysbrack. Various of the dogs are marked with a triangle with a cross inside.

Carme Riera is the main tributary of the Anoia river (62 km), along with other smaller as stream or Montbui Castellol√≠. One of the aspects that promote and prevent the existence of our stream is that Carme municipality that provides the name for the stream due to its geographical proximity, is located just above a huge aquifer Carme - Capellades resulting in the continuous presence of water on the ground, either visible or below ground. It is estimated that runs through about a third of the surface of the entire region of Anoia. This geological stores and groundwater flows taking advantage of permeability, porosity and cracking the rock that hosts.  History  Historically, Carme River was not always known by the same name. In fact, it is estimated that began to receive this designation from the late nineteenth century. Previously, and as demonstrated in various notarial documents of the time, Carme River has been designated with the name Riera (River) Noya or Noia. Consequently, the current Anoia River was known Riera Igualada, honoring the great capital of the region anoienca. The data show that, at least until 1825 the affluent still receive name Noya or Noia.  Nature, flora and fauna  Focusing now on its own stream and its own route, observe the diversity of flora and fauna that includes. On one hand, the accompanying flora throughout the journey to the stream is deciduous, usually one that is in the vegetation. On the other hand if we separate meters directly from the river, begin to see what is really most of the flora in the region of Anoia. Proliferate widely evergreen trees, mainly pine, although originally believed that the whole area was populated by oaks that currently there are much less present. Shrubs, bushes and pine are the most common that are in the land of limestone anoienca. As for wildlife, should highlight one aspect over the other. During the course of the stream there are different animals, all very common in the forests of central Catalonia. Among these, we highlight common reptiles like the snake or turtle, mammals such as wild boar, rabbit, hare or badger common. Furthermore and in addition to all that we can categorize this group of common forest interior Catalonia, are in the stream of a number of individuals Carme unique and special. The fact is that in this area of scrub and wetlands strange phenomenon occurs. For the last few decades has been observed in the vicinity of Carme Riera there are different types of birds, many of them almost unique in our country, and especially very rare in Catalonia. In fact, just one year ago, a team of specialists and animal rights carried out a field study in the field in order to locate and highlight what were actually groups of birds there are. The result of this study showed that in the Valley of Carme and along its wetland areas are home to over fifty species and up to 85 different bird species. Among the most common, as the swallow, robins, blue duck head or cute, but also include some other more spontaneous and less common, such as the executioner, the shrike, black crows or Serin.  Hiking routes  One aspect that we can highlight the route of Carme Riera is a few kilometers from the village of Carme specifically at the level of the municipality of Santa C√†ndia. In this place the stream follows a special tour, immersed amidst the rock carved by the same force of the water and its sediments. The fact is that this stretch of about 2 km you can practice descents and hiking. Specifically, the ravines and gorges Santa Heraklion is estimated that trace a route that requires a reduction of two hours. The difficulty is low, which leads many hiking schools use this space to instruct beginners.

Originally from Liverpool, Lander was previously a member of the band The Hideaways. He has experienced success as a prolific session musician, record industry executive, and company director. Lander has played on hits such as Culture Club's \\"Karma Chameleon\\" as well as \\"Church of the Poison Mind\\" and the Spice Girls' hit \\"Say You'll Be There\\". He has played with many musicians including Paul McCartney, Annie Lennox, ABC and Madness.  Work as a Musician  Lander was an intricate part of the late Mersey Beat scene, playing with well-known local band The Hideaways. The band were one of the first R&B; groups in Liverpool and to this day hold the record for the most performances in the Cavern's history, surpassing The Beatles. In the mid 1960s Judd kindled a relationship with Sonny Boy Williamson II (Aleck Ford 'Rice' Miller) who taught Lander the intricacies of the Blues Harmonica. Landers playing technique became much in demand, his curiosity for the music industry led him to record label Charisma Records, whilst still retaining his status as a respected session musician. His reputation as both a PR man & Session player grew and eventually, he was approached by Apple Records to help with John Lennon‚Äôs 75 release ‚ÄúRock ‚Äòn‚Äô Roll Album. As a musician he was invited to perform on various in-house sessions with artists such as Billy Preston. Over the course of his career and directorships at various major labels, he has been instrumental in the careers of artists such ABBA, Michael Jackson, Nigel Dick and The Proclaimers. He was also responsible for breaking Meat Loaf in the UK, receiving a proclamation by the Mayor of the City Of Cleveland, Lander is also noted for persuading a rather recluse guitar icon Jeff Beck into doing a TV interview with a bizarre result. Head hunted by RCA records to run their Motown UK Record division, Judd joined them at the historic Motown 25th anniversary show: ‚ÄòYesterday, Today, Forever‚Äô. Whilst at Motown Lander was called upon to a session at Red Bus Studios in London to lay down a harmonica part with a then relatively unknown band called Culture Club which led Lander to creating the now famous harmonica lead lines on their No 1 - million seller \\"Karma Chameleon\\" and \\"Church of the Poison Mind\\" with the release came a glut of TV and Wembley Stadium appearances. Around this period Lander was invited to join Paul McCartney on stage at The Odeon Hammersmith for a charity concert, and has since worked with Paul on his Flowers in the Dirt. As a musician Judd is credited with performances on over 2000 recording sessions. He is noted for his work with artists such as The Beach Boys, Nazareth, The Proclaimers, Kirsty MacColl, Prefab Sprout, Maxi Priest, Madness, The The, Tina Turner, Mike Oldfield, The Communards, Richard Ashcroft, Annie Lennox. In addition to all this he now has an entry in ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs Who In The Music Industry‚Äù and has received one of the highest musical accolades by receiving the Gold Award from BASCA ‚ÄòThe British Academy of Songwriters, Composers and Authors‚Äô held at London‚Äôs Savoy hotel. This coveted award celebrates the achievements of an outstanding group of people who have made a special contribution to Britain‚Äôs music industry. Judd was also involved in the biggest event in the UK music calendar The BRIT AWARDS. Judd had worked on this show for the past 22 years as floor Cam Director. Judd is now based in Hertfordshire just outside of London, where his office walls don an array of Gold and Platinum discs and awards, serving as a testament to the contribution he has given and still is making in the music business.  Work in Television  Lander moved into the world of television as a puppeteer on BBC's Saturday Superstore kids show for a period of 5 years, then as an associated producer on The St Lucia Jazz Festival \\\\- shot in the Caribbean. His on-screen credits can also be seen in ‚ÄòResting Rough‚Äô an odd but amusing short film about a flea ridden mattress, which featured Pierce Brosnan ‚Äì Judd composed arranged and produced the films music. He also contributed to quite a few BBC drama episodes and headed the prestigious position as Director of promotions with London Records. His Chrysalis Records appointment saw him deliver the classic hit ‚ÄòThe One and Only‚Äô with Chesney Hawkes. Other shows include - Top of the Pops, The Tube, The Old Grey Whistle Test and Later... with Jools Holland. He then went onto become A&R;/label Director at Warner Music Group, a division within media giants Warner Bros. delivering them a No 2 and 3 top 40 chart single. Over the past 10 years he has successfully returned to his PR roots - and with his indisputable wealth of media contacts he has already helped a host of international artists obtaining major TV media coverage - featuring artists such as LeAnn Rimes.

From October 1990 he served under Helmut Kohl as a minister without portfolio in Germany's first post-reunification government. In the next government, between 1991 and 1994, he served as Minister of Education and Science. Life =Early years= Ortleb was born directly after the war in the eastern part of Thuringia, then a part of the Soviet occupation zone in what had till recently been central southern Germany. During his early years the zone became the newly created German Democratic Republic. Ortleb successfully completed his schooling in 1962 and undertook military service with the National People's Army until 1964, then signing up as an army reserve officer. =Academic= He studied Mathematics at Dresden, obtaining his first degree in 1963 and his doctorate in 1971. In 1977 he became a senior research assistant, still at the Dresden University of Technology. Here, for several years, he also headed up an \\"Army Reserve Collective\\", in the end reaching the rank of lieutenant. Further academic promotion (Habilitation) to the status of \\"Dr.-Ing. (engineering)\\" followed in 1983, on the basis of a paper entitled \\"Baustein-Terminal in Dialogsystemen\\", after which his academic work focused on Information Systems. He moved north in 1984, to Rostock University where he lectured on information systems processing, was appointed an associate professor in 1989, and where he worked from 1992 till 1998 as Professor for Technical Systems Applications Software. =Political= Ortleb joined the Liberal Democratic Party of Germany (LDPD) in 1968. The East German LDPD was one of five constituent Bloc parties controlled by the country's ruling SED party through a political structure called the National Front. He subsequently held various positions within the LDPD, joining the regional party secretariat for Dresden in 1976. His political career started moving to Rostock before his academic career, and in 1978 he was elected LDPD regional chairman for the Rostock region. In 1982, however, he was additionally appointed chairman of the LDPD's district executive for the party in Dresden-south. At the LDPD party conference at Weimar on 3 March 1977, he appeared, not for the last time at a party conference, in his army uniform and gave a rousing speech in praise of national defense. He spoke with eloquence and some passion: \\"My first argument is visible to you all, this uniform ... the result, the exercise in the art of war, is forced on us daily by the actions of the imperialists\\"\\"Mein erstes Argument ist, f√ºr jeden sichtbar, die Uniform...Die Konsequenz, die Kriegskunst zu trainieren, wird uns t√§glich von der imperialistischen Tat aufgezwungen.\\" Western observers subsequently identified more than a trace of irony in his performance. The Berlin Wall was breached in November, ushering in a period of rapid transition which by August 1990 had led to German reunification. On 10 February 1990 the LDPD held a Special Party Conference at Dresden, the outcome of which was a new name and a new Party Chairman. The new name was actually the old name which the party had been required to abandon in 1951. The Liberal Democratic Party (LPD / Liberal-Demokratische Partei ) elected Rainer Ortleb as its new chairman - effectively the party leader - in succession to Manfred Gerlach. East Germany's first and last national free election took place in March 1990 with the party (in alliance with a couple of recently emerged like minded and short-lived groupings) won 21 seats under Ortleb's leadership, and a junior role in East Germany's governing coalition under Lothar de Maizi√®re. Ortleb's career as a party leader was cut short in August 1990, however, when his LDP merged with its West German counterpart, the FDP (Freie Demokratische Partei). Following the merger of the LDP with the FDP Rainer Ortleb became regional party chairman in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern between 1991 and 1994. In 1997 he became the FDP regional party chairman in Saxony, becoming in the process the only FDP politician to be a regional party chairman successively in two different regions. In 1999 Ortleb resigned from his party chairmanship in Saxony following poor performance in a regional election for which his name had been at the top of the FDP candidate list. Two years later, following differences within the party over support for Ingolf Ro√überg as the party's (successful) candidate as mayor of Dresden, Ortleb resigned from the party in 2001. In the 2009 election Ortleb gave his support to \\"Die Linke\\", the successor to East Germany's old ruling SED (party). In November 2009 he gave a wide-ranging press interview celebrating the twentieth anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, in which he called for a reorientation of his former party, the FDP. =National Parliament= The East German election in March 1990 saw the liberal alliance led by Ortleb gaining more than 5% of the national vote. Ortleb, representing the Dresden constituency, was one of 21 Liberal Democrats who now entered the National Assembly (Volkskammer) where he led the Liberal group. He was one of the 144 deputies in the chamber who on 3 October 1990, as part of the German reunification process, became members of the Bundestag (National Assembly) of the reunited Germany. In the following two national elections, in December 1990 and in October 1994, he was elected to the Bundestag as a deputy for Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. Ortleb remained a member of the Bundestag till 1998. =Ministerial office= On 3 October 1990 Rainer Ortleb was one of the formerly East German political leaders to join the cabinet of the newly reunified Germany, under Federal Chancellor Kohl. Initially he served as a Minister without portfolio, but following the national election two months later, on 19 January 1991, Ortleb was appointed Minister for Science and Training in succession to J√ºrgen M√∂llemann. On 3 February 1994 he resigned from his ministerial position on health grounds.

This file system has two main novel features. First, it lays out files directly in a very large virtual storage address space. Second, it leverages the virtual flash storage layer to perform block allocations and atomic updates. As a result, NVMFS performs better and is much simpler than a traditional Unix file system with similar functionalities. Additionally, this approach avoids the log-on-log performance issues triggered by log-structured file systems. Microbenchmark results show that NVMFS can deliver 94,000 I/O operations per second (IOPS) for direct reads and 71,000 IOPS for direct writes with the virtualized flash storage layer on top of a first-generation Fusion-io ioDrive. For direct access performance, NVMFS is consistently better than ext3 on the same platform, sometimes by 20%. For buffered access performance, NVMFS is also consistently better than ext3, and sometimes by over 149%. Application benchmarks show that NVMFS outperforms ext3 by 7% to 250% while requiring less CPU power. Additionally, I/O latency is lower with NVMFS compared to ext3. Flash Memory API The API used by NVMFS to access flash memory consists of: * An address space that is several orders of magnitude larger than the storage capacity of the flash memory. * Read, append and trim/deallocate/discard primitives. * Atomic writes. The layer that provides this API is called the virtualized flash storage layer in the DFS paper. It is the responsibility of this layer to perform block allocation, wear leveling, garbage collection, crash recovery, address translation and also to make the address translation data structures persistent.

The area is mostly located on the banks of Jhelum river about 5 km from city center. The area is considered as the core point in the city as the first inhabitants of the Srinagar lived there. It is considered a seat of resistance as most anti-India protests take place here. In general, the whole area to the north of city centre Lal Chowk is considered a part of downtown although some areas hold high significance. The historical buildings and monuments found in the area reflect the design of old times. The residential homes are depicted to be constructed from late-19th century to early-20th century. Many key monuments like Jamia Masjid, Khanqah-e-Moula, Maharaj Gangh and shrines have been built by famous rulers of Kashmir. History The area was settled more than 2000 years ago in 3rd century BC by Raja Pravarsena. The area is the hub of the historical monuments made by the famous rulers of Kashmir. The historical monuments include Jamia Masjid in Nowhatta, Khanqah-e- Moula in Zana Kadal Aali Masjid in Eidgah, Maharaj Ganj tomb in Maharaj Ganj, Pathar (stone) Masjid in Nawabazar, and Sheikh Abdul Qadir Jeelani's shrine in Khanyar. Moreover, the Roza Bal shrine is also situated in the area. Geography The area is located at at an elevation of 1585 meters above mean sea level in Srinagar. Demographics Kashmiri is the main language of the area. People also use Urdu and English as secondary languages. It is estimated that the downtown has the population of half a million which is about 47% of the total population of Srinagar district. Flood In September 2014 the state of Jammu and Kashmir was hit by floods caused by torrential rainfall. The area of Downtown was least affected as compared to the rest of Srinagar, though close to the river, the people from other parts of Srinagar shifted to downtown for safety. Commercial buildings and residential homes and Government offices were shattered to nothing in the adjoining areas. People lost their lives and properties and the whole area was set on the economic back-foot. Schools, hospitals and other places of significant importance were damaged by the floods.

The film was released in Germany on 7 February 2013 and was released to video in the United States on 26 August 2014. It stars Peter Gadiot as a young man that finds himself fascinated by a woman who seems to be the mirror image of his former sweetheart, who was carted off by a demon six years ago. Synopsis Toby McClift (Peter Gadiot) is the son of a strict preacher (Roger Tebb) who continually warns Toby that he must never ever fall in love or have anything to do with love. Despite these strict warnings, Toby falls in love with Katie (Jytte-Merle B√∂hrnsen) and makes plans to meet up with her in a cemetery one night. Just as they are to meet, Katie is swept away by a demonic beast and is never seen again. Toby tries to convince everyone that her disappearance is due to a beast, but nobody believes him, least of whom is his father, and he's placed in a mental institution for the next six years. Once he's released he takes a job in an old castle serving as a tutor for Laura (also played by B√∂hrnsen), the niece of the elderly Lady Wallace (Jeanette Hain). Toby is struck by how much Katie and Laura look alike, to the point where he's certain that the two are one and the same. He's saddened when Laura claims not to know him, but becomes intrigued by how contradictory her nature is, as she is both sensuality and innocence. At the same time Toby is increasingly unnerved by how strange everything is in the house, including the actions of Lady Wallace's butler Mortimer (Klaus Tange) and several increasingly bizarre visions. He also notices that the longer he stays in the house, the younger Lady Wallace seems to appear. Eventually this becomes too much for Toby and he unsuccessfully tries to perform an exorcism on Laura, convinced that she is being possessed by Lady Wallace. Humiliated by his failure, Toby tries to leave but is stopped by Laura, who confesses that she is a witch that requires a pure, innocent being in order to be young forever and that she needs Toby in order to accomplish this.

Bloody Disgusting and Dread Central both panned the film, with Dread Central writing that \\"If I had to search for a lone beacon of light here, it would be the backdrop of the castle itself, giving off a retro-Italian horror movie feel; however, the lame CGI and dreadful performances bring this film back down to substandard levels of mediocrity. When all was said and done, the only thing ‚Äò‚Äùforbidden‚Äù about this movie should be the ability to sit through it again.\\" The Austin Chronicle was more positive in their review, stating \\"Sure, there are some shoddy CGI moments, including a lot of inexplicable shots of the sky going red or purple. But then Hastreiter's longtime cinematographer Tam√°s Kem√©nyffy suddenly pulls off a surprisingly beautiful image. It's inexplicable that suddenly something so elegant and well-crafted appears in the midst of lumpen cinematic mud, but it happens.\\" HorrorNews.net gave a favorable review for the work, commenting that it was \\"definitely the kind of film that you either love it or hate it with no middle ground\\" and that it would appeal to \\"a true fan of gothic horrors\\".

It was the fourth Catholic church built in North Carolina, the first west of Raleigh, and the first in what is today the Diocese of Charlotte. Built to serve the Irish miners in the area, it underwent a long period of neglect until restoration efforts began in the mid-20th century. Today it is operated as a mission church of Queen of the Apostles Church in Belmont.  History  Chevalier Riva de Finola established gold mines in the region starting in the 1830s, and many Irish immigrants came to the area to work in the mines. At first, they worshipped at de Finola's home, but he left in 1835 after a court ordered his mines closed. John England, Bishop of Charleston, assigned missionary Fr. T.J. Cronin to serve the miners in 1838, and he quickly began fundraising to build a church near what would become Mount Holly. In 1841, one of the miners, William Lonergan, donated six acres of land in what was then Lincoln County for the construction. Lonergan did not live to see the church completed, and was buried in 1842 on the site, the first burial in what would become St. Joseph's Cemetery; Cronin died of yellow fever the same year, and his body was moved to St. Joseph's in 1843. The simple wooden church, dedicated to Saints Mary and Joseph, was completed in 1843 and dedicated by a Fr. J.J. O'Connell, another missionary. Early records of church activities were lost in 1861 when the archives of the Diocese of Charleston were lost in the Great Fire of Charleston. O'Connell returned to serve as parish priest 1870‚Äì77, and in 1871, he purchased 500 acres of land from the Caldwell family. This land was eventually accepted by the Benedictines at Saint Vincent Archabbey in Pennsylvania, who arrived in 1876 and established what is today Belmont Abbey. After O'Connell's departure, however, regular services ceased. The construction of St. Peter's in Charlotte and losses and disruption from the American Civil War contributed to declining parish rolls. Eventually, the entire congregation shifted to the Abbey, and the church underwent a long period of neglect. The church underwent a long period of neglect. It was restored in 1974 thanks to a fundraising effort led by Francis Galligan of Gastonia. It was rededicated the following year by Bishop Michael Joseph Begley, and in 1979 was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. A small group of volunteers led by Carl Heil has looked after the property since 1993. In 2001, a statue of Saint Joseph that had stood outside St. Joseph's Hospital in Asheville was moved to the site.  Architecture  Completed in 1844, the structure a vernacular temple-form, Greek Revival style frame church clad in white clapboard.

As a philosopher he stuck to neo- Thomism and focused mostly on confronting Krausism. In education he represented the Catholic regenarationism, fiercely pitted against the Liberal current. In politics he was active within Carlism; his career climaxed during the 1896-1898 term in the Congress of Deputies and during the 1907-1915 terms in the Senate.

Even in the early 20th century he was only marginally mentioned by historians of Spanish literature;in his massive work Historia de la lengua y literatura castellana, Julio Cejador y Frauca marginally mentions Polo y Peyrol√≥n in volume IX (Segundo periodo de la epoca realista), Madrid 1918, but ignores him in volumes X/XI (Epoca regional y modernista), Madrid 1919 later on he went into oblivion,he is straightforwardly mentioned as a second-rate novelist by Santiago Sebastian, Aportaci√≥n de Polo y Peyrol√≥n a la Etnologia turolense, [in:] Aragon 1958, p. 6 though was occasionally acknowledged in anthologies.excerpts from his Historia de un ochavo moruno (1884) were placed in Jose Bergua (ed.), Las mil mejores paginas de la lengua castellana.

His stance is classified as neotomismo or neocatolicismo in philosophySirera Mirrales 2011, pp. 251-2; some name him the follower of Jaime Balmes, see Federico Mart√≠nez Roda, Valencia y las Valencias: su historia contempor√°nea (1800-1975), Valencia 1998, , 9788486792893, p. 190 and as regeneracionismo pol√≠tico- educativo in pedagogy.Sanz Ponce 2011 Polo's repudiation of krausism developed in course of the teaching career and stemmed from his growing interest in pedagogy and education in general.Urcelay Alonso 2013, p. 11 During last decades of the 19th century krausism became a philosophical powerhouse of liberal Spanish politics, represented mostly by Francisco Giner del Rios and Instituto Libre de Ense√±anza.also by Francisco Pi y Margall, Emilio Castelar, Manuel Pedregal y Canedo, Rafael Altamira, Pawe≈Ç Skibi≈Ñski, Historia a siwadomosc nardowa.

Life John Garidas is first mentioned in the year 900, during the reign of Leo VI the Wise (reigned 886‚Äì912). At the time, he was probably a member of the imperial bodyguard, the Hetaireia, and was charged with arresting the commander of the Hetaireia (hetaireiarches), Nicholas Zaoutzes, whose son, Basil, had led an abortive plot against the emperor. During the attempted coup by the general Constantine Doukas on 6 June 913, he remained loyal to the young emperor Constantine VII (r. 913‚Äì949) and was the one who killed, according to the Vita Euthymii, Constantine Doukas' son Gregory. By this time, he already held the senior rank of patrikios. In 914, he was named to the post of hetaireiarches by the Empress-dowager and regent Zoe Karbonopsina after his predecessor, Theophylact Dominikos, was also involved in a plot to seize the throne. In fall/winter 917, still as hetaireiarches, Garidas took part in the campaign against the Bulgarians under the Domestic of the Schools Leo Phokas the Elder. Leo Phokas had already suffered a heavy defeat at the Battle of Acheloos, in whose aftermath the Bulgarians had invaded Byzantine lands in Thrace. The campaign ended in yet another heavy Byzantine defeat at the Battle of Katasyrtai, when the Bulgarians launched a surprise night attack on the Byzantine camp and routed the imperial army. Garidas and Leo Phokas barely escaped with a few troops, and sought refuge behind the city walls of Constantinople. In early 919, Constantine VII and the Patriarch of Constantinople Nicholas I Mystikos toppled Zoe as regent. As they feared a possible usurpation by Leo Phokas, they dismissed him from the Domesticate and appointed Garidas, by now a magistros, in his stead. Garidas agreed, on the condition that his son Symeon and his brother-in-law Theodore Zephinezer be appointed as joint commanders of the Hetaireia, something which would effectively give Garidas control of the imperial government. The emperor and the patriarch agreed to his demands, but as soon as Garidas had left the palace to return to his home, they evicted Symeon and Theodore from the palace. As a result, Garidas, fearful of his own life, turned to the admiral Romanos Lekapenos, and became his supporter. Lekapenos now emerged as a strong contender for the throne, and in a series of moves, secured control of the imperial government, neutralized Leo Phokas, and gained promotion first to basileopator and finally to senior co-emperor on 17 December 919.

Opportunities for Economic Growth  Most European countries experienced a similar trend of brief economic growth followed by varying degrees of economic devastation during the twenty years of relative peace after 1918. Many countries sought to overhaul their industrial manufacturing facilities to help with economic reconstruction following World War 1. Newly formed Eastern European states started a transition towards industrialization, and experienced mixed results.Ros√©s, Joan R., and Nikolaus Wolf.

It took until the early 1920s for these innovations to spread across countries and from one industry to another. Important innovations of the time include the combustion engine and complete overhaul of the mechanics powering machines in industry, agriculture, and transportation. The rise in enrollment rates of primary schools shows a continued accumulation of human capital in European countries, which began in the 19th century.Ros√©s, Joan R., and Nikolaus Wolf.

Web. 16 Nov. 2014. Along with technological innovations, the large stock of human capital across Europe led to increases in total-factor productivity (TFP). As the relative peace in Europe dissipated in the 1930s, countries failed to coordinate economic policies and could not exploit the aforementioned growth factors. Investment slowed as resources were put towards preparing for another armed conflict due to friction over the redistribution of economic and political power after World War 1. A rise in protectionism and fragmentation of markets is proof of the failure to establish transnational economic policies necessary to capitalize on the opportunities for economic growth.Ros√©s, Joan R., and Nikolaus Wolf.

Economics and Politics after 1929  The onset of the great depression in 1929 undoubtedly had an astronomical effect on the global economy during the latter years of the interwar period. American credit disappeared with the United States stock market crash in October 1929, severely hurting European businesses and causing a drastic rise in unemployment. As the economies in Austria and Germany appeared to be in danger of collapsing, the United States suspended war reparations, which had a chain reaction across Europe. Policies implemented by European countries also compounded the effects of the great depression.Saenz-Cambra, Concepcion, ed. \\"The European Economy in the Interwar Period.\\" The Saylor Foundation (n.d.): 2-5. Saylor. Saylor Academy. Web. 16 Nov. 2014. This section examines the economic situation in Germany and the United Kingdom, in relation to the smaller Nordic states. The United Kingdom was the leading economic power at the time, and Germany was rapidly gaining strength under Hitler and the Nazi Party. It also shows how different economic factors and policies lessened the effects of the great depression on the Nordic States. = Germany = The aftermath of Germany's loss in World War 1 saw the country experience severe hyperinflation, with the Weimar Republic finally tackling the issue by 1923. A period of known as the Golden Twenties then saw major economic stabilization and growth fuelled largely by foreign investments and loans. However, the Great Depression resulted in the recalling of these loans and severe economic troubles and social unrest. By 1932, close to six million people were unemployed. The situation in Germany became so precarious that Hitler and the Nazi party started to gain the support of the people.Zermeno, Sebastain. \\"Germany During the Interwar Period.\\" Prezi.com. Prezi Inc., 8 June 2011. Web. 16 Nov. 2014. = United Kingdom = Estimated to have lost ¬º of its wealth during World War 1, Britain turned to welfare to spark an economic recovery. Reliant on receiving payments of war debts from Germany to stimulate economic growth after the onset of the great depression, the British economy suffered when the United States nullified these reparation payments. Britain, along with France, demanded that Germany pay these debts, despite the country being on the verge of a financial collapse. After much debate, the sum of the payment was set at 32 billion gold-backed US dollars over the course of 62 years. Economists such as John Maynard Keynes have compared this to imposing slavery on Germany and its defeated allies. = Nordic Countries = The Nordic countries discussed include Denmark, Norway, Finland, and Sweden, as Iceland is not mentioned. While most countries adopted inwards economic policies after 1929, Nordic states continued their cooperation and reliance on international trade. With extreme fluctuations in the international economy, these countries were forced to specialize in areas in which they had a competitive advantage. One example of this is Finland identifying the increasing demand for wood across Europe, and using their abundance of natural resources to give rise to a major timber industry. This allowed Finland to experience tremendous growth during the latter half of the 1930s.Olsson, Sven- Olof. \\"What Can We Learn from Economic Crisis 1929-1933 When Discussing and Analyzing the Present Economic Crisis?\\" SNEE Conference (2010): n. pag. Snee.org. Gothenburg University, 18‚Äì21 May 2010. Web. 16 Nov. 2014. Norway also grew after a strong recovery in 1934 from stagnant foreign trade and rising unemployment caused by the great depression. Denmark's neutrality during World War 1 allowed it to supply both sides and profit from this war. It used this profit to lessen the effects of the great depression and stimulate a quick economic recovery. Sweden did not feel the effects of the great depression until the early 1930s, but recovered quickly and stabilized its economy by supplying goods to most of Europe. While these countries experienced relative economic growth, there was fear that their trade conditions would deteriorate due to the imposition of quotas and the control on trade of larger states.Olsson, Sven-Olof. \\"What Can We Learn from Economic Crisis 1929-1933 When Discussing and Analyzing the Present Economic Crisis?\\" SNEE Conference (2010): n. pag.

Each Nordic state specialized in commodities that were high in demand in both Britain and Germany, the two largest and most important countries. Sweden specialized in iron ore, Finland in paper, Denmark in agrarian products, and Norway in nickel and aluminum. Germany's expansion created a tense political climate, and the Nordic states relied on political cooperation while other countries turned inwards in an attempt to become more self-sufficient. Representatives from Norway, Denmark, Finland, and Sweden met numerous times throughout the interwar period to establish strategies, which protected industries such as timber and agriculture that were exposed to international competition. The most important meeting proved to be The Oslo Convention in 1930, which included the four Nordic countries (Finland joined late), Belgium and the Netherlands.Olsson, Sven-Olof. \\"What Can We Learn from Economic Crisis 1929-1933 When Discussing and Analyzing the Present Economic Crisis?\\" SNEE Conference (2010): n. pag. Snee.org. Gothenburg University, 18‚Äì21 May 2010. Web. 16 Nov. 2014. The states agreed to reduce obstacles to foreign trade, which in turn allowed them to form an economic bloc comprising 8.64 per cent of world trade in 1931. With the refusal of Britain and Germany to participate, The Oslo Convention did not achieve its intended goal of a global revival of free trade; however, it further strengthened exchange between the Nordic states. Imports and exports between the four countries grew, helping with their continued economic growth during the 1930s. Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden are proof of the importance of cross-border policies in relation to economic growth. Countries with inwards policies, such as Germany and Britain, would be stuck in the great depression for much longer as a result. The political and economic landscape in Germany following the great depression paved the way for the radicalization of its people.Olsson, Sven-Olof. \\"What Can We Learn from Economic Crisis 1929-1933 When Discussing and Analyzing the Present Economic Crisis?\\" SNEE Conference (2010): n. pag.

Germany‚Äôs Fascist Economy  Upon bringing fascism to Germany in 1933, Adolf Hitler proclaimed, \\"the State should retain supervision and each property owner should consider himself appointed by the state. It is his duty not to use his property against the interests of others among his own people. This is the crucial matter. The Third Reich will always retain its right to control the owners of property.\\"Barkai, Avraham. Nazi Economics: Ideology, Theory, and Policy. Trans. Ruth Hadass-Vashitz. Oxford: Berg Publishers Ltd., 1990. This laid the foundation for Germany's new fascist economy and the radical economic policies that would follow. One of the Nazi Party's first steps was to eliminate small corporations, which Hitler classified as any corporation with capital under $40,000. The establishment of new corporations with capital less than $20,000 dollars was also forbidden.Shirer, William L. The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich. New York: Simon and Schuster, 1960. Hitler completely reorganized the economic landscape in Germany. The economic chamber of the Third Reich consisted of over two hundred organizations and national councils involved in industry, commercial, and craft lines. Large public works programs, such as the construction of the Autobahn, stimulated the economy and reduced unemployment. These programs also prevented the recurrence of inflation, which plagued the German economy immediately following World War 1 and led to widespread civil unrest. As the economy slowly recovered under the Nazi Party, Hitler adapted the economy to cater towards war preparations.Hans- Joachim Braun, \\"The German Economy in the Twentieth Century\\", Routledge, 1990, p. 83  The Four-year Plan  In 1936, Hitler and Nazi Party implemented their second four-year plan of the period, and put it in the hands of Hermann Goering. The goal of the plan was to continue to economic transition towards fascism while making Germany self-sufficient in preparation of another war. Four priorities of the plan were to increase agricultural production, retrain key sectors of the work force, implement governmental policies to regulate imports and exports, and to achieve self-sufficiency in the production of raw materials.\\"The Four Year Plan.\\" History Learning Site. N.p., May 2012. Web. 18 Nov. 2014. Several high-ranking members of the Third Reich believed Goering was not the right man for the job, but Hitler expressed full confidence in him. Several business leaders also did not support this plan, and believed a wholesale rearmament would come at the expense of economic improvement. Despite numerous concerns over Goering and the plan itself, it was carried out and extended into the start of World War 2. The success of the plan in preparing Germany for war is attributed to the Goering's use of slave labor, which he defended as necessary of the very existence of Germany.\\"The Four Year Plan.\\" History Learning Site.

Lasting Impacts of the Interwar Period  Many social, political, and economic changes started taking place during the brief period of relative peace between the two World Wars. In their book British Tourism: The Remarkable Story of Growth, Victor Middleton and Leonard Lickorish describe the period as, \\"A transition away from the Victorian Age toward the new world of greater individuality, mobility and innovation in most spheres of daily life, and especially in leisure and travel. Against what one might suppose, it was also a period of remarkable growth in travel and tourism and of developing social ideas that are still easily traceable today,\\".Middleton, Victor T.C. \\"Chapter 1.\\" British Tourism: The Remarkable Story of Growth. By Leonard J. Lickorish. 2nd ed. N.p.: Routledge, n.d. 16. Print. page 2. Holiday travel and leisure excursions became a huge source of revenue in the 1930s as rail travel was at the peak of its popularity. Many of the changes that started during the interwar years could not fully manifest until the political and economic climate of Europe was settled following World War 2. Travel and tourism became a huge part of life for people in Britain as soon as it was affordable after the war. The role of the media began to transform through cinema and radio communications in the 1930s, and this extended dramatically following the end of World War 2. The growth of tourism during the interwar period provided a basis for future development when post-war conditions would allow.Middleton, Victor T.C. \\"Chapter 1.\\" British Tourism: The Remarkable Story of Growth. By Leonard J. Lickorish. 2nd ed. N.p.: Routledge, n.d. 16. Print. Tourism across all of Europe started to become a huge revenue generator. Entrepreneurs who pioneered new business models during the interwar years paved the way for the growth of holiday resorts and travel agencies in the latter half of the 20th century. Even during the depression years, inbound tourism expanded and prompted people to start concentrating more on foreign exchange earnings. Evidence shows that tourism was even more of an income generating factor during the interwar period than in the years following World War 2 when local governments were undergoing significant changes. Tourism in Europe would not reach the level of popularity it experienced during the interwar period until close to the 21st century.Middleton, Victor T.C. \\"Chapter 1.\\" British Tourism: The Remarkable Story of Growth.

The organisation has existed since the eighties but it was formally founded in 1994. The organization contains both private and public museums, all of which are registered as members of De Museumvereniging, the Dutch Museum Association. The OAM association has a limited jurisdiction and an elected chair and vice-chair. The 'official' museums of Amsterdam actually do not exist. The name is a misleading translation of the unofficial name of an unincorporated meeting club of mostly government subsidized museums who co- ordinate their marketing to monopolize further government subsidies for city marketing and government assistance. The website of the Jewish Historical Museum slightly more correctly calls them: 'organization' of Amsterdam Museums with an office in the Amsterdam Uitburo or the city's entertainment desk. But the real Dutch name, as in the logo, is 'overleg' or 'meeting.' The foundation Samenwerkende Amsterdamse Musea (SAM) represents the collective business interests of the OAM.

Racing only as a two-year-old he won two of his three races including the Breeders' Cup Juvenile. His career was ended by injury in December 2013 and he was retired to stud. Background New Year's Day is a bay horse with a narrow white stripe bred in Kentucky by Clearsky Farms. He was sired by the Irish-bred stallion Street Cry, who won the Dubai World Cup in 2002 before becoming a very successful breeding stallion. His other offspring have included Zenyatta, Winx, Street Sense, Whobegotyou and Shocking. New Year's Day's was the first foal of his dam Justwhistledixie, a high-class racemare who won the Grade II Davona Dale Stakes and finished second in the Acorn Stakes in 2009. As a descendant of the broodmare Bold Irish, Justwhistledixie came from the same branch of Thoroughbred family 8-c which also produced Ruffian, Pine Bluff and Fusaichi Pegasus. In September 2012, the yearling colt was consigned to the Keeneland sales where he was bought for $425,000 by Ben Glass. The colt entered the ownership of Mary & Gary West and was sent into training with Bob Baffert. Racing career =2013: two-year-old season= On his racecourse debut, New Year's Day ran in a five and a half furlong maiden race on the Polytrack surface at Del Mar on August 18, 2013. Ridden by Garrett Gomez, he started at odds of 4/1 in a field of nine runners. After racing towards the rear of the field he moved up on the outside entering the straight and finished third behind Indexical and Hi Fashioned. Two weeks later at the same track, New Year's Day contested another maiden race, this time over a distance of one mile and started the 0.9/1 favorite against eight opponents. Gomez tracked the leader Carson's Ten in the early stages before sending his mount into the lead two furlongs from the finish. New Year's Day went clear of the field in the straight and won by one and three quarter lengths from Bond Holder with a gap of three and a quarter lengths back to Cautious Giant in third. New Year's Day was then moved up sharply in class to contest the thirtieth running of the Breeders' Cup Juvenile over eight and a half furlongs at Santa Anita Park on November 2 in which he was ridden by Martin Garcia. The Champagne Stakes winner Havana was made the 3/1 favorite ahead of Tap It Rich the more fancied of the runners from the Baffert stable with New Year's Day next in the betting on 8/1 alongside Bond Holder. The other contenders included the Hopeful Stakes winner Strong Mandate and the Breeders' Futurity Stakes winner We Miss Artie. A very strong pace was set by Conquest Titan, Rum Point and Strong Mandate, with New Year's Day settled behind the leading group on the inside. As the field entered the straight, Havana gained the advantage from Strong Mandate but Garcia produced New Year's Day with a strong late run along the inside rail to take the lead in the closing stages and won going away by one and a quarter lengths. Havana took second ahead of Strong Mandate, Bond Holder and Tap It Rich. Explaining his tactics, Garcia said My horse doesn't have that much pace. I was exactly where I wanted to be. The rail was open and I took it; I didn't panic\\". Baffert, who was winning the race for the third time after Vindication in 2002 and Midshipman in 2008 said \\"He showed us a lot in his two races at Del Mar and he's been showing us a lot here in the morning. He's been telling us in the mornings that he's ready.\\" In late December New Year's Day sustained a training injury described as a \\"non-displaced chip on the left hind sesamoid\\". On 26 December it was announced that the colt would be retired from racing and would begin his stud career Hill 'n' Dale Farms in Lexington, Kentucky. His owners' agent Ben Glass said We don't know what happened‚Äîwhether he kicked himself coming off the track, or what. \\"It was going to be a long layoff, regardless of what we did, so [we] decided it would be in the best interest of the horse to retire him. Bob said he didn't want to have to hold his breath every time he breezed him. We would like to win more races with him but that's not in the cards. Disappointed isn't the right word for it.\\" Assessment and awards New Year's Day was runner-up to the gelding Shared Belief in the poll for American Champion Two-Year-Old Male Horse. In the Eperimental Free Handicap he was rated the best American two-year-old of 2013, with a weight of 126 pounds. Stud career New Year's Day began his stud career at Hill 'n' Dale Farms in Kentucky at a fee of $12,500 for a live foal. On July 15, 2017 New Year's Day was represented by his first winner, a bay filly named Special Portion. On her racing debut, Special Portion (out of Awesomeatthetrack, by Awesome Again) won by 2 1/2 lengths at Arapahoe Park. In 2016 he sired multiple G1 winner, Maximum Security. Maximum Security won the 2019 Kentucky Derby before being DQed. Prior to Maximum Security's emergence as a G1 winner, in late 2018, New Year's Day was sold to Brazilian interests to stand future seasons in that country. However, following the success of Maximum Security, he was subsequently sold to Japanese interests by that Brazilian owner. He is expected to stand his first season in Japan in 2020.

The park is located immediately south-west of Tower Bridge and immediately south-east of City Hall, London. It is frequently used for food festivals and other events. The name originates from the many potters who lived and worked in the area in the 17th and 18th centuries. The land has never been a Potter's field (a burial ground for the poor), although there were graveyards in the area. History The first named pottery in the Potters Fields Park records is Pickleherring Pottery. It was established in 1618 by Christian Wilhelm; in the 1670s and 1680s, at least two other potteries were established by other people in the same area. On the 1682 William Morgan Map, the area is referred to as \\"Potts Fields\\"; the St. Olave's Parish Register shows 124 Potters operating in the area between 1618 and 1710. The number was down to 68 between 1710 and 1733. The Rocques Map of 1746 shows \\"Potters Fields\\" as a street name for the lane linking Tooley Street to Pickleherring Street. By 1772 pottery making had disappeared from the area. In 1988 St. Martin's Property Corporation and Southwark Council agreed on the name \\"London Bridge City Park\\", but local community groups protested and it finally opened as \\"Potters Fields Park\\".

The prize was established in memory of prominent entomologist and biodiversity informatics proponent Ebbe Nielsen, who died of a heart attack in the U.S.A. en route to the 2001 GBIF Governing Board meeting. History The award was created in 2001 to honour the recently deceased Danish-Australian entomologist Ebbe Nielsen, who was a keen proponent of both GBIF and the biodiversity informatics discipline. At the time of its creation, the prize was the only global award for work in biodiversity. Initially set at US$35,000 and later ‚Ç¨30,000, the award comprised a cash prize plus an invitation to give a guest lecture to address the annual meeting of the governing body of GBIF in whichever country the meeting was being held for that year. In its 2003 call for submissions, the prize was stated as being \\"[awarded] annually, to a promising researcher, normally within ten years of their entering the research field of biodiversity informatics. Candidates should be combining biodiversity informatics and biosystematic research in novel and exciting ways ... The primary selection criterion is scientific excellence as evidenced by the nominee‚Äôs research and publication record, and in particular, the innovation shown in combining biosystematics and biodiversity informatics research in their field of activity.\\" Over the life of the prize, it was won by researchers from Japan, Germany, Sweden, Argentina, United States (twice), Australia (twice), United Kingdom, Colombia, Canada, Denmark and Portugal.

Ball states that he was never called to the English Bar, although he practiced as an attorney in the King's Bench.Ball p.259 He was befriended by the leading Irish barrister John Philpot Curran, who persuaded him that his future lay in a career in Ireland. He was called to the Irish Bar in 1792 and took silk in 1806. He was a man of great erudition, who was described, no doubt with some exaggeration, as the most learned man ever to practice at the Irish Bar. He was also an exceptionally hard worker, and above all a superb advocate. He made his reputation with his speech for the defendant, which was described as \\"a masterpiece of eloquence\\", in the leading quo warranto case, R. v. Waller O'Grady, in 1816, where the Crown challenged the right of the Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer to appoint his younger son as a Court clerk.Ball p.341 Thereafter his career advanced rapidly: he became Third Serjeant in 1817, Second Serjeant in 1818, and a judge of the Court of King's Bench (Ireland) in 1820. He was one of the last Englishmen to be elevated to the Irish Bench.Ball p.259 He enjoyed a high reputation as a judge, being described as calm, dignified and impartial.Annual Register 1847, obituary His most memorable trial was that of Daniel O'Connell for conspiracy in 1844: while other judges sat on the Court, it was Burton who passed the sentence of imprisonment, which was later quashed by the House of Lords.Ball p.341 Burton was by then a very old man and his mental and physical faculties may have been failing: several witnesses claimed that he was asleep during the trial.Geoghegan, Patrick M.

Biography  Jean-Claude- R√©publicain Arnoux was born at Le Cateau-Cambr√©sis in the Nord department of France on 16 December 1792. His father was a postmaster. In 1811 he entered the √âcole polytechnique and became a lieutenant in the Artillery under the French First Empire, before being decommissioned on 16 July 1815. He was the Administrator of the (General Post Office) and was appointed General Manager of the General Post Office at Laffite in 1856. Between 1845 and 1852 he built the rail line from Paris to Strasbourg, after doing scientific research at the √âcole Centrale. In 1838 he published essays concerning his system for carriages on large curves. On 9 March 1841 he made a proposeal for a railway from Paris to Meaux, although it was not enacted. Diagram of the Arnoux System He is best known as the inventor of the Arnoux system (), whichwas used on the first Ligne de Sceaux on 6 June 1846. This system used trains with articulated axles, such that the movements of the axles were guided by chains and pulleys, so that they could negotiate tight curves at high speed. He won the from the French Academy of Sciences in 1839.: contains a description of the prize and a long study of the advantages and disadvantages of the Arnoux System By an Order of 6 September 1844 he won the operator's concession for the Ligne de Sceaux for 50 years. Work started in the middle of 1845, under the direction and assistance of his two sons-in-law. Lalanne worked on the route, earthworks and infrastructure. He worked later to extend the route as far as Robinson in 1893 and managed the branches from Bourg-la-Reine and Palaiseau to Orsay. Alexis DulongSon of the physicist Pierre Louis Dulong. He is named on the face of the historic monument: (\\"Denfert-Rochereau Station, lately called the Sceaux or Entrance to Hell. History: Only survivor of the first age of Parisian railways.

Arnoux's solution was not without its problems, and twenty years later it was replaced with a more standard solution. Station using the Arnoux System The first line was from the (\\"Hell's Gate\\") (now Denfert-Rochereau) to Sceaux, Hauts-de-Seine. According to the timetables, in the year 1868 it ran to Paris every hour on the hour from 6am to 10pm and from Paris to Sceaux hourly from 6.47am to 10.47pm. The price in first class was 75 centimes, in second class 75 centimes, and in third class 45 centimes. Parisians who wanted to enoy the countryside used it to get to Bals de Sceaux and Guinguettes de Robinson. Arnoux had previously provided diligences for the Paris - Orl√©ans journey from 10 June 1843; he hadn't foreseen their redundancy. This operation was first used on the first French (and first continental European) line, opened on 30 June 1827 between Paris and Saint-√âtienne and 1 March 1832 to Andr√©zieux. Arnoux died in 1866.

The Movie) is a 2014 made-for-television Christmas comedy film directed by Tim Hill, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Jeff Morris. The film stars Internet celebrity cat Tardar Sauce, also known as \\"Grumpy Cat\\", and Megan Charpentier as a young girl who befriends and later adopts Grumpy Cat, only to discover that the two can communicate with one another. The film premiered on Lifetime on November 29, 2014, to generally negative reviews from critics. Plot Grumpy Cat is a lonely and grumpy cat living in a mall pet shop located that is slated to be closed. She is bitter at being constantly passed over for other animals in the store, but is surprised to find that she can communicate with Chrystal, an equally lonely 12-year-old girl who is shocked that Grumpy Cat can talk. The two are initially at odds, but start to befriend each other, especially after a high-priced Leonberger dog is kidnapped from the pet shop for its value.

The film was created to showcase Tardar Sauce, the subject of an Internet meme which first appeared in 2012. By the end of 2013, the company which manages Grumpy Cat's image was valued at around $1 million. The company is managed by Ben Lashes, who is credited as an Executive Producer on Grumpy Cat's Worst Christmas Ever. Tim Hill, one of the writers, had previously directed Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties and Alvin and the Chipmunks. When Plaza was cast to perform Grumpy Cat's voice, she was initially unfamiliar with it, but learned about the cat before production. The film was shot in its entirety before Plaza recorded her lines. She re-drafted around 90% of her dialogue, explaining, > Once I realized that the cat's mouth wasn't going to move, I just kind of > went for it, and thought, 'Well, if it's just going to cut to the cat and I > can say my line, then I can just comment on other things, too.'

Some butterfly and moth breeders limit their market to wholesale customers while other breeders supply smaller volumes of stock as a retail activity. Some small scale and larger scale breeders limit their businesses to provision of the butterflies or moths for schools. Others provide butterflies in commemorative events such as funerals, hospice activities, bar mitzvahs, 911 memorial events and weddings. The process often includes the release of individual organisms to the wild where the release occurs in the natural range of the butterfly. Captive butterfly breeding programs do not affect biodiversity. History =5000 BC to 1976= Commercial breeding of Lepidoptera has a long history. The Bombyx mori (Latin: \\"silkworm of the mulberry tree\\"), The practice of breeding silkworms for the production of raw silk, also known as Sericulture, has been underway for at least 5,000 years in China. It is dependent on humans for its reproduction and does not occur naturally in the wild. The silkworm was domesticated from the wild silkmoth Bombyx mandarina which ranges from northern India to northern China, Korea, Japan, and the far eastern regions of Russia. The domesticated silkworm derives from Chinese rather than Japanese or Korean stock. Silkworms were unlikely to have been domestically bred before the Neolithic age; before then, the tools required to facilitate the manufacturing of larger quantities of silk thread had not been developed. The domesticated B. mori and the wild B. mandarina can still breed and sometimes produce hybrids.... = 1977‚Äìpresent = Serious commercial breeding activity began in 1977. At this time the tomato industry on Guernsey had become bankrupt and unused greenhouses remained. An entrepreneur purchased vacant greenhouse and filled it with tropical plants ‚Äì creating a tropical jungle environment. At this point, butterflies from Asia were acquired. The newly constructed enclosure contained a waterfall, and small stream. The structure was publicized and opened to the public. In 1977, there was no access to commercial butterfly breeders in tropical regions. Stock was obtained from amateur lepidopterists who periodically provided few dozen butterflies to the exhibit. The Guernsey butterfly exhibit was a commercial success. Butterfly exhibits rapidly gained a positive reputation with investors. They were seen as novel commercial activities generating a return in a short of time. The butterfly exhibit industry continued to expand in 1980 and until 1988 in the United Kingdom. New exhibits were started every year. Some were separate exhibits while others were part of wealthy estates. Other commercial exhibits were added onto already existing businesses such as garden supply centers. The new butterfly exhibits had various results. Some were considered 'shoddy'. One example of this was one owner who pinned his dead butterflies onto flowers to cut costs. Other exhibitors sought to improve their exhibits to increase the public's enjoyment. These developed long-term profits goals. Some exhibitors began minimal investment attempting to maximize their short-term gains. Commercial butterfly breeding and exhibitions have developed over the past 20 years essentially putting unprofitable exhibitors out of business. European butterfly exhibits are now supplied by regulated butterfly brokers. In 1980 one full-time professional distributor supplied live butterfly stock - Entomological Livestock Supplies. Other suppliers have formed since then. Brokers import butterfly pupae from around the world. Leading producers of butterfly pupae are the United States, El Salvador, Surinam, Ecuador Malaysia, Kenya, Philippines, Thailand, and Costa Rica. Butterfly exhibits and commercial/captive breeding have flourished in Canada and the United States. North America's largest butterfly exhibit is The Niagara Parks Commission's (Ontario) Butterfly Garden. It opened in 1996 and is a $15 million facility. One weekend in January it admitted 20,000 visitors. Commercial and captive breeders often begin their operations after raising butterflies as a hobby and then expanding this into a business. Many butterfly breeders consider themselves to be hobbyists and limit their breeding to providing butterflies to their friends, families and schools at no cost.  Related applications Captive breeding of other species has been successful. The Pere David's deer was successfully saved through captive breeding programs. After almost being hunted to extinction in China. They demonstrated success with a wide variety of species in the 1970s ranging from birds (e.g. pink pigeon), mammals (e.g. pygmy hog), reptiles (e.g. Round Island boa) and amphibians (e.g. poison arrow frogs). Their efforts were successful in reintroducing the Arabian oryx (under the auspices of the Fauna and Flora Preservation Society), in 1963. The Przewalski's horse has recently been re-introduced to the wild in Mongolia.In 2010, the Oregon Zoo found that Columbia Basin pygmy rabbit pairings based on familiarity and preferences resulted in a significant increase in breeding success. Captive bred stock is purchased by researchers. Captive butterfly breeding has been used to replenish extirpated populations of butterflies. One example of this was the commercial breeding of the Florida keys species butterfly by butterfly breeder Fort Lauderdale. Disease, parasite and predator controls microsporidium spore Microsporidium, a fungus, kills 100% of larvae hatched from infected eggs . This disease is transferred from larvae to adults. The bacterium originates from the host plant. Infected larvae initially show no visible symptoms. This infection is detected with a microscope. Protocols Commercial and hobbyist breeders are often members of the IBBA and the AFB. Breeders are trained in infection control, health monitoring, disease prevention, laboratory techniques and biological pest control. Captive breeders employ cost-effective and sustainable methods of plant propagation needed to provide larval food for their stock. Green houses, hydroponics, drip irrigation, and organic-based methods are used to control disease costs and create high plant yields. Pesticides are not used in the breeding of stock. Captive breeders reduce the exposure of laboratory bred stock to naturally curing predators, parasites and diseases that occur in wild stock by rearing butterflies in enclosed environments. larva room The butterfly and moth larvae are typically raised in containers in various densities dependent upon the predetermined protocols. Some butterfly larvae best raised in lower densities and others at higher densities. Breeding operations can include environmental controls such as humidity and temperature. Some commercial breeders limit their shipments to wholesale customers like butterfly houses, conservatories and exhibits. Other breeders shipped directly to customers who use the butterflies in various venues. Breeders ship stock in all ages of the life cycle of the butterfly to elementary and secondary schools throughout the United States; subject to the shipping regulations of the USDA. Event organizers sometimes purchase butterflies from breeders to be released during events. These events include: * 911 Memorial services * Cancer survivor Memorial services * Hospice -related Memorial services. * Funeral services * religious ceremonies * one day educational seminars * weddings A breeder typically begins operation by obtaining breeding stock from a reputable supplier of healthy stock screened for disease. Most breeders in southern states are able to 'overwinter' their stock enabling them to provide butterflies to customers year-round if the ambient temperatures are supportive of flight and the survival of the butterfly. Many breeders in northern latitudes that experience cold winters or repeated frosts shut down for the winter months. Larger breeding operations require the hiring of employees who are then trained to grow larval food maintain the grounds, sustain controlled environments, make shipments, advise receiving organizations on the proper care of butterfly stock.  Economic development in Third World countries Butterfly farming has been economically successful in increasing economic opportunities for local people in Ecuador and Costa Rica. Butterfly farming also promotes conservation activities and education.Checa,Maria F. \\"Butterfly farming: a successful approach to achieve conservation and development in western Ecuador.\\" Program for Southern Lepidopterist Society and Association for Tropical Lepidoptera, Gainesville, Florida. September 26‚Äì28, 2014, p.12 Commercial breeding in developing countries is readily understood by the people who do it. It is environmentally non-destructive, uses available raw materials, economically and environmentally sustainable. It is considered to be ethical in that it is not dehumanizing or degrading to the people who do it. In contrast to the clear cutting of natural habitats, butterfly farming is dependent upon native plant species. A butterfly farmer keeps areas of land intact with naturally occurring vegetation. Commercial butterfly farmers plant native plants on the property, providing food sources for the caterpillars. Commercial butterfly breeders generate employment and support the rural economy. It inhibits the rural to urban movement patterns. Education and conservation Commercial breeders provide stock to be used in education programs in elementary and secondary schools. Commercially bred monarchs migrate to overwintering sites in Mexico expanding the knowledge of migratory behavior. Genetics Some are concerned with possible negative effects. Over a sufficient number of generations, inbred populations retain genetic diversity. The cheetah has undergone genetic drift the wild for thousands of years with no inbreeding detriments. Host plants Hydroponic growing of larval food plants Breeders grow host plants for the larva that they are raising. Many of them have green houses that are enclosed to protect the food plants from being contaminated by parasites, predators and adverse environmental conditions. The plants raised in these green houses grow faster and stronger due to the methods employed by the breeders. Different host plants are needed by different species of butterflies. Some larva are limited to one type of host plant well other larva are referred to as generalists and are able to use a variety of host plants. Regulatory oversight The US Department of Agriculture regulates the interstate shipment of captive/commercially bred butterflies. The USDA allows shipments to areas and regions within the natural range of the butterfly. Some states have their own regulations to govern the shipping and release of commercially bred stock. Canada also regulates the shipment of butterflies. Butterfly releases and breeding done within the boundaries of a state are not regulated by the United States Department of Agriculture. Butterflies, moths, and almost all other species of animals and plants are not allowed to be removed from federal land and are not considered a source of butterflies for release. Fines are applied to those who collect from federal lands. Only six species of butterflies can be shipped across state lines in the United States. Butterfly houses, conservatories, and exhibits can receive butterflies and moths from areas outside of the United States. These shipments are regulated and do not allow the release of butterflies from these controlled environments. The shipments are also regulated by the United States Department of Agriculture. The same operations do receive shipments of native butterflies from breeders within the United States who have the proper permits. Controversy =Reducing biodiversity= Commercial and captive breeding releases of painted lady and monarch butterflies have been criticized for their potential of reducing biodiversity in wild populations. The homogeneity of the genome of the monarch has been determined and has been found to be 'unprecedented' across its worldwide range. =Petition to have the monarch butterfly designated as threatened under the Endangered Species Act= Adoption of the designation to have the monarch butterfly as threatened would prohibit the release of commercially bred monarchs, subject to substantial fines and penalties. =Disease transmission and the development of more virulent strains of parasites= Butterfly releases have been criticized for having the potential of spreading disease and promoting the proliferation of more virulent strains of parasites. Parasitic strains of Ophryocystis elektroscirrha have been found to be the most virulent in the western population of the monarch butterfly. When monarchs in the eastern population were inoculated with the parasite found in the western population, the eastern monarchs were found to be more resistant to the parasite than even the western monarchs. When monarchs from the western population were inoculated with the parasite found on eastern monarchs, no significant differences were observed. The degree of variation can be attributed to different variations in host and parasitic conditions. =Overutilization= Butterfly releases have been criticized because the monarch butterfly population is being overutilized. Breeders often use wild monarch butterflies to initiate their seasonal breeding, the released butterflies add to the population of wild monarchs. US and Canadian breeders Some breeders are able to generate substantial income. Large operations require large, paid, and trained staff. Market-driven competition determines the price of butterflies supplied to customers and wholesalers.

It is dedicated to contribute to the solutions of system innovation of Guangdong Province during the ‚Äúopen- up‚Äùprocess and promote the successful open-up experiences shaped in Guangzhou to other parts of China. Unirule used to run a Chinese website which focused on wide range of hot topic issues in China and regularly posted Chinese essays. China-review.com was an academic exchange platform of Unirule to promote communication between intellectuals and the public. All of Unirule's websites, social media accounts, as well as the social media accounts of Unirule's leading researchers, were closed down by the City of Beijing's government in late January 2017.The Economist February 18, 2017, pp. 37-38. On 10 July 2018, the institute was evicted without notice from their offices in Beijing. Workmen welded the door shut with five staff members inside, although they were released after police arrived. The Aijiaying leasing company from whom the institute leased their offices claimed that the contract was terminated after complaints from other residents in the block, but the institute's director, Sheng Hong, stated that he thought their eviction was carried out on the orders of government authorities. Sheng added that they would try to hire temporary premises for meetings in the future, but in the modern age the institute could survive without a physical presence. As of 2019, the institute operates with a 10 person staff located about 15 miles north of central Beijing. In August 2019, the institute announced that in response to governmental pressure it would be closing down permanently. The institute said that the Beijing municipal government had issued an order to shut down the institute as it was accused of violating regulations. The institute intends to file a legal challenge to the order, but it is not expected to be successful. Publications Unirule as an institution produced its Annual Report of the institution itself and publishes books and reports from the institution's own research. The books and reports included Chinese economy, such as ‚Äú China‚Äôs State-owned Enterprises: Nature, Performance, and Reform\\", China Economics(series, since 1994); Public governance, such as Report of Public Government Index of 30 Capital Cities(since 2008); Institutional economics, such as ‚ÄúGame: the Segmentation, Implementation and Protection of Land Rights‚Äù, ‚ÄúCase Studies in China‚Äôs Institutional Change‚Äù, ‚ÄúA Democratic and Legal System‚ÄîThe Reform of China‚Äôs Government System‚Äù and so on. In addition, articles, reports, policy briefs and opinion pieces were published on media, such a Xinhua News Agency, Economic Daily, China Daily, People‚Äôs Daily, The Economist, Reuters, the Financial Times and others. The Unirule ran a column on The Financial Times Chinese website. Funders Unirule did not receive financial assistance from any government entities, and instead, was dependent upon social donations and provisional grants for projects from institutions in China and abroad. Projects included research proposals entrusted to Unirule, training programs and other services provided. Some projects were supported by Center for International Private Enterprises (CIPE), the Ford Foundation, Alton Jones Foundation, US-China Chamber of Commerce, and the International Institute of Economics (IIE).

It was started by a group of parents on the parenting on-line discussion forum Mumsnet. History In 2012, a thread was opened on the Mumsnet online forum which said: \\"If you think that girls and boys should feel free to play with whatever toys that interest them most, and that they shouldn't walk into a toy store and feel pressurised to conform into archaic gender roles and stifling stereotypes, please join in the discussion!\\" As a result of the debate which followed, the Let Toys Be Toys campaign was officially launched in November 2012. Shortly afterwards, volunteer mystery shoppers from the campaign visited various retailers to gather information about how they were promoting toys; this was then used to decide which should be targeted by the campaign. The organisers set out their objectives, saying: > ‚ÄúToys are for fun, for learning, for stoking imagination and encouraging > creativity. Children should feel free to play with the toys that most > interest them. Isn‚Äôt it time that shops stopped limiting our children‚Äôs > imagination by telling them what they ought to play with? The answer is > simple ‚Äì we‚Äôre asking retailers and manufacturers to sort and label toys by > theme or function, rather than by gender, and let the children decide which > toys they enjoy best. Let toys be toys ‚Äì for girls and boys.‚Äù In February 2014, Chi Onwurah, MP for Newcastle upon Tyne Central, mentioned the Let Toys Be Toys campaign in a parliamentary debate she had called on gender-specific toy marketing. She told the House of Commons: > ‚ÄúBefore entering Parliament, I spent two decades as a professional engineer, > working across three continents.

House of Commons debate: > ‚ÄòChildren‚Äôs Toys (Gender‚Äìspecific Marketing)‚Äô, col. 138WH. Retrieved 29 > November 2014 Onwurah later told Kira Cochrane, a reporter for UK Newspaper The Guardian, that she believes the limiting of children by gender stereotypes is a serious economic issue, with the proportion of female students on engineering degree courses having fallen from 12% to 8% in the thirty years since she had started studying for one herself. She said: \\"We have some big economic problems, and one is a huge skills shortage in engineering and technology. There are thousands of jobs going unfilled, and in addition a lot of our engineers are in their 50s and retiring in the next five years. At the same time we have the lowest proportion in Europe of women who are professional engineers. [‚Ä¶] Toys are so important and formative, and for me this is about the jobs of the future, about what happens in 10 or 15 years' time. We can't go on with a segregated society.\\" In October 2014, Jess Day, a Let Toys be Toys campaigner told UK newspaper the Daily Mirror: > \\"It's easy to dismiss toys as trivial, but this is one way we can help our > children feel confident that they don't have to fit in with old-fashioned > stereotypes. Labelling construction toys as boys‚Äô toys and craft or dolls as > girls‚Äô toys restricts play. Play is important and different types toys help > hone different skills.

[‚Ä¶] There's nothing wrong with giving a girl a > doll for Christmas, or a boy a car ‚Äì but children need a variety of play. > Why would we want to tell them that only certain types of play are allowed > for them? That sounds like the opposite of fun!‚Äù Response from retailers Amongst early responses from retailers were decisions by Boots UK and The Entertainer to remove all ‚Äôboys‚Äô and ‚Äògirls‚Äô toys signage in their stores, and a promise from Marks and Spencer to make all their toy ranges inclusive. By December 2013, one year after the launch of Let Toys Be Toys, half of the 14 major retailers contacted by the campaign had already removed in-store ‚Äògirls‚Äô and boys‚Äô signage and stopped using gendered labelling on their own-brand toy packaging; a further five were taking steps to do so. A pre-Christmas survey of toyshops in the UK and Ireland conducted by Let Toys Be Toys supporters in November 2013 showed a 60% reduction in the use of gendered signs in retail outlets in comparison to Christmas 2012 when the campaign began. Retailer Hobbycraft came top of the list of stores promoting and selling toys without relying on gender stereotypes and was named the ‚Äôbest of the high street‚Äô by the campaign; Toymaster and Fenwick came second and third respectively. Fenwick was also, along with Debenhams and TK Maxx, named as the most improved store; all three had decided to stop using ‚Äôgirls‚Äô and ‚Äôboys‚Äô signage. However, overall the campaign‚Äôs survey found that more than 70% of stores inspected used some form of gender-based marketing; gender-based labelling was used to sell the majority of toys in 40%. Let Toys Be Toys co-founder Kerry Brennan said: > ‚ÄúWhile there‚Äôs still a long way to go to address sexism in the toy industry, > the changes in major retail chains like Debenhams are just brilliant to see. > They‚Äôve replaced pink and blue ‚Äògirls‚Äô and ‚Äòboys‚Äô signs with new colourful > signs that say ‚ÄòVehicles‚Äô, ‚ÄòSuperheroes‚Äô, ‚ÄòSoft Toys‚Äô, and ‚ÄòTV Characters‚Äô, > among others. Everything is much easier to find and children are no longer > being sent the message that science and adventure are only for boys, crafts > and nurturing play only for girls‚Äù. In November 2014, supermarket chain Tesco removed \\"gift for a boy\\" signage from superhero alarm clocks in its shops after a shopper‚Äôs photo of her \\"superhero-loving\\" daughter next to the sign was posted on Twitter and retweeted more than 10,000 times. Tesco apologised saying the clock would \\"make a great gift for both girls and boys\\". Let Toys Be Toys said the group was pleased the photo had resulted in the removal of the sign, adding: \\"Signs like these do influence people in their choice of what toys to buy children [‚Ä¶and they] \\"make children feel 'wrong' for liking certain things\\". On 30 November 2014, UK newspaper The Independent on Sunday reported the story of a seven-year-old girl who had been upset when the best and most complex train sets disappeared from the Toys R US website when her mother applied the ‚ÄúFor girls‚Äù filter. She had asked her mother to apply the filter as she had previously been bullied at school because she liked dinosaurs and had worn Spider-Man sandals. Her mother told the newspaper that her daughter had asked \\"Why are they saying I can't have that train set because I am a girl?\\" She had then lost \\"all confidence in her choices\\" and said that she didn't want a train set for Christmas after all. Following a complaint, Toys R Us‚Äô managing director phoned the mother to discuss the issue and to offer vouchers as compensation for the upset caused by the incident. The Independent on Sunday report also noted: ‚ÄúInterestingly, Amazon does not tend to use gender on its UK site, although gender signposting is prominent in its main US site.‚Äù It added that: ‚Äú‚Ä¶ a letter ‚ÄòTo Parents‚Äô thought to have been included in a 1974 Lego boxset saying ‚ÄòThe urge to create is equally strong in all children. Boys and girls‚Äô has also been getting thousands of shares on social media‚Äù. Awards In November 2013 Let Toys Be Toys were awarded the Progressive Preschool 2013 Marketing Award for their campaign against sexism in toy retail. The campaign was shortlisted in the 2014 National Diversity Awards and in March 2015 came top in the Advocacy category in Westbourne Comms third annual Change Opinion awards. This was followed by a win in the Care2 Awards presented in May 2015. In January 2016 it was announced that Let Toys Be Toys had won the Brio Prize. Other campaigns inspired by Let Toys Be Toys =Let Books Be Books= Let Toys Be Toys campaigners launched the Let Books Be Books campaign to persuade publishers to remove gender labels from their book titles and to encourage publishers and retailers to stop promoting books as ‚Äòfor girls‚Äô or ‚Äòfor boys‚Äô. The campaign was supported by prominent authors including former and current children's laureates Anne Fine and Malorie Blackman, the poet laureate Carol-Ann Duffy, and Philip Pullman. Publishers Parragon Books, Usborne Publishing, Ladybird Books, Dorling Kindersley, Chad Valley and Miles Kelly Publishing were amongst those who announced that they would no longer be publishing gender-specific titles. =Play Unlimited= In 2013, the Play Unlimited campaign was launched in Australia by campaigners who had been inspired by Let Toys Be Toys. It was successful in persuading Toys R Us to drop gender labelling from its website.

Librarianship is the management, organisation, collecting and preserving of information, often in libraries. The 2003 US Census showed that Hispanic people had the lowest proportion of librarians in their population while American Indians had the lowest number of librarians. Most librarian jobs were occupied by elderly Caucasian males. Library associations affected by this lack of ethnic diversity have put several measures in place to attempt to correct this issue. It has been suggested that the lack of diversity in librarianship is because most people are not aware of the job opportunities in the librarianship sector. Others suggest that a lack of diversity in university graduates makes it harder for there to be diversity in librarianship as the job is often held by people who hold university degrees. Issue There is a perceived lack of diversity in the field of librarianship. Older Caucasian males make up a significant percentage of library staff in higher positions, creating a deficit of library jobs for people of other sexes, ages, races, and ethnicities. Public libraries aim to hire a culturally diverse staff. The American Library Association, as well as many individual libraries around the country, are attempting to addressing the alleged problem. Statistics According to a chart created by the U.S. Census Bureau in 2003 that compiled information from 2000 of all ethnicities, Hispanics are most underrepresented among librarians. It showed that about 9% of the U.S. population was Hispanic, while only 3% of the population were employed as librarians. The ethnicity with the fewest librarians in America was American Indian/Alaskan Natives, at 0.5% of the country‚Äôs population.Lance, K. C.(2005). Racial and Ethnic Diversity of U.S. Library Workers. American Libraries. ARL‚Äôs statistics from 2009 to 2010 show that 14.3% of staff in ARL university libraries are minority groups.Andrade, R & Rivera, A. (2011). Developing a Diversity-Competent Workforce: The UA Libraries' Experience. Journal of Library Administration. Solutions The majority of employees and educators agree that there is an issue with diversity among staff in the library field. Where they differ is how to solve the problem. There are opposing views on what is at the root of the issue, creating difficulty on how to change the status quo. Education Some believe that the answer is to foster library education. To become a librarian or to gain a high position in libraries, most institutions require a master‚Äôs degree (an MLA or MLIS); many argue that there is not enough diversity among students who receive a graduate‚Äôs degree and as a result diversity lacks in the library career field. The ARL is just one organization who subscribes to this school of thought. They developed the Initiative to Recruit a Diverse Workforce (IRDW) to help those minorities going to school for a library degree finish. Work environment Another field of thought is that a lack of diversity in the workplace is due to poor working climates. This group of people would argue that the workforce of libraries does not recruit and nurture the careers of underrepresented groups. Some recommend training staff to become more culturally sensitive and value others coming into the workforce. Also, leaders should be trained to value cultural diversity when going through a hiring process. Recruitment Some think the problem lies with a lack of interest in the career field of Library and Information Science. If minorities do not desire to become librarians, they will not seek to obtain an MLS or MLIS and therefore will not fill high job roles in libraries. Some recommended solutions are to create a great experience for all racial groups early on in life. This may inspire more young children to become interested in the career field later on in life. Another method suggested by employers is to grant free education to minorities who currently work in libraries at an entry level position if they pursue a degree that will further them in their current job.

Preminger contacted Robinson, who began working on the song, then visited Harburg for help with the lyrics. Harburg was not interested in the financial contract, but nonetheless assisted with shaping the song. Preminger chose not to use the song.

He is particularly associated with the ·π£awt genre called ·π¢awt al-Khaleej (\\"Voice of the Gulf\\"). Career and personal life As a teenager, Suri worked on sailing ships plying the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean. He first started as a maidan singer; he learned ·π£awt by listening to phonograph records of performances by Abdullatif al-Kuwaiti. Continuing to travel widely, he became known as \\"The Singing Sailor\\". Suri's family was conservative and did not approve of his musical inclinations; his brother even threatened to shoot him if he did not give up singing. He consequently moved to Mumbai where he worked first as a boilerman, then as a mercantile broker and translator in the trade between Arab and Indian merchants. During this time Suri continued to practice and perfect his musical art, integrating Indian influences into his music ‚Äì some of his lyrics were in Urdu as well as his native Arabic, helping him secure a steady sale of his records (he recorded twelve 78-rpm shellac gramophone records in the early 1930s) to an Indian as well as an Arabic audience. In 1943, Salim Rashid Suri married an Indian woman and in the late 1940s he and his wife relocated to Bahrain where he enjoyed success as a performer and set up his own record label and recorded other musicians. He continued to be a leading creator and exponent of the ·π¢awt al-Khaleej (\\"Voice of the Gulf\\") variety of ·π£awt. However, the advent of vinyl records ruined his record business and he returned to Oman in 1971 where the Sultan made him a consultant for cultural affairs.

Founded by Nuan Thamutaro (‡∏ô‡∏ß‡∏• ‡∏ò‡∏°‡∏°‡∏ò‡πÇ‡∏£) in 1956, Potisarn is built on Mr. and Mrs. Saiputhong's land in an area of 6 rai 440 square wah. When the school started in 1956, there was no classroom or any buildings. Students had to study in a temple. Later, Nuan Thamutaro raised funds for a school building. The result was a 2-floor wooden building that contained 12 classrooms. This building was finished in 1958. In 1982, Potisarn School got funded for a 3-floor concrete building that contained 18 classrooms. In 1983, the pool and toilet were built. Later in 1984, the elementary education department selected Potisarn School into its elementary improvement program. In this program, Potisarn's students got free books, free uniforms and free shelter. In 1986, Suankularb Wittayalai recruited Potisarn to be their sub-school. That meant any Potisarn students who met the requirements would be eligible to get into Suankalarb Wittayalai without any further exam. Now the school consists of 3 main buildings, 1 medical building and 1 football field.http://www.ps.ac.th  School Emblem  The emblem of Potisarn Pittayakorn consists of three elements. The first element is Battlements (‡πÄ‡∏™‡∏°‡∏≤), which represents Thailand‚Äôs Ministry of Education. The second element is Trishula (‡∏ï‡∏£‡∏µ‡∏®‡∏π‡∏•), which is the symbol of Department of General Education. And the last element is Bo Leaf (‡πÉ‡∏ö‡πÇ‡∏û‡∏ò‡∏¥‡πå), which represents the school of Potisarn Pittayakorn itself.  School Motto  The motto of Potisarn Pittayakorn School comes from a famous proverb in Bali Sanskrit, which is written as ‚Äú‡∏≠‡∏ï‡∏∫‡∏ï‡∏≤ ‡∏´‡∏¥ ‡∏≠‡∏ï‡∏∫‡∏ï‡πÇ‡∏ô ‡∏ô‡∏≤‡πÇ‡∏ñ‚Äù.

This proverb has been teaching the students to do everything by themselves and make the most out of any resources they have got.  School Slogan  There are three slogans every student has to bear in mind: \\\\- The first slogan is ‚ÄúStudy well and always be curious‚Äù (‡πÄ‡∏£‡∏µ‡∏¢‡∏ô‡∏î‡∏µ) This slogan is not only applied in their classes, but it also has to happen outside classroom. \\\\- The next one is ‚ÄúHave a discipline, follow the traditions, culture and law of Thailand‚Äù (‡∏°‡∏µ‡∏ô‡πâ‡∏≥‡πÉ‡∏à) \\\\- The final slogan is ‚ÄúHave patience like an athlete does‚Äù (‡πÉ‡∏à‡∏ô‡∏±‡∏Å‡∏Å‡∏µ‡∏¨‡∏≤) as athletes understand what winning, losing and forgiving are.

He died in Paris in 1939 and is buried in Rennes alongside his son. Early works After completing his primary education and when he was twelve years of age, Boucher was apprenticed to a Rennes blacksmith but his artistic abilities came to the notice of the sculptor Charles Joseph Lenoir, the father of Pierre Charles Lenoir, who advised him to attend evening classes at the \\"Halle aux Toiles\\" in Rouen. There he became a friend of the painter Jules Ronsin who was to become a director of the ·∫æcole R√©gionale des Beaux-arts in Rennes, a school which was to produce a generation of talented sculptors who became known as the \\"·∫æcole de Rennes\\" and apart from Boucher included Paul Le Goff, Louis Henri Nicot , Pierre Charles Lenoir, Eloi Robert, Albert Bourget, Armel Beaufils and Francis Renaud. 1888 was to be an important year for Boucher and he enrolled at the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris, helped by a bursary from the Rennes municipality. On arriving in Paris he shared rooms with Ronsin and his apprenticeship started at the Acad√©mie Julian where he was able to learn from Henri Chapu and by the end of 1889 he was able to join the ·∫æcole des beaux-arts itself and was placed in the studio of Alexandre Falgui√®re and was able to attend classes run by Antonin Merci√©. Boucher now worked on preparing suitable works to submit to the salons and enter into competitions. 1891 saw him win third medal in the competition entitled \\"Figure model√©e d'apr√®s l'antique\\". 1896 saw Boucher's first showing at the Salon des Artistes fran√ßais with a plaster version of \\"Un soir\\". Here are details of some of these early works. =\\"√Çge d'or\\"= In 1893 he executed the composition \\"√Çge d'or\\" and in that year won the \\"Lemaire\\" competition medal which allowed him to reduce the length of his obligatory military service which was due at that time. The present whereabouts of \\"√Çge d'or\\" is not known. =\\"Achille rev√™t l'armure apport√©e √† Th√©tis\\"= This plaster bas-relief is held in the Mus√©e des Beaux-rts in Troyes. It had been Boucher's submission for the Prix de Rome in 1894. \\"Achille rev√™t l'armure apport√©e √† Th√©tis\\" had been that year's set subject for those competing for the prize. Boucher was the runner-up, but by way of consolation did win the 1894 Chenavard prize. =\\"Un soir\\"= This marble composition was shown at the Salon des Artistes Fran√ßais in 1899 and presented to Montauban in 1902, where it stands in the \\"Jardin des Plantes\\". Several versions of the piece were cast in bronze. The plaster version had appeared at the Salon des Artistes fran√ßais in 1896. =\\"Ca√Øn apr√®s la mort d'Abel\\"= In 1898, Boucher was again the runner-up for the Prix de Rome. \\"Ca√Øn apr√®s la mort d'Abebeings\\" was that year's set subject. This was the year he left the Beaux-Arts having won the \\"Prix National\\" (see comments below for \\"Antique et moderne\\"). Restoration of the west porch of the Dol-de- Bretagne cathedral In 1898 Boucher received his first major commission when invited to participate in the restoration of Dol-de-Bretagne cathedral. He worked on some relief sculptures on the exterior of the cathedral's west porch. This work exposed Boucher to the technics of Gothic architects and craftsmen. Relief sculpture on main door of Dol-de-Bretagne cathedral =\\"Antique et moderne\\"= This work in marble can now be seen in Cesson- S√©vign√© although for many years it was held in the Nantes' Mus√©e des Beaux- Arts. This work won the \\"Prix National\\" in 1898 which came with a bursary to cover the expense of a period spent outside France studying sculpture including a year in Italy, something along the lines of the \\"Prix de Rome\\" but without the chance to study at the Acad√©mie de France/Villa Medici. Boucher left Paris on 1 September 1901, visiting museums and staying for periods in Belgium, Germany, England and Spain before reaching Italy. Boucher's composition features two people, one representing antiquity in the form of a philosopher seated in an armchair and the other modernity with a depiction of a young woman seated on the ground by the philosopher. Both are deep in thought. A plaster version was shown at the Salon des Artistes fran√ßais in 1899 and in 1905 Boucher donated this to the Mus√©e Joseph Denais in Beaufort- en-Vall√©e. =\\"Devant la Mer\\"= This marble work depicting a young couple was exhibited at the Salon des Artistes fran√ßais in 1899. In 1934 it was shown at the Mus√©e du Petit Palais and the following year placed in the Jardin des Tuileries. In 1959 Germaine Richier' s \\"L'√©chiquier\\" replaced Boucher's \\"Devant la Mer\\" and the latter's present whereabouts is not known. =\\"Et√©\\"= In 1900 Boucher received the first class medal from the Salon des Artistes fran√ßais for this plaster composition which featured a family scene; wife, husband and daughter. The present whereabouts of this work is not known. His successes at this time with the Salon des Artistes fran√ßais where he exhibited the work \\"Antique et Moderne\\" and others and his near successes with the Prix de Rome led to a bursary being granted in 1901 as part of the Prix National which allowed Boucher to travel overseas and he visited Belgium, Spain, Germany and Great Britain and finished in Italy where he was obliged under the terms of the bursary to study for one year. Subsequent works =Monument to Ernest Renan= Ernest Renan monument in Tr√©guier In 1903, Boucher, having returned to France from Italy, received the commission to work on the Ernest Renan monument in Tr√©guier. The statue was inaugurated in 1903 and sits in the place Matray and in front of Tr√©guier's cathedral. Renan is depicted next to Athena the Goddess of Reason and the symbol of Science and Wisdom. The work is in bronze, the casting being undertaken by the Malesset foundry. The plaque on the monument's base reads The erection of the monument was promoted in 1902 by \\"Les Bretons de Paris\\". Boucher was awarded the L√©gion d‚Äôhonneur for this work. =Monument to Rivoire= Boucher's monument to Andr√© Rivoire can be seen in Vienne. Rivoire was a poet and playwright. =\\"Union de la Bretagne √† la France\\"= In 1911 Boucher created this relief placed in a niche of the Rennes h√¥tel de ville. It was dynamited by Breton separatists in 1932 This 1911 work was arguably one of Boucher's best works but the \\"Gwenn ha Du\\" group blew it up as a protest. It was never replaced but some of the fragments were used for subsequent monuments/memorials. See later details. The Rennes art museum for example hold a fragment entitled \\"T√™te de bretonne\\". A fragment of the sculpture \\"Union de la Bretagne √† la France\\" in the Rennes Art Museum =The work \\"Chinoise au br√ªle parfum\\"= Both the Mus√©e des beaux-arts in Rennes and the Mus√©e d'Orsay in Paris hold versions of this Boucher work which he worked on between 1911 and 1913. The association \\"Bretons de Paris\\" had organised for a monument to be erected in Brest dedicated to Dr Mesny. The work was in bronze and stood in Brest's place de La Tour d'Auvergne but in 1942 the work was requisitioned and the bronze melted down. However limited edition reductions had been cast in bronze and marketed under the titles \\"Oriental Priest\\" and \\"Oriental Fairy\\" and it is copies of these statuettes which the two museums hold. The work had been shown at the 1923 Exposition coloniale in Marseille. In 1979 the original plaster model came into the possession of the Mus√©e de Rennes. =Bust of Charles Le Goffic= Bust of Charles Le Goffic in Lannion This Boucher work can be seen in Lannion's place de l'√âglise Saint-Jean. =\\"La Maternit√©\\"= The \\"Manoir du Carfour\\" in La Bou√´xi√®re is today known as the \\"Centre m√©dical Rey-Leroux\\" and in the nearby park is a work by Boucher entitled \\"La Maternit√©\\". This work has been identified as having been a part of the Rennes \\"La R√©union de la Bretagne √† la France\\" blown up in 1932 by Breton separatists but others feel it was a preliminary study intended for the Rennes sculpture. The Mus√©e municipal de Locronan have a plaster version of the work. =Monument to Armand Dayot= This 1937 Boucher work in Paimpol was another bronze confiscated and melted down in 1941. The inscription on the pedestal reads Jean-Julien Lemordant and \\"les Bleus de Bretagne\\" decided to honour Dayot who was born in Paimpol. After the war a replacement bust was erected but in stone not bronze. =Monument to Charles Baratoux= Boucher executed the bronze bust for this 1904 monument which is located in Saint-Brieuc. Baratoux had served as Saint Brieuc's mayor. In 1942 the bronze was requisitioned and melted down. In 1949 Elie Le Goff executed a replacement bust. =Monument to Edouard Le Mounier= The tomb of Edouard Le Mounier This monument was dedicated to the French aviator who died in 1918. It marks Le Mounier's tomb in the Cimeti√®re Saint-Michel in Saint- Brieuc. Boucher's bust of Le Mounier sits on a column of pink marble and by this column is the sculpture a veiled woman in mourning, an allegory for France. She clasps a wounded bird in her arms. Bust of the Comtesse de S√©gur Bust of the comtesse de S√©gur This Boucher bust of the writer and Russian-born Countess dates to 1920 and can be seen in Paris' Jardin du Luxembourg. =Bust of Eug√®ne Biraud= Biraud had set up the first cooperative milk factory in Brittany and Boucher was commissioned in 1932 to execute this bronze bust which stands in Surg√®res' avenue de la Gare. =Statue of Serpollet= Boucher's sculpture was unveiled in 1909. L√©on Serpollet was a French industrialist and maker of steam automobiles under the \\"Gardner-Serpollet\\" brand. He also designed steam trams. Statue of French industrialist L√©on Serpollet =Monument √† la Victoire et aux Soldats de Verdun= Boucher's sculpture of a French warrior on the \\"Monument √† la Victoire et aux Soldats de Verdun\\" This monument celebrating the victory at Verdun and the soldiers who fought there throughout 1914-1918 stands in Verdun's place de la Lib√©ration. Boucher worked on the monument with the architect L√©on Chesnay. Building started in 1926. This monument is of huge dimensions and stands at the top of a 73 step staircase joining the rue Mazes with the place de la Liberation. Boucher's sculpture of a French warrior stands at the top of a pyramid shaped tower leaning on a massive sword and looking out towards the Verdun battlefields to the east. At the foot of the tower is a crypt into whose niches, records (les Livres d'Or) of the names of the French and American soldiers who fought on the Meuse were placed, although these records are now held in Verdun's mairie. Boucher had fought at Verdun and joining the Army as a sergeant he had been promoted to lieutenant and was awarded the croix de guerre. The inauguration took place on 23 June 1929 as part of various ceremonies in that year to mark the \\"renaissance\\" of Verdun after ten years of reconstruction. The ceremony was performed before a huge crowd with Gaston Doumergue, Raymond Poincar√© and Marshal Philippe P√©tain presiding. This monument is of enormous importance to the French nation with ceremonies organised by the \\"Comit√© de la Voie sacr√©e\\" and the \\"la Voie de la Libert√©\\" and a torch lit procession each year on the 11 November from the flame of the Arc de Triomphe's tomb of the unknown soldier is taken to Verdun and relights the flame in the monument's crypt and other torches are taken to various war memorials throughout France (known as the \\"Flamme du Souvenir\\"). Below is a photograph of the plaque on the monument's base. On each side of the Boucher's sculpture are 152.4 mm Russian canons. =Study of Fra Angelico= Boucher executed the Fra Angelico sculpture in around 1913 and the Mus√©e d'Orsay hold a version in marble. The founder Valsuani carried out various castings in bronze and Rudier did a bronze casting just of the head. Boucher won the Houllevigne prize with this work. =Monument to Mar√©chal Galli√©ni= Monument to Mar√©chal Galli√©ni This 1926 bronze sculpture by Boucher is located in Paris' Place Vauban. The figure of Galli√©ni stands on a Euville stone pedestal and is supported by four caryatids which are allegories for the major phases of Galli√©ni's life- The Sudan where he started his career, Tonkin where he fought Chinese rebels, Madagascar where he served as Governor and Paris which he helped defend in 1914. Originally the monument was erected on the esplanade des Invalides. The inscription on the pedestal reads It was in 1920 that a committee was formed to organise a monument to Galli√©ni and a subscription was organised. The initial commission went to the sculptor B√©net but his sculpture was considered as too modest for Paris and his work was erected in Trilbardour in 1924 facing the site of the Battle of the Ourcq. Boucher was now commissioned to produce a Galli√©ni sculpture and much thought then went into finding a suitable location, the Esplanade des Invalides being chosen and finally when the existing location was chosen to be the site of the 1937 Exposition internationale, the monument was moved to the place Vauban. =Monument to √âmile Fayolle= √âmile Fayolle Also in the place Vauban is the monument to another \\"Mar√©chal\\" of France who distinguished himself in the 1914-1918 war; √âmile Fayolle. Boucher carried out the sculpture in 1935. We have the figure of Fayolle in bronze and standing on a stone pedestal around which stand four soldiers. =Barentin= The Mairie of Barentin holds several fragments of the monument \\"Union de la Bretagne √† La France\\" these being \\"T√™te d'homme\\",\\" t√™te de chevalier\\",\\"T√™te de Charles VIII\\", \\"T√™te de femme\\", \\"T√™te de Duguesclin\\", \\"T√™te de rennaise\\" and \\"T√™te de Jean Janvier\\" =Bust of Georges Lecompte= This can be seen in M√¢con's Mus√©e des Ursulines. =Bust of Michel Colombe= This bronze Boucher work can be seen in Tours' mairie. =Mayenne memorial covering all the wars of the 20th century= Inaugurated on 11 November 1937, this monument, with sculpture by Boucher, was given to Mayenne by the Minist√®re de l‚ÄôEducation Nationale and replaced the old war memorial which was moved to the Mayenne cemetery. The work was entitled \\"√Ä Condorcet\\". A semi-circular wall at the rear of the sculpture carries the names of those killed in all the wars of the 20th Century- 304 in the 1914-1918 war, 24 in the 1939-1945 war, 9 civilian casualties of 1944, 10 in the Indochinese war, 1 in the Korean war and 6 in North Africa. The inscription reads =Saint Cyr War Memorial= This memorial in the Cour Wagram was dedicated to the pupils of the military school Ecole Sp√©ciale Militaire de Saint-Cyr who lost their lives in the 1914-1918 war. It was erected in 1922. The monument was damaged during the 1939-1945 war but the damage was subsequently repaired. Boucher chose the following to be inscribed on the monument The inauguration on 22 May 1922 was conducted by Alexandre Millerand in the presence of Franchet d'Esperey, Ferdinand Foch and P√©tain. =√âcole Nationale des Beaux-Arts War Memorial= This memorial stands in the school's \\"Cour du m√ªrier\\" and Boucher sculpted the figure of a soldier. The memorial inscribed \\" A nos morts victorieux\\" lists all the students and staff of the Beaux-Arts who gave their lives for France in 1914-1918. Boucher's sculpture of the soldier but in limestone was used for the Vitr√© war memorial and a bronze version was used for the Saint-Pierre war memorial in R√©union. The plaster model for the work appeared at the 1921 Salon and this can be seen in Paris' Mus√©e de l'Arc de Triomphe. The bust only was shown at the Salon de la Soci√©t√© des Artistes in 1932 and the Rennes Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts hold a bronze version. We must remember that not only had Boucher been a pupil at the Beaux-Arts but had also on 18 September 1919 become professor and head of the sculptural arm of the school, replacing Antonin Merci√©. =Vitr√© War Memorial= The Vitr√©, Ille-et-Vilaine war memorial stands in the place du Ch√¢teau and involves a granite sculpture by Boucher of a soldier. The monument was inaugurated on the 22 May 1921. Boucher depicts a soldier in the trenches leaning on his rifle and lists the names of the 318 men of Vitr√© who gave their lives in the 1914-1918 war. Boucher had seen service in the Vitr√© infantry in his first spell of military service. =Monument to Fran√ßois Marie Luzel= This 1906 sculpture can be seen in Plouaret's Place de l'√âglise. Luzel was a Breton poet often known by his Breton name Fa√±ch an Uhel. Boucher has created a bust of Luzel on top of three books. Luzel had been born in Plouaret on 6 June 1821. The monument was erected on the initiative of the Bleus de Bretagne. =\\"Monument aux volontaires am√©ricains\\"= Boucher's \\"Monument aux volontaires am√©ricains\\" This 1923 monument can be seen in Paris' Place des √âtats-Unis / Place de l'Amiral de Grasse and is a memorial to all American volunteers. Boucher sculpted a soldier in bronze who stands on a plinth and below two soldiers shake hands before an allegorical figure of Victory. The main inscription reads The monument was dedicated on 4 July 1923 by Raymond Poincar√© and honours those Americans who had volunteered to fight in World War I in the service of France. Boucher had used a photograph of the soldier and poet, Alan Seeger, as his inspiration, and Seeger's name can be found on the back of the plinth among those of twenty-three others who had fallen in the ranks of the French Foreign Legion. Also, on either side of the base of the statue, are two excerpts from Seeger's \\"Ode in Memory of the American Volunteers Fallen for France\\", a poem written shortly before his death on 4 July 1916. Seeger intended that his words should be read in Paris on 30 May of that year, at an observance of the American holiday, Decoration Day (later known as Memorial Day): > They did not pursue worldly rewards; they wanted nothing more than to live > without regret, brothers pledged to the honor implicit in living one's own > life and dying one's own death. Hail, brothers! Goodbye to you, the exalted > dead! To you, we owe two debts of gratitude forever: the glory of having > died for France, and the homage due to you in our memories. =Monument to Victor Hugo= Bronze cast of Victor Hugo sculpture. A gift from Rennes to Raymond Poincar√©. Now in the Mus√©e barrois. Boucher depicts Victor Hugo as an exile standing in a storm on the rocks of Guernsey and facing the sea. The King of Portugal had commissioned Boucher to execute the sculpture for Lisbon but in 1908 political disturbances in Portugal resulted in the order being cancelled. Boucher then decided to exhibit the piece at the 1908 Salon des Artistes fran√ßais and it was well received and, working through the \\"Soci√©t√© Victor Hugo\\", a deal was done to have the work erected in Guernsey. Initially carved in granite from the plaster model, a marble version was finally erected in Candie Garden, Saint-Pierre-Port, Guernesey. After the war Boucher made several reduced versions of the work and it was cast in bronze by Valsuani in various sizes. A bronze version of the sculpture was shown at the 1931 Salon des Artistes fran√ßais which then stood in front of the Panth√©on in 1935 before it was despatched to Thionville. The Mus√©e Victor Hugo hold a bronze reduction of the work, a plaster \\" T√™te de Victor Hugo\\" and a bronze mask of Hugo. The Mus√©e de Bar-le-Duc also hold a statuette of Hugo by Boucher. This was given as a gift to Poincar√© by the city of Rennes in 1914 and given to the Bar-le-Duc museum by Madame Poincar√© in 1936. =Combourg War Memorial= Boucher worked on the Combourg War Memorial in 1919 and sculpted a soldier and a woman in mourning. The monument also lists the names of the men remembered and the names of some of the war's battles- Verdun, La Marne, L'Yser and Champagne. =Monument to Yves Guyot= This monument stands in Dinan and honours the French politician, journalist and economist. It was cast in bronze by Alexis Rudier. =Monument to Ludovic Trarieux= Monument to Ludovic Trarieux Boucher completed this work, which stands in Paris' square Denfert-Rochereau, in 1907. There was a bronze bust at the top of the memorial to Ludovic Trarieux, but this was confiscated and melted down in 1942. The figures Boucher sculpted were allegories for work and justice and he also created the figure of a widow and orphan. Miscellaneous =Works by Boucher in H√©d√©= One of Boucher's works on display in H√©d√© Boucher lived at one time in H√©d√© and many of his works are on public display there. There is a square in H√©d√© that bears Boucher's name and he sculpted the head of Christ for the local church and the head of a soldier for the H√©d√© war memorial. photographs of some of Boucher's H√©d√© sculptures are shown in the gallery below. =Sculptures on public display in Cesson-S√©vign√©= Cesson-S√©vign√© has a large collection of sculpture by Boucher, who was of course born there. A sculpture park extends from the Hotel de Ville, and a large statue commemorating Camille Desmoulins' call for the Bastille to be stormed on 13 July 1789, occupies a nearby junction. Other sculptures are present in the Centre Culturel, which also hosts a rolling program of exhibitions and other events. =Bust of Anatole Le Braz= Anatole Le Braz was at one time a teacher at Quimper's College de la Tour d'Auvergne and there is a bronze Boucher bust of Le Braz in front of the college building. =Boucher works in the parc de la Chalotais in Cesson S√©vign√©= Cesson S√©vign√© was Boucher's birthplace and possess many of his works and archival records.

August 24, 1891 in Pleasant Grove, Utah Territory) was a wife of Parley P. Pratt who was one of the original twelve apostles of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. She is also considered by some to have been one of the plural wives of Joseph Smith the founder of the Latter Day Saint movement. Her life paralleled much of the early history of the church. Early life Mary Ann Frost was born in Groton, Vermont and was the daughter of Aaron Frost, a farmer, and his wife Susanna Gray Bennett Frost. When Mary Ann was young, her family moved to Bethel, Maine (then a province of Massachusetts). She married Nathan Stearns, her first husband, on April 1, 1832. She gave birth to her first child, Mary Ann Stearns, on April 6, 1833. Nathan Stearns died on August 25 of the same year leaving Mary Ann a widow. In the late summer of 1835 Brigham Young, and a number of other Mormons came to Bethel, Maine. Mary Ann and her sister, Olive Grey Frost ‚Äì who would later marry both Joseph Smith and, after Smith's death, Brigham Young ‚Äì converted to the Mormon faith and were baptized by Mormon Apostle David W. Patten. Marriage to Parley P. Pratt In late 1836 Mary Ann and her sister moved to Kirtland, Ohio, where the church gathered and built its first temple. While in Kirtland, she met the recently widowed Parley P. Pratt, one of the original twelve apostles of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. They were married in Kirtland on May 9, 1837. In July 1837 Parley P. Pratt left on a mission trip to New York City. During this trip Pratt published the second edition of the Book of Mormon and his book A Voice of Warning defending the Mormon faith. In April 1838, as a result of the Mormons being expelled from Ohio, Pratt and Mary Ann moved to the town of Far West in Caldwell County, Missouri. Their first child, Nathan Pratt, was born there on August 31, 1838. Pratt participated in the Battle of Crooked River, near Ray County, Missouri on 25 October 1838. He was apprehended after the battle and was jailed at Richmond in Ray County and later in Columbia in Boone County from late 1838. In December Mary Ann joined her husband in jail but departed on March 17, 1839 to join other Mormons in Far West, Missouri before moving to Quincy, Illinois. On July 4, 1839 Pratt escaped from jail and reunited with Mary Ann and his children at Quincy on July 11. In August 29, 1839, Mary Ann and Pratt left for New York City before going to England on a mission trip. Pratt sailed from New York on March 9, 1840 and arrived in Liverpool. Mary returned to her parents in Maine for a few months and arrived in Manchester, England in mid-October, 1840. Their daughter Olivia Pratt was born in Manchester, England on June 2, 1841. They left England with 250 converts on October 29, 1842 and arrived in Nauvoo, Illinois, the new headquarters of the church, in April 1843. Nauvoo It is supposed by some that Mary Ann became a plural wife of Joseph Smith in 1843. However, there is no documentary evidence to support this hypothesis. In the summer of 1843, Mary Ann's sister, Olive Grey Frost (1816‚Äì1845), was married to Joseph Smith. On July 24, 1844, Pratt married Elizabeth Brotherton as Pratt's first plural wife. Pratt would marry four more women later in the same year. All of these marriages were without Mary Ann's knowledge or consent. On November 7, 1844 Mary Ann's sister Olive was married to Brigham Young as his 16th wife. She died in Nauvoo on October 6, 1845. On December 10, 1845, Mary Ann, along with Parley P. Pratt and his brother Orson Pratt, received the temple endowment in the Nauvoo Temple. Sometime after January 1, 1846 Mary Ann found out about Pratt's polygamous marriages, which dated back to 1844. The couple estranged after this. On February 6, 1846, following the advice of Brigham Young, Mary Ann was sealed, by Apostle Heber C. Kimball, to Pratt for time and was sealed to Joseph Smith for eternity in the Nauvoo Temple. (Note that Smith had been dead for a year and a half at that time.) On February 13, 1846, Mary Ann, Parley and children left Nauvoo with the bulk of the Mormons living there. Mary Ann returned one week later to stay with her parents, who were still in Nauvoo but planned to leave when work on the Temple was complete. On September 18, 1846 Mary Ann left Nauvoo with the last group of Mormons and arrived, in June 1847, at Winter Quarters, Nebraska. Upon rejoining Parley she told him she is returning to Maine with the children. Parley left on a mission trip in late 1847. In March 1848 Mary received money from Parley and returned to Maine. Later life After living in Bethel for about three years, Mary Ann left on March 10, 1851 and stayed for some time in St. Louis, Missouri and Kanesville, Iowa. She and her children left Kanesville on June 10, 1852 and arrived in Salt Lake City, Utah with the Harmon Cutler Company on September 10, 1852. Pratt returned from an eighteen-month mission trip to California and Chile on October 18. Mary Ann did not reunite with him but allowed their children to visit him. On March 5, 1853 she was granted a divorce from Parley P. Pratt by Brigham Young. Mary Ann lived the rest of her life in Pleasant Grove, Utah. She never remarried. She worked as a midwife and is reputed to have delivered hundreds of children without losing a single one. In 1880 Mary Ann authored an article in the Salt Lake City magazine Woman's Exponent entitled \\"Give to those Rights to Whom Rights Belong\\", which advocated that women be given more legal and political rights. Mary Ann died in Pleasant Grove in 1891, at the age of 83. She was buried in the Pleasant Grove City Cemetery. Children Mary Ann Frost Stearns Pratt was the mother of five children by her two husbands. Two of the children died while young.

It is located on the Mall Road, Solan, Himachal Pradesh, India. The school was founded in 1958 and is affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education, New Delhi since 1962. The school is an English Medium, Co-Educational day school. The motto of the school is \\"Gaudium In Veritate\\" which means \\"Joy In Truth\\". St. Luke's is about an hour drive from Shimla and two hours from Chandigarh. The nearest railway station is Solan. The alumni of St. Luke's are known as Ex-Lukites. St. Luke's is believed to be the oldest school of Solan. The school admits students from K.G. to XII. The session starts from mid February and ends in December.  History  The school had its beginning with only 8 students in 1955 in Subathu, a cantonment area. It was named as Ephiphany School with Rev. Father Christanand as its founder. In 1957, the school was moved to Solan and housed in a rented building known as Badru-Khan House. St. Luke's is named after one of the Gospel writers St. Luke. In 1962 the school was granted permanent recognition due to the strenuous efforts of Rev. Fr. Emmanuel, who rendered his services to the school till 1973. After Fr. Emmanuel left, Fr. Persy took over as Manager cum Principal for a short duration. Fr. S.J.F. More joined as Manager cum Principal. Fr. More with his vast and solid experience of working in many reputed schools planned a spacious school building. However the project could not be materialized due to some financial constraints. Fr. More left for Bhopal in 1979. In 1980, the vacuum left by Fr. More was temporarily filled by Dr. Fr. M.M. Mascarenhas who was called from Pune. He left St. Luke's in 1981. At that time Mr. Darryl Michael who was the headmaster of the school took over as the Principal and Fr. C.J. Alvares from Mangalore took over the charge as Manager of the school. It was under the able guidance of Fr. Alvares and unstinting work of Mr. Michael that the new school building was blessed by Rt. Rev. Dr. G.B. Rego on 14 June 1986. It was in 1992 that the Bishop of Simla Chandigarh Diocese invited the Bethany Sisters to run the school after Mrs. Agatha Thomas who was the principal left the school. Sister Marceline with 3 other sisters took over the charge as Principal. Sr. Wilberta who took over the charge from Sr. Marceline worked tirelessly to upgrade the school to +2 level. She was the master mind to make St. Luke's the Accredited Center for Open School. The school currently has 2000 students on roll. A separate building for Primary students was inaugurated by Rt. Rev. Dr. Gerald John Mathias. In 1997 the school was upgraded to +2 level.

In general, the heat transfer between surfaces is governed by temperature, surface emissivity properties and the geometry of the surfaces. The relation for heat transfer can be written as an integral equation with boundary conditions based upon surface conditions. Kernel functions can be useful in approximating and solving this integral equation.  Governing equation  The radiative heat exchange depends on the local surface temperature of the enclosure and the properties of the surfaces, but does not depend upon the media. Because media neither absorb, emit, nor scatter radiation. Governing equation of heat transfer between two surface Ai and Aj : q(r_i) = \\\\int_{\\\\lambda=0}^\\\\infty \\\\int_{\\\\psi_i=0}^{2\\\\pi} \\\\int_{\\\\theta_i=0}^\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2} \\\\varepsilon_{\\\\lambda,i} (\\\\lambda,\\\\psi_i,\\\\theta_i,r_i) I_{b\\\\lambda,i}(\\\\cos\\\\theta_i\\\\sin\\\\theta_i)\\\\,d\\\\theta_i\\\\,d\\\\psi_i\\\\,d\\\\lambda - \\\\sum_{j=1}^N \\\\int_{\\\\lambda=0}^\\\\infty \\\\rho_{\\\\lambda,i}(\\\\lambda,\\\\psi_{r,j},\\\\theta_{r,j},\\\\psi_j,\\\\theta_j,r_i) I_{\\\\lambda,k}(\\\\lambda,\\\\psi_k,\\\\theta_k,r_i) \\\\frac{\\\\cos\\\\theta_j\\\\cos\\\\theta_k}{r_k-r_j^2} \\\\, dA_k where : \\\\lambda = wavelength of radiation rays, : I = radiation intensity, : \\\\varepsilon = emissivity, : r = reflectivity, : \\\\theta = angle between the normal of the surface and radiation exchange direction, and : \\\\psi = azimuthal angle If the surface of the enclosure is approximated as gray and diffuse surface, and so the above equation can be written as after the analytical procedure : q(r) + \\\\varepsilon(r)E_b = \\\\varepsilon(r)\\\\oint K(r,r') \\\\left[ E_b(r')+1-\\\\frac{\\\\varepsilon(r')}{\\\\varepsilon(r)}d\\\\Gamma(r')\\\\right] where E_b is the black body emissive power which is given as the function of temperature of the black body : E_b(r) = \\\\sigma T^4(r)\\\\, where \\\\sigma is the Stefan‚ÄìBoltzmann constant. Kernel function Kernel functions provide a way to manipulate data as though it were projected into a higher dimensional space, by operating on it in its original space. So that data in higher- dimensional space become more easily separable. Kernel function is also used in integral equation for surface radiation exchanges. Kernel function relates to both the geometry of the enclosure and its surface properties. Kernel function depends on geometry of the body. In above equation K(r,r‚Ä≤) is the kernel function for the integral, which for 3-D problems takes the following form : K(r,r') = -\\\\frac{n(r-r')n'(r-r')}{\\\\pir-r'^4} F = \\\\frac{\\\\cos\\\\theta_r\\\\cos\\\\theta_r'}{\\\\pir-r'^4} F where F assumes a value of one when the surface element I sees the surface element J, otherwise it is zero if the ray is blocked and Œ∏r is the angle at point r, and Œ∏r‚Ä≤ at point r‚Ä≤. The parameter F depends on the geometric configuration of the body, so the kernel function highly irregular for a geometrically complex enclosure. Kernel equation for 2-D and axisymmetric geometry For 2-D and axisymmetric configurations, the kernel function can be analytically integrated along the z or Œ∏ direction. The integration of the kernel function is : K(r,r') = - \\\\int\\\\int\\\\ F\\\\frac{n(r-r')n'(r-r')}{\\\\pir-r'^4}\\\\, dz'\\\\, dz = \\\\frac{n(r-r')n'(r-r')}{\\\\pir-r'^4} F Here n denotes the unit normal of element I at the azimuth angle œï‚Ä≤ being zero, and n‚Ä≤ refers to the unit normal of element J with any azimuth angle œï‚Ä≤. The mathematical expressions for n and n‚Ä≤ are as follows- : n = ( \\\\cos\\\\theta,0,\\\\sin\\\\theta) : n' = (\\\\cos\\\\theta'\\\\sin\\\\phi', \\\\cos\\\\theta'\\\\sin\\\\phi', \\\\sin\\\\theta') Substituting these terms into equation, the kernel function is rearranged in terms of the azimuth angle œï'- : K(\\\\phi') = \\\\frac{(c'+d\\\\cos\\\\phi') (c+d\\\\cos\\\\phi')}{\\\\pi(c+d\\\\cos\\\\phi')^2} F where c = r_i^2+r_j^2+Z_j^2 : d = -2r_ir_j : c' = Z_j\\\\sin\\\\theta - r_i\\\\cos\\\\theta : d'= r_j\\\\cos\\\\theta : c=Z_j\\\\sin\\\\theta'+r_j\\\\cos\\\\theta' : d=-r_i\\\\cos\\\\theta' Relation : \\\\frac{d\\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\arctan\\\\left(\\\\sqrt\\\\frac{c-d}{c+d} \\\\tan\\\\frac{\\\\phi}{2}\\\\right)\\\\right\\\\\\\\}}{dx} = \\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{c^2-d^2}}{2(c+d\\\\cos\\\\phi)} holds for this particular case The final expression for the kernel function is : \\\\bar k(\\\\phi) = 2\\\\int\\\\limits_0^\\\\phi k(\\\\phi') \\\\, d\\\\phi' : \\\\bar k(\\\\phi) = -\\\\frac{2}{\\\\pi} \\\\left[A\\\\phi+b\\\\arctan\\\\left(\\\\sqrt\\\\frac{c-d}{c+d} \\\\tan\\\\frac{\\\\phi}{2}\\\\right)+C\\\\frac{\\\\sin\\\\phi}{c+d\\\\cos\\\\phi}\\\\right] where A=\\\\frac{d'd}{d^2} : B=2\\\\frac{(c^2-d^2)(d'f+ed)+cdef}{d(c^2-d^2)\\\\sqrt{c^2-d^2}} : C=\\\\frac{def}{d^2-c^2} : e=\\\\frac{dc'-cd'}{d} : f=\\\\frac{dc-cd}{d}  References  * Robert Siegel, Thermal Radiation Heat Transfer, Fourth Edition * Ben Q.

The type and only known species is A. hutchisoni. This type specimen consists only of a broken , but it is despite this fragmentary nature very significant. It constitutes the oldest known lambeosaur remains from North America, as well as the only known lambeosaur species from the Wahweap Formation, of which it pertains to the Upper Member. Among its relatives, it seems to be particularly similar to Parasaurolophus, rather than animals like Lambeosaurus. It would have lived in a wet environment, bordering on the sea but with a more arid season during some times of the year. This environment would have been shared with a diverse variety of fish and turtles, as well as other dinosaurs like ceratopsids and tyrannosaurids. Discovery and naming Grand Staircase A fossil bearing locality near Death Ridge in Kane County, Utah was first reported in 1973 by H.D. Zeller; this locality is part of the Wahweap Formation, itself part of the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument. The information reported by Zeller would be used by John Howard Hutchison and colleagues to return there to collect fossils in 1999. Among these was the maxilla (a jawbone) of a lambeosaurine hadrosaur This maxilla was first reported in 2013, in a paper by Terry Gates and colleagues. It was noted as the only known lambeosaur material from the formation (reported as being from the Upper Member), and the oldest known lambeosaur material in North America. They suggested the unique morphology indicated it was a new taxon, but refrained from naming it. Later, the specimen was described and named in a 2014 study, again led by Terry Gates, published as part of the book Hadrosaurs. The new species was given the name Adelolophus hutchisoni. The holotype is UCPM 152028, an incomplete right with both ends broken off. The generic name is derived from Greek Œ¥Œ∑Œªœåœâ, \\"unknown\\" and ŒªœåœÜŒ∑, \\"crest\\", referring to the anatomy of the species' presumed crest being unknown. The specific name is a reference to Hutchison, who discovered the specimen. The study noted that the exact locality of the specimen was unknown, making its referral to the Upper Member tentative, merely surmised by the rock matrix that had surrounded the specimen. The type locality would be clarified by a 2016 study by Hutchison and Patricia A. Holroyd, confirming it came from the lower end of the Upper Member. It was suggested that the locality may bridge the gap (in time) between the older Middle Member and younger Upper Member of the formation. Fossils of other animals from the same locality were reported in the paper. Among these were fragmentary hadrosaur l specimens, pertaining to various ages, including one very large individual. While the possibility was noted these could belong to Adelolophus, a referral is impossible to confirm. Description Skull of Parasaurolophus, a similar hadrosaur and presumed relative Several unique morphological traits diagnose Adelolophus as a distinct genus, despite its fragmentary nature. The anatomy of the only known bone, the (part of the upper jaw, bearing teeth), is identifiable as that of a lambeosaur (a type of dinosaur which possessed large, hollow head crests) based on features such as its triangular shape. Among its relatives, its anatomy is more similar to that of parasaurolophins (tube-headed lambeosaurs) rather than lambeosaurins (casque headed lambeosaurs), two closely related types of lambeosaurine. It differs most prominently from other taxa in its very tall medial wall (a ridge situated along the middle, upper edge of the bone), both on the front and back end of the bone. By comparison, lambeosaurins possess a particularly short medial wall, with that of Parasaurolophus showing an intermediate condition between the two. The dorsal process, another region of the bone, is again more similar to that of parasaurolophins, being relatively rounded rather than sharply tapering one as in lambeosaurins. The region where the maxilla articulates with the bone seems to indicate a parasaurolophin-like jugal as well, though this bone itself was not preserved. Near the back end of the maxilla, another distinguishing trait of Adelolophus is its large, elevated palatine process (a triangular feature of the bone); in other lambeosaurs, it is smaller and lower on the maxilla. The shape of the bottom edge of the bone, along the toothrow, is drastically different from other North American relatives, including Parasaurolophus. Running from the jugal articulation to the palatine process, Adelolophus possesses a unique, thickened ridge, also unique among lambeosaurs. Palaeoenvironment Skull of the tyrannosaurid Lythronax Adelolophus pertains to the Upper Member of the Wahweap Formation, which is dated to the early Campanian age. The geology of the formation is characterized by mudstone and sandstone. The environment of the Upper Member was tidal, characterized by meandering rivers. Compared to the lower members, the Upper Member had a more marine influence, caused by the encroaching Western Interior Seaway. This created an estuarine environment with brackish water. Despite the generally wet climate, a dry season would have been present. The fossil remains of numerous other animals from the locality the holotype was found paint a picture of what animals Adelolophus would have lived alongside. Fish present include indeterminate sturgeon and gar specimens, as well as better remains of the large bowfin fish Melvius. Turtles of the extinct baenid family are abundant at the site; these include Arvinachelys, Denazinemys, Neurankylus, and additional remains not identifiable to the level of species. Gars, Melvius, and baenid turtles are all common throughout the Wahweap Formation. Nanhsiungchelyid turtle Basilemys and indeterminate trionychid turtle specimens were also reported. Mesosuchian remains have been documented; this is significant, as fossils of the group are rarely found in the formation. Lastly, fragmentary remains of a tyrannosaurid theropod were found at the site. The tyrannosaur Lythronax is known from the Middle Member of the Wahweap Formation, but the remains from the Adelolophus locality are non-diagnostic, so whether they belong to the taxon cannot be determined. Ceratopsid dinosaur Machairoceratops is also from the Upper Member.

The bridge spans the Ossipee River just east of the modern alignment of North Road (Maine State Route 160), which it formerly carried, between the towns of Porter and Parsonsfield. Built in 1876 by the towns, it is a Paddleford truss bridge which has been strengthened with laminated arches. The bridge was closed to traffic in 1960, and is now maintained by the state. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970. Description and history The bridge has two spans, resting on granite block abutments and a central pier. The total length of the bridge is , and it is from the flooring to the peak of the gable roof. The total width is ; the portals have an internal width of and height of . The bridge trusses are from a design by Peter Paddleford, a modification of the more common Long truss. The laminated arches, a 20th- century addition, consist of 21 layers of planking bolted together, to which the King posts of the truss have also been fastened. The sides of the bridge are sheathed in vertical boarding to two-thirds of the height. The roof is made of cedar shingles. The first bridge to join the small towns of Porter and Parsonsfield at this site was completed in 1800. The site is one where the Ossipee River flows slowly, but accelerates just downstream, as it heads toward Kezar Falls. A second bridge was built in 1808, and a third in 1858. Construction of the third bridge inaugurated a dispute between the towns over how much of the bridge each town should pay for. Eventually an agreement was reached, but the bad blood between the towns meant that, when this bridge was built in 1876, they could not agree on roofing materials, and the two portions of the bridge were differently shingled. The bridge was closed to vehicular traffic in 1960, when the present alignment of North Road was built, and the state took over the bridge's maintenance in 1967. Around that time, the present roof was built, and the bridge underwent a major restoration.

The group was named after either Ahmad al-Abdo al-Saeed, a Syrian civilian who was killed in the early 2011 protests, or first lieutenant Ahmad al-Abdo, a rebel commander who was killed in action during the war. The group received support from the Friends of Syria Group. Structure and equipment As of 2017, the group claimed to have 2,000 fighters, including 500 defected soldiers and 30 officers from the Syrian Armed Forces. The head of the group is the \\"joint command council\\", led by Captain Ahmed Tamer. Fighters in the group typically operate in groups of 10. Its main equipment are Toyota Land Cruiser and Toyota Hilux gun trucks mounted with various weaponry including autocannons, heavy machine guns, recoilless rifles, and multiple rocket launchers. It also operate at least 1 T-62 and 2 T-55s. The group received BGM-71 TOW missiles as one of the first rebel groups to do so in May 2014 and is also in possession of Chinese HJ-8 and Russian 9M133 Kornet anti-tank missiles paid by Qatar and supplied from Sudan. History The group was involved in the capture of the Brigade 559 and the siege of Dumayr airbase. It primarily operates in the eastern Qalamoun Mountains and northern Damascus countryside regions. In March 2016 the group and the US-backed New Syrian Army captured the al-Tanf border crossing from ISIL in a cross-border raid. On 9 June 2016, the group's leader, Colonel Bakour Salim, who was also the commander of the Damascus Military Council from 2012 to 2013, died from an ISIL suicide bombing after the group advanced and captured several ISIL positions. Later in June, the FMAA and the NSA were hit by airstrikes from 2 Russian Sukhoi Su-34s and participated in the failed 2016 Abu Kamal offensive against ISIL. A new commander, Captain Ahmed Tamer, was appointed on 30 August 2016 after the previous commander was dismissed for alleged corruption. Since 2016, the opposition local council of towns in the eastern Qalamoun Mountains have negotiated a ceasefire agreement with Syrian government forces. As a result, the group abided by it and focused their fighting on ISIL. As part of the Southern Front, the group also abided by a ceasefire in effect since the January 2017 Astana talks. In an interview with the group's commander in February 2017, he announced that the group will support an international attempt at a ceasefire in Syria. In April 2018, along with other rebel groups in the eastern Qalamoun, fighters of the Forces of Martyr Ahmad al-Abdo were evacuated to the Turkish-occupied zone in the northern Aleppo Governorate.

Discovery and naming Through field work by Zhou Zhonghe and Li Yan, the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology at Beijing acquired a pterosaur specimen found at the village of Daohugou near Linglongta. It was prepared by Li Yutong. The specimen is catalogued as IVPP V12537. It is a partial skeleton with soft tissue impressions, compressed on a plate and counterplate. This specimen includes part of the torso and pectoral girdle, the left humerus (upper arm bone), both coracoids, right scapula, the sternal plate, neck vertebrae, back vertebrae, ribs, and the posterior part of the skull and lower jaws. Daohugoupterus was named and described in 2015 by Cheng Xin, Wang Xiaolin, Jiang Shunxing and Alexander Wilhelm Armin Kellner. The type and only known species is Daohugoupterus delicatus. The generic name combines a reference to Daohugou with a Latinised Greek œÄœÑŒµœÅœåŒΩ, pteron, \\"wing\\". The specific name means \\"delicate\\" in Latin, in reference to the gracile build. Description Daohugoupterus is a small pterosaur. The humerus is long. Two distinguishing traits were indicated, which were considered possible autapomorphies: the nasal bones deeply invade the frontal bones, and the sternal plate is broad, being 2.5 times wider than it is long. Classification The short neck vertebrae, presence of cervical ribs, and the form of the humerus with a quadrangular deltopectoral crest indicate that Daohugoupterus was a relatively basal pterosaur, outside of the Pterodactyloidea. It was placed Pterosauria incertae sedis. Paleoecology Daohugoupterus is a member of the Yanliao Biota, which also includes the pterosaurs Jeholopterus and Pterorhynchus; Daohugoupterus is the smallest of the three.

Smart was United States champion in the 440 yd hurdles in 1917 and 1919 and in the long jump in 1919. Biography Smart became an athlete at Lyons Township High School in La Grange, Illinois, leading the school to team titles at the 1915 interscholastic meets of both Illinois (in Class B) and Michigan. He was highly versatile, scoring points in the sprints, hurdles, high jump and long jump; in one 1917 dual meet between Northwestern University (which he then represented) and Indiana he won six individual events. Smart won the 440 yd hurdles at the 1917 Penn Relays, overtaking world record holder Billy Meanix on the final straight, although 2 ft 6 in (76.2 cm) hurdles, rather than the usual 3 ft (91.4 cm) hurdles, were used in that race. Later that year, Smart won his first title at the national championships, defeating both Meanix and the previous year's champion, Walter Hummel; his winning time of 54.8 was only 0.2 seconds off the world record and equaled Hummel's meeting record. In 1918 Smart underwent military officer training at Camp Grant and qualified as a lieutenant; like many other top athletes, he missed that year's national championships due to World War I. Smart returned to competition in 1919, and was favored to regain the national 440 yd hurdles title. He won the event in 55.6, ahead of Meanix; he won a second title in the long jump with a jump of 22 ft in (6.88 m), overtaking his Chicago A.A. clubmate Sherman Landers in the final round. In June 1920 Smart won the 440 yd hurdles in 55.6 at the Midwestern Tryouts, a qualifying meet for the United States Olympic Trials of that year. At the final Trials, however, he only made it past the heats as a fastest loser, and was eliminated in the semi-finals. He was named to the Olympic team, but only as an alternate, and did not get to run at the Olympics; instead, he represented the United States in meets against the national teams of Sweden and France (in Paris) and the British Empire (in London). He won the 400 m/440 yd hurdles in both of these meets. Smart died at his home in Glen Ellyn, Illinois in November 1955. He was survived by wife, two sons and a daughter.

From constructional side it was connection of modified body chasis of Jelcz PR110 and chasis of Ikarus 260. During production, there were no significant changes to the construction of the bus. The bus was created because of crisis and finding thriftiness currencies in Poland, needed for buying buses abroad and because of this M11 was treated as a temporary solution. History =Genesis= MPK Lublin Jelcz M11 in Lublin, Poland in 2009 At the beginning of the 1970s, the authorities of Polish People's Republic decided to upgrade their city transport fleet. For this purpose already in years 1970‚Äì1972 on Warsaw streets it have been started to test such bus models as: Hungarian Ikarus 242, West German Magirus-Deutz M170-S11H, French Berliet PR100, Italian FIAT 420A, British-Danish Leyland Lidrt 12/4 Worldmaster, Spaniard Pegaso 5023, Japanese Hino RC620 and Czechoslovak Karosa SM11. The winner was Berliet PR100. From the beginning this model was considered as temporary because of bigger transportation needs and it was planned to expand it by adding third door. New Jelcz PR110 was 12-meters bus provided with three doors. These vehicles were being made in 50% with parts imported from France. The crisis of the 1980s meant that Polish People's Republic government didn't have foreign currency to buy parts for these vehicles. Parts imported from abroad for one bus by prices from the beginning of 1984 costed 2000 US dollars. They couldn't be bought in Polish factories. In addition, the WSK Mielec engine factory could produce only up to 1,000 engines per year. Because of this it has been decided to start cooperation with Hungarian People's Republic. Trade agreement between Poland and Hungary signed in Warsaw 24 October 1983 assumed deliveries to Polish cities Ikarus 260 busesIkarus 280s were delivered to Poland from 1982. and Csepel 260.88 chasis (which were used inter alia in Ikarus 260 buses). In return, the Hungarian side was receiving Polish Fiat 125p's i 126p and Star trucks. According to the agreement Hungarian People's Republic had to deliver in years 1986‚Äì1990 about 1500 complete chasis with driving system. Even then, it was found that Jelcz M11's (initially named Jelcz M110) were supposed to be a temporary solution and their production should be finished at the moment of appearance Jelcz M120's, produced by Polish industry at all. Problems with exploitation and failure rate of Jelcz M11's accelerated working on new models. =Production= New Jelcz M11 bus was based on Csepel chasis plate with the engine. Body was taken after little modifications from Jelcz PR110. First prototype was made in 1983. During tests in Budapest scientists from the local polytechnic did computer endurance tests of structural elements. Serial production of Jelcz M11's began in 1984. New buses were being produced parallelly with Jelcz PR110's, and till 1986 even with Jelcz 043. In 1990 production of M11 has been finished; about 2600 buses had been produced. =Exploitation= KM G≈Çog√≥w Jelcz M11 rear in G≈Çog√≥w, Poland in June 2005 Jelcz M11's were placed to all city transport operators (every except Warsaw) from country distribution. To the Warsaw Jelcz M11's went in 90. years, where they were being mainly exploitated by private operators. =Modernization= In 1994 there have been created plans to adjust city buses to the needs of people with physical disabilities. For this purpose, expertise has been done, which concluded that the buses Jelcz M11, as well as based on the same floor plate Ikarus 260s/280s, are not suitable for fitting elevators. Where as building folding ramps was excluded because of too high floor plate. Because of this conception of building new buses have been created, even though partly low-floor, instead try to modernise current buses like western companies. Construction During the 6-year production period there were no important changes in the model. =Undercarriage= Ikarus 260 Jelcz M11's were equipped with Hungarian chassis Csepel 260.88. The same chassis plates were being used in Ikarus 260 buses. The vehicles were characterized by high flat floor. Chassis plate was the reason of most defects of Jelcz M11 but it allowed the exchange of engine parts between Jelcz M11 and Ikarus 260s and 280s.  Drivetrain  The bus was powered by six-cylinder in-line diesel engine RABA-MAN D2156HMU6 of a capacity 10350 cm¬≥ and maximum power of 193 HP. The drive unit allowed achieve a maximum speed of 82 km/h. It was lower value than in Ikarus 260, Jelcz was supposed to be ‚Äì contrary to the Hungarian bus ‚Äì typical urban vehicle. Engine was located horizontally in the middle part of floor plate. Power was transferred by 5-speed manual gearbox typu Csepel ASH 75.2. From the gearbox the power of engine was transferred by the driveshaft (Gewes production). Driveshaft drove the rear axle of the company Raba. In the bus was used rear axle RABA 118, newer than in Ikarus 260.

On May 10, 1824, the Burmese under General Maha Bandula launched an invasion of Chittagong from Arakan as the southern part of a two-pronged attack aimed at Calcutta. They offered to end the invasion if the British were to hand over some Arakanese rebels that had taken refuge in the Bengal Presidency. The British commander at Ramu, Captain Noton (also spelled Cotton in some sources), rejected the offer, and the Burmese detachment under Lord Myawaddy Mingyi U Sa attacked. After three days of fighting the British troops, a mixed force with a total strength of several hundred men, was routed and forced from Ramu on May 17. The British losses in killed, wounded and missing amounted to more than half the strength of the garrison. The Burmese however failed to exploit their advantage, and Maha Bandula's army would withdrew to counter the British occupation of Rangoon.  Campaign background  In 1824, the Burmese armies marched into the Bengal Presidency to force the British into surrendering Arakanese rebels taking shelter. Maha Bandula, was supported by twelve of the Burmese best divisions, including one under his personal command, all totaling 10,000 men and 500 horses. Bandula's plan was to attack the British on two fronts: Chittagong from Arakan in the southeast, and Sylhet from Cachar and Jaintia in the north. Bandula personally commanded the Arakan theatre while Thado Thiri Maha Uzana commanded Cachar and Jaintia theater. British forces in Chittagong under Colonel Shapland consists of around 3,000 men from 13th Bengal Native infantry, 5 companies of the 2nd battalion 20th Native infantry, 1st battalion of the 23rd Native Infantry and a local corps of Arakanese levies. Early in the war, British forces were pushed back by the battle-hardened Burmese due to the difficulties of fighting in the jungles of Manipur and Assam. While Bandula remained in Arakan, a 4,000 strong Burmese force under the Lord Myawaddy, advanced into Chittagong. According to G.P. Ramachandra, the Burmese made several efforts to make peaceful contact. According to a British witness: > \\"Captain Noton [the British commander] communicated with two horsemen who > approached the opposite bank of the river, who disavowed any hostile > intention of the Burmese towards us, but desired only that some rebellious > subjects under our protection should be delivered up to them offering at the > same time to explain further the views of the Burmese, provided Captain > Noton would allow them to cross the river with a guard of 100 horsemen and > guarantee the safety of that party.\\" Noton did not trust the Burmese and rejected the offer. It appears that the British were the first to open fire: \\"On the evening of the 14th, the enemy's whole force is concentrated on the opposite bank of the river apparently with the intention of crossing at a favourable opportunity [some units] were detached for the purpose of annoying the enemy on their Encampment, and preventing them crossing the river, should they attempt it. Several rounds of grape and shrapnel were fired from the nine-pounders with effect, and appeared to create much confusion.\\" The Burmese then proceeded to attack the British force occupying Ratnapallang, fourteen miles south of Ramu. Captain Noton, commanding from Ramu, decided to attack the Burmese position, leaving the convalescents of the 1/23rd, the whole of the Provincials, and around a hundred levy, he marched out of Ramu on the evening of the 11th May with the rest of his detachment, including the two 6-pounder guns. The British found the Burmese occupying the hills overlooking the road on the east side and built a stockade at Ratnapallang. While Captain Noton was able to advance past these hills towards the stockade, they experienced difficulty in bringing up the guns due to the inexperience of the mahouts who drove the elephants. The British exchanged fire all night around the stockade but were forced to withdraw in the morning due to the ammunition coolies deserting and the guns thus being unserviceable. Noton withdrew to back to Ramu, with a loss of seven missing and eleven wounded. He was reinforced joined by three companies of the 2nd battalion of the 20th Bengal Native Infantry.  Forces  The British forces consisted of around 350 regulars: five companies from the 1st Battalion of the 23rd Bengal Native Infantry, three companies from the 2nd Battalion, 20th Bengal Native Infantry, 250 men from the Chittagong Provincial Battalion and about 400 Maghs (Arakanese) Levies. Noton also had under his command two 6-pounder guns. The Burmese army left the capital with 4,000 and gathered levies along the way gathering up to a total of around 10,000 by the time they reach Arakan. The British estimated at least 10,000 infantry and 200 cavalrymen at Ramu, however, actual numbers are likely lower as the Burmese forces split into several columns under Myawaddy Mingyi U Sa, Uzana and Maha Bandula himself. Furthermore, the British regarded much of the intelligence gathered on Burma to be inadequate and unreliable.  Battle  On the 13th morning, Myawaddy's forces had been reinforced and encouraged by their success, advanced from their stockade in Ratnapallang and occupied the hills east of Ramu across the river which flows by the town. Despite the disparity in strength, Noton resolved to hold Ramu, for he was confident that further reinforcements would arrive from Chittagong. During the 14th May, the two 6-pounder guns managed to prevent the Burmese from crossing the river, but on the 15th they managed to cross the stream, and took possession of a tank near British position. The encampment was surrounded by a three-foot levee and was protected on its right flank by the river; some sixty feet right flank was another tank, which was held by a rear was also a tank, held by a strong unit of Provincials. The Burmese infantry made good use of natural cover and despite heavy fire proceeded to occupy the tank in front without difficulties. In the next two days, Burmese entrenched themselves closer and closer to the British lines despite heavy fire. The levies and Provincials at this point were greatly demoralized and were barely prevented from deserting. Captain Noton began to consider withdrawing but he had received information leading him to believe that reinforcements would arrive from Chittagong next day, and chose to hold his ground. Skirmishing continued all night but by the next morning, the Burmese positions had been reinforced and were entrenched within thirty yards of the British pickets at the tank. As the Burmese began to close in, the levies and Provincials fled along with the elephants from the gunnery teams leaving the regulars severely outnumbered and without artillery support. Noton, with only 400 exhausted men attempted to retreat before the Burmese could attack. They managed to maintain order for about half a mile before being finally caught up by the Burmese cavalry who broke and routed the remaining British troops. Wilson describes the closing stage of the battle as: > \\"(A) small body of Horse attached to their force, by whom the men that fell > off from the main body were instantly cut to pieces, filled (our) troops > with an ungovernable panic, which rendered the exertions of their officers > to preserve order unavailing.\\"  Aftermath  = Casualties = The British force suffered around 250 killed, wounded or captured. Among the six European and three Indian officers, only three survived with two being wounded. The six officers were Captains Trueman, Pringles, and Noton himself, Lieutenant Grigg, Ensign Bennet, and Assistant-surgeon Maysmore were killed. Lieutenants Scott and Campbell were wounded while Lieutenant Codrington escaped. The British force at Ramu had been thoroughly destroyed with British prisoners being marched back to Ava. The British considered their operations in the Chittagong frontier \\"unsatisfactory throughout\\" with little knowledge of the terrain, sickness being prevalent, difficulties in logistics and lack of friendly locals. The Burmese losses were unknown but were suspected to suffer at most 200 killed or wounded most of them from the British artillery. The Burmese commander at Ramu, Myawaddy, however, witnessed the firepower of British regulars and would at that point attempt to avoid engaging them in open combat. Myawaddy's column then joined Bandula's column on the march to defeat British forces at Gadawpalin, and went on to capture Cox's Bazar. The destruction at Ramu caused extreme panic in Chittagong and in Calcutta. The Burmese victory too contributed to the Barrackpore mutiny of 1824 where tales of mystical prowess of the Burmese was exaggerated. However Bandula, not wanting to overstretch his lines, stopped Myawaddy from proceeding to Chittagong even though it was lightly held. Had the Burmese taken it, it would open the way to Calcutta. A threat to Calcutta could have potentially forced the British into giving more favourable terms in the peace negotiations to the Burmese kingdom or at least contribute more troops on the Arakan frontier rather than to Rangoon. Furthermore, the British occupation of Rangoon and naval assault forced the offensive to halt and return to Burma. Myawaddy and his veterans would return to Arakan while Bandula brought the rest of his men back to Rangoon to face the 11,000 strong expeditionary force under Sir Archibald Campbell. The British would later return to Arakan with a much larger army of 10,000 men including two Royal regiments, cavalry and thirty artillery pieces led by high profiled officers such as War of 1812 veteran Joseph Wanton Morrison and Colquhoun Grant. Although the British would finally defeat Myawaddy and his depleted men in the Battle of Mrauk U on April 1, 1825, Morrison and many of his men suffered greatly from tropical diseases.

She lived most of her adult life in a small cottage in Kintradwell, near Brora, Scotland. She was awarded the British Empire Medal in 1971. Early life Megan Boyd was born Rosina Megan Boyd on 29 January 1915 in Surrey, England. She was the youngest of three children. In 1918 her father moved the family to the Scottish Highlands to take a job as a bailiff or river watcher on the River Brora on the Duke of Sutherland's sporting estate. She attended local schools until she was 15 when she took her first fly tying work. During World War II she held various jobs including delivering milk and duties as an auxiliary coast watcher. Boyd was described as full of energy and a much-loved local figure in Brora. Country dancing was her favorite relaxation and she took an active role in helping the old and disabled locally. Considered eccentric by some, Boyd dressed in men's clothes, with man's shirt and tie, sport jacket and heavy army-style boots. She cut her own hair in a very short crop known as the Eton Crop. Fly tyer At the age of 12, Megan began taking fly tying lessons from Bob Trussler, another river keeper on the estate. Trussler's tutelage went on for many years with emphasis on precision and quality. Boyd also relied on two classic salmon fly publications for tying instructions and pattern recipes. She considered How To Dress Salmon Flies-A Handbook for Amateurs (1914) by T. E. Pryce- Tannatt as her \\"bible\\". She also relied on Kelson's The Salmon Fly (1895) for pattern advice. Her first paying fly tying work came when a Sir Charles Clauson requested she convert more than a dozen gut-eyed salmon flies onto the more modern eyed hooks or \\"irons\\". After seeing her work, local salmon anglers began asking Megan to tie flies for them and her reputation began to grow. Megan made her reputation by tying classic and traditional flies such as the Jock Scott, Silver Doctor, Durham Ranger and Wilkinson. She always claimed she tied flies for anglers and resisted tying for commercial fly houses. Her flies were extraordinarily durable and lasted many seasons. Over the course of her 65-year tying career, some estimate she tied tens of thousands of salmon flies. Yet despite the huge numbers of salmon that could not resist her flies, she never fished herself. Boyd's cottage as it looked in 2012, in disrepair. In 1935, at the age of twenty, Boyd left her family home and moved into a small cottage at Kintradwell overlooking the North Sea just north of Brora. The cottage was built from second hand materials in 1906 and did not have electricity or running water until the 1980s. She set up a small, kidney- shaped fly tying desk in a potting shed next to the cottage where she routinely worked 14-hour days tying flies to fill orders. Visiting anglers from around the world who came to fish the Rivers Brora and Helmsdale for salmon would stop by her cottage to watch her tie flies and place orders. If she was not at home, she left a small notepad and pencil under her doormat for visitors to write down their orders. Boyd for the most part tied traditional patterns, but is credited with one of her own invention ‚Äì The Megan Boyd ‚Äì which proved to be a very effective low water pattern in the Scottish Highlands. Awards and legacy As early as 1938, Boyd's flies were winning awards in competitions such as the 1938 Empire Exhibition in Glasgow where her flies won the Open award. Angler author Joseph D. Bates Jr. whose seminal works on Atlantic salmon flies include: Atlantic Salmon Flies and Fishing (1970) after polling the best of the world's fly tiers has been quoted as saying \\"The best are in Scotland, and of course Megan Boyd is the best in Scotland.\\" Bates included several flies tied by Boyd in the color plates of his 1970 book. In a 1996 tribute to women who have influenced fly fishing in The American Fly Fisher, author Lyla Foggia said this about Boyd: \\"During six decades that Megan Boyd created her magical concoctions out of feathers and fur, she did indeed produce flies that many regard as 'The Tiffiany's of the twentieth century'\\". In 1971, Queen Elizabeth II awarded Boyd the British Empire Medal and invited her to Buckingham Palace to receive the medal. Boyd wrote to the Queen explaining she could not attend because she was busy playing bridge and no one could look after her dog Patch. The Queen wrote back explaining she understood as she had dogs herself. Later that year, Prince Charles, an avid user of her flies, presented Boyd the medal at his fishing lodge in the Highlands. They became friends and he visited Boyd at her cottage or in Brora on a number of occasions. When he married Lady Diana, Boyd sent the prince some flies as a wedding gift with the following note: In 2013, filmmaker Eric Steel produced and directed Kiss The Water, an 80-minute documentary on Megan Boyd's fly tying life. The film was shown at both the 2013 Tribeca Film Festival and the Edinburgh Film Festival. In the film, David Profumo, the fishing editor of Country Life magazine who was apprenticed with Boyd one summer during his youth, said: Death Boyd tied flies for almost six decades using only natural light or a gas lantern for illumination. At the age of 70, her eyesight began to fail and she was forced to retire from commercial tying in 1985. In 1988 she moved from her Kintradwell cottage into Brora. In 2000, Prince Charles paid her a visit in the nursing home where they discussed her favourite fly: the Popham. Originated by F. L. Popham, the pattern is one of the most complicated and beautifully constructed of all the classic dressings that Britain has given to the sport. She is remembered for her devotion to her work, living by herself and working many hours a day. She was a dedicated conservationist and a major supporter of the North Atlantic Salmon Fund and its efforts to preserve remaining stocks of wild salmon to their native rivers. Boyd regularly donated examples of her flies for auctions to raise funds for the salmon. Boyd died on 15 November 2001 in Golspie, Scotland at the age of 86.

[it was] an amazing performance\\". The Arima Kinen over 2500 metres at Nakayama Racecourse on 28 December attracted its customary strong field, and Epiphaneia started second in the betting behind Gold Ship, with the other contenders including Just A Way and Gentildonna.
