The book details Jamison's experience with bipolar disorder and how it affected her in various areas of her life from childhood up until the writing of the book. Narrated in the first person, the book shows the effect of manic-depressive illness in family and romantic relationships, professional life, and self-awareness, and highlights both the detrimental effects of the illness and the few positive ones. The book was originally published in hardcover by Alfred A. Knopf, Inc. in New York and reprinted by Vintage Books in paperback in 1997.  Synopsis  = Part 1: The Wild Blue Yonder = Jamison describes her childhood and early life as part of a military family and the effects that had on her life, including a very conservative upbringing and the need to make new friends after every relocation. She recalls having a very happy childhood, and a supportive family. Her father was creative and charismatic and her mother kind and yet resourceful. In her adolescence she showed an interest in science and medicine which later switched to psychology. When her family moves to California, her family life deteriorates with her father becoming more prone to depressive episodes and her mother busy pursuing professional goals. It is at this time, her senior year in high school, that Jamison experiences her first episode of hypomania, followed by her first episode of depression, which she was able to go through passing as normal. Some time later Jamison starts her undergraduate studies at UCLA, where she determines clinical psychology as her career path. After finishing her undergraduate, Jamison earns her Ph.D. in clinical psychology from UCLA and becomes a professor in the Department of Psychiatry. = Part 2: A Not So Fine Madness = Jamison describes her episodes of mania and how they related to her personal and professional life. Her heightened energy and emotions make her a social at work and very efficient with her responsibilities, but irritable and restless in her marriage, which leads her to separating from her husband. She describes periods of reckless spending as characteristic of her mania, and how her brother helped her fix her financial situation. Jamison describes how, in her mania, her brain couldn't focus to read a single paragraph or listen to a song. Shortly after this she seeks treatment for the first time, and a colleague confronts her with her need to take lithium for her disease. Around this time Jamison starts seeing a psychiatrist with whom she starts psychotherapy sessions that would become a part of her routine for the rest of her life. Against medical advice, Jamison went off lithium several times, sometimes to get away from the side effects, and others related to her own rejection of her diagnosis. It was in one of these events and during a severe depressive episode that Jamison has a suicide attempt, in which she takes an overdose of lithium. Her attempt was deterred by a phone call from her brother, who finds her semi-alert and slurring and calls for help. After this, Jamison describes the number of people in her life that resolved to keep an eye and take care of her during her episodes, including her mother, brother and friends. Months after her suicide attempt, Jamison founds the Affective Disorders Clinic and applies for tenure at UCLA, which is granted. = Part 3: This Medicine, Love = Jamison narrates major events in her romantic life. After the end of her first marriage, she falls in love and starts dating a man named David, a British psychiatrist with the Army Medical Corps. After spending a few days together where she lived in L.A., they spend several weeks in London which made her \\"remember how important love is to life\\". David was to her always loving, kind, and reassuring, and Jamison admits to enjoying life like she hadn't for years. After she returns to LA, David is posted to an army hospital in Hong Kong, where he plans for her to meet him. Before this can happen, however, a diplomatic courier comes to her house with the news that David had died of a massive heart attack while in duty. Jamison retells her months of grief about David's death, from feeling numb and detached during the funeral in London at first, to breaking down in the British Airways counter when they asked her the reason of her visit, to being able to remember David with fondness without regretting the future they'd lost. Once back home, Jamison has an adjustment to her lithium levels, which greatly diminished the side effects without removing its effectiveness against the symptoms of bipolar disorder. Some time after, she meets Richard Wyatt, the man that would become her second husband and with whom she shares a more \\"opposites attract\\" relationship, which led to a rapidly evolving relationship that led her to leave her tenure position at UCLA to live in Washington with him. = Part 4: An Unquiet Mind = Jamison talks about the renaming of her disease from manic-depressive illness to bipolar disorder, and rebels against the change, arguing that the new name is not descriptive enough of the disease and suggests a separation between depression and manic- depressive illness which is not always clear or accurate. She tells her account of witnessing the first evidence of a genetic component to bipolar disease, and sitting with Jim Watson talking about mood disorders and family trees. After this genetic connection is made, Jamison talks about her struggle with her desire to have children. Later she recounts the recommendation of a physician she saw once to not have any because of her disease. Jamison calls not having her own children \\"the single most intolerable regret of [her] life\\", but describes her relationship with her niece and nephew and how she enjoys it. In her new life in Washington, Jamison starts working in the Department of Psychiatry at the Johns Hopkins Medical School. She is apprehensive to disclose her illness to her new coworkers but does so to not jeopardize the care of her patients and make her superiors aware of the legal risk. Despite her fears, she describes being very accepted and supported in her work environment in Hopkins, as well as maintaining an optimistic view of the future of her illness.  Reception  The book received a positive reception, with Jamison being praised for her bravery. In 2009, Melody Moezzi, an Iranian-American attorney who is diagnosed with bipolar disorder, reviewed An Unquiet Mind for National Public Radio. She described the memoir as \\"the most brilliant and brutally honest book I've ever read about bipolar disorder\\". Moezzi stated that \\"an unquiet mind need not be a deficient one\\". A 2011 review in The Guardian held that An Unquiet Mind has been unrivaled in its honesty about life with bipolar disorder.

One of them originates in Ishkamish District and the other originates in Khost wa Fereng District. They meet in Bangi District and run to the Khanabad River. There is one bridge over the Bangi river, which connects 15000 people with the district center. Before it was built, a portion of the district would be cut off from the rest for several months. Bangi is bordered by Dasht-e-Archi to the north, Baharak to the northeast, Taluqan to the east, Chal to the southeast, Ishkamish to the south, and Khanabad to the west. Khanabad is located in Kunduz Province, with all other districts in Takhar Province. Bangi may also border Aqtash District, but Aqtash is a temporary district. There are 59 villages in Bangi District.  History  Bangi was first recognized in 1998 in the 329 Afghanistan district set, mapped by AIMS. The district was considered to be an anti- Taliban bulwark in 2010 (in the Taliban insurgency) because of its large Uzbek population. The district governor was killed by the Taliban in 2015. Later in 2015, the Taliban claimed to have captured Bangi. Two years later, the Taliban claimed that the entire district was under full governmental control. Bangi was considered to be under full government control in late 2017 by the BBC, but just a few months later SIGAR classified it as contested. An irrigation canal that benefits over 7,500 people was built in 2019. Demographics The district has a population of about 39,042 and a sex ratio of 101 males for every 100 females. Bangi has an Uzbek majority at 80% of the population, with Tajik, Hazara, and Pashtun minorities at ten, six and four percent of the total population. The median age is 17.2, which is one of the highest in the province. Only Warsaj District has a higher median age. About 50% of the population is working, and about 10% of the unemployed are seeking a job. The district is home to about 5,827 households, with an average size of 6.7 people.

The average household size is 6.5 people. Economy Farming and livestock are the main economic activities of the area. The main agricultural crops grown are wheat, barley, flax, chickpea and sesame. Agricultural output is low because of a lack of new farming technologies and skilled workers. Chah Ab is rich with mines and natural resources, and one material mined is gold. However, they are largely unregulated. In addition, the forests are being cut down for light and fuel due to a lack of electricity. Education and Health Only about a third of the population ages 15‚Äì24 could read in 2015, and under 10% in 2006. Education has poor quality, with a shortage of money, staff, supplies, and building space. Some people object to sending girls to school due to traditional sentiments. There is only one health clinic in the district as of 2006, and it cannot serve everyone that needs health care. This causes a high mortality rate.

Khatlon is a province located in Tajikistan, and Dashte Archi is located in Kunduz Province. All other districts it borders are located in Takhar Province. History Khwaja Ghar was first mapped by Mohammed Ashraf in 1973 to prepare for a census. Later, in 2001, the Taliban captured Khwaja Ghar in Early 2001, and held it until November of that year. The fighting was the heaviest in 20 years and destroyed much of the district. In 2005, Dashti Qala District was created from part of Khwaja Ghar. Mohammad Omar became district governor in 2006. The Taliban started challenging the government for control of Khwaja Ghar in early 2010, receiving support from insurgents in Dashte Archi District. In late 2010, much of the district was contested, Taliban controlled, or self governed. In August 2006, the Taliban took control of the district center for a short period of time before being pushed back by security forces. Civilians said that the locals were harassed while they were in the district center. The Taliban claimed that they controlled 20% of Khwaja Ghar in March 2017. 10 villages were later taken by the Taliban in June of that year. There have been many incidents in Khwaja Ghar since then.

Economy 40% of employed people work in agriculture, hunting, fishing, or foresting- making it is the biggest sector in Khwaja Ghar. The main crops are wheat, barley, cotton, and flax. There are about 14,000 hectares of irrigated land and 32,000 hectares of rain-fed land, but not all of the land is used. Irrigation is provided by the Taloqan River, but the water level is low by the time it reaches Khwaja Ghar. Agricultural output is low due to lack of seeds, training, modern farming methods, equipment, and cold storage houses. Livestock is also raised in the district, with mostly sheep and goats being raised. Another 30% of the workforce works in the service sector. The majority of women work in weaving and tailoring. The district bazaar is one of the largest in the northeast, probably because of its proximity to Tajikistan. Khwaja Ghar benefits from cross-border trade, both legal and illegal.

All bordering districts are located in Takhar province, Afghanistan except for Khatlon, which is a Tajik province. The Panj River separates Yangi Qala from Tajikistan. History Old map of Takhar Amanullah Khan, in the 1920s, tried to colonize the area with non-native groups. Pashto- speakers arrived in the area and clashed with the native Uzbeks and Tajiks. The district has formally existed since 1973 when Mohammed Ashraf plotted a map of 325 Afghan Districts. That set expanded to 329 by 1998, and Yangi Qala went unchanged. However, in 2005, Khwaja Bahuddin was split from this district and Yangi Qala shrank. =Fighting= The first time that the Taliban were seen in the district was around 2009 and there have been clashes between Anti- government groups (including the Taliban) and the Government of Afghanistan. In August 2010, anti-government forces established a checkpoint and captured one soldier and one policeperson. Then in October, a NATO operation killed the Taliban district leader. Three years later on 8 February 2013, ISAF captured an IMU leader who was assisting in planning a high-profile attack. Later in 2015, the Taliban claimed to have taken the district, but officials said that was untrue. There was a clearing operation in the district in February 2017 that pushed the Taliban out of the district. One month later, the Taliban claimed to have 15% control over the district. The following May, the Taliban controlled almost half the districts and held a police checkpoint for more than a day. Around this time, the decision was made to move the district offices to the provincial capital due to security concerns. Later in September an attack on the district center was repulsed. At the end of the year, the BBC classified Yangi Qala as having low Taliban presence, defined as being attacked about once every three months. On 6 February 2018, the Afghanistan Air Force raided Taliban strongholds in the district and killed 12 insurgents, and another raid in May killed another 6 militants. In October, Takhar officials said that the Taliban controlled half the district. Around that same time, the Taliban attacked security outposts in the district. The Taliban took an outpost in Kaftar Ali village after two hours of fighting on 2 April 2019. There was another attack on an outpost 32 days later. Later in July, an illegal armed commander occupied a few villages in the district and disrupted activity. There was another security post attack during that same month. On 3 September, a pro-government militia was ambushed and 11 people were killed. Demographics The district has a population of 23960, and half the population are males and the other half are females. The median age is 16.5 and 43.2% of people work in the district. 43.8% of those were seeking work but couldn't find any. The average household is 6.7 people, meaning there are about 3576 households in the district. Economy More people work in agriculture than any other industry in Yangi Qala. However, the farming technologies that the farmers have are not sufficient and there is a lack of irrigation systems. There are rug and carpet weaving centers in the district. The district doesn't have a proper center of trade. Yangi Qala has one gold mine. The district exports heroin to Tajikistan. Healthcare and Education Yangi Qala had about a 45% literacy rate for people ages 15‚Äì24 in 2015. The district has some limited schooling opportunities including Madrasas, but the schools lack funds, staff, buildings, and supplies- leading to a low literacy rate. In addition, the district lacks a university. There is some access to healthcare with three medical centers located in the district, however mortality rates remain high because of a lack of trained doctors, a district hospital, and safe drinking water.

Biography =Family background= Born in Augusta, Georgia, he was the son of Hall of Fame trainer, William P. Burch and Emily J. Cammer whose sister Leonora Cammer married another prominent horseman, Green B. Morris. Both Preston Burch and his brother Selby followed in their father's footsteps. He was greatly influenced by not only his father and uncle, but also by another Hall of Fame trainer, Sam Hildreth. =Early career= Preston Burch began his career in 1902 with the purchase of his first racehorse Stuyve, a bay gelding by Stuyvesant and out of Katie A. (by Hyder Ali). The gelding raced and won in Burch's colors: blue silks with orange cuffs and an orange cap.Training Thoroughbred Horses by Preston Burch, p9 Setting up his own public stable in Canada, Preston Burch trained horses for prominent American owners such as Francis R. Hitchcock and John E. Madden. =Move to Europe= When the New York State Legislature under Governor Charles Evans Hughes outlawed all racetrack betting it resulted in the closing of every horse racetrack in the state after the end of the 1910 season. Following the state ban, the suddenly out-of-work Burch moved to France where he was able to make a living training both steeplechase and flat racing Thoroughbreds for wealthy American owners Harry La Montagne, William Astor Chanler, George P. Eustis, and John Sanford. Competing at racetracks across Europe, among his successes was a win in the Grand Steeplechase International at Milan with Harry La Montagne's horse Sultan VII.Training Thoroughbred Horses by Preston Burch, p10 His racing career was interrupted by the outbreak of World War I in which he served in France with the American Field Service as a volunteer ambulance driver. =Return to United States= At the end of the War, Burch returned to the United States where he continued to train horses for John Sanford as well as for George Wingfield's Nevada Stock Farm and later for Detroit auto body magnate, Charles T. Fisher. Burch eventually set up operations on the East coast with major clients such as Admiral Cary T. Grayson, Samuel Ross, Walter M. Jeffords, Sr., William duPont, Jr., Marion duPont Scott, Donald P. Ross and W. Deering Howe. Burch bred a number of successful horses, the most famous of which was the U.S. Racing Hall of Fame filly Gallorette foaled in 1942. The following year he took over as head trainer for the highly successful Brookmeade Stable, owned by Isabel Dodge Sloane. Running Brookmeade Stable, in 1950 he was the United States' leading money winner. That year he trained the two-year-old colt, Bold, with whom he would win the 1951 Preakness Stakes. In 1918, Burch saddled 1916 Kentucky Derby winner George Smith to victory in the Bowie Handicap at Pimlico Race Course by defeating two other Kentucky Derby winners. The 1917 winner, Omar Khayyam, finished vsecond and 1918 winner, Exterminator, ran third. Miami News ‚Äì May 13, 1959 Known as someone who never allowed a horse to race unless it was in top condition, Burch was a founding member of the American Trainers Association. He was elected the Association's first president and served for seven years.Training Thoroughbred Horses by Preston Burch, p11 In 1953, Blood-Horse Publications published his book titled \\"Training Thoroughbred Horses\\" (ASIN: B000O6YU38). The widely read book was reprinted in 1973, 1976, and again in 1992. =Retirement= In 1957, Burch retired after a career that spanned fifty-six years. Under his tutelage, assistant trainers such as Richard E. Handlen, Burley Parke, and Oscar White learned the art of conditioning Thoroughbreds and went on to very successful training careers of the own. Preston Burch was inducted in the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1963. In 1973, he was the honored guest at the annual Testimonial Dinner given by the Thoroughbred Club of America. He was one of the trainers feature in the 2007 book Masters of the Turf: Ten Trainers Who Dominated Horse Racing's Golden Age by author Edward L. Bowen. Family Burch's son Elliott also became a racehorse trainer. Like his father and grandfather, Elliott Burch had an outstanding career that resulted in his induction in the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1980. Another son of Preston Burch, William Preston Burch (1919‚Äì1998), was a Longtime executive with Gulfstream Aerospace whose son Preston M. Burch II is a 1966 graduate of Adelphi University with a degree in physics and is the manager of the Hubble Space Telescope Program and Deputy Associate Director for Astrophysics, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.

They were originally named \\"Caribou Eskimo\\" by the Danish Fifth Thule Expedition of 1921-4 led by Knud Rasmussen. Caribou Inuit are the southernmost subgroup of the Central Inuit. Approximate location of Caribou Inuit bands at the end of the 19th century Bands ;Ahialmiut Ahialmiut relied on caribou year-round. They spent summers on the Qamanirjuaq calving grounds at Qamanirjuaq Lake (\\"huge lake adjoining a river at both ends\\") and spent winters following the herd to the north. ;Akilinirmiut Akilinirmiut were located in the Thelon River area by the Akiliniq Hills (A-ki, meaning \\"the other side\\") to the north of Beverly Lake and also visible above Aberdeen Lake. Some lived northwest of Baker Lake (Qamani'tuuaq), along with Qairnirmiut and Hauniqturmiut. Many relocated to Aberdeen Lake because of starvation or education opportunities. ;Hanningajurmiut Hanningajurmiut, or Hanningaruqmiut, or Hanningajulinmiut {\\"the people of the place that lies across\\"} lived at Garry Lake, south of the Utkuhiksalingmiut. Many Hanningajurmiut starved in 1958 when the caribou bypassed their traditional hunting grounds, but the 31 who survived were relocated to Baker. Most never returned permanently to Garry Lake. ;Harvaqtuurmiut Harvaqtuurmiut were a northern group located in the region of Kazan River, Yathkyed Lake, Kunwak River, Beverly Lake, and Dubawnt River. By the early 1980s, most lived at Baker Lake. ;Hauniqtuurmiut Hauneqtormiut, or Hauniqtuurmiut, or Kangiqliniqmiut, (\\"dwellers where bones abound\\") were a smaller band who lived near the coast, south of Qairnirmiuts, around the Wilson River and Ferguson River. By the 1980s, they were absorbed into subgroups at Whale Cove and Rankin Inlet. ;Ihalmiut Ihalmiut (\\"people from beyond\\"), or Ahiarmiut (\\"the out-of-the-way dwellers\\") were located at the banks of the Kazan River, Ennadai Lake, Little Dubawnt Lake (Kamilikuak), and north of Thlewiaza (Kugjuaq; \\"Big River\\"). Relocations in the 1950s included to Henik Lake, Whale Cove, and by the 1980s, most were in Eskimo Point. ;Paallirmiut Paallirmiut (\\"people of the willow\\"), or Padlermiut (\\"people from the Padlei River region\\"), or Padleimiut were the most populous band. They were located south of the Hauniqtuurmiut and Harvaqtuurmiut bands. Paallirmiut were split into a coast-visiting (Arviat) subgroup who spent the hunting season on the lower Maguse River, and an interior subgroup who stayed year-round in the Yathkyed Lake to Dubawnt Lake area. After Hudson's Bay Company ships discontinued trading the Keewatin coast in 1790, Paallirmiut traveled to Fort Prince of Wales for trade. The Arvia'juaq and Qikiqtaarjuk National Historic Site is the band's historic summer camping site. By the 1980s, most lived in Eskimo Point (Arviat). ;Qaernermiut Qaernermiut (\\"dwellers of the flat land\\"), or Qairnirmiut (\\"bedrock people\\"), or Kinipetu (Franz Boas, 1901), or Kenepetu, a northern group, were located from the sea coast between Chesterfield Inlet to Rankin Inlet across to their main area around Baker Lake and some even to Beverly Lake. By the early 1980s, most lived at Baker Lake. ;Utkuhiksalingmiut Utkuhiksalingmiut (\\"people who have cooking pots\\"), were located in the Chantrey Inlet area around the Back River, near Baker Lake. They made their pots (utkusik) from soapstone of the area, therefore their name. Their dialect is a variant of Natsilingmiutut, spoken by the Netsilik. Origin Lacking an early written language, Caribou Inuit pre-history is unclear. There are three main theories: #Caribou Inuit are the descendants of an interior Eskimo culture that spread in Arctic North America and Greenland. (Birket-Smith, 1930; Rasmussen, 1930; Czonka, 1995) #Caribou Inuit are the descendants of Thule people who had migrated from Alaska. (Mathiassen, 1927) #Caribou Inuit were the 17th century descendants of a migratory subgroup of Copper Inuit from the arctic coast. (Taylor, 1972; Burch, 1978) While this is the most current hypothesis, it is still unproven. (Czonka, 1998) History Caribou Inuit ancestors originally went back and forth between the Barrenlands to hunt the Beverly and the Qamanirjuaq (\\"Kaminuriak\\") caribou herds during seasonal migrations; and the Hudson Bay (Tariurjuaq) for whaling and to fish during the winters. The Chipewyan Sayisi Dene were caribou hunters also, but they stayed inland year-round. Because of waning caribou populations during extended periods, including the 18th century, the Dene moved away from the area, and the Caribou Inuit began to live inland year-round harvesting enough caribou to get through winters without reliance on coastal life. Regular contact began around 1717 after the establishment of a permanent settlement in Churchill, Manitoba. The contact included access to guns, along with an introduction to trapping and whaling. Christian missionary, Father Alphonse Gast√©, made diary notes about peaceful relations between settled Caribou Inuit and migratory Dene that he met along the Kazan River in the late 19th century. Explorer Joseph Tyrrell estimated the \\"Caribou Eskimo\\" numbered nearly 2,000 when he led the Geological Survey of Canada's Barren Lands expeditions of 1893 and 1894. Eugene Arima classifies the Hauniqtuurmiut, Ha'vaqtuurmiut, Paallirmiut, and Qairnirmiut as Caribou Inuit \\"southern, latter\\" bands: through the end of the 19th century, they were primarily coastal saltwater hunters, but with firearm ammunition from commercial whalers, they were able to live inland year-round hunting caribou without augmenting their diet on sea life. (Arima 1975) Regular trade dates to the early 20th century and missionaries arrived soon thereafter, developing a written language, challenged by a variety of pronunciations and naming rules. In the Arctic spring of 1922, explorer/anthropologist Kaj Birket-Smith and Rasmussen encountered and reported on the lives of Harvaqtuurmiut and Paallirmiut. Some hunting years were better than others as resident caribou and migratory herds grew or declined, but Caribou Inuit populations dwindled through the decades. Starvation was not uncommon. During a bleak period in the 1920s, some of the Caribou Inuit made their way to Hudson's Bay Company outposts and small, scattered villages on their own. In the early 1950s the Canadian media reported the starvation deaths of 60 Caribou Inuit. The government was slow to act but in 1959 moved the surviving 60, of around the 120 that were alive in 1950, to settlements such as Baker Lake and Eskimo Point. This set off an Arctic settlement push by the Canadian government where those First Nations living in the North were encouraged to abandon their traditional way of life and settle in villages and outposts of the Canadian North. Author/explorer Farley Mowat visited the Ihalmiut in the 1940s and 1950s, writing extensively about the Ihalmiut. Ethnography Early 20th Century Inuit parka Caribou Inuit were nomadic and summers were time of relocation to reach different game and to trade. In addition to hunting, they fished in local lakes and rivers (kuuk). Caribou Inuit northern bands from as far away as Dubawnt River travelled on trading trips to Churchill via Thlewiaza River for extra supplies. The nomadic nature made the people and their dogs into strong walkers and sledders who carried loads of implements, bedding, and tents. Kayaks portaged people and baggage in rivers and lakes. Kayaks were also used for hunting at water crossings during annual migration. Wounded animals were tied together, brought ashore, and killed there to avoid the struggle of dragging dead animals. Every part of the caribou was important. The antlers were used for tools, such as the ulu (\\"knife\\") and goggles to prevent snow blindness. The hides were used for footwear and clothing, including the anorak and amauti, using caribou sinew to piece the articles together, and worn in many layers. Mittens were lined with fur, down, and moss. While spring- gathered caribou skins were thin, sleek, and handsome, summer-gathered caribou skins were stronger and warmer. Hides were used also for tents, tools, and containers. Caribou Inuit lived within a patrilocal social unit. The male elder, the ihumataq (\\"group leader\\"), was the centralized authority. There was no other form of authority within subgroups or within the Caribou Inuit in general. Like other Inuit, Caribou Inuit practiced an animist religion, including beliefs that everything had a soul or energy with a disposition or personality. The protector was Pinga, a female figure, the object of taboos, who brings the dead to Adlivun. The supreme force was Hila (\\"air\\"), a male figure and the source of misfortune. Christian missionaries established posts in the Barren Lands between 1910 and 1930, converting (siqqitiq) most Inuit from animists to Christians, though some, nonetheless, maintain remnants of their traditional shamanistic beliefs. Caribou Inuit are Inuktitut speakers. Inuktitut has six dialects, of which Caribou Inuit speak the Kivalliq dialect, and that is further divided into the subdialects, Ahiarmiut, Hauniqturmiut, Paallirmiut, and Qairnirmiut. The Utkuhiksalingmiut's dialect, Utkuhiksalingmiutut, is similar to but distinct from their neighbors' Nattilingmiutut. Like other central Canadian Arctic people, Caribou Inuit participated in nipaquhiit (\\"games done with sounds or with noises\\"). The Caribou Inuit genre lacked typical katajjaq (\\"throat sounds\\") but added narration missing amongst other Inuit groups. Modern-day adaptation ;Re- settlement There are several books written on the hardships and the 1950s federal government re-settlement of Caribou Inuit. With re-settlement to coastal communities, the nomadic nuunamiut (\\"people of the land\\") ways ended and Caribou Inuit joined tareumiut (\\"people of the sea\\"), the maritime Inuit being a more stable group. Even with federal assistance, adapting to displacement in fewer and larger towns proved difficult, resulting in high unemployment, domestic violence, sexual abuse, substance addiction, suicide, and parental neglect. ;Language With the acquisition of English, native language loss is the primary threat to their cultural survival, while neither language is being mastered. ;Art On a positive note, artisan skills evolved and Caribou Inuit, such as Jessie Oonark, are notable for their figurines of animal life. Another Inuit art medium, also considered a game, and also associated with their religious beliefs, involves string figures (ajaraaq/ajaqaat [plural]). ;Population About 3,000 Caribou Inuit exist today, located in Chesterfield Inlet, Rankin Inlet, Whale Cove, Arviat, and Baker Lake.

Biography He was born to Mary and Frederick Sparks, a federal government clerk. He was apprenticed to an architect but also took private painting lessons from Howard Helmick. His progress there encouraged him to enroll at the Corcoran Art School. After some time at Corcoran the Director, E. F. Andrews, appointed him to the sensitive position of monitor in the \\"painting from life\\" (nude) art classes. In 1898 he won a design competition, along with his collaborator J. Elfreth Watkins, chief of buildings for the United States National Museum, for a proposed \\"Hall of American Inventions\\" to be built at the Exposition Universelle (1900). As a result, he was given a place on the installation committee and went to Paris. While there, he took employment that provided him the means to study at the Acad√©mie Julian with Jean-Paul Laurens. After two years there, he transferred to the √âcole des Beaux-Arts, where he studied with Fernand Cormon and William Bouguereau. He remained in Paris for ten years altogether; taking numerous trips to the Mediterranean coast and North Africa. He returned to the United States in 1908, when Arthur Hamerschlag, head of Andrew Carnegie's new Carnegie Technical Schools, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, hired him to be the founding head of the Department of Painting and Illustration. Very early on, he encountered resistance to his plans for the \\"painting from life\\" class, being told that using \\"a cow, a dog, or a calf\\" would be more decent, despite the fact that Carnegie himself had no objection to nudes. He eventually prevailed, and used human models throughout his tenure there. While teaching, he continued to paint and participated in numerous exhibitions in Philadelphia, Chicago and New York. He resigned his post in 1919, intending to live at the art colony in New Hope, Pennsylvania; where he would join his old friend, Edward Redfield. Before he got there, however, he contracted the \\"Spanish flu\\" and died in Philadelphia. His works remained little known until the 1960s, when interest in them was revived.

When Talkies pushed silent films into the background, she worked in stock theater for a time before moving to radio drama, where she became well known in the repeated role of a telephone operator. She was married twice, to comedian Buddy Wattles and to radio producer William T. Johnson. Dancer and bit player Thompson and her mother moved to San Francisco and Hollywood in the early 1920s, where Thompson, after a stint as a cafe dancer, pursued a career in acting. She received her first film role in 1921, starring opposite Vernon Dent as Violet Joy in Up and at 'em. Silent film star Dropping Violet Joy for Duane Thompson, she was Neal Burn's feminine lead in Hot Water. That film launched her into regular roles, and she starred in four films that year. From 1923 to 1929, Thompson starred in 37 films, with uncredited roles in another three films. In 1925, she was one of 13 women selected by the Western Association of Motion Picture Advertisers (WAMPAS) as a WAMPAS Baby Star alongside future Hollywood legend June Marlowe. It was said at the time she was selected by WAMPAS that \\"Duane Thompson, with dancing as a foundation for a theatrical career, embarked on what is leading her to fame and fortune... She has appeared in numerous Christie Comedies, and is now leading lady for Walter Hiers.\\" Stage and radio Although Thompson appeared in Voice of the City, a Talkie, the advent of talking films effectively ended her film career, and she went on to stock theater. In 1928, she was signed for a stage role in Dixie McCoy's production of Tarnish at the Hollywood Music Box., and in 1931, she played Susan Porter in Philip Barry's Holiday with the Woodward Players in St. Louis. Shortly thereafter, she turned to radio, where she opened each broadcast of the Hollywood Hotel radio program and played a lead in such comedy series as The Newlyweds. Her radio role opening broadcasts of Hollywood Hotel led to an offer in 1937 to play herself in the Hollywood Hotel movie. Following that film she returned to her work in radio with her second husband, producer William T. Johnson. She was often cast as a switchboard operator. Personal life Born July 28, 1903 in Red Oak, Iowa, Lura Duane Malony was the daughter of Dr. John Henry Malony and Georgia Ethel Manker. She and her mother relocated to Omaha when Duane was 2 years old, before moving on to California. Duane took the surname of her mother's second husband, Tommy Thompson. For a brief time she used the stage name Violet Joy. On December 11, 1928, she married stage comedian Emmett K. (Buddy) Wattles, and, in 1937, radio producer William T. Johnson. After retiring, she lived in Los Angeles with her husband and daughter, Judith, until her death on August 15, 1970, at the age of 67.

Founded in San Francisco in 1974, it has published 116 limited-edition books, most printed by letterpress, often illustrated with original prints by notable artists.  History  The press, writes Michael Kimmelman of The New York Times, \\"carries on a grand legacy of San Francisco printers and bookmakers.\\" The press was founded by Andrew Hoyem, continuing the tradition of the Grabhorn Press of Edwin and Robert Grabhorn. Hoyem had been partners for seven years with the younger Grabhorn brother, and after his death Hoyem started Arion Press, preserving the Grabhorn's historic collection of American metal type. Since 2001, Arion Press has been a cultural tenant at the Presidio, where it shares an industrial building with its typecasting division, M & H Type‚Äîthe oldest and largest hot metal type foundry in the U.S. for letterpress printers. The Arion Press gallery is open daily, and tours of the letterpress print shop, typefoundry, and book bindery are also available to visitors on a weekly schedule. Arion Press has a nonprofit branch, the Grabhorn Institute, founded to help preserve and continue the use of one of the last integrated typefoundry, letterpress printing, and bookbinding facilities in the world. In recognition of this effort, in 2000 the Grabhorn Institute was designated by the National Trust for Historic Preservation as part of \\"the nation's irreplaceable historical and cultural legacy\\" under its Save America's Treasures program. The press publishes three to four new books each year, in editions of 400 copies or less. \\"Its editions of such classics as Moby-Dick and contemporary works that pair poets and artists are considered to be among the most exquisitely printed books in the world,\\" in the words of John King of the San Francisco Chronicle. The press's lectern edition of the Bible \\"will probably be the last lectern Bible to be produced using traditional methods [and] will no doubt be regarded as one of the finest examples of book-making.\\" In part due to their scarcity, many of Arion's books are highly collectible. Under Andrew Hoyem, who retired in 2018, the Press focused on creating limited edition books of notable literature illustrated with original prints from prominent artists. The press's livre d'artiste series, launched in 1982, includes Robert Motherwell's etchings for James Joyce's Ulysses, Jasper Johns's etching for the poetry of Wallace Stevens, Richard Diebenkorn's etchings for the poetry of W. B. Yeats, and Martin Puryear's woodblock prints for Jean Toomer's Cane. Other artists who have collaborated in Arion Press editions include Jim Dine, John Baldessari, Wayne Thiebaud, Alex Katz, Kiki Smith, R.B. Kitaj, Sol LeWitt, Mel Bochner, and Stephen Shore. The press has published such contemporary writers as Seamus Heaney, Allen Ginsberg, Tom Stoppard, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, David Mamet, Edward Albee and Arthur Miller. Other writers published by the press include Samuel Beckett, H.G. Wells, Graham Greene, Virginia Woolf, and Emily Dickinson. Since Hoyem's retirement, the Press has continued its publication and public education activities. The staff continues the legacy of regularly producing books using the same traditional methods, and to collaborate with leading artists worldwide. The type foundry and book binding facility operate as they always have. Arion Press books are in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the Huntington Library, the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, and the British Library, among others.

It is particularly useful in analysis of variance (a special case of regression analysis), and in constructing simultaneous confidence bands for regressions involving basis functions. Scheff√©'s method is a single-step multiple comparison procedure which applies to the set of estimates of all possible contrasts among the factor level means, not just the pairwise differences considered by the Tukey‚ÄìKramer method. It works on similar principles as the Working‚ÄìHotelling procedure for estimating mean responses in regression, which applies to the set of all possible factor levels. The method Let Œº1, ..., Œºr be the means of some variable in r disjoint populations. An arbitrary contrast is defined by :C = \\\\sum_{i=1}^r c_i\\\\mu_i where :\\\\sum_{i=1}^r c_i = 0. If Œº1, ..., Œºr are all equal to each other, then all contrasts among them are 0\\\\. Otherwise, some contrasts differ from 0\\\\. Technically there are infinitely many contrasts. The simultaneous confidence coefficient is exactly 1 ‚àí Œ±, whether the factor level sample sizes are equal or unequal. (Usually only a finite number of comparisons are of interest. In this case, Scheff√©'s method is typically quite conservative, and the family-wise error rate (experimental error rate) will generally be much smaller than Œ±.) We estimate C by :\\\\hat{C} = \\\\sum_{i=1}^r c_i\\\\bar{Y}_i for which the estimated variance is :s_{\\\\hat{C}}^2 = \\\\hat{\\\\sigma}_e^2\\\\sum_{i=1}^r \\\\frac{c_i^2}{n_i}, where * ni is the size of the sample taken from the ith population (the one whose mean is Œºi), and * \\\\hat{\\\\sigma}_e^2 is the estimated variance of the errors. It can be shown that the probability is 1 ‚àí Œ± that all confidence limits of the type :\\\\hat{C}\\\\pm\\\\,s_\\\\hat{C}\\\\sqrt{\\\\left(r-1\\\\right)F_{\\\\alpha;r-1;N-r}} are simultaneously correct, where as usual N is the size of the whole population. Draper and Smith, in their 'Applied Regression Analysis' (see references), indicate that 'r' should be in the equation in place of 'r-1'. The slip with 'r-1' is a result of failing to allow for the additional effect of the constant term in many regressions. That the result based on 'r-1' is wrong is readily seen by considering r = 2, as in a standard simple linear regression. That formula would then reduce to one with the usual t distribution, which is appropriate for predicting/estimating for a single value of the independent variable, not for constructing a confidence band for a range of values of the independent value. Also note that the formula is for dealing with the mean values for a range of independent values, not for comparing with individual values such as individual observed data values. Denoting Scheff√© significance in a table Frequently, superscript letters are used to indicate which values are significantly different using the Scheff√© method. For example, when mean values of variables that have been analyzed using an ANOVA are presented in a table, they are assigned a different letter superscript based on a Scheff√© contrast. Values that are not significantly different based on the post-hoc Scheff√© contrast will have the same superscript and values that are significantly different will have different superscripts (i.e. 15a, 17a, 34b would mean that the first and second variables both differ from the third variable but not each other because they are both assigned the superscript \\"a\\"). Comparison with the Tukey‚ÄìKramer method If only a fixed number of pairwise comparisons are to be made, the Tukey‚ÄìKramer method will result in a more precise confidence interval. In the general case when many or all contrasts might be of interest, the Scheff√© method is more appropriate and will give narrower confidence intervals in the case of a large number of comparisons.

Under the governing law, an emotional support animal is not a pet and is generally not restricted by species. An emotional support animal differs from a service animal. Service animals are trained to perform specific tasks such as helping a blind person navigate, while no training is required for emotional support animals and they need not be formally trained to perform any tasks to mitigate mental illness. Any animal that provides support, well-being, comfort, or aid, to an individual through companionship, unconditional positive regard, and affection may be regarded as an emotional support animal. In the U.S., people with mental health disabilities can be exempted from certain federal housing and travel rules if they own an emotional support animal. To receive that exemption, they must meet the federal definition of disabled, and the animal must provide emotional support that alleviates some symptom or effect of the disability. The person must usually present a letter from a certified healthcare provider, stating that the animal provides emotional support that alleviates one or more of the symptoms or effects of the disability.  Animals  Emotional support animals are typically cats and dogs, but may be members of other animal species. In relation to whether or not an emotional support animal should be allowed in a rental property, it is thus necessary to perform an individualized assessment of the specific assistance animal to determine if it poses a direct threat of harm or would cause substantial property damage, and not to assume that an animal is excluded based upon breed or species. Although a wild or exotic animal that poses an increase risk of disease or potential attack upon other people may potentially be excluded, courts have recognized species including guinea pigs and miniature horses as emotional support animals. Laws and regulations that allow service animals to be taken into businesses or onto aircraft may give the service provider discretion to deny admission to unusual service animals. For example, under the Air Carrier Access Act, airlines are never required to accommodate unusual animals such as ferrets, rodents, snakes and other reptiles, or spiders within the passenger cabin of an airplane. In 2018, Delta Air Lines banned pit bulls and similar breeds of dogs from the passenger compartment of their aircraft as emotional support animals, after a pit bull traveling as an emotional support animal bit two employees. Most airlines will allow emotional support animals, with proper documentation from a veterinarian and/or mental health counselor, and small animals such as cats and dogs can be held on the passenger's lap during the flight. There is no requirement under federal law for emotional support animals to wear a tag, harness, or clothing of any type indicating they are emotional support animals.  Training and tasks  Emotional support animals do not need to have any special training. There are no training requirements for emotional support animals. Emotional support animals typically have no training beyond what would be expected for the same type of animal. Emotional support animals need not perform any tasks other than what a pet of the same species would perform, and may display unwanted behaviors, such as defecating or urinating in inappropriate places, growling and barking at people, or biting them. Both poorly trained emotional support animals and poorly trained pets that are being fraudulently passed off as emotional support animals represent a threat to the health, safety, and function of both people and trained service animals.  Owners  To qualify for an emotional support animal in the US, its owner must have an emotional or mental disability that is certified by a mental health professional such as a psychiatrist, psychologist, or other licensed mental health care provider. These may be invisible disabilities. The owner's mental health impairment must be substantial enough to produce disability, rather than discomfort or a desire to have a pet. Furthermore, for the provider to certify the animal, non-fraudulently, the emotional support animal's presence must provide a significant benefit, that makes the difference between the person functioning adequately and not. = ESA letters = An emotional support animal letter, or an ESA letter, is a document that qualifies people to be accompanied by a support animal in contexts in which pets might not be permitted, such as in rental housing or mass transportation. The letter must be issued by a psychiatrist, qualified mental health professional, or physician. The professional who issues an ESA letter need not be the recipient's primary care physician, and some doctors may refer patients who are seeking an ESA to psychologists or other professionals. Under US Department of Transportation, rules, the doctor or mental health professional who issues the letter must be currently providing treatment to the passenger.Department of Transportation (2003) \\"Guidance Concerning Service Animals in Air Transportation.\\" . Airlines are not obligated to accept certificates or letters that are more than one year old, and may require that the certification be provided on the letterhead of a licensed mental health professional or doctor who is specifically treating the passenger's mental or emotional disability. = Multiple emotional support animals = While there do not seem to be any cases dealing with the issue of multiple emotional support animals, the basic requirements for this accommodation would be the same. Thus, if a person with a disability claimed to need multiple emotional support animals, he or she would need documentation supporting this claim from his or her psychologist or other licensed healthcare professional. The practitioner would need to provide documentation that each support animal alleviated some symptom of the disability. As of 2018, Delta Air Lines limits free travel for emotional support animals to one animal per ticketed passenger. = Misrepresentation = The ability to avoid extra costs, such as paying damage deposits for pets in a rental apartment or extra baggage fees for taking an animal on an airplane, has resulted in some people misrepresenting their pets as ESAs. Following a 2018 incident in which a woman tried to board a flight with her peacock, airlines have tightened their requirements for flying with an ESA. In some US states, providing a letter, registry, or certificate to a person who is not disabled is a crime. Many states have made it a criminal misdemeanor to make false claims stating that their animal is an assistance animal or to say they are a handler training an assistance animal. States that have passed laws criminalizing the misrepresentation of service and assistance animals include Alabama, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Texas, Utah, Virginia, and Washington State.  US housing  In the U.S., legal protection against housing discrimination is afforded to people with mental disabilities under two federal statutes: Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Federal Fair Housing Amendments Act (FHAA) of 1988. These statutes, and the corresponding case law, create the general rule that a landlord cannot discriminate against people with mental disabilities in housing, and if a reasonable accommodation will enable a person living with a disability to equally enjoy and use the rental unit, the landlord must provide the accommodation. Persons with disabilities may request a reasonable accommodation, such as a waiver of a \\"no pets policy\\", for any assistance animal, including an emotional support animal, under both the FHAA and Section 504. = Legislation =  Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act  Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act was enacted in 1973 and made broad and sweeping statements that discrimination against the disabled in any program receiving federal financial assistance was illegal. However, it was not until 1988 when the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) created regulations under the statute. Section 504 states: In the context of housing discrimination, this statute creates the rule that public housing authorities cannot deny housing to a person with a disability solely because of his or her disability, and that if a reasonable accommodation can be made to make housing available to a person with a disability, the landlord is required to make the accommodation. Even though the statute does not expressly use the phrase \\"reasonable accommodation\\", it has been read into the statute by case law and HUD regulations interpreting the statute. To establish that a \\"no pets\\" waiver for an emotional support animal is a reasonable accommodation under Section 504, the tenant must: have a disability, be \\"otherwise qualified\\" to receive the benefit, be denied the benefit solely because of the disability, and the housing authority must receive federal financial assistance. Courts have held that \\"otherwise qualified\\" means that the tenant must be able to meet the requirements of the program in spite of the handicap. Also, the tenant must be able to meet the general rules of tenancy, such as cleaning up after the animal and walking the animal in designated areas. The Majors and Whittier Terrace courts established the foundational principles that a tenant can be \\"otherwise qualified\\" under Section 504 despite an inability to comply with a \\"no pets\\" policy, and that a waiver of a \\"no pets\\" policy can be a reasonable accommodation under Section 504. However, several courts have consistently held that a tenant requesting an emotional support animal as a reasonable accommodation must demonstrate a relationship between his or her ability to function and the companionship of the animal.See Majors v. Housing Authority of the County of Dekalb (5th Cir. 1981); Housing Authority of the City of New London v. Tarrant, (Conn. Super. Ct. Jan. 14, 1997); Whittier Terrace v. Hampshire (Mass. App. Ct. 1989); Durkee v. Staszak (N.Y.App.Div. 1996); Crossroads Apartments v. LeBoo (City Court of Rochester, N.Y. 1991) This required nexus between the disability and the emotional support animal has been refined by several courts. For instance, in Janush v. Charities Housing Development Corp (N.D. Ca., 2000), the U.S. Northern District Court of California held the reasonable accommodation is a fact-based, and not species- based, issue. In Nason v. Stone Hill Realty Association (1996), a Massachusetts trial court recognized that there were more reasonable accommodations to lessen the effects of a person's disability, other than keeping an emotional support animal, and therefore denied the tenant's motion for preliminary injunction. Courts have held the emotional distress expected to occur if a person is forced to give up his or her emotional support animal will not support a reasonable accommodation claim. Since a violation of Section 504 requires the housing authority to receive federal funding, this act did not cover private housing providers. This legislative gap existed until 1988 when Congress passed the Fair Housing Act Amendments.  Fair Housing Act Amendments  Whereas only housing authorities receiving federal financial assistance are subject to Section 504, both public and private housing authorities are subject to the provisions of the Fair Housing Act. Enacted as part of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 legislation, the Fair Housing Act (FHA) focused on housing discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, or gender; in 1988, however, the Federal Fair Housing Act Amendments (FHAA) expanded this scope to include handicapped persons. The FHAA states that it is unlawful \\"to discriminate in the sale or rental...of a dwelling to any buyer or renter because of a handicap of that buyer or renter, a person residing in or intending to reside in that dwelling after it is so sold, rented, or made available, or any person associated with that buyer or renter.\\" Further, it is discrimination for any person to: \\"refuse to make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices, or services, when such accommodations may be necessary to afford a handicapped person equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling unit, including public and common use areas.\\" Thus, like Section 504, the FHAA requires landlords to make reasonable accommodations for tenants. Additionally, the FHAA, in section 3602(h) defines handicap, with respect to a person, as: # a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more of such person's major life activities; # a record of having such an impairment; or # being regarded as having such an impairment. The term \\"major life activities\\" has been interpreted broadly to include those \\"activities that are of central importance to daily life,\\" such as \\"seeing, hearing, walking, breathing, performing manual tasks, caring for one's self, learning, speaking, and reproducing.\\" The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is responsible for administering the FHAA; the Attorney General and private individuals may enforce it. To establish a prima facie case of housing discrimination under the FHAA: the tenant must have a qualifying disability, the landlord knew of the handicap or should reasonably be expected to know of it, accommodation of the handicap may be necessary to afford the tenant an equal opportunity to use and enjoy the dwelling, and the landlord must deny the request, such as refusing to waive the \\"no pets\\" policy. The second element, that the landlord knew of the handicap or should have known of it, places an affirmative burden on the tenant to request the reasonable accommodation, such as a waiver of a \\"no pets\\" policy for an emotional support animal. A tenant wishing to obtain a waiver of a \\"no pets\\" policy for an emotional support animal may meet this burden by providing a letter from his or her physician or mental health professional: stating that the tenant has a mental disability, explaining that the animal is needed to lessen the effects of the disability, and requesting that the animal be allowed in the rental unit as a reasonable accommodation for the mental disability. Landlords are entitled to ask for supporting materials which document the need for an emotional support animal. Mere emotional distress that would result from having to give up an animal because of a \\"no pets\\" policy will not qualify under federal law. Instead, there must be a link, or a nexus, between the animal and the disability. The nexus between the animal and the disability is analyzed under the third element of an FHAA housing discrimination case, known as the necessity requirement, and requires that the accommodation will affirmatively enhance a disabled tenant's quality of life by ameliorating the effects of the disability. So long as the requested accommodation does not constitute an undue financial or administrative burden for the landlord, or fundamentally alter the nature of the housing, the landlord must provide the accommodation. Although the Fair Housing Act covers both multi- and single-family detached home, the sale or rental of a single family dwelling by an owner is exempt from the statute. There are two exceptions to this exemption, however. One is that the exception will not apply if the private individual owner owns more than three single- family homes. The other exception to this exemption is the use of a real estate agent or a broker to rent out the home. A tenant may be awarded actual and punitive damages, injunctions, and attorney fees at the discretion of the court for a landlord's violation of the FHAA. It is important to note, that though in most cases, landlords do grant ESA's the same reasonable housing accommodations as a service animal, there have been instances where they do not. There are some court cases, such as, the Kenna Homes case in West Virginia, where the court has said it is not a violation of Fair Housing rules for a landlord to require an assistance animal to have some form of training.  Americans with Disabilities Act  The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) allows people with disabilities to bring their service animals in public places. However, the ADA only extends these protections to dogs that have been \\"individually trained\\" to \\"perform tasks for the benefit of an individual with a disability,\\" which is the definition of service animals under 28 C.F.R. ¬ß 36.104. Since emotional support animals are typically not trained for an individual's specific disability and since emotional support animals might not be dogs, they do not receive the protections of the ADA. A public place can therefore deny an emotional support animal admission. In situations where the ADA and the FHAA/Section 504 apply simultaneously (e.g., a public housing agency, sales or leasing offices, or housing associated with a university or other place of education), housing providers must meet their obligations under both the reasonable accommodation standard of the FHAct/Section 504 and the service animal provisions of the ADA. The lack of training for emotional support animals has also led to controversy in the courts. Specifically, there is controversy over whether the ADA definition of service animal, with its requirement of training, applies to reasonable accommodation claims for animals under the FHAA. However, HUD administrative judges have ruled in favor of emotional support animals, despite their lack of training, as being reasonable accommodations.See HUD v. Dutra, 1996 WL 657690 and HUD v. Riverbay Corporation, 1994 WL 497536 Additionally, several courts have also ruled that untrained assistance animals are reasonable accommodations under the FHAA.See Overlook Mutual Homes, Inc. v. Spencer (S.D. Ohio 2009), Bronk v. Ineichen (7th Cir. 1995), Fair Housing of the Dakotas, Inc. v. Goldmark Property Management, Inc. (D.N.D. 2011) (this case acknowledges that some courts use the ADA definition of service animals to apply to animals under the FHAA). Yet, there are cases that have held an assistance animal, in order to be considered a reasonable accommodation under the FHAA, must be trained.See \\"In re Kenna Homes Co-op. Corp.\\" (2001); Prindable v. Association of Apartment Owners of 2987 Kalakaua (D. Haw. 2003); Assenberg v. Anacortes Housing Authority (W.D. Wash. 2006). = Landlords = Many landlords have \\"no pets\\" policies for their rental properties, and many landlords that allow pets impose restrictions on the type and size of pets that tenants are allowed to bring into the rental property. Many landlords are reluctant to waive their pet policies and restrictions, even when requested by a tenant who is requesting accommodation of a mental or emotional disability. Nonetheless, most landlords may not legally reject a tenant who has documented qualification for an emotional support animal, nor may a landlord charge any form of pet fee to that tenant. Landlords may be concerned that waiving a \\"no pet\\" policy for one tenant will inspire many others to claim mental illnesses and the need for emotional support animals. Landlords may believe that as more tenants have animals on the property, odors and noises from the animals may deter other tenants from renting and thus lower the value of the rental property. Landlords may also believe that making exceptions to a \\"no pets\\" policy for a tenant's emotional support animal may confuse other tenants who do not understand why one person was allowed an animal while they were not. However, if a tenant documents the need for an emotional support animal under the Fair Housing act or state law, and the landlord is not exempt from those laws, the landlord must allow the tenant to possess an emotional support animal. The FHA does not have a conclusive definition of what type of animal an assistance or companion animal must be, plus the animal does not need to be trained to perform any specific task to be considered an emotional support or companion animal. This means dogs, cats, birds, and other types of companion animals can be considered use for emotional support.https://rew- online.com/2016/10/opinion-the-rules-for-allowing-pets-in-no-pet-buildings . Pet deposits The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and Department of Justice have held that \\"providers may not require persons with disabilities to pay extra fees or deposits as a condition of receiving a reasonable accommodation.\\" In 1990, a HUD administrative judge enjoined owners of an apartment complex from charging a person with a disability a pet deposit fee. The judge held that an auxiliary aid, like a service, guide, or signal dog, may be necessary to afford the individual an equal opportunity to use and enjoy the dwelling unit, including public and common areas. Accordingly, when a tenant qualifies for a service animal or emotional support animal, a landlord may not charge the tenant additional fees in association with the presence of the animal in the rental property. This prohibition extends to pet deposits and fees, even when those fees are charged to other tenants who have pets. A landlord may charge a tenant for damage caused to a rental property by the tenant's emotional support animal, and may deduct the cost of repairs from the tenant's security deposit, but may not increase the security deposit based upon the tenant's possession of an emotional support animal. Exceptions Exceptions may apply to a landlord's obligation to allow a tenant to possess an emotional support animal. For example, owner-occupied buildings with four or fewer rental units are exempt from the federal Fair Housing Act. The Fair Housing Act also exempts private owners of single-family housing sold or rented without the use of a broker, as long as the owner does not own more than three single family homes, as well as housing operated by organizations and private clubs that restrict occupancy to members. Exemptions under state law may be more restrictive than federal exemptions. Even when the Fair Housing Act applies, circumstances may arise under which a landlord may restrict a tenant from possessing an emotional support animal. *If a tenant's emotional support animal compromises the safety of other tenants or their property, or if the animal poses a danger to other tenants, the landlord may not have to allow the tenant in the housing or waive a \\"no pets\\" policy. *If the tenant becomes unable to properly care for his or her emotional support animal, the landlord may be able to restrict the tenant's continuing possession of the animal. *If a tenant is neglecting his or her emotional support animal and the neglect rises to a level where the animal is endangered, then there may be a basis for action by the police or animal control. If any animal is being neglected, local law enforcement or animal control can intervene. * If other more reasonable alternatives exist to lessen the effects of the disability and the tenant has not provided proper documentation of an emotional support animal, a court may not compel a landlord to waive a no pets policy as an accommodation of the tenant's disability. * Even if entitled to possess an emotional support animal, a tenant remains subject to all the other provisions of the lease, including any requirement to maintain his or her residence in a sanitary manner. A landlord may also evict a person with a disability if that person does not comply with legitimate tenancy rules that apply to all tenants. If the requested accommodation (i.e., the waiver of a \\"no pets\\" policy for an emotional support animal) constitutes an undue financial or administrative burden for the landlord, or fundamentally alters the nature of the housing, the landlord may not have to provide the reasonable accommodation. However, as the burden of allowing emotional support animals is generally modest, most landlords have been unsuccessful in arguing a denial of a waiver of a \\"no pets\\" policy on the basis of a claimed extreme burden. = College residence halls and dormitories = On April 25, 2013, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development sent notice to its regional offices that public universities are required to comply with the Fair Housing Act, which includes allowing emotional support animals into college dormitories and residence halls. , colleges in the United States such as St. Mary's College of Maryland were trying to accommodate students with a documented need for emotional support animals.  US Employment  ESA in the workplace Current ADA rules require employers not to discriminate on the grounds of a disability. This means they need to make certain exceptions to service animals brought on the job with their owner. There are questions as to whether these exceptions extend to ESAs, because by law, they are not service animals. There are court cases both for and against ESAs being brought to work. Currently, this area is in a state of flux and until laws are put into place that specifically address this issue, cases will have to be decided as they arise. As it stands now, a person can have their ESA at work as long as they can provide documentation supporting the need.  Air travel in the US  Emotional support animals are allowed to travel on U.S. airlines with their disabled owners at no additional charge. The Air Carrier Access Act established a procedure for modifying pet policies on aircraft to permit a person with a disability to travel with a prescribed emotional support animal, so long as they have appropriate documentation and the animal is not a danger to others and does not engage in disruptive behavior (for example, jumping on people, barking or growling, urinating or defecating in the cabin or gate area, etc.). \\"Unusual\\" animals, including all snakes and other reptiles, can legally be refused. In regards to airline policies affecting persons flying with animals, most airlines charge fees and require the animal to be in a cage that can fit under the seat; if a caged animal cannot be placed under the seat, the animal flies with the luggage. With emotional assistance animals, on the other hand, they are not required to be caged, nor are people charged for flying with an emotional support animal. In 2017, a quarter of a million passengers brought emotional support animals with them on just Delta Air Lines. With the exceptions provided to emotional support animals, many people who do not have a mental disability have tried to bring their animals on a plane and pass them off as emotional support animals. Airlines, such as JetBlue and Southwest, however, typically have policies that passengers flying with emotional support animals must follow. = Conflicts with passengers with animal allergies = The rights of passengers with emotional disabilities to travel with an animal are specifically enshrined in US law; in contrast, the rights of passengers who are allergic to those emotional support animals do not have specific protections and often feel that their right to a safe flight is treated as less important. The Federal Aviation Administration's advice to airlines prioritizes passengers with service animals, but not household pets, over passengers with allergies to those animals. (It does not mention whether emotional support animals should be treated like trained service animals or like household pets in such an instance.) Passengers who are allergic to cats, dogs, or other animals are usually seated in a different part of the airplane, and may be denied boarding, removed from flights, moved to other flights, or required to provide a letter from a licensed physician, dated with the last 10 days, saying that even if they are exposed to animal dander, they will not die before the flight ends. = Required documentation for airlines = The required documentation for US-based airlines is a letter, printed on a healthcare provider's letterhead, that meets all of the following requirements: * is from a currently licensed mental health professional, * is no more than one year old, * states that the passenger has a mental health-related disability listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (but need not say which disability the passenger has), * states that having the animal accompany the passenger is necessary to the passenger‚Äôs mental health or treatment or to assist the passenger, * states that the individual providing the assessment of the passenger is a licensed mental health professional, * states that the passenger is currently being treated by this mental health professional, and * lists the date and type of the professional‚Äôs license and the state or jurisdiction in which it was issued. Writing letters such as this is considered extra-therapeutic administrative paperwork, rather than professional care. The specific requirement to have a letter from a healthcare provider that is providing treatment to the passenger excludes all \\"certificates\\" or letters from websites that sell unofficial registries without providing professional care to the passenger. Some airlines, including Delta and United, additionally require passengers traveling with emotional support animals to complete forms provided by the airline at least 48 hours before departure that certify that the animal is properly vaccinated, in good health, and has been trained to behave well in public. While an airline is allowed to require a passenger traveling with an emotional support animal to provide written documentation that the animal is an emotional support animal, the same is not true for a service animal.  Controversy  Controversies include the behavior of some animals, harm to other people, the problem of widespread fraud, and the scientific inquiry about the benefit of emotional support animals. Emotional support animals may behave differently to trained assistance animals. For instance, due to the lack of training, an emotional support animal may bark or sniff at other people, whereas service dogs are trained not to do so. People with unique disabilities (invisible disability), such as allergy to animal dander, have suffered from allergic attacks triggered by emotional support animals. There is also a concern about people fraudulently acquiring emotional support animals though they are legally not considered disabled. According to one survey, Americans generally believe that a majority of emotional support animals serve a legitimate need, but the more experience the respondents had with service animals and emotional support animals, the more aware they were of fraud. The prevalence of fraud, and the rising popularity of emotional support animals, has increased the number of animals in public places where animals are normally not allowed. Several well- publicized incidents involving emotional support dogs causing injuries to passengers or airline employees on flights have led to further controversy, stricter policies for flights, and a growing movement to institute a national registry and certification process for service dogs and emotional support animals. = Scientific evidence = Researchers have not established that untrained emotional support animals provide any significant benefit to people with mental or emotional disabilities. Interacting with an animal may reduce perceived emotional distress for some people, but the scientific research is limited and of low scientific quality. Existing research suggests that the benefit, if any, is smaller than its proponents hoped for. A small number of studies have found that emotional support animals increased their owners' distress. There is no research on uncommon animals such as hamsters. There is also evidence that requesting exemption letters from psychologists or mental healthcare providers can damage the recipients therapeutic relationship with these professionals, regardless of the outcome of these requests. Ethically, providers of psychotherapy may choose to recommend an emotional support animal for the people they are treating if it will play a temporary part in a larger treatment plan, but not as a form of permanent palliation of symptoms. For permanent situations, therapists often refer the client to a neutral, independent psychologist who can determine whether the individual is disabled and/or would benefit from an emotional support animal. This process is not a careless rubber-stamping of the request; the neutral, independent provider should review the client's records, interview the client, consult with the therapist, and do whatever additional testing is necessary to determine the extent of disability and the appropriateness of the recommendation, and, if necessary, be willing and able to defend the diagnosis and decision to prescribe the animal in court.  Other types of assistance and service animals  Emotional support animals are only one type of animal that is used for people with disabilities or similar issues. Other types of animals used by and for people with disabilities include: * Service animals or assistance dogs: Animals, usually dogs, that have been trained to perform specific tasks for a person with a disability. Subtypes include:  Guide dogs and guide horses: Dogs and miniature horses that have been trained to help a blind person walk independently.  Hearing dogs: Dogs that have been trained to identify sounds for a deaf person, such as an alarm or someone calling the person's name.  Medical response dogs: Dogs that have been trained to notice the onset of a medical condition, such as hypoglycemia in a person with diabetes, and to alert the handler.  Mobility assistance dogs: Typically larger dogs, mobility assistance dogs are trained to help persons who have difficulty walking, such as by pulling a wheelchair, opening doors, or letting the handlers lean on the dogs for stability and support while walking.  Psychiatric service dogs: Dogs that have been trained to perform specific tasks, such as entering a room to determine whether it poses any threat to the handler. This includes autism service dogs.  Seizure response dogs: Similar to medical response dogs, these dogs are trained to alert their handlers to the onset of an epileptic seizure. * Therapy cats and therapy dogs: Cats or dogs that comfort people in difficult situations, such as people in hospice care. Unlike assistance dogs, therapy animals are not usually trained to perform specific tasks, and the people they interact with may not be disabled. Unlike emotional service animals, they are not necessarily owned by a person with a disability, but instead visit different people, who may or may not be disabled, through programs in healthcare institutions, schools, or disaster areas.

She is also a singer/songwriter, TV producer, voice over artist and high end property developer. Children's ITV On Monday 3 April 1989 the contract to produce Children's ITV was taken over by an independent production company, called Stonewall Productions. As well as doing the regular afternoons service, in the summer of '89, they also had to provide a mornings service too, which was a rival to But... First This! on Children's BBC. Downs & radio presenter Clive Warren were both hired to present the mornings service, which ran from 9:25am to 12:30pm on weekdays throughout July and August. Also, the puppet character Scally the Dog often appeared in the mornings with them too. Additionally during this time, they both took separate turns as stand-ins for fellow Children's ITV presenter Jerry Foulkes in the afternoons, when he was away on holiday. On 2 January 1990 (following Foulkes' departure on 22 December 1989) Downs took over co-presenting the Children's ITV afternoons service, along with Scally. Warren returned to Children's ITV in summer 1990, to present the mornings service on his own, but he and Downs did occasionally swap roles, with him doing the afternoons and she doing the mornings instead sometimes. In September 1990, Children's ITV's afternoon service became slightly longer, now running from 3:55 to 5:10pm each weekday. Downs and Scally continued to present Children's ITV's afternoons service until 29 March 1991, when Central Television regained the contract to produce Children's ITV back from Stonewall. They were replaced by a solo Tommy Boyd, who had already presented Children's ITV once before in the 1980s, now returning for a second time on 1 April 1991. However, on 3 January 2003 CITV celebrated its 20th birthday, with a special one-off programme called CITV's 20th Birthday Bash. Downs and Scally both appeared on the programme, alongside other past and present Children's ITV presenters, such as Roland Rat, Matthew Kelly and Michael Underwood. Other work After she left Children's ITV in 1991, Downs pursued a singing career and was a signed recording artist with Perfecto, Sony and Wildlife Records, also providing backing vocals for many artists, including Steve Hackett (a former member of the rock group Genesis). She is involved with music production, songwriting, Jeanne also helped to devise and manage Pop Academy a 'pop school' at the ACM in Guildford, Surrey. She is also a founder member of a 'live' band called Madison Square. She also does much voice-over and narration work, including many commercials. She is married to record producer Aron Friedman. She also designs, builds and remodels high end properties in Los Angeles and Surrey.

The station is currently owned by Henson Media and features news, sports, weather and music features programming from ABC Radio News and Westwood One, as well as locally produced programming. The station can be heard during daylight hours in neighboring Evansville, Indiana and Owensboro, Kentucky. WSON first signed on ten days after the attack on Pearl Harbor, and was owned by Henderson businessman Hecht Lackey. For most of its first four decades on the air, WSON was a daytime-only station, signing off at sunset in order to protect CJBC in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. However, a treaty between the United States and Canada signed in the mid-1980s allowed WSON and other daytimers that went off the air to protect Canadian clear-channel stations, to begin nighttime operations as well. WSON must use a directional antenna from sunset to sunrise, with the signal oriented to the southwest; this protects the skywave signal of CJBC in Toronto, Ontario Canada. 860 AM is a Canadian clear-channel frequency. Recent developments In July 2010, owner Henry Lackey, the son of station founder Hecht Lackey, announced that he had agreed to sell WSON to Ed Henson, which owns WMSK-AM-FM in Morganfield and Sturgis, Kentucky. The deal received FCC approval and was consummated soon thereafter.Stinnett, Chuck. WSON sale planned to Union County station owner. The Henderson Gleaner, 2010-07-12. In September 2011, WSON began simulcasting on an FM translator, W243CU (96.5 FM), which is licensed to Sebree, Kentucky. W243CU, which has an effective radiated power of 250 watts, can be heard up to 30 miles in any direction from its transmitter site in the Wolf Hills north of Henderson. It allows listeners in Evansville and surrounding communities to listen to WSON's programming after nightfall, when the AM station has to adjust its coverage.

This is a marine-modified version of Volkswagen Groups 3.0 V6 24v TDI CR automobile engine. Marine automobile engines are types of automobile petrol- or diesel engines that have been specifically modified for use in the marine environment. The differences include changes made for the operating in a marine environment, safety, performance, and for regulatory requirements. The act of modifying is called 'marinisation'. All of the \\"Big 3\\" American auto companies have had engines marinised at some point. Chrysler is notable, because the company marinised engines in-house through Chrysler Marine, as well as selling engines to third parties such as Indmar or Pleasurecraft Marine. General Motors marine automobile engines are based on a gasoline truck engine. That means four-bolt main bearing caps instead of just two; sometimes the crankshaft is forged steel and the pistons an upgraded aluminum alloy. Most importantly the camshaft profile is different with the overlap ground to 112 degrees instead of 110. Expansion plugs are bronze to better fight corrosion. The head gasket's metal O-ring is also more corrosion resistant. Examples of the opposite of a marinized car engine also exist, e.g. the 6,2 or 6,5 liter Detroit Diesel V8 engine found in Chevrolet and GMC utility vehicles was originally a marine engine adapted for automotive use.

Origins El Puente was begun by Jos√© Mario Rodr√≠guez (b. 1940, G√ºira de Melena - d. 2002, Madrid), a young poet who perceived the post-revolution literary world in Havana as closed to new writers. \\"[Lunes de Revoluci√≥n] only covered people connected to the director Guillermo Cabrera Infante, and they never reviewed books by young writers.\\" He wanted to create a publishing project that would be open to everyone, \\"Especially young people, new people.

The books they shared included authors such as Borges, Lautr√©amont, Rimbaud, Cuban poet Emilio Ballagas, Nerval, Rilke, Tagore, Mayakovsky, Salvatore Quasimodo, Essenin, poet Vicente Huidobro, Proust, Seferis, Dylan Thomas, and Holderlin. Within a short time they began publishing as a group. Ana Mar√≠a Simo became co-director of the project,Rodr√≠guez, Jos√© Mario. (2002) \\"La ver√≠dica histor√≠a de Ediciones El Puente, La Habana, 1961‚Äì1965 \\", Revista Hispano Cubana, Madrid, number 6, winter 2002. largely focusing on the production end and editing fiction. Other core members included Gerardo Fulleda Le√≥n, Nancy Morej√≥n, Ana Justina, and Reinaldo Garc√≠a Ramos (Reinaldo Felipe), who later made up the board of directors. Impact In practical terms, the impact of the group can be seen in what and who they published. Self-subsidizedFunds came largely from Jos√© Mario's father (\\"La ver√≠dica historia\\") and Ana Mar√≠a Simo, who was working as a journalist. and publishing with editorial independence, even after they were persuaded to ally themselves with the Writers Union (Uni√≥n de Escritores y Artistas de Cuba - UNEAC), El Puente introduced dozens of new voices to the literary scene, eventually publishing more than twenty writers and offering more than three dozen books of poetry, theater, fiction, and folklore. Writers who got their start with El Puente include prize-winning poet and translator Nancy Morej√≥n, playwright Gerardo Fulleda Le√≥n, now director of the Rita Montaner theater company in Havana, folklorist Miguel Barnet, and playwright and lesbian activist Ana Mar√≠a Simo. El Puente's long-term impact as a movement is more difficult to gauge. Emerging from the euphoria of the revolution, they were seen by some, including themselves, as embodying the post-revolution generation. Cuban- Chilean poet Alberto Baeza Flores in particular hailed them as a kind of unifying movement, gathering together \\"a generation of young writers, which was the first surge in tandem with the Cuban revolution, and which is a brilliant and critical generation.\\" Baeza Flores, Alberto (1980-12-11), Miami Herald, in \\"La ver√≠dica histor√≠a\\". They deliberately worked in opposition to the previous generations that they saw as excluding and elitist. They were especially determined to assert their intellectual freedom and claim all writing that reflected the gamut of Cuban society, even from writers that left the island. Anthologies, such as La Nov√≠sima Poes√≠a Cubana (1962) edited by Reinaldo Garcia Ramos and Ana Mar√≠a Simo, in part expressed this literary ethos that had less to do with rigorous craft or a common style, than fresh points of view. And while Simo's book of short stories, Las F√°bulas, was one of the few ever reviewed, the books regularly found an audience, and some of the other arts communities were also enthusiastic about El Puente. Book covers were designed by young architecture students and visual artists, including Gilberto Segu√≠, David Bigelman and Jos√© Lorenzo. A collaborative performance with \\"feeling\\" composers including , Cesar Portillo de la Luz, , Ela O'Farril, and others at the El Gato Tuerto had fans lined up down the block. They had exchanges of ideas with playwrights like Eugenio Hern√°ndez Espinosa, even though they weren't necessarily published by El Puente.Grant, Mar√≠a (2002). \\"Nancy Morej√≥n: Sobre el Puente\\".

A young philosophy professor, Josefina Su√°rez, also became central to the group, introducing some of her students, like the poet Liliam Moro. Not everyone agreed that El Puente represented the post-revolution generation, or that they served any useful purpose at all. At the time, critics such as Jes√∫s D√≠az, for instance, said they did not represent anything except a very small \\"dissolute\\" fringe, and charged not only that some of the writing was uneven, but that El Puente was \\"a politically and aesthetically erroneous phenomenon.\\"D√≠az, Jes√∫s, \\"Encuesta\\". La Gaceta de Cuba, no. 50, April‚ÄìSeptember 1966. A criticism easier to divorce from politics was that Jos√© Mario used the group, perhaps too frequently, to publish his own poems. In more recent times, several contemporary researchers in Cuba seem to see its diversity as one of El Puente's greatest contributions. Diversity The core group had as many women as men, and women are central in the list of published works (see Publications). Most of the writers were poor or working-class. Many were blackGarc√≠a Ramos, Reinaldo. (Fall-Winter 2002). \\"Introducci√≥n: Jos√© Mario, el entusiasmo esperanzado\\". La Habana Elegante. Dallas.

After the revolution, one of the first occasions homophobia went from a private attitude to public policy was during the National Meeting of Poets (Encuentro Nacional de Poetas) held in Camag√ºey in 1960 shortly before El Puente was begun. Colonel Alberto Bayo, a representative of the government, used the opportunity to launch an invective against homosexuals, calling them \\"bad seed,\\" and warning they were going to \\"pervert the revolution.\\" That night large placards appeared that said, \\"Fags, dykes, out!\\"(Rein Conversation) In 1965, the government set up concentration camps, euphemistically called Military Units to Aid Production (UMAP), where \\"social scum\\" From 1965 to 1967, the Government forced many priests, pastors, and others \\"who made religion a way of life\\" into forced-labor camps called Military Units to Aid Production (UMAPS), alongside homosexuals, vagrants, and others considered by the regime to be \\"social scum.\\"Cuba: International Religious Freedom Report 2005, U.S. Dept. of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor (mostly gay men, but also Jehovah's Witnesses, and those perceived as disaffected) were interned behind barbed wire and used as forced labor until the UMAPs ended in 1967.

Ginsberg and gay scapegoating As social pressures intensified, and El Puente become increasingly well known, members of the group began to draw more and more attention from state security. In 1964, Ana Mar√≠a Simo was jailed for several weeks and interrogated.Almendros, Nestor and Jim√©nez Leal, Orlando (1984). Mauvaise Conduite. Documentary film about abuses of LGBT people in Cuba. 115 minutes. France. The openly gay men in the group, such as Jos√© Mario, started being regularly detained, targeted for their homosexuality, but also because they read the wrong books (Gide), listened to the wrong music (The Beatles) and once or twice had drunken scenes in the middle of the night. A couple of members were caught stealing library books. In January 1965, Allen Ginsberg, the openly gay poet, Buddhist, and drug-user, was invited to the island by Casa de las Am√©ricas to be part of the jury for that year's poetry prize. Besides meeting writers like Julio Cort√°zar, Mario Vargas Llosa, Camilo Jos√© Cela and Nicanor Parra, Ginsberg found his way to members of El Puente who had been corresponding with him, and intended to publish a translation of Howl. > \\"His visits to my house, and that we appeared together in various public > places, like the Writers Union cafeteria and at a reception at the Casa de > las Am√©ricas and his explosive declarations about current politics and the > persecution of homosexuals, put us, as they say, on everybody's lips.

In a > matter of days, Ginsberg was expelled from the country.\\" Though on that occasion charges were dropped, afterwards, publishing and distributing were increasingly difficult for El Puente, which was already falling apart from internal and external pressures. Jos√© Mario moved back into his parents' house, and rarely stepped into the street where he was vulnerable: \\"They detained me 17 times.\\" Books at the printers were confiscated, and finally, \\"the publisher was abruptly closed by governmental authorities.\\" El Caim√°n vs. El Puente Harassment peaked in 1966 after the group had already ceased publication, when El Puente was publicly attacked by Jes√∫s D√≠az, an editor of El Caim√°n Barbudo, a literary magazine created and funded by the Communist Youth. Unlike El Puente, they were straight, mostly men, almost all white, and largely recruited from the university. Jesus Diaz was an assistant professor. He used the La Gaceta, a magazine of the Writers Union, to publicly declare that members of El Puente were \\"generally bad as artists\\" but, more dangerously, \\"the most dissolute and negative segment of their generation\\" and \\"a politically and aesthetically erroneous phenomenon.\\" Coming just a few months after the internment of gay men had officially begun, his statement was a shock to the group. \\"They declared a war of extermination on us.\\" A week after Diaz' first attack appeared, Jos√© Mario was summoned to a concentration camp. In El Puente's response, written and signed by Ana Mar√≠a Simo, she defended the merits of El Puente, and called Diaz's statement an \\"acto de delaci√≥n intelectual\\" an \\"intellectualized denunciation\\".Simo, Ana Mar√≠a, \\"Encuesta Generacional II: Repuesta a Jes√∫s D√≠az\\". La Gaceta de Cuba, no. 50, April‚ÄìSeptember 1966. Jes√∫s Diaz published a long rebuttal, repeating his attack, and personally taking aim at Ana Mar√≠a Simo as well.D√≠az, Jes√∫s, \\"Jes√∫s D√≠az responde a Ana Mar√≠a Simo: El √öltimo Puente\\". La Gaceta de Cuba, no. 50, April‚ÄìSeptember 1966. Years later, Jes√∫s D√≠az, who himself left the island for Spain, blamed it on the age, and literary quarrels, \\"Nevertheless... I recognize what I did and I'd like to offer my regrets to Ana Mar√≠a Simo and other authors that could have felt attacked by me at that time.\\" D√≠az, Jes√∫s, \\"El fin de otra ilusi√≥n.

Guillermo Rodr√≠guez Rivera, another one of the editors, later defended El Caim√°n, blaming the Communist Youth for forbidding them, \\"to publish any young writer or artist which was homosexual. It wasn't a decision that we made at the magazine‚Ä¶\\" Sequel After the exchange with El Caim√°n, and the internment of Jos√© Mario, the work of El Puente was largely erased. Some members emigrated, and those who remained were \\"endiablados\\", demonized. For decades, Nancy Morej√≥n was hesitant to speak out in groups: \\"I thought if I raised my hand to say something, somebody would be sure to say, \\"Shut up, those people from El Puente...\\" I can tell you that now, but before we didn't talk about these things...\\" Scholars have begun to research the group, and in its July‚ÄìAugust 2005 issue, the Gaceta de Cuba published a series of related pieces in a first attempt to grapple with the history of El Puente. Since then, other books have appeared, including the 2011 work Ediciones El Puente en la Habana de los a√±os 60: Lecturas cr√≠ticas y libros de poes√≠a, edited and introduced by Jes√∫s J. Barquet.

The Blagoveshchensk Fortified Region was created in 1932 and, from 1965 known as the 33rd Motor Rifle Division, continues to serve in the Russian Ground Forces to this day. In 2009 it was downsized into the 39th Separate Motor Rifle Brigade. Pre-war origin The 33rd MRD has a most unusual lineage which begun with the order by the Special Red Banner Far Eastern Army (OKDVA) No. 30/010 dated 18 March 1932 to the 4th Directorate of Works to construct the Blagoveshchensk Fortified Region () UR, with the goal of protecting the left bank of the Amur river. Subsequently, another order was issued (No. 176/72) on 31 October 1932, directing that the Fortified Region be included in the Army order of battle. The newly constituted Fortified Region was numbered 101st UR and included the following units: *108th independent machine-gun battalion; *256th independent machine-gun battalion. By the order of the Peoples' Commissar of the Military District No.0030 of 5 July 1939, the Fortified District became a part of the newly created Front Group and was subordinated to the 2nd Independent Red-Banner Far Eastern Army. From 1 August to 1 December 1939, on the basis of the 189th independent Rifle Regiment of the Blagoveshchensk UR of the 2nd Independent Red-banner Far Eastern Army, were formed 20 independent platoons of () caponnier artillery,Note: a French term or phrase in fortification, is a passage made from one work to another, of 10 or 12 feet wide, and about 5 feet deep, covered on each side by a parapet, terminating in a glacis. Sometimes they are covered with planks and earth. each with 11 personnel, altogether 220 people, according to the personnel establishment No. 9/913. World War II Service In October ‚Äì November 1941 in the city of Blagoveshchenk of the Amur region, on the basis of the 189th independent Rifle Regiment of the Blagoveshchensk UR, were formed the 1st and 2nd Independent Rifle Brigades of the 101st Fortified Region (2nd Red Banner Army of the Far Eastern Front). On 17 March 1942 the two brigades became the 258th and 259th Independent Rifle Brigades. On 22 November 1944 the 342nd Rifle Division (2nd formation) of 2nd Red Banner Army of the Far-Eastern Front was formed in the environs of Blagoveshchenk (Amur region) on the basis of 258th independent Rifle Brigade and 259th independent Rifle Brigade. The commemorative formation day of the division was set on 1 December 1944. The following units were included in the division's formation at the time: *357th Rifle Regiment; *377th Rifle Regiment; *389th Rifle Regiment; *39th Artillery Regiment; *480th Self-propelled Artillery Battalion; *171st Independent Anti- Tank Destroyer Artillery Battalion; *162nd Combat Engineer Battalion; *1036th Independent Signal Battalion ; *236th Medical and Sanitary Battalion; *58th Independent Reconnaissance Company; *571st Motor transport Company; *22nd Chemical Protection Company. The 357th Rifle Regiment was formed from the 2nd and 3rd sub-machine gun battalions of the 258th independent Rifle Brigade in the village Novotroitskoe of the Blagoveshchensk region (Amur region) about 20‚Äì25 km from Blagoveshchenk, and its first regimental commander was Major I.T. Rudnik. On 15 March 1945 according to the Decree of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, the 357th Rifle Regiment was entrusted with its combat banner. In the middle of May 1945 the 342nd Rifle Division was brought out into the dunes along the Amur where it began to create the second defence entrenchment line. The division built defensive installations for two more months, then force marched 60 kilometers, and began work on new entrenchments. In July 1945 the 342nd Rifle Division was included in the composition of the 87th Rifle Corps of the Coastal Group of Forces (subsequently the 1st Far East Front). The division was relocated into the Ussuri Krai, and lived in camp tents near Lesozavodska. At the start of military operations against Japan, the 87th Rifle Corps was in the reserve of the 1st Far-Eastern Front and was located in the region of the town of Lesozavodsk. After the invasion of Manchuria On the night of 2 September 1945 the division was embarked on transports and was directed to the occupation of islands Iturup and Urup. Two regiments landed on Iturup island, an artillery regiment (less a battalion) and the staff of the division, while on the island of Urup two other regiments were landed. The 342nd RD completed a 100 kilometer march from Kholmsk to Korsakov and during the march celebrated the great Victory Day on 3 September 1945. One division and the 113th Rifle Brigade were located in the southern part of the Kurile Islands, and two other rifle divisions in the southern part of Sakhalin Island, strengthened by one tank brigade from the front assets. In Korsakov, the division was living in dugouts, and then began to build barracks at the station Dachnaya (389th RR). The division spent two winters living in the tents. After the war, Anita township on Sakhalin became the garrison of the 357th Rifle Regiment. Post-war service By the directive of the Stavka of the Military High Command from 10 September 1945 to 15 October 1945 2nd Far East Front was redesignated the Far East Military District with the staff in the city of Toyokhara (now Yuzhno Sakhalinsk). By 30 December 1945 all rifle divisions of the military district were reorganized with the new organization (with the divisional artillery brigades) and were authorised an establishment of 8132 personnel each. In 1948 the 192nd Tank self-propelled Regiment was formed from personnel of the 342nd Rifle Division on the base of the 480th independent self-propelled Artillery Battalion. In October 1953, by the order of the Minister of Defense of the USSR dated 23 April 1953, the staff of the Far East Military District, the former 2nd Far-Eastern Front, was reformed into the administration of the 15th Army, with its headquarters at Yuzhno- Sakhalinsk. The command staff of the 87th Rifle Corps was brought back to the continent. On 4 March 1955, units were renumbered. 87th Rifle Corps was re- formed into 2nd Rifle Corps; the 342nd Rifle Division was renamed the 56th Rifle Division; and the 258th Rifle Red Banner Division ‚Äì became the 41st Rifle Red Banner Division (144th and 465th Rifle Regiments); In March 1957, rifle divisions were reformed into motor-rifle divisions. 2nd Rifle Corps was re-formed into 2nd Army Corps On 17 May 1957, the 56th Rifle Division became the 56th Motor-Rifle Division (in this case the 357th Rifle Regiment was renamed as the 390th Rifle Regiment);Michael Holm, 33rd Red Banner Motorised Rifle Division, accessed February 2015. The 41st Rifle Red Banner Division was renamed the 41st Motor-Rifle Red Banner Division; and the 79th Rifle Sakhalin Division was renamed the 79th Motor-Rifle Sakhalin Division. On 28 March 1960 the 2nd Army Corps was reformed at Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, Sakhalin Oblast. It became the 51st Army (Soviet Union) in 1977, and the 56th MRD (later 33rd MRD) stayed under the 51st Army's command until 1997. On 17 November 1964 the 56th Motor-Rifle Division was renamed the 33rd Motor Rifle Division. The division was moved into the 68th Army Corps in 1997.

The stated purpose of the expedition was to investigate the progress of the war by the South Vietnamese regime and its US military advisers against the Viet Cong insurgency. The mission was led by Victor Krulak and Joseph Mendenhall. Krulak was a major general in the United States Marine Corps, while Mendenhall was a senior Foreign Service Officer experienced in dealing with Vietnamese affairs. The four-day whirlwind trip was launched on September 6, 1963, the same day as a National Security Council (NSC) meeting, and came in the wake of increasingly strained relations between the United States and South Vietnam. Civil unrest gripped South Vietnam as Buddhist demonstrations against the religious discrimination of President Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Di·ªám's Catholic regime escalated. Following the raids on Buddhist pagodas on August 21 that left a death toll ranging up to a few hundred, the US authorized investigations into a possible coup through a cable to US Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. In their submissions to the NSC, Krulak presented an optimistic report on the progress of the war, while Mendenhall presented a bleak picture of military failure and public discontent. Krulak disregarded the popular support for the Viet Cong, feeling that the Vietnamese soldiers' efforts in the field would not be affected by the public's unease with Di·ªám's policies. Mendenhall focused on gauging the sentiment of urban Vietnamese and concluded that Di·ªám's policies increased the possibility of religious civil war, and were causing the South Vietnamese to believe that life under the Viet Cong would improve the quality of their lives. The divergent reports led US President John F. Kennedy to ask his two advisers \\"You two did visit the same country, didn't you?\\" The inconclusive report was the subject of bitter and personal debate among Kennedy's senior advisers. Various courses of action towards Vietnam were discussed, such as fostering a regime change or taking a series of selective measures designed to cripple the influence of Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Nhu, Di·ªám's brother and chief political adviser. Nhu and his wife Madame Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Nhu were seen as the major causes of the political problems in South Vietnam. The inconclusive result of Krulak and Mendenhall's expedition resulted in a follow-up mission, the McNamara‚ÄìTaylor mission.  Background  After the Hu·∫ø Ph·∫≠t ƒê·∫£n shootings on May 8, civil unrest broke out in South Vietnam. Nine Buddhists were shot by the Roman Catholic regime of President Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Di·ªám after defying a government ban on the flying of Buddhist flags on Vesak, the birthday of Gautama Buddha and marching in an anti-government protest.Jacobs, pp. 142‚Äì143. Following the shootings, Buddhist leaders began to lobby Di·ªám for religious equality and compensation and justice for the families of the victims. With Di·ªám remaining recalcitrant, the protests escalated.Jacobs, pp. 144‚Äì145. The self-immolation of Buddhist monk Th√≠ch Qu·∫£ng ƒê·ª©c at a busy Saigon intersection became a public relations disaster for the Di·ªám regime, as photos of the event made front-page headlines worldwide and became a symbol of Di·ªám's policies.Jacobs, pp. 147‚Äì149. As protests continued, the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) Special Forces loyal to Di·ªám's brother Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Nhu conducted the X√° L·ª£i Pagoda raids on August 21, leaving a death toll estimated to be up to several hundred and causing extensive damage under the declaration of martial law. Universities and high schools were closed amid mass pro-Buddhist protests. In the meantime, the fight against the Viet Cong insurgency had begun to lose intensity amid rumors of sectarian infighting amongst ARVN troops.Jacobs, pp. 152‚Äì154. This was compounded by the plotting of a coup by various ARVN officers, which distracted attention from the insurgency. After the pagoda raids, the Kennedy administration sent Cable 243 to the US Embassy, Saigon, ordering an exploration of alternative leadership possibilities.Jacobs, pp. 160‚Äì163.  Initiation and expedition  At the end of the National Security Council (NSC) meeting on September 6, it was agreed that the priority was to obtain more information on the situation in Vietnam. US Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara proposed sending Marine Corps Major General Victor Krulak on an immediate fact-finding trip. The NSC agreed that Joseph Mendenhall‚Äîa Foreign Service Officer with Vietnam experience‚Äîwould accompany him and the pair began the mission later that day. On their return trip to Washington, D.C., Krulak and Mendenhall were to bring John Mecklin and Rufus Phillips back from Saigon to report. Mecklin was the United States Information Service (USIS) director, while Phillips served as the director of rural programs for United States Operations Mission (USOM) and as an advisor for the Strategic Hamlet Program. The State Department sent the Saigon embassy a detailed cable containing questions about Vietnamese public opinion across all strata of society. In Krulak's words, the objective was to observe \\"the effect of recent events upon the attitudes of the Vietnamese in general, and upon the war effort against the Viet Cong\\". In a four-day trip, the two men traveled throughout Vietnam before returning to Washington to file their reports. Krulak visited 10 locations in all four Corps zones of the ARVN and spoke with US Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr., the head of US forces in Vietnam General Paul Harkins and his staff, 87 US advisors and 22 ARVN officers. Mendenhall went to Saigon, Hu·∫ø, Da Nang and several other provincial cities, talking primarily to Vietnamese friends. Their estimates of the situation were the opposite. Mecklin wrote afterwards that it \\"was a remarkable assignment, to travel twenty-four thousand miles and assess a situation as complex as Vietnam and return in just four days. It was a symptom of the state the US Government was in\\". The mission was marked by the tension between its leaders. Mendenhall and Krulak intensely disliked one another, speaking to each other only when necessary. Mecklin and Krulak became embroiled in a dispute during the return flight. Krulak disapproved of Mecklin's decision to bring television footage that had been censored by the Di·ªám regime back to the US, believing the action was a violation of sovereignty. After a long and bitter argument aboard the aircraft, Krulak called upon Mecklin to leave the film in Alaska during a refueling stop at Elmendorf Air Force Base, further suggesting that the USIS director remain with the film in Alaska.Jones, pp. 356‚Äì357.Tucker, p. 263.  Report and debriefing  alt=A portrait of a middle-aged man, looking to the left in a half-portrait/profile. He has chubby cheeks, parts his hair to the side and wears a suit and tie. The NSC reconvened on the morning of September 10 to hear the delegation's reports. Mendenhall had experience in Vietnamese affairs, having served under the previous US Ambassador Elbridge Durbrow. Durbrow had urged Di·ªám on a number of occasions to implement political reform. Krulak was a marine known for his belief in using military action to achieve foreign affairs objectives. His temperament earned him the nickname \\"Brute\\", which originated from his wrestling career at the Naval Academy. The Deputy Secretary of Defense Roswell Gilpatric noted that Mendenhall was regarded \\"with great suspicion on the Virginia side of the river [the Pentagon, headquarters of the Defense Department]\\", whereas Krulak was \\"universally liked and trusted in the Pentagon, both on the civilian and military side\\".Jones, p. 357. The backgrounds of Krulak and Mendenhall were reflected in their opposite analyses of the war. Krulak gave a highly optimistic analysis of military progress and discounted the effect of the Buddhist crisis on the ARVN's fight against the Viet Cong. His conclusion was that \\"[t]he shooting war is still going ahead at an impressive pace. It has been affected adversely by the political crisis, but the impact is not great.\\" left Krulak asserted that a substantial amount of fighting was still required, particularly in the Mekong Delta, which was regarded as the Viet Cong's strongest region. Krulak asserted that all levels of the ARVN officer corps were conscious of the Buddhist crisis but he believed that most had not allowed religious beliefs to negatively affect their internal military relationships to a substantial degree. He believed that the ARVN officers were obedient and could be expected to carry out any order they regarded as lawful. Krulak further asserted that the political crisis had not significantly damaged bilateral military ties. Moving along to the Vietnamese view of their leaders, Krulak predicted that there was dissatisfaction among the officers, which he believed was mainly directed at Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Nhu, the younger brother of Di·ªám who was widely seen as the power behind the regime.Jacobs, pp. 86‚Äì87.Jacobs, pp. 111‚Äì112.Tucker, p. 290.Karnow, pp. 246, 250. Krulak believed that most officers wanted to see the back of Nhu but that few were willing to resort to a coup. Krulak reported that three US advisers strongly criticized the Nhus and advocated the pair's departure from South Vietnam to avoid a public relations disaster at the United Nations. Krulak felt that these problems were outweighed by what he believed to be a successful military effort and that the war would be won irrespective of the political leadership. He predicted that the ARVN had little ability to facilitate an improvement in governance and felt that they would not flex whatever muscle they had. Krulak optimistically concluded, Mendenhall disagreed and argued that the anti-Di·ªám sentiment had reached a level where the collapse of civilian rule was possible. He reported a \\"reign of terror\\" in Saigon, Hu·∫ø and Da Nang, observing that the popular hatred usually reserved for the Nhus had spread to the generally respected Di·ªám. Mendenhall asserted that many Vietnamese had come to believe that life under Di·ªám worse than being ruled by the Viet Cong. Mendenhall thought that a civil war on religious grounds was possible. He predicted that the war could only be won with a regime change, otherwise South Vietnam would collapse into sectarian infighting or a massive communist offensive. The contradictory nature of the reports prompted Kennedy's famous query, \\"You two did visit the same country, didn't you?\\" = Debate = Krulak attempted to explain the contrasting assessments by pointing out that Mendenhall had surveyed urban areas, while he ventured into the countryside \\"where the war is\\". Krulak asserted that political issues in Saigon would not hamper military progress, stating \\"We can stagger through to win the war with Nhu remaining in control.\\" Assistant Secretary of State Roger Hilsman asserted that the difference between the contrasting reports \\"was the difference between a military and a political view\\". During the debate over the differences in outlook, Mendenhall asserted that Saigon had suffered \\"a virtually complete breakdown\\" following the pagoda raids. Mendenhall reported that Vietnamese public servants feared being seen with Americans. He recalled one visit when he had to remain quiet while his Vietnamese host crept around the room, searching for hidden microphones. Mendenhall asserted that \\"Saigon was heavy with an atmosphere of fear and hate\\" and that the people feared Di·ªám more than the Viet Cong. He reported many public servants no longer slept at home due to a fear of midnight arrests by Nhu's secret police. Many officials had recently spent the bulk of their day negotiating the release of their children, who had been incarcerated for participating in pro-Buddhist protests. Mendenhall asserted that internal turmoil was now a higher priority than the war against the communists. Mendenhall denounced Saigon's reconciliation and goodwill gestures towards the Buddhists as a public relations stunt. He reported that monks from provincial areas who had been arrested in Saigon for demonstrating were not returned to their places of origin as promised. Mendenhall noted that when the monks were released, Di·ªám's officials retained their identification papers. This resulted in their re- arrest upon attempting to leave the capital. The monks were then branded as Viet Cong because they did not have government identification papers. As news of such tactics spread across the capital, some monks sought refuge in the Saigon homes of ARVN officers. Mendenhall insisted that the United States was responsible for the situation because it had helped the Ngo family gain power, armed and funded it. He reasoned that as Di·ªám used the arms against his own people, Washington also shared responsibility. He stated that \\"a refusal to act would be just as much interference in Vietnam's affairs as acting\\".Jones, p. 358. Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Nhu (pictured right) meeting US Vice President alt=Tall Caucasian man standing in profile at left in a white suit and tie shakes hands with a smaller black-haired Asian man in a white shirt, dark suit and tie. According to the Pentagon Papers, \\"the critical failure of both reports was to understand the fundamental political role that the army was coming to play in Vietnam\\". The papers concluded the ARVN was the only institution capable of deposing and replacing Di·ªám. Di·ªám and Nhu fully realized the potential threat, responding with the divide and conquer paradigm. They usurped the prerogative of senior officer promotion and appointed generals based on loyalty to the palace, giving orders directly to officers.Karnow, pp. 252‚Äì253. This action caused deep distrust among the senior officers and fragmented their power. Krulak failed to realize that if the situation deteriorated to the point where discontent with Di·ªám posed the possibility of a communist victory, the generals would intervene in politics because of what would happen to them under communist rule. Neither Krulak nor Mendenhall seemed to anticipate that if a military junta came to power, the divisive effect of Di·ªám's promotion politics would manifest itself as the generals vied for power. Neither of the pair put any emphasis on the detrimental effects that would have been caused by political infighting among the generals. During the NSC meeting, Frederick Nolting‚Äîwho preceded Lodge as US Ambassador to South Vietnam‚Äîtook issue with Mendenhall's analysis.Hammer, p. 208. Regarded as a Di·ªám apologist,Tucker, p. 308. Nolting pointed out that Mendenhall had been pessimistic about South Vietnam for several years. Mecklin reinforced and pushed Mendenhall's view further, calling on the administration to apply direct pressure on Saigon by suspending non-military aid, in an attempt to cause a regime change. In Mecklin's words: The Pentagon Papers opined that Mecklin understood the pitfalls of a military junta that Krulak and Mendenhall had overlooked. Regardless, Mecklin concluded that the US should proceed in fostering a regime change, accept the consequences, and contemplate the introduction of US combat troops to stop a possible Viet Cong victory. The NSC meeting then heard Phillips' bleak prognosis of the situation in the Mekong Delta. He claimed that the Strategic Hamlet Program was a shambles in the delta, stating that they were \\"being chewed to pieces by the Viet Cong\\". When it was noted that Phillips had recently witnessed a battle in the delta, Kennedy asked Phillips for his assessment. Phillips replied: \\"Well, I don't like to contradict General Krulak, but I have to tell you, Mr. President, that we're not winning the war, particularly in the delta. The troops are paralysed, they're in the barracks, and this is what is actually going on in one province that's right next to Saigon.\\" Phillips asserted that removing Nhu was the only way to improve the situation. Phillips asserted that the only means of removing Nhu was to bring in Colonel Edward Lansdale, the CIA operative who had consolidated Di·ªám's position a decade earlier,Tucker, p. 220. a proposal that Kennedy dismissed. Phillips recommended three measures: * Terminate aid to the ARVN Special Forces of Colonel L√™ Quang Tung, who took his orders directly from the palace and not the army command.Hammer, p. 130. Tung had led the raids on Buddhist pagodas on August 21 in which hundreds were killed and widespread physical destruction occurred.Jones, pp. 297‚Äì298. The Special Forces were used mainly for repressing dissidents rather than fighting communists.Tucker, p. 227. * Cut funds to the Motion Picture Center, which produced hagiographic films about the Nhus. * Pursue covert actions aimed at dividing and discrediting Tung and Major General T√¥n Th·∫•t ƒê√≠nh.Jones, pp. 358‚Äì359. Dinh was the military governor of Saigon and the Commander of the ARVN III Corps. Dinh was the youngest general in the history of the ARVN, primarily due to his loyalty to the Ngo family.Tucker, p. 404.Jacobs, p. 169. In the ensuing debate, Kennedy asked Phillips what would happen if Nhu responded to the cuts by diverting money away from the army to prop up his personal schemes. When Kennedy asked if Nhu would blame the US for any resulting military deterioration, Phillips replied that the ARVN would revolt, because the ARVN officers who were on Viet Cong hit lists would not allow the communists to run loose. Phillips said that if Nhu tried to divert military aid away from the troops to prop up his personal schemes, the Americans could deliver the money straight to the countryside in suitcases. = Robust disagreement = US Vice President right The meeting became confrontational when Krulak interrupted Phillips, asserting that American military advisers on the ground rejected the USOM officer's assessments. Phillips conceded that although the overall military situation had improved, this was not the case in the crucial delta areas. Phillips noted that the provincial military adviser in Long An Province adjacent to Saigon, had reported that the Viet Cong had overrun 200 Strategic Hamlets in the previous week, forcing the villagers to dismantle the settlement. McNamara shook his head at the radically divergent reports. When Krulak derided Phillips, Assistant Secretary of State W. Averell Harriman could no longer restrain himself and called the general \\"a damn fool\\". Phillips diplomatically took over from Harriman and asserted that it was a battle for hearts and minds rather than pure military metrics.Jones, p. 359. Mecklin generated more disquiet by advocating the use of American combat troops to unseat the Di·ªám regime and win the war. He asserted that \\"the time had come for the US to apply direct pressure to bring about a change of government, however distasteful\\". Mecklin asserted that there would be a backlash if aid was simply cut, so US troops would have to directly fix the problem. Mecklin later wrote to USIS head Edward R. Murrow to insist that US troops would welcome combat in the case of a communist escalation. On the journey back to the United States, he had asserted that the use of American combat forces would encourage the coup and lift morale against the Viet Cong. He also called for the engineering of a coup. He called for the US to show more intent.Jones, p, 360. The pessimism expressed by Phillips and Mecklin surprised Frederick Nolting, who preceded Lodge as the US ambassador in Saigon. Nolting said that Phillips' account \\"surprised the hell out of me. I couldn't believe my ears.\\" Nolting asserted that Mecklin was psychologically vulnerable to being brainwashed because he had recently split with his wife. At the time, Mecklin was living with journalists David Halberstam and Neil Sheehan of The New York Times and UPI respectively. Halberstam and Sheehan both won Pulitzer Prizes and were strident critics of Di·ªám.Jacobs, p. 130.Karnow, p. 312.  Aftermath  One strategy that received increasing consideration in NSC meetings‚Äîas well as at the US Embassy, Saigon and in Congress‚Äîwas a suspension of non-military aid to Di·ªám. After the erroneous Voice of America broadcast on August 26, which announced an aid suspension, Lodge was given the discretion on August 29 to suspend aid if it would facilitate a coup. In the meantime, the US Senate began to pressure the administration to take action against Di·ªám. Hilsman was lobbied by the Senate Subcommittee on the Far East. Senator Frank Church informed the administration of his intention to introduce a resolution condemning Di·ªám's anti-Buddhist repression and calling for the termination of aid unless religious equality was instituted. This resulted in Church agreeing to temporarily delay the introduction of the bill to avoid embarrassing the administration.Hammer, pp. 213‚Äì214. While the delegation was in Vietnam, the strategy of using a selective aid suspension to pressure Di·ªám into ending religious discrimination was actively discussed at the State Department. In a television interview on September 8, AID Director David Bell warned that Congress might cut aid to South Vietnam if Di·ªám did not change his policies. On September 9, Kennedy backed away from Bell's comments, stating \\"I don't think we think that [a reduction in aid to Saigon] would be helpful at this time.\\" On September 11, the day after Krulak and Mendenhall tabled their reports, Lodge reversed his position. In a long cable to Washington, he advocated the consideration of using non-military aid suspension to spark the toppling of Di·ªám. Lodge concluded that the US could not get what it wanted from Di·ªám, and had to force events to come to a head. After another White House meeting on the same day, Senator Church was informed that his bill was acceptable, so he introduced the legislation into the Senate. The National Security Council re-convened on September 17 to consider two of Hilsman's proposals for dealing with Di·ªám. The plan favored by Hilsman and his State Department colleagues was the \\"pressures and persuasion track\\". This involved an escalating series of measures at both public and private level, including selective aid suspension and pressuring Di·ªám to remove Nhu from power. The alternative was the \\"reconciliation with a rehabilitated GVN track\\", which involved the public appearance of acquiescence to Di·ªám's recent actions and an attempt to salvage as much as possible from the situation. Both proposals assumed that an ARVN coup was not forthcoming. The inconclusive report saw a follow-up mission sent to Vietnam, the McNamara‚ÄìTaylor mission, led by Defense Secretary Robert McNamara and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Maxwell D. Taylor.

He was the very first student for the modern-day Theological School, and was thus appointed to succeed his predecessor, Youssef Bey Mankarious, in the year 1918, as the second dean of the renewed center of theology.The Theological School of Alexandria by Father Mathew Attia On 20 June 2013, he was canonised as a saint by the Holy Synod of the Coptic Orthodox Church. Early work Before he became the head of renowned Theological Seminary, Habib Girgis felt that preaching and adult education were not sufficient for the advancement of the Coptic Orthodox Church. Protestant and Catholic missionaries have been at work since the mid- nineteenth century, with the aim to radically influence the views of the Copts in order to abandon their long lasting faith in Oriental Orthodoxy. Thus, with many issues at hand, Habib Girgis decided to establish Sunday schools at the beginning of the twentieth century as a means of satisfying the need for education. As a result, Coptic Orthodox Sunday schools were founded in major cities in Egypt in the year 1900‚Äîfifteen years before there were even Egyptian public schools.The story and significance of Archdeacon George Habib (automatic translation) The Sunday school movement flourished in Egypt after much hard work, and now, Coptic studies thrive in Egypt and abroad. As Habib Girgis saw it, the interest of young children were the true foundations of Sunday schools, and by 1900, Sunday school was the main pillar for the renaissance of Coptic Orthodox Christianity in the twentieth century until present, thanks in part to the hard work of Habib Girgis and other famous modern-day Sunday school teachers in the Coptic Church. Coptic churches and villages throughout Egypt at the start of the twentieth century felt that they needed to include better curriculum and more textbooks. By the year 1899, Pope Cyril V issued the need to teach children to learn and deepen their faith, as Habib Girgis visualized the need for raising children in accordance with the teachings of Christianity and the spirit of faithful patriotism. Habib Girgis worked to restructure Sunday school curricula significantly, as he had striven to do what he did eventually: to improve academic standards. Dean of the Seminary He dedicated his life to the seminary and its improvement. Habib Girgis assisted the Pope in expanding its buildings in Mahmasha. Pope Kyrillos V often visited the seminary and blessed its students. This deacon was a skillful speaker. He accompanied the Pope in his pastoral visits to Upper Egypt and Sudan. He translated many religious books from foreign languages to Arabic and published El-Karma periodical, to spread the facts of the faith in a positive way. He published many books, among them were: The Seven Sacraments of the Church, The Consoler of the Faithful, The Mystery of Piety, and many others. He taught and nurtured many generations of clergymen who flourished in the church and filled it with their sermons and religious publications.The Coptic Synaxarium: The life of Pope Cyril V (and relationship with the late Habib Girgis) His term as dean ended with his death in 1951.The story and significance of Archdiacon Habib Girgis (Arabic) However, Pope Yusab II appointed Father Ibrahim Attia later that year. With Father Ibrahim, who did carry the work on, there were many new improvements in the years to come. This would eventually lead up to Bishop (the recently departed Pope) Shenouda's involvement as the current dean of the Catechetical School of Alexandria.

He was appointed an exorcist in the past, but is no longer in office. Life His father was a businessman and did not expect him to become a priest, but to take charge of the family business since he was his only son. Father Fortea acknowledges that up until his adolescence, religion lacked importance for him and that the concept of sin seemed to be an anachronism. He valued the Church on the same level of Greek Mythology. During that period of time, he had in mind to pursue studies in Law School. However, when he turned 15 years old, his perspective had a radical change and, in his own words, he understood that ‚Äúhe was a sinner and that the Church was the truth.‚Äù He attributed this change to a grace from God. The same year, he finds himself considering the possibility of becoming a priest. After looking for guidance into this new path, he took the advice of a priest who told him to join the seminary, just to rule out any doubt. Upon entering the seminary, he clearly understood that the priesthood was his calling. He then got a bachelor's degree in Theology at the University of Navarra and his master's degree in the University of Comillas. Even though his specialty in Theology was on History of the Church, his licentiate thesis was about the topic of exorcism, hence the title ‚ÄúExorcism in the Present Age.‚Äù The result of those investigations was published under the titled ‚ÄúDaemoniacum.‚Äù That publication made him known for the first time in Spain. Years later, and with a greater scope of knowledge in the topic, Summa Daemoniaca was published. This book was followed by a supplemental publication called Exorc√≠stica which provides new theoretical resources and practical cases. Publications Father Fortea‚Äôs most famous publication is Summa Daemoniaca. That book is a treatise of demonology and an exorcist‚Äôs manual. The book analyzes the world of demons, the final damnation state of the soul, the inter-relationship of the fallen angels among themselves and with respect to angels, human beings and God. The book‚Äôs second part deals with the different related demonic phenomena: how to discern if someone‚Äôs possessed, how to conduct an exorcism, the poltergeist phenomenon in haunted houses, as well as some other strange and unusual phenomena. That book ends with an analysis about evil itself. The ‚Äúreflections‚Äù at the end of the book constitute the most philosophical part of the treaty. The book Exorcistica is a supplemental publication of Summa Daemoniaca. It is as extensive as the book it supplements: this second treaty embraces with a deeper understanding the topics discussed in the first book. The book, Anneliese Michelle, a Case of Possession, analyzes the case of a possessed German girl who died in 1976. In A Mysterious God, the question about charismatic gifts is analyzed as well. Fr. Fortea has been prolific in regards to exploring the literature field. In fact, he wrote a novel series regarding the book of Apocalipse called ‚ÄúDecalogia or Saga of Apocalipse‚Äù which is a cycle of ten novels about the end of the world, explained over and over again from a series of different perspectives. The following is a complete list of his publications classified by genres: Decalogia or Saga of the Apocalipse: Ciclus Apocalypticus (2005) Historia de la II Secesi√≥n de los Estados Unidos de Am√©rica (2005) La Construcci√≥n del Jard√≠n del Ed√©n (2005) Memoirs of the Last Templar Master: Anno Domini 2211 (2005) The Judgement (2005) Necroner√≥polis (2005) L√≠nea Trocaica (2005) Goedia (2005) Book Nine: Abstracts from the Revelation Era (2005) Book Ten: Abstracts from the Revelation Era (2005) Edipo Vasco - Libros Libres, 2004.

M. S. Raju produced and directed the film while debutant Kamalakar composed music for the project. It is a remake of Kannada language Blockbuster film Mungaru Male, which featured Ganesh and Pooja Gandhi. The film was dubbed into Tamil and released in 2013 under the title Gnabagangal Thaalattum. Plot Jog Falls in Sagara, Karnataka, where a few sequences of the film were shot. Abhiram (Vinay) is the only son of Uma (Jayasudha) and Babji (Naresh). On a visit to a mall amidst a heavy wind, he spots a pretty girl named Nandini (Meera Chopra). Whilst staring at her, he inadvertently falls into a manhole. Nandini rescues him from the pit, but in the process loses her heart-shaped watch that she had just bought. While accompanying his mother to Araku, Abhi confronts a man named Jaanu (Ajay). Jaanu, who has been following Nandini, beats up Abhi, mistaking him to be dating her. Abhi, unaware that Jaanu has vowed not to allow anyone near Nandini, thrashes him and his gang in return. In Araku, Abhi meets Nandini unexpectedly. He identifies himself, expresses his love, and offers to tie the watch as an indication of his intention to marry her. Nandini, who is already engaged, rejects his proposal. Still, Abhi vows to marry her if she meets him again. Uma takes Abhi to her friend Bharathi's (Seetha) house. There, Abhi discovers that his host in Araku, Col. Choudary (Suman), is Nandini's father. Choudary is deaf, and Nandini's marriage is only a week away. Dejected, Abhi throws Nandini's watch away. Nandini calls him and asks him to meet her. Delighted, Abhi goes in search of her watch. While searching for it, he spots a rabbit, which he names Devadas and brings along with him. Eventually, he finds the watch. Since Nandini's friends are due to arrive from Mumbai for the marriage, Abhi takes Nandini to the railway station. The train from Mumbai is delayed by five hours, so Nandini and Abhi decide to visit a nearby temple. While returning from the temple, Abhi and Nandini are caught in the rain. An old couple offers them shelter inside their hut. Abhi, still in two minds about expressing his love to Nandini, grabs a few toddy bottles, goes out in the rain, and starts drinking. When Nandini walks towards an intoxicated Abhi, offering an umbrella, he tells her that he had better stay away from her to keep from making a move on her. Nandini is now in love with Abhi and is in a dilemma as her wedding is in a few days. She requests him to take her to the top of a waterfall and expresses her love to him, standing at the edge of the waterfall. Abhi, intent on marrying Nandini, takes Choudary for a morning jog to discuss his marriage with her, but Choudary, a heart patient, tells Abhi that he is expected to die anytime, and his only wish is to get Nandini married off to Gautam (Diganth). On the night before the marriage, Abhi drives away without taking Devadas. He then starts drinking in a bar. He finds Gautam asking the bar owner (Narsing Yadav) for directions to Choudary's home. When Jaanu tries to kill Gautam, Abhi saves Gautam and convinces himself that only Gautam is suitable to marry Nandini. The following day, Abhi drops Gautam at the marriage venue but declines to attend the marriage. Gautam asks for the heart-shaped watch as a remembrance, but Abhi refuses to give it and leaves. As he is leaving, Nandini asks Abhi if he told their story to her father, to which Abhi replies that he doubted her love. Hurt, Nandini tells him not to show his face again. With tears in her eyes, she marries Gautam. Abhi leaves, taking her memories and Devadas with him. On the way, he goes to the waterfall where Nandini proposed to him. There, Devadas dies. The story ends with Abhi burying Devadas's body near the edge and returning to his house, heartbroken. Cast * Vinay as Abhiram * Meera Chopra as Nandini * Suman as Col.

The Chicago, Kalamazoo and Saginaw Railway (CK&S;), known informally as the \\"Cuss, Kick & Swear\\" is a defunct railroad which operated in southwest Michigan in the late 19th and early to mid 20th centuries. Despite the name, the line ran entirely within the state of Michigan, with the majority in Kalamazoo County. It eventually became part of the New York Central. As of 2010, most of the former CK&S; tracks have since been abandoned. History Preferred Share of the Chicago, Kalamazoo & Saginaw Railway Company from the 1st January 1901 The company incorporated on June 7, 1883, with the initial intent of constructing a line from Kalamazoo northeast to Hastings. On October 29, 1887, the company amended its articles, now calling for a line of connecting the Chicago and Grand Trunk Railway's line in northeastern Cass County to Saginaw. This grandiose vision never came to pass; the company's completed line stretched a mere beyond Hastings. In 1906 the CK&S; was leased by the Michigan Central Railroad-the Central took 60% control, while the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway, itself owned by the New York Central Railroad, took 40%. In 1930 the New York Central, having merged with the LS&MS; in 1915 and leased the Michigan Central in 1930, leased the CK&S.; The New York Central continued to operate the CK&S; under its own name until 1968, when Conrail bought the remaining properties. Operation Despite its name, the line linked neither Chicago, Illinois nor Saginaw, Michigan, although it did pivot on Kalamazoo, Michigan. Construction started in 1886 between Kalamazoo, Michigan and Hastings, Michigan; this section was completed by 1888. On September 1, 1889, the northern branch reached Woodbury, on the northwest edge of Eaton county, where it met the Detroit, Lansing and Northern Railroad (later the Pere Marquette Railroad). On December 1, 1901, the southern terminus was extended to Pavilion, Michigan, in southern Kalamazoo County, where it met the Grand Trunk Railway, for a total length of . A 1909 report by the Michigan Railroad Commission found that the CK&S; operated three trains in each direction daily; two passenger and one freight. In 1910, the Grand Trunk Western leased the line from Kalamazoo to Pavilion; the CK&S; converted the rump to yard service. In 1937, the CK&S; abandoned the section between Delton and Woodbury; in 1942, it cut back further to Richland Junction. In 1978, Conrail abandoned the line to Richland as well, leaving only yard trackage within Kalamazoo itself. On July 25, 1930, the CK&S; purchased a line from the dying Michigan United Railways. This line ran south from Hooper to Richland, and crossed the CK&S;'s main line at Richland Junction, north of Richland proper. The CK&S; converted the track from electrified interurban to standard operation. In 1961, it cut the line back to Doster, and in 1978 Conrail abandoned the rest. Except for the portion from Kalamazoo to Pavilion where Grand Elk RR uses it to connect with CN.

It is located in the area known as Monti della Laga and sits within the Gran Sasso e Monti della Laga National Park. The village can be found at an elevation about 2709 feet on a rocky piece of land that juts out over and dominates the nearby Tordino River. In the year 2007 Tavolero is but an uninhabited ghosttown. Most of the villas in the village date back to the 18th century. One in particular is of major historical significance and was likely constructed in the 15th century. It has an imposing chimney and fireplace and has now been restored for use as a summer vacation home. The San Flaviano Church 300px This church is of great historical significance. It likely dates back to the last third of the 13th century and sits alone several hundred meters above the small village below. This placement of the village church is characteristic of other nearby small villages in the area. San Flaviano is built on the foundation of preexisting structure whose origins likely date back to end of the 11th century. Evidence of this can be seen via several inscribed marking stones embedded in the church's front wall and porticoes. Mention is made of San Flaviano in a document dated 1324 known as the Rationes decimarum. It lists the church as falling within the parish of Rocca Santa Maria which itself formed part of the Diocese of Teramo. Architectural aspects of the church are characteristic of those features frequently employed by the Order of the Cistercians. The church bears a strong resemblance to another of this order's churches, Santa Maria ad Criptas, located in the Pescara Province town of Fossa and built in the late 13th century. Together they serve as important monuments to the presence of the Cistercians in the Abruzzo Region of Italy. The church of San Flaviano bears a more simplistic wooden beamed roof rather than a more ornate and costly volt. This was likely done in to keep the costs of the church within reason. In medieval times the church was expected to turn over a tenth (la decima) of its revenue to the parish each year. The \\"Borghi\\" (Burgs) Projects Tavolero, along with the nearby villages of Martese and Serra, has been selected by the Province of Teramo as a site for development as a major tourist center. Emphasis will be placed on restoring the village in a manner that is both authentic and environmentally sound.

Categorized as a \\"fast casual restaurant\\", the quality and preparation time of its food is between that of a fast-food restaurant and a more formal restaurant. Wahoo's provides many vegetarian and some vegan options, such as tofu, banzai veggies and brown rice, and also provides a kids' meal menu. They serve Wahoo fish in their tacos, as well as Mahi-mahi. History Wahoo's Fish Taco sign in Orange, California Wahoo's was founded in Costa Mesa, California, in 1988 by Chinese- Brazilian brothers Eduardo \\"Ed\\" Lee, Renato \\"Mingo\\" Lee and Wing Lam, who mixed traditional Chinese and Brazilian flavors with dishes they encountered while traveling in Mexico. Their parents had fled to Brazil in the 1950s following the conclusion of the Chinese Civil War, and settled in S√£o Paulo, opening a Chinese restaurant; their five sons were all born in Brazil. Their father, Cheong Lee, and the eldest brother came to the United States in 1964, and the rest of the family arrived in 1975, opening the Shanghai Pine Gardens restaurant on Balboa Island. Based on their experience working long hours at Shanghai Pine Gardens, the parents insisted that their five children should study medicine, law, or engineering; the eldest brother went to law school, the second brother studied medicine, and the third brother (Wing Lam) attended San Diego State University, initially studying engineering, but switching to finance after being placed on academic probation. The first Wahoo's Fish Taco restaurant, located at 1862 Placentia Avenue in Costa Mesa, opened in November 1989, serving Baja California-style fish tacos. The three brothers (youngest of the five sons) were the main restaurant employees. Wing Lam recounted in 2011 that \\"back in the day, I took your order, ran to the kitchen, made it and delivered it to your table.\\" The three brothers remain involved in daily operations, with Wing Lam staffing the chain's California-based food truck. The first restaurant was funded in part with US$30,000 the brothers received from their parents after selling Shanghai Pine Gardens. Steve Karfaridis, the first manager of Wahoo's second location, in Laguna Beach, is now a partner in the business. The corporate headquarters are in Santa Ana, California. The three brothers are still involved with the company, with Wing Lam acting as the public face of the company, working in public relations and marketing. Projected sales in 2004 were . By 2011, annual sales exceeded . =Expansion= Wahoo's also operates a food truck in Hawaii. By 1994, Wahoo's had opened two additional locations, one each in Costa Mesa and Laguna Beach. The business permit for the fourth location in Huntington Beach, was delayed over a city code requirement to pay for 12 spaces in the city-owned Main Street parking garage, and an additional location was opened in Lake Forest in May 1994. By late 1995, Wahoo's had six locations in total, five in Orange County, California and one in Denver, Colorado. The Wahoo's that opened in Manhattan Beach in 1998 was the first Wahoo's in California outside Orange County. In 2001, Wahoo's had 22 locations and announced plans to open 40 more by 2006. By 2005, Wahoo's had 36 locations, including the original Costa Mesa restaurant. Wahoo's has since expanded across California and has opened locations in Colorado, Hawaii, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey & Pennsylvania . In 2009, Wahoo's announced plans to add 100 franchise locations by 2014, but those plans have slowed. By Wahoo's 25-year anniversary in 2013, they had 64 restaurants in seven states, and would later that year go on to open Wahoo's first international restaurant in Tokyo, Japan. Marketing From the outset, Wahoo's has targeted the surfing community by offering affordable prices and eclectic decor, which uses stickers and surfing equipment inside the restaurant. Wahoo's would cater corporate events for surf apparel companies and local surf contests to build word-of-mouth for its fish tacos. Similar strategies were used to build support in other \\"extreme\\" sports communities such as snowboarding, rock climbing, and cycling. Wahoo's also built a strong youth following by naming a local \\"athlete of the week\\" and sponsoring a meal, which would inevitably be attended by the athlete's friends. The fish tacos served by street vendors in Baja California were, in Lam's recollection, generally filled with unsaleable by-caught fish such as shark; the bycatch would be sold cheaply to street vendors, who sliced the fish into strips, deep fried the strips, and sold the fish in inexpensive tacos with cabbage and tomatoes. While attending San Diego State, Lam came up with the idea to replicate the fish tacos for an American audience, similar to the origin story told by Rubio's founder (and fellow Aztec alumnus) Ralph Rubio. The primary difference was the Wahoo's fish taco was prepared as his family would interpret the recipe: grilled meat, instead of fried, and beans without lard or bacon fat, with vegetarian and vegan options. The brothers' efforts to replicate street tacos with a healthy twist coincided with a renewed consumer interest in \\"fresh\\" Mexican cuisine, and Wahoo's has offered nutritional information from the start to cater to health-conscious consumers. In addition, Wahoo's has been credited as creating one of the earliest Asian-taco fusions. Word-of-mouth from existing stores was sufficient when new Orange County locations were opened, but when Wahoo's expanded north into Manhattan Beach in Los Angeles County, the marketing effort reverted to advertising in local newspapers and schools. In popular culture Author Earlene Fowler credits the original Wahoo's location as her office while she was writing her first novel. January 9, 2013 was proclaimed Wahoo's Fish Taco Day in Costa Mesa to honor the chain's 25th founding anniversary. Travis Barker, drummer for blink-182, opened a Wahoo's Fish Taco restaurant in Norco, California (co- owned with the Lee brothers) in 2004.

Licorice McKechnie, the remainder of the former girlfriends, would depart after the release of the album. This album, compared to its predecessors, is a more generic folk album. The band was continuing its exploration into progressive rock and synthesizers in order to create a more commercial-oriented sound. This was due more to Heron's influence over the band. As a result, the band would lose much of their trademark style that made them popular in the British counterculture of the 1960s.

He won from Larkana with 84, 426 votes, having lost from two of the other constituencies to the Imran Khan-founded Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) candidates. The PPP scion claimed that rigging took place before and after the elections, adding that across Pakistan polling agents were expelled from the polling stations. \\"We are a part of the parliament to support the democratic we will ignore the discrepancies in the election,\\" he remarked, demanding a probe into rigging allegations. =Member of the National Assembly= On 13 August 2018, Bhutto Zardari became a member of the National Assembly of Pakistan. In his first speech in the parliament on 17 August 2018, he was proud to be elected member of the prestigious house. Journalists, Politicians and people of Pakistan were all praise for the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Chairman Bhutto Zardari after he delivered his maiden speech in the parliament. In his speech, he asked Imran Khan to fulfill his promise of rooting out corruption, resolving water crisis and providing ten million jobs and 5 million houses to the people during his tenure. The speech received positive reception from both, mainstream and social media, as well as other prominent politicians, and marked a significant moment in Bilawal's emergence as a politician. This is the speech where Bhutto Zardari coined the term 'PM Select' for Imran Khan who sworn in as Prime Minister Pakistan after a controversial General Elections of 2018. He also said that Imran Khan is the prime minister of ‚Äòdonkeys‚Äô and ‚Äòliving corpses‚Äô as used to refer to people of Pakistan before becoming the Prime Minister. = Committee for Human Rights = On 5 March 2019, Bhutto Zardari was elected ‚Äì unopposed - as the chairperson of the National Assembly Standing Committee for Human Rights. In its first meeting on 18 April 2019, the committee deliberated on The ICT Rights of Persons with Disability Bill, 2018, moved by the ministry and The National Commission on the Status of Women (Amendment) Bill, 2018.  Political activism  =Support for 18th Amendment= Bhutto Zardari has repeatedly criticized the One Unit system and warned against any attempt to bring in the presidential system, explaining that it will not be in the interest of democracy. During a press talk at a conference on 27 April 2019, he stated, \\"Presidential system is neither in the interest of the country nor the federation and all democratic forces will resist any such move,\\" adding that the presidential form of government had failed wherever it had been enforced. \\"There is no provision in our laws for conducting referendum.\\" = Freedom of expression = A devout advocate for democracy, Bhutto Zardari has repeatedly denounced censorship and likened any forms of curbing media freedom to living under a dictatorship. He made a speech at the Karachi Press Club on World Press Freedom Day where he said, \\"An undeclared censorship is stifling the freedom of expression in Pakistan and journalists are coming under threat from state and non-state actors. He added, \\"Journalists and media persons as human rights defenders suffer the most when freedom of expression is stifled. After the right to life, the most important right is the right of expression and the freedom of association because all other rights cannot even be articulated without it.\\" During the speech, he also to criticized the Prevention of Electronic Crime Act 2016 and stated that it had been misapplied to stifle dissent. = Women's rights = Bhutto Zardari is a strong advocate of \\"peaceful, progressive, prosperous, democratic Pakistan\\", what he calls his mother's vision. In an interview with the BBC, he said that his 2018 election campaign was to implement these principles. He is a strong supporter of women's empowerment and believes in empowering women and taking them on board in all matters is the sole guarantee of country's progress. On the occasion of International Day of the Girl Child, the PPP chairman said that a future based on progress and prosperity could remain a dream without empowering girls and taking them on board in all matters. Bhutto Zardari acknowledged all those women who stepped forward in all sections of life and field while defeating many impediments at every level and social taboos. He specifically named Fatima Jinnah, Benazir Bhutto, Asma Jehangir and Maryam Mukhtar.

The Sindh government under PPP abolished child marriages by making the legal marriage age eighteen years in the province under the Sindh Child Marriages Restraint Act, 2013. He as member of opposition in the National Assembly has also advocated that the legal marriage age should be made eighteen years across the country. On 4 May 2019 he tweeted, \\"UAE marriage age is 18, Indonesia is 18 and Turkey is also 18. Are they not Muslim countries? In Sindh where marriage age is 18, we saw how law stopped an adult marrying a 10-year-old! Every 20 minutes a girl dies in Pakistan as a result of underage pregnancy. #EndChildMarriage.\\" = Civil rights = Bhutto Zardari has repeatedly defended the rights of minorities in Pakistan. On 4 December 2012, in a statement responding to reports about demolition of a Hindu temple in Karachi and a desecration of an Ahmadia graveyard in Lahore he said, \\"Our forefathers did not sacrifice their lives for an intolerant, extremist, sectarian and authoritarian Pakistan. I appeal to all of you to rise up and defend Jinnah‚Äôs Pakistan. My party and I will stand by you, shoulder to shoulder.\\" During a cake cutting ceremony for Christmas in Karachi, on 25 December 2018, Bhutto Zardari said, the PPP is the custodian of social justice, parity, religious and interfaith harmony in the country and its advocacy for the prevalence of peace and tranquility across the world is heavily established. At the memorial for the 7th death anniversary of former Federal Minister of Interfaith Harmony, Shahbaz Bhatti on 3 March 2018, Bhutto Zardari said, \\"May I take this opportunity to say that we share the concerns over the misuse of blasphemy laws. This is the concern of not only the Christian community but of all of us. It is my concern too. These laws have been used as a tool by extremists to settle personal scores. They have been used to grab properties of Christians and other non-Muslims. The blasphemy laws carry mandatory death penalty. We must prevent their misuse. We will.\\" =Foreign policy= On 20 September 2014, while speaking to party workers in Multan, Bhutto Zardari said, \\"I will take back Kashmir, all of it, and I will not leave behind a single in of it because, like the other provinces, it belongs to Pakistan.\\" The statement was to be the first marking his stance on the Kashmir issue and remarked upon widely in local and international media. On 6 February 2019, Bhutto Zardari met with the Kashmir Council in Washington to express solidarity with the people of Kashmir. During the meeting, he assured the delegation that he would continue to raise voice against the brutalities of Indian forces against innocent and unarmed Kashmiri people at every available forum both nationally and internationally. He said that loyalty to the cause of Kashmir was in his blood and he would stand with the people of Indian-Held Kashmir in their just struggle for right to self- determination and freedom from illegal and immoral Indian occupation. = Terrorism = On 18 February 2018 while addressing a function in Washington, Bhutto Zardari said that there is a growing increase in terrorism in Pakistan and that democracy can win over extremism, but the biggest battle is of ideologies. \\"The battle is between modernity and extremism.\\" Bhutto Zardari has also repeatedly criticized the government's resistance of implementing the National Action Plan, which he deems resistance to democracy and peace in the nation. He has also demanded the removal of three federal ministers accusing them of having connections with banned militant outfits. On 7 March 2019, during a provincial council meeting, Bhutto Zardari said, \\"I demand a joint parliamentary committee for implementation of National Action Plan and removal of all three federal ministers for their connection with extremist organisations. If our demands are not met, we will not support the government any move.\\"  References   External links  Category:Living people Category:1988 births Category:Pakistani MNAs 2018‚Äì2023 Category:Pakistan Peoples Party MNAs Category:Children of national leaders Category:Children of Prime Ministers of Pakistan Category:Children of Presidents of Pakistan Category:Leaders of political parties in Pakistan Category:Pakistani people of Iranian descent Category:Pakistani people of Iraqi descent Category:Pakistani people of Kurdish descent Category:Pakistani expatriates in England Category:Pakistani expatriates in the United Arab Emirates Category:Karachi Grammar School alumni Category:Rashid School for Boys alumni Category:Alumni of Christ Church, Oxford Category:Bhutto family Bilawal Category:Politicians from Karachi ","title":"Bilawal Bhutto Zardari"},{"id":"14914577","text":"Francis Rolleston Gardner (born 31 July 1961) is a British journalist and author.

From 2006-2010, Roberts served as the State Representative for House District 59. In 2010, she was elected to Senate District 6 and served until her resignation at the end of 2016.Alderton, Stephanie. Don Coram will replace Ellen Roberts in Colorado Senate. The Durango Herald, January 7, 2017. Viewed: 2017-01-13. In 2015, she was elected to serve as the President Pro-Tem for the Colorado State Senate, a position she held until her resignation. Biography Born in Hudson, New York, Roberts was raised in Rhinebeck, where she was elected class president in high school. She earned a self-designed undergraduate degree in environmental policy from Cornell University in 1981. During college, she spent a semester as an intern in Washington DC, working for her Congressional representative and for the Republican National Committee. She moved to Colorado upon graduation and worked as a ranger in Rocky Mountain National Park until 1984. In 1982, Roberts married; she and her husband, Rick, have two children: Caitlin and Ben, both of whom have attended Fort Lewis College in Durango, Colorado. After being hired by a law firm in Granby, Colorado, Roberts returned to school to earn a J.D. from the University of Colorado in 1986. She worked as an attorney in private practice in Granby and Hot Sulphur Springs, specializing in estate, probate and business law. A resident of Durango, Colorado since 1989, she joined the Southwest Colorado Bar Association in 1986 and served as its president, and as president of the Southwest Colorado Women's Bar Association. As an attorney, Roberts advocated for increased legal services for immigrants and Spanish-speakers in southwestern Colorado Roberts has focused on health care, constitutional reform, judicial, and financial issues in the state legislature, and, despite being in the minority party, has seen almost all legislation she sponsored signed into law. She has also carried legislation to strengthen private property rights surrounding oil and gas drilling, and to create a legislative youth advisory council. Early career Roberts began to re-enter politics after the death of her father in 1992, first focusing on hospice and health care issues. As a member (since 1999 ) and later chairman of the board of Mercy Regional Medical Center, she pushed for the construction of a new hospital in Durango. She chaired Healthy 58, a rural health care task force, and in 2001, was appointed to the Task Force to Evaluate Health Care Needs for Colorado, a commission formed by the legislature to study health-care needs in rural Colorado communities. Roberts sat on the Sixth Judicial District Nominating Commission, and co-chaired the Durango Citizens Steering Committee for a New Library, a successful effort to push for a new local public library that was eventually built on the site of Mercy Medical Center, the hospital Roberts had worked to help replace. She was a member of the Citizens Health Advisory Council, the High Noon Rotary Club, and sat on the boards of First National Bank and the Community Foundation Serving Southwest Colorado. In 2004, she won the Durango Chamber of Commerce's Athena Award for professional women in business. Colorado House of Representatives =2006 Election= In December 2004, only a month after Larson was elected to his fourth and final term in the state house, Roberts filed for a 2006 candidacy to seek his seat. She announced her campaign formally in January 2005. She was endorsed by Larson, and won the Republican nomination unopposed. As Representative Mark Larson neared the end of his term-limited tenure in the Colorado House of Representatives, Roberts began to work with him on learning the legislative process, in preparation for seeking elected office herself. She instigated a bill, introduced by Larson and eventually signed into law, to require that remains be handled in accordance with the wishes of the deceased. She also lobbied the legislature, unsuccessfully, for the creation of an interim committee to study palliative care. During the general election campaign, Roberts emphasized her work on health care issues and her experience working with Representative Larson in the legislature, and criticized the passage of constitutional amendments creating conflicting fiscal obligations. Although both Roberts and her main opponent, Democrat Joe Colgan, signed a clean campaign pledge, controversy arose over advertisements run by outside sources. In particular, Roberts denounced as \\"misleading\\" and \\"unacceptable\\" a television advertisement criticizing Colgan's record as mayor of Durango. The ad, which was run by a political group associated with the Colorado Association of Home Builders, was later pulled off the air. Direct mail flyers sent by right-leaning outside groups during the last weeks of the campaign also misrepresented both candidates' stances on immigration, exaggerating the contrast between their positions. In addition to her Democratic opponent, Roberts faced unaffiliated write-in candidate Christopher Navage. Navage withdrew from the race in October 2006 and endorsed Colgan. Roberts significantly outraised her opponents, donating over $8,000 to her own campaign, and ultimately winning the November 2006 general election with 52 percent of the vote. =2007 Legislative Session= In the 2007 session of the Colorado General Assembly, Roberts was a member of the House Health and Human Services Committee, the Joint Legal Services Committee, and the House Judiciary Committee. Roberts was one of the most successful Republican legislators at passing legislation through the Democrat-controlled legislature, and has been identified by media reports and commentators as a \\"standout\\" legislator and a potential candidate for higher office. She also organized bowling outings for legislators during her first year in the legislature. Roberts carried legislation which revised Colorado's surface rights laws, requiring oil and gas companies to minimize the impacts of drilling. The bill was weakened by lobbying from the Colorado Oil and Gas Association, but represented a breadth of reform that had failed to pass in previous legislative sessions. During her first legislative session, Roberts also sponsored bills to revise the process by which special health care districts are created and to expand eligibility for Korean War special license plates; she cosponsored legislation to fund study of a methane seep in southwestern Colorado. Her only unsuccessful bill was a measure to tighten the rules under which cigar bars could claim exemptions from Colorado's indoor smoking ban. After being killed in committee, the measure was revived in the Colorado Senate by Democrats, but was again unsuccessful. Following the 2007 session, Roberts was named by House Republican leadership to the newly formed Criminal and Juvenile Justice Commission. In November 2007, she was named a Legislator of Merit by the Colorado Behavioral Health Council. She joined with other Republicans to criticize an executive order issued by Governor Bill Ritter allowing collective bargaining with government employee unions as a betrayal of Ritter's promise of bipartisan cooperation on major issues. =2008 Legislative Session= In the 2008 session of the Colorado General Assembly, Roberts sat on the House Health and Human Services Committee and the House Judiciary Committee. She introduced eight bills during the session, all of which were passed by the legislature. During the 2008 legislative session, Roberts introduced a bill, drafted and lobbied for by Colorado students, to create a legislative youth advisory council. The bill stalled in the legislature until its minimal cost was approved by the House Appropriations Committee, after which it cleared both the House and Senate, and Governor Bill Ritter signed it into law. She was later appointed by Minority Leader Mike May to be one of the legislative members of the council. Roberts introduced a bill which would grant advanced practice nurses power to sign off on additional medical forms, in response to shortages of doctors in portions of rural Colorado, a measure which garnered support from both nurses' and doctors' associations. In March, she backed a proposal to require that insurance companies offer low-cost health care benefit packages for Coloradoans, as part of a \\"public-private\\" plan towards achieving universal coverage. Roberts was the sponsor of a legislative resolution urging the Federal Communications Commission to support including southwestern Colorado, including portions of her district, within the Denver media market, a resolution she introduced again in 2010. Before the session began, Roberts had expressed interest in sponsoring legislation to revise the process by which the Colorado Constitution is amended through ballot measures, proposing that supermajority popular votes be required to enact amendments. She proposed extending the public hearing process as a means of providing additional input on ballot measures, and, in February 2008, was appointed to a six-member legislative panel tasked with developing recommendations for constitutional reform. She was ultimately a cosponsor of the panel's proposal to create distinctions in the petition process between constitutional and statutory amendments,; the proposal which was referred by the legislature to voters and appeared on the November 2008 Colorado ballot as Referendum O. Roberts campaigned in support of Referendum O during the fall campaign. Roberts was one of a few Republicans to back a measure to reform spending requirements in Colorado's state constitution. The proposal, which would have diverted excess revenues under TABOR to K-12 education, was regarded as a sweeping revision to competing constitutional mandates; it was not passed by the General Assembly, but was advanced as a citizens' initiative. =2008 Election= Roberts was nominated by the Republican Party for a second term in the state house; she faced no challengers either in the Republican primary or in the general election. Roberts stood against some fellow Republicans by opposing Amendment 52, a ballot measure on the November ballot that would reallocate some severance tax revenue from water projects to transportation. She also backed Republican presidential candidate John McCain and spoke before McCain at an October rally in Durango, Colorado. Following her re-election, Roberts was nominated for the post of House Minority Caucus Chair, but lost the caucus' vote for the post to Rep. Amy Stephens. After losing the vote, Roberts publicly lamented the lack of rural representation in legislative leadership and alleged that Republican lawmakers were threatened with primaries if they voted for her leadership bid. =2009 Legislative Session= For the 2009 legislative session, Roberts was appointed to the House Health and Human Services Committee and the House Judiciary Committee, where she was the ranking Republican member. Roberts was also named to a Republican task force charged with making recommendations on resolving the state's projected budget shortfall. In 2009, Roberts also sat on the Colorado Commission on Criminal and Juvenile Justice and co-chaired the Colorado Youth Advisory Council. During the 2009 session, Roberts sponsored several bills relating to juvenile criminal offenders, including legislation to allow more juveniles to have their criminal records expunged, and to allow young adults to serve sentences within the Youth Offender System instead of correctional facilities. Roberts also sponsored legislation to make minor adjustment to the statutes concerning the Colorado Youth Advisory Council, legislation to create a regional self-insurance plan within the San Luis Valley, and legislation revising statutes surrounding end-of-life care. =2010 Legislative Session= Following the 2009 legislative session, Roberts sat on an interim committee dealing with hospice and palliative care issues, and carried legislation originating from that committee during the 2010 session, including two bills that clarified policies surrounding end-of-life care and advance directives. Other legislation that Roberts carried in 2010 included a bill to allow voluntary income tax contributions to support 2-1-1 services, and she fought against cuts to the Native American tuition waiver program at Fort Lewis College. Roberts was one of only three Republican House members to vote in support of Colorado's 2010 budget, after successfully sponsoring an amendment that removed restrictions on Fort Lewis College's ability to set its own out-of-state tuition rates. Roberts had planned to introduce legislation to place a one-year moratorium on new Colorado health insurance mandates with independent Rep. Kathleen Curry, as part of a proposal to overhaul the states insurance mandate commission. However, they announced at the start of the session that their proposal would not include an immediate moratorium on insurance mandates, and the legislation was killed on its first hearing in a House committee. Roberts also withdrew one of her proposals to continue a pilot program for training of Certified Nursing Assistants, on account of its cost. Roberts also sponsored a contentious piece of legislation with general election opponent Sen. Bruce Whitehead, negotiated by Governor Ritter's office, to require utilities to convert some Front Range coal-fired power plants to natural gas. Colorado Senate =2010 Election= In June 2009, Roberts announced her intention to seek the Colorado State Senate seat held by term-limited Democratic Sen. Jim Isgar in the 2010 legislative elections, Senate District 6. After Isgar resigned from the legislature in July 2009 to head the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Rural Development office in Colorado, Democrats appointed civil engineer Bruce Whitehead to the seat; Whitehead declared his intention to run for a full term in 2010, setting up a race that Colorado Republicans viewed as one of their best opportunities to pick up a seat in the Democrat-controlled legislature. Roberts' 2010 campaign for the Senate seat also faced a challenge in the Republican primary from former Norwood, Colorado town marshal Dean Boehler, who campaigns as a self-described \\"true conservative;\\" Boehler received 67 percent of delegate votes at the Republican district assembly to Roberts' 33, earning him the top spot on the August primary ballot. Roberts won the primary race with 54% of the vote and went on to win the general election with 61% of the vote. =2011 Legislative Session= As state senator, Roberts served on several committees, including the Health and Human Services, Judiciary, and Legislative Legal Services Committees and also acted as ranking Republican on the Senate Local Government Committee. She served on two interim committees, the Water Resources Review Committee and the Legislative Health Benefit Exchange Implementation Review Committee until the end of the 2012 legislative session. In addition to her responsibilities at the Colorado legislature, Roberts was appointed to the National Conference of State Legislatures‚Äô (NCSL) Federal Deficit Reduction Task Force and, in August 2011, was elected to NCSL‚Äôs Executive Committee. She is the only Colorado legislator to serve on either of these committees. =2012 Legislative Session= Senator Roberts proposed legislation at the start of session regarding the surety bond required for towing carriers in rural areas. SB12-049 would have lowered the surety bond from $50,000 to $10,000 for local entities. The bill was assigned to the Senate Transportation Committee, but was postponed indefinitely after it was introduced. However, after the bill was killed, public upheaval caused Roberts to introduce a new bill, this time in the House, which resolved the same issue. HB12-1347 passed the second time around with a resounding 98-1 vote. Senator Roberts was appointed to the National Conference of State Legislatures Budgets and Revenue Committee. In addition, she was re-elected to the Executive Committee for NCSL. Senator Roberts was also awarded the Legislator of the Year Award for the 2012 legislative session by the Economic Development Council of Colorado. During the 2012 legislative session, Roberts was award a handful of awards: 2012 Champion of Conservation Award from the Colorado Coalition of Land Trusts, the 2012 Pinnacle Award from the Colorado Farm Bureau, the 2012 Common Sense in the Courtroom Award from the Colorado Civil Justice League, and the 2012 Green Colorado Legislator of the Year Award. She was also honored to win the 2012 Legislator of the Year Award from the Colorado Economic Development Council. Due to the wild fires in the state of Colorado in 2012, Senator Roberts was elected as Chairwoman of the bipartisan Lower North Fork Fire Commission, which convened during the interim and which proposed four pieces of legislation to address the threat of wildfire risk and damage in Colorado. =2013 Legislative Session= Roberts was appointed to serve on the Senate Health and Human Services Committee. =2015 Legislative Session= As state senator, Senator Roberts serves on several committees. She serves as Vice Chair of the Agriculture, Natural Resources and Energy Committee as well as Chair of the Judiciary Committee. Senator Roberts also serves on the Committee Legal Services, Water Resources Review Committee, Joint Judiciary Committee and the Joint Agriculture and Natural Resources Committee. Legislative Initiatives =COYAC= In 2008, Senator Roberts sponsored HB08-1157, a bill that sought to create a state legislative youth advisory council in Colorado. Prior to the 2008 legislative session, Senator Roberts had met with a group of high school students from Cortez, Durango, and Pagosa Springs in order to gauge the scope of the soon to be legislation as well as the group that would form after the legislation had been passed. The bill was passed in May 2008, creating the Colorado Youth Advisory Council also known as COYAC. During the 2012 legislative session, Roberts brought forth legislation that stemmed from her youth council initiative as well: HJR12-1004, a resolution that recognized the struggle Colorado faces surrounding teen suicides. This joint resolution sought to identify teen suicides and focus on suicide prevention as well, particularly via COYAC and through COYAC initiatives.

(Îã¨ÎßàÍ∞Ä ÎèôÏ™ΩÏúºÎ°ú Í∞Ñ ÍπåÎã≠ÏùÄ? ‚Äì Dalmaga dongjjok- euro gan ggadakeun?) (1989) is a South Korean film written, produced and directed by Bae Yong-kyun, a professor at Dongguk University in Seoul. Known principally as a painter, Bae spent seven years making this film with one camera and editing it by hand. The film was screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 1989 Cannes Film Festival. It was the first South Korean film to receive a theater release in the United States. The US distributor Milestone Films premiered the film in New York City on September 24, 1993 and then expanded to over 30 cities.https://twitter.com/MilestoneFilms/status/1214604083765633024?s=20 Plot A meditative film dealing with Seon Buddhist views on life, Why Has Bodhi-Dharma Left for the East? follows the lives of three Buddhist monks: an orphaned boy, an adult monk and an elderly monk.Synopsis from This film is largely about two Zen koan: ‚Äòwhat was my original face before my mother and father were conceived?‚Äô and, ‚Äò(in death) where does the master of my being go?‚Äô The film's title, although not explained literally in the film, is a reference to Bodhidharma, a fifth- or sixth-century Buddhist monk probably from Nepal, India, Sri Lanka or Persia who transmitted Zen to China. The question \\"Why has Bodhi-Dharma left for the east\\" is echoed by the young boy's question, \\"Why have we all left the world?\\" The entire film can be seen as an answer to that question, so that the film itself becomes a koan. The three main protagonists are: Hae-jin, an orphan boy; Ki-bong, a young monk and; Hye- gok, a Zen master. Hae-jin injures a bird while bathing. Its mate does not leave the bird but stays around, as if to see what becomes of its mate. Hae- jin takes the injured bird away to heal it, but it dies later in the film. The film then cuts to a scene in which an ox breaks through a confining fence and escapes into the forest. The ox represents Ki-bong's need to escape as well as his own blind passions. The ox, like the young man, escapes its confinement, but isn't truly free. It seems free, but really is still subject to its own desires. The young man also escapes the confinement of the world, but is still plagued by his own blind passions. The ox can also be seen as representing the blind passions of the young boy, escaping the walls of his humanity and running amok. The abbot instructs a young monk (Ki-bong) to assist a Zen master living alone in the mountains. The young monk has renounced his life of hardship in search of peace and perfection. The Zen master is a recluse, living in a monastery on a high mountain and has realised the vanity of knowledge. He also knows the secret of everlasting peace. Dogged by chilblains (inflammation of the hands and feet caused by exposure to cold and moisture), he tries to lead others to the same conclusion, which comes only with ardent devotion, not simply through knowledge or worship. The old master mainly tries to communicate his way through the use of hwadu, or Zen riddles with no absolute answers. The first hwadu is \\"What was my original face before my father and mother were conceived?\\" The second is \\"When the moon takes over in your heart (that is, in enlightenment or death), where does the master of my being go?\\" He instructs the young monk to \\"hold the koan between his teeth\\" and solve them. In solving the koans, the old master tells the young monk that he will find an unshakeable peace. The young monk takes leave of the old monk and goes to town, where he buys medicine for the old man with alms from begging. He also visits his own blind mother, who is having a hard time tending to herself. The young monk returns to the monastery, disillusioned and appalled at his own selfishness in renouncing his destiny, which was to serve his mother and family. He returns to the old monk and communicates his desire to go back to human society, embrace the filth of humanity and face the turmoil of day-to-day existence in the swarm of people. He is severely reprimanded by the monk. However he does not prevent him from leaving. The young monk leaves the monastery to return to his old life, but is caught in a flash flood and nearly drowns. He is found sitting on a rock in the middle of rapids by Hae-jin. The young monk is then rescued by his master. When the young monk regains consciousness, he is informed by the boy that his master had been in meditation for quite a while and is severely ill. Ki-bong realises that the master has traded his own life to save him. Deeply moved, he visits the old master, who extracts a promise from Ki-bong to perform his last rites as the old man wishes. His wish is for his body to be burned on top of the hill so that he can return to his original place. News of a festival on the approaching full-moon day reaches Ki-bong, who wishes to attend it with the boy. Hye-gok, apparently feeling better, gives them leave, assuring Ki-bong that he would manage well by himself. The old man also asks them to bring enough paraffin for him. At the festival, Ki-bong and Hae-jin watch the enthralling dance, while it is made known that the dancer is none other than the old monk himself in another form. In his monastery, he is slowly making preparations himself. On a bright full-moon night, Hae-jin and Ki-bong make their way back. Upon returning to the monastery, the boy smells burnt medicine; they quickly discover that the old man is dead. True to his promise, with the true meaning and meaninglessness of death, possession, desire and vanity dawning on him with every passing instant, Ki-bong places the corpse in a wooden chest and slowly starts a difficult trek up the hillside. He carries the chest on a firewood pack ‚Äì presumably the same pack the young monk had used at the beginning of the film to haul firewood ‚Äì to the monastery. The meaning here is that in death, the body is no different from firewood. This idea is said earlier by the old man when he told the little boy that the boy's extracted tooth is no different from a pebble in the road. By nightfall, the young monk reaches the burial ground. He tries to light the pyre, but there is a light drizzle and he can't get it started. He suddenly remembers his master's words about the paraffin, so he goes back to the monastery to collect it. He then returns to the burial ground and sets fire to the coffin. He spends the night by the side of the burning body, tortured by his feelings and coming to the full realisation of death. Looking around the burning body, the ox and the young boy appear. Both seem transfixed by the blaze. Even the blind passions and foolishness of youth are subdued in death. In the morning, after the funeral pyre has burned down, the young monk is seen kneeling and sifting his fingers through the ashes. In this scene, the young monk is fully encountering the true realisation of death. He seems to be looking for something in the ashes and finds the last few remaining bones of his former master. Presumably, these few small bones are the ‚Äúmaster‚Äù of the old man's being. They are what is left after everything else is burned away. They are death. The young monk collects these bones and grinds them to powder with a stone. He then walks through the forest, scattering the powdered bones over water, earth, trees and plants. When the young monk scatters the old man's powdered bones, he returns the old man to his original place, as the master had said must happen. The original place is everywhere, just as his original face is everything. With this realisation, the young monk finally solves the koans and attains the unshakeable peace the master had spoken about. He then returns to the monastery. Seeking out Hae-jin, he entrusts the boy with the master's few remaining possessions. He then takes his leave. In the final sequence, we see the boy coming of age. In a play scene, the young boy re- enacts the previous night's event by burning the old man's few personal belongings. He does in miniature what the young monk had done the night before. In this act, the boy remembers the old man's teachings and comes to understand the nature of impermanence. He wakes up the next day and goes to the stream to collect water. As usual, the dead bird's companion chirps to distract him (the chirping bird represents the sound of death), but this time the boy does not even notice it. Understanding impermanence, his education is complete. He enters the master's room and closes it after him. An old master has died and a new one has taken his place. The bird flies away, liberated. The wandering ox (which had always been shown before in shadow) returns with a man (possibly Ki-bong), walking beside him in sunlight. It, too, has found peace. Rather than having to face the choice between confinement or escape, the blind passions now walk alongside the human. Both the human and the passions find their true place.

The island was once inhabited by watermen and farmers but has since been abandoned and submerged. It is located in the Holland Strait, between Bloodsworth Island and Smith Island, six miles west of Wenona, Maryland and Southeast of another Former Island, Long Island.  History  Holland Island was originally settled in the 1600s, taking its name from early colonist Daniel Holland, the original purchaser of the property from the Dorchester County Sheriff. By 1850, the first community of fishing and farming families developed on the island. By 1910, the island had about 360 residents, making it one of the largest inhabited islands in the Chesapeake Bay. The island community had 70 homes, stores and other buildings. It had its own post office, a two-room school with two teachers, a church, baseball team, community center, and a doctor. The islanders supported themselves mainly by dredging for oysters, fishing for shad and crabbing. Their fleet of workboats included 41 skipjacks, 10 schooners and 36 bugeyes, some of which were built on the island. The wind and tide began to seriously erode the west side of the island, where most of the houses were located, in 1914. This forced the inhabitants to move to the mainland. Many disassembled their houses and other structures and took them to the mainland, predominantly Crisfield. Attempts to protect the island by building stone walls were unsuccessful. The last family left the island in 1918 when a tropical storm damaged the island's church. A few of the former residents continued living on the island during the fishing season until 1922 when the church was moved to Fairmount, Maryland. Stephen White, a minister, cared for the island for many years and formed The Holland Island Preservation Foundation. In June 2010, White sold the island to the Concorde Foundation. In October 2010, the last remaining house on Holland Island, built in 1888, collapsed. =Lighthouse= The Holland Island Bar Light, a lighthouse originally built to the south of Holland Island in 1889, was dismantled and replaced with an automated light in 1960. Geology and ecology The land of the island has been submerged as a result of erosion exacerbated by sea level rise associated with the sinking of the land's surface associated with isostatic subsidence. This process has caused a major loss of land on the island. Like other Chesapeake Bay islands, Holland Island is primarily made up of clay and silt. The western ridge of the island is very exposed to waves in the bay, making it prone to erosion as well. The island's size was reduced by half, from approximately in 1915 to in 2005. Most of the remaining land on the island is now marsh, but most of the time the entire island is underwater. Many birds, including terns, herons, songbirds, and brown pelicans used to be found on the island. A survey in 1995 counted 609 nesting pairs in a heron rookery on the island. Hurricane Isabel, a tropical storm by the time it reached Maryland in September 2003, destroyed 60 percent of the trees that previously served the rookery.

Architecture Surp Astvatsatsin is a small building with a cruciform central-plan and a dome with an octagonal drum and a Byzantine-style red tile roof. It measures only 19 feet 7 inches by 24 feet 6 inches, and is simply decorated with geometric and foliage patterns around the eaves and cornices. The apse is horseshoe shaped. Many of the original tiles on the roof which were laid on mortar have remained intact, and the church has had only some minor restoration during the 1950s. According to Thierry, Surp Astvatsatsin marks a turning point in Armenian architecture, with its plan in the shape of a cross with a single dome setting a style that would be repeated over the centuries in spite of other influences.

He and his family seem to be the only cats in the series who actually can talk. Taisho's real name is William Thomas Jefferson III, and he is a pure breed American Shorthair (though he dislikes both about himself). Taisho also owns and runs Neko Curry, a curry shop. ;K≈çichi Tanaka :Voiced by Atsushi Yamada :, who usually goes by as , is a young Japanese business man who is the only regular customer at Neko Rahmen, despite rarely receiving a decent meal. Tanaka plays the straight man to the easily excitable and scheming Taish≈ç. He is extremely diplomatic and polite, but will try to intervene to soothe Taish≈ç when he gets agitated. ;Mii-chan :A \\"youngster\\" hired by Taisho to help him run his shop. As she is a cat, she usually will be sleeping instead of working. A recurring gag is she often has a new litter of kittens which Taisho tries to unload on Tanaka and other customers. ;Mimi-chan :The only kitten of Mii-chan who has stayed with her. She is another cat working for Taisho, and like her mother, sleeps and plays more than actually works. A recurring gag is Amaiya can never tell the difference between the two. ;Second-Shop Guy :Another part-timer hired by Taisho. He is an older man with glasses and a beard, who seems to accept working for cat treats like some of Taisho's other employees. Tanaka has commented his ramen is no better than Taisho's. Never officially named, he's nicknamed \\"the Second-Shop Guy\\" as he relocates to run Taisho's second location. A running gag is that every time Tanaka visits, its profession has changed (electronic shop, outlet mall, etc.) and its always packed. Another gag with him is he never says anything but, \\"Well...yeah,\\" ;Shige-chan :A kleptomaniac bum who worked for Taisho. Taisho seems oblivious to when Shige- chan steals from the register or from customers. He eventually came back to work for Taisho's curry shop. Shige never says anything and has an unusual habit of striking a pot with a ladle. Despite his compulsion to steal, it is shown in a special manga chapter that he has a caring heart when he gave pieces of his only food to a hungry bird, dog, and baby and later saved Taisho from a fall. ;Taisho's father :A successful kitten model drawn with very wide cute eyes and a bow on one of his ears. He tried to make Taisho follow in his footsteps, but seems to accept his son's ramen shop. Because of his cuteness, Tanaka first thought he was a girl. His real name is William Thomas Jefferson II. Taisho's father loves curry to the point he can forget about scolding Taisho for a misdeed. ;Taisho's mother :She resembles Taisho aside from some aged marks and wearing a more feminine apron. She does not approve of Taisho's choice of work, and wishes him for to be married to a pedigree girl, much to his exasperation. ;Taisho's brothers :Taisho's younger brothers, who often visit their elder brother's shop. They wish to become kitten models like their father, much to Taisho's annoyance. ; :Tanaka's crush. She finds Taisho amusing, and continually ticks him off with innocent comments like being a dog person or seeing ramen as hobo food. Taisho considers her a witch for her insulting comments and how she seemingly ignores Tanaka's affections (as she is dating Akkun). Tanaka seems to lose some affection for her after seeing how she treats Akkun, restricting his diet to water and small fruits and forcing him to exercise. ;Miki :A girl Taisho developed a huge crush on (though Tanaka had first believed it was her cat Taisho was talking about). She left overseas to study as a pianist, and has left her cat, Goro, under Taisho's care. ;Goro :Miki's (male) cat that currently is living with Taisho. Tanaka had thought Goro was a girl and was Taisho's crush until Taisho (angrily) corrected him. ;Tetsu :Taisho's muscular friend who is always playing weird card games with Taisho. His occupation is a truck driver. He was a construction worker that was saving his cash up to buy his own truck and began going to Taisho's ramen stand as Taisho kindly gave him ramen for a cheap price. The two quickly became friends as they talked about their dreams. After Taisho tried to teach Tetsu how to work a crane to help him get his truck faster, they accidentally wrecked his stand. Tetsu gave all his savings to help Taisho back on his feet, allowing him to open his shop. By the time Taisho finally opened his shop, Tetsu had now become a truck driver and was there to celebrate the opening. ;Toku :An old man who works as a part-timer for Taisho. He is spacey and perhaps somewhat senile and is willing to work for glasses of milk (what Taisho was paying him). He has a twin brother named Taku. ;Taku :Taku's twin brother who resembles him except for slightly thicker facial hair and a very short temper. He also works for Taisho's ramen shop. ;Taiichi Amaiya :A full- time worker for Taisho, he was held back in high school for many years. Amaiya has had a face like an old man's since he was five years old, which has had people mistaken him for an adult. This led to shop owners believing he was at their stores to buy cigarettes and beer, which led to him having a reputation as a terrifying delinquent. However, Amaiya's face and reputation caused him to have a poor outlook at himself. However, Taisho was the first to ever call him a \\"boy\\", which has led to him becoming very respectful and idolizing of Taisho. He is one of the few people who absolutely adores Taisho's ramen and has seemed to become the second in management in the ramen stand after Taisho. A recurring gag is Amaiya can never tell Mii-chan or Mimi-chan apart, even when he has put a bow on one of them. ;Akkun :Mariko's boyfriend who resembles a typical handsome bishounen. He has an enormous appetite and can eat anything, regardless of what it is made of or how it tastes. As such, he likes Taisho's ramen, even the weirdest of creations. Taisho often uses him for eating contests, such as offering customers free ramen if they can eat more than Akkun (which no human can). However, Mariko says he hanly good looks so she worries about him getting fat. As such, she forces crazy exercise regimens and dietary restrictions on him, which he seemingly accepts. ;Soup :Taisho's pet Dachshund. She is the daughter of Mariko's dog, Mary, and was given to Taisho without his consent. Taisho initially thought she was a boy (Mariko told him later) and named her Soup after she enjoyed a bowl of soup he made when he had no other thing to feed her. Taisho eventually warmed up to the puppy and has kept her ever since. ;Washio :Mariko's friend who adores ramen and cats. As expected, she immediately falls in love with Taisho and his shop and comes more than Taisho wants. She is overbearing and often intrusive on him, as she forces grooming and nail-clipping on him. Surprisingly, Washio is from a very rich family, as she can afford owning a purebred superstar cat like Patricia. ;Patricia :Taisho's little sister who is a cat model like their father. He gets along with her the best. She resembles their father, but has the strict and tidy personality of their mother, which leads to her scolding Taisho about his cleaning and dietary habits. It was revealed later she is owned by Washio, who is rich enough to afford her.

Brand awareness is one of two dimensions from brand knowledge, an associative network memory model. Brand awareness is a key consideration in consumer behavior, advertising management, and brand management. The consumer's ability to recognize or recall a brand is central to purchasing decision-making. Purchasing cannot proceed unless a consumer is first aware of a product category and a brand within that category. Awareness does not necessarily mean that the consumer must be able to recall a specific brand name, but they must be able to recall enough distinguishing features for purchasing to proceed. Brand awareness consists of two components: brand recall and brand recognition. Several studies have shown that these two components operate in fundamentally different ways as brand recall is associated with memory retrieval, and brand recognition involves object recognition. Both brand recall and brand recognition play an important role in consumers‚Äô purchase decision process and in marketing communications. Brand awareness is closely related to concepts such as the evoked set and consideration set which include the specific brands a consumer considers in purchasing decision. Consumers are believed to hold between three and seven brands in their consideration set across a broad range of product categories. Consumers typically purchase one of the top three brands in their consideration set as consumers have shown to buy only familiar, well- established brands. As brands are competing in a highly globalized market, brand awareness is a key indicator of a brand's competitive market performance. Given the importance of brand awareness in consumer purchasing decisions, marketers have developed a number of metrics designed to measure brand awareness and other measures of brand health. These metrics are collectively known as Awareness, Attitudes and Usage (AAU) metrics. To ensure a product or brand's market success, awareness levels must be managed across the entire product life-cycle - from product launch to market decline. Many marketers regularly monitor brand awareness levels, and if they fall below a predetermined threshold, the advertising and promotional effort is intensified until awareness returns to the desired level.  Importance of brand awareness  Brand awareness is related to the functions of brand identities in consumers‚Äô memory and can be measured by how well the consumers can identify the brand under various conditions. Brand awareness plays an important role in the consumer‚Äôs purchasing decision-making process. Strong brand awareness can be a predictor of brand success. Brand awareness is strengthened by its brand- related associations such as the consumers‚Äô evaluation of the brand and their perceived quality of the brand. Consequently, brands focus on improving customer satisfaction and invest in advertising to increase consumers‚Äô brand awareness. Brand awareness is a key indicator of a brand's market performance. Brands competing in a highly globalized market invest in global advertising and distribution to compete for consumers‚Äô attention and awareness. As capitalism and global transport contribute to consumer behavior, many marketers regularly monitor brand awareness levels. If these levels fall below a predetermined threshold, the advertising and promotional effort is intensified until awareness returns to the desired level. In marketing planning and brand management, it is important to set objectives to promote brand awareness to motivate consumers to purchase a given brand‚Äôs products. Brand awareness is one of the major brand assets that adds value to the product, service or company. Investing in building brand awareness can lead to sustainable competitive advantages, thus, leading to long-term value.  Brand Equity  Brand equity is the sum of assets and liabilities relating to a brand, its name and logo, and the sum or difference is the value that is offered by the product or service or a company or the company's customers. For the assets and liabilities to have effect on brand equity, they have to be related to the name or logo of the brand. If the brand's name or logo changes, then, it can either have a positive or a negative impact on the assets and liabilities of the brand, with some of them getting transferred to the new name and logo. The brand equity stands on the assets and liabilities and it can differ from factor to factor such as, brand loyalty, brand name awareness, how a customer perceives the quality of a brand, and other proprietary assets such as patent and trademark.  Types of brand awareness  Brand awareness is divided into two components: brand recall (also known as unaided recall or occasionally spontaneous recall) and brand recognition (also known as aided brand recall). These types of awareness operate in entirely different ways with important implications for marketing strategy and advertising. = Brand recall= Brand recall is also known as unaided recall or spontaneous recall and refers to the ability of the consumer to correctly generate a brand from memory when prompted by a product category. When prompted by a product category, most consumers can only recall a relatively small set of brands, typically around 3‚Äì5 brand names. In consumer tests, few consumers can recall more than seven brand names within a given category and for low-interest product categories, most consumers can only recall one or two brand names. Research suggests that the number of brands that consumers can recall is affected by both individual and product factors including; brand loyalty, brand knowledge, situational and usage factors, and education level. For instance, consumers who are highly experienced with a given product category or brand may be able to recall a slightly larger set of brand names than those who are less experienced with a given product category or brand. =Brand recognition= Brand recognition is also known as aided recall and refers to the ability of the consumers to confirm that they have seen or heard of a given brand before. This does not necessarily require that the consumers have to identify the brand name. Instead, it means that consumers can recognize the brand upon presentation, either at the point-of-sale or after viewing its visual packaging.  Top-of-mind awareness Consumers will normally purchase one of the top three brands in their consideration set. This is known as top-of-mind awareness.Solomon, M., Hughes, A., Chitty, B., Marshall, G. and Stuart, E., Marketing: Real People, Real Choices,pp 17-19 Consequently, one of the goals for most marketing communications is to increase the probability that consumers will include the brand in their consideration sets. By definition, top-of-mind awareness is \\"the first brand that comes to mind when a customer is asked an unprompted question about a category.\\"Farris, Paul W.; Neil T. Bendle; Phillip E. Pfeifer; David J. Reibstein (2010). Marketing Metrics: The Definitive Guide to Measuring Marketing Performance. Upper Saddle River, New Jersey: Pearson Education, When discussing top-of-mind awareness among larger groups of consumers (as opposed to a single consumer), it is more often defined as the \\"most remembered\\" or \\"most recalled\\" brand name(s).See, for instance, Koniewski, M., \\"Brand Awareness and Brand Loyalty\\", PMR Research Paper, Feb, 2012, www.research-pmr.com A brand that enjoys top-of-mind awareness will generally be considered as a genuine purchase option, provided that the consumer is favourably disposed to the brand name.Manternach, L. (2011). Does your brand have top of mind awareness?. Corridor Business Journal, 7(52), 26. Top-of-mind awareness is relevant when consumers make a quick choice between competing brands in low-involvement categories or for impulse type purchases.Driesener, C., Paech, S., Romaniuk, J., & Sharp, B., \\"Brand and Advertising Awareness: A Replication and extension of a known empirical generalization,\\" Australasian Marketing Journal, vol. 12, no. 3, 2004, pp 70-80 = Marketing implications of brand awareness= Clearly brand awareness is closely related to the concepts of the evoked set (defined as the set of brands that a consumer can elicit from memory when contemplating a purchase) and the consideration set (defined as the ‚Äúsmall set of brands which a consumer pays close attention to when making a purchase decision‚Äù).Howard, J. A., & Sheth, J.N. (1969). The Theory of Buyer Behaviour. Wiley, N.Y. One of the central roles of advertising is to create both brand awareness and brand image, in order to increase the likelihood that a brand is included in the consumer's evoked set or consideration set and regarded favourably.Meenaghan, R., \\"The role of advertising in brand image development\\", Journal of Product and Brand Management, Vol. 4, no. 4, 1995, pp.23 - 34 Consumers do not learn about products and brands from advertising alone. When making purchase decisions, consumers acquire information from a wide variety of sources in order to inform their decisions. After searching for information about a category, consumers may become aware of a larger number of brands which collectively are known as the awareness set.Chon, K.Y., Pizam, A. and Mansfeld, Y., Consumer Behavior in Travel and Tourism, 2nd ed, 2000, New York, Haworth, pp 86-87 Thus, the awareness set is likely to change as consumers acquire new information about brands or products. A review of empirical studies in this area suggests that the consideration set is likely to be at least three times larger than the evoked set.Roberts, J., \\"A Grounded Model of Consideration Set Size and Composition\\", in Advances in Consumer Research, Vol. 16, Thomas K. Srull, (ed.) Provo, UT, Association for Consumer Research, 1989, pp 749-757, Online: http://acrwebsite.org/volumes/5967/volumes/v16/NA-16 Awareness alone is not sufficient to trigger a purchase, consumers also need to be favourably disposed to a brand before it will be considered as a realistic purchase option. The process of moving consumers from brand awareness and a positive brand attitude through to the actual sale is known as conversion. Hatten, R.S., Small Business Management: Entrepreneurship and Beyond, Mason, OH, South-Western Cengage, 2012, p.317 While advertising is an excellent tool for creating awareness and brand attitude, it usually requires support from other elements in the marketing program to convert attitudes into actual sales.Solomon, M., Hughes, A., Chitty, B., Marshall, G. and Stuart, E., Marketing: Real People, Real Choices,pp 363-364 Other promotional activities, such as telemarketing, are vastly superior to advertising in terms of generating sales. Accordingly, the advertising message might attempt to drive consumers to direct sales call centres as part of an integrated communications strategy.ACCC, The Comparator Website Industry in Australia, Commonwealth of Australia, 2014, p. 8 Many different techniques can be used to convert interest into sales including special price offers, special promotional offers, attractive trade-in terms or guarantees. Percy and Rossiter argue that very few shoppers use lists and this has important implications for the purchase decision and advertising strategy Percy and Rossiter (1992) argue that the two types of awareness, namely brand recall and brand recognition, operate in fundamentally different ways in the purchase decision. For routine purchases such as fast moving consumer goods (FMCG), few shoppers carry shopping lists. For them, the presentation of brands at the point-of-sale acts as a visual reminder and triggers category need. In this case, brand recognition is the dominant mode of awareness. For other purchases, where the brand is not present, the consumer first experiences category need then searches memory for brands within that category. Many services, such as home help, gardening services, pizza delivery fall into this category. In this case, the category need precedes brand awareness. Such purchases are recall dominant, and the consumer is more likely to select one of the brands elicited from memory.Percy, L. and Rossiter, J., \\"A Model of Brand Awareness and Brand Attitude Advertising Strategies\\", Psychology and Marketing, Vol. 7, no. 4, 1992, pp 263-274 When brand recall is dominant, it is not necessary for consumers to like the advertisement, but they must like the brand. In contrast, consumers should like the ad when brand recognition is the communications objective.Rossiter, J and Bellman, S., Marketing Communications: Theory and Applications, Pearson Australia, 2005, pp 157-160 The distinction between brand recall and brand recognition has important implications for advertising strategy. When the communications objectives depend on brand recognition, the creative execution must show the brand packaging or a recognisable brand name. However, when the communications objectives rely on brand recall, the creative execution should encourage strong associations between the category and the brand.Rossiter, J. R., Percy, L. and Donovan, R.J., ‚ÄúA Better Advertising Planning Grid,‚Äù Journal of Advertising Research, vol. 31 (October/November), 1991, pp 11-21. Advertisers also use jingles, mnemonics and other devices to encourage brand recall. Brand dominance occurs when, during brand recall tests, most consumers can name only one brand from a given category.Aaker, D. (1996). Building Strong Brands. New York: Free Press Publications. Brand dominance is defined as an individual's selection of only certain brand names in a related category during a brand recall procedure. While brand dominance might appear to be a desirable goal, overall dominance can be a double-edged sword. When a brand name becomes so well-known that the brand becomes synonymous with the category, the brand is said to have 'gone generic' A brand name that is well known to the majority of people or households is also called a household name Merriam-Webster Dictionary, http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/household%20name and may be an indicator of brand success. Occasionally a brand can become so successful that the brand becomes synonymous with the category. For example, British people often talk about \\"Hoovering the house\\" when they actually mean \\"vacuuming the house.\\" (Hoover is a brand name). When this happens, the brand name is said to have \\"gone generic.\\" Business Dictionary,http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/generic-brand.html Examples of brands becoming generic abound; Kleenex, Cellotape, Nescafe, Aspirin and Panadol. When a brand goes generic, it can present a marketing problem because when the consumer requests a named brand at the retail outlet, they may be supplied with a competing brand. For example, if a person enters a bar and requests \\"a rum and Coke,\\" the bartender may interpret that to mean a \\"rum and cola-flavoured beverage,\\" paving the way for the outlet to supply a cheaper alternative mixer. In such a scenario, Coca-Cola Ltd, who after investing in brand building for more than a century, is the ultimate loser because it does not get the sale.  Measuring brand awareness  Just as different types of brand awareness can be identified, there are a variety of methods for measuring awareness. Typically, researchers use surveys, carried out on a sample of consumers asking about their knowledge of the focus brand or category. Two types of recall test are used to measure brand awareness:Hsia, H.J., Mass Communications Research Methods: A Step-by-Step Approach,\\" Routledge\\" *Unaided recall tests: where the respondent is presented with a product category and asked to nominate as many brands as possible. Thus, the unaided recall test provides the respondent with no clues or cues. Unaided recall tests are used to test for brand recall. *Aided recall test: where the respondent is prompted with a brand name and asked whether they have seen it or heard about it. In some aided recall tests, the respondent might also be asked to explain what they know about the brand e.g. to describe package, colour, logo or other distinctive features. Aided recall tests are used to test for brand recognition. *Other brand-effects tests: In addition, to recall tests, brand research often employs a battery of tests, such as brand association tests, brand attitude, brand image, brand dominance, brand value, brand salience and other measures of brand health. Although these tests do not explicitly measure brand awareness, they provide general measures of brand health and often are used in conjunction with brand recall tests. To measure brand salience, for example, researchers place products on a shelf in a supermarket, giving each brand equal shelf space. Consumers are shown photographs of the shelf display and ask consumers to name the brands noticed. The speed at which consumers nominate a given brand is an indicator of brand's visual salience. This type of research can provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of packaging design and brand logos.Sutherland, M. and Sylvester, A.K., Advertising and the Mind of the Consumer: What Works, What Doesn't and Why, Great Britain, Kogan Page, 2000 pp 198-199 Metrics used to measure brand effects are collectively termed AAU metrics (Awareness, Attitudes and Usage).Farris, Paul W.; Neil T. Bendle; Phillip E. Pfeifer; David J. Reibstein (2010). Marketing Metrics: The Definitive Guide to Measuring Marketing Performance. Upper Saddle River, New Jersey: Pearson Education, Inc. . The Marketing Accountability Standards Board (MASB) endorses the definitions, purposes, and constructs of classes of measures that appear in Marketing Metrics as part of its ongoing Common Language in Marketing Project.  Brand awareness and the hierarchy of effects  Basic Hierarchy of Effects Model (after Lavidge, 1961) Brand awareness is a standard feature of a group of models known as hierarchy of effects models. Hierarchical models are linear sequential models built on an assumption that consumers move through a series of cognitive and affective stages, beginning with brand awareness (or category awareness) and culminating in the purchase decision.Egan, J., Marketing Communications, London, Thomson Learning, pp 42-43 In these models, advertising and marketing communications operate as an external stimulus and the purchase decision is a consumer response. A number of hierarchical models can be found in the literature including DAGMAR and AIDA.Diehl, D. and Terlutter, R., \\"The Role of Lifestyle and Personality in Explaining Attitude to the Ad,\\" in Branding and Advertising, Flemming Hansen, Lars Bech Christensen (eds), p. 307 In a survey of more than 250 papers, Vakratsas and Ambler (1999) found little empirical support for any of the hierarchies of effects.Demetrios Vakratsas and Tim Ambler, \\"How Advertising Works: What Do We Really Know?\\" Journal of Marketing, Vol. 63, No. 1, 1999, pp. 26-43 DOI: 10.2307/1251999 URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/1251999 In spite of that, some authors have argued that hierarchical models continue to dominate theory, especially in the area of marketing communications and advertising.O‚ÄôShaughnessy, J., Explaining Buyer Behavior, Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1992 The hierarchy of effects developed by Lavidge in the 1960s is one of the original hierarchical models. It proposes that customers progress through a sequence of six stages from brand awareness through to the purchase of a product.Lavidge,R.J. and Steiner, G.A., \\"A Model for Predictive Measures of Advertising Effectiveness,\\" Journal of Marketing, October, 1961, pp 59-62 ::::: Stage 1: Awareness - The consumer becomes aware of a category, product or brand (usually through advertising) :::::::::::::::: ‚Üì ::::: Stage 2: Knowledge - The consumer learns about the brand (e.g. sizes, colours, prices, availability etc) :::::::::::::::: ‚Üì ::::: Stage 3: Liking - The consumer develops a favourable/unfavourable disposition towards the brand :::::::::::::::: ‚Üì ::::: Stage 4: Preference - The consumer begins to rate one brand above other comparable brands :::::::::::::::: ‚Üì ::::: Stage 5: Conviction - The consumer demonstrates a desire to purchase (via inspection, sampling, trial) :::::::::::::::: ‚Üì ::::: Stage 6: Purchase - The consumer acquires the product Hierarchical models have been widely adapted and many variations can be found, however, all follow the basic sequence which includes Cognition (C)- Affect (A) - Behaviour (B) and for this reason, they are sometimes known as C-A-B models.Barry, T.E., \\"The Development of the Hierarchy of Effects: An Historical Perspective,\\" Current Issues & Research in Advertising vol. 10, no. 2, 1987, pp. 251‚Äì295 Some of the more recent adaptations are designed to accommodate the consumer's digital media habits and opportunities for social influence.

While awareness is a necessary precondition for a purchase, awareness alone cannot guarantee the ultimate purchase. Consumers may be aware of a brand, but for different reasons, may not like it or may fail to develop a preference for that brand. Hence, brand awareness is an indicator of sales performance, but does not account for all sales performance.Rossiter, J and Bellman, S., Marketing Communications: Theory and Applications, Pearson Australia, 2005, p. 107-109 For these reasons, marketers use a variety of metrics, including cognitive, affective and behavioral variables, to monitor a brand's market performance. As consumers move through the hierarchy of effects (awareness‚Üí knowledge‚Üí liking‚Üí preference‚Üí conviction‚Üí purchase), they rely on different sources of information to learn about brands. While main media advertising is useful for creating awareness, its capacity to convey long or complex messages is limited. In order to acquire more detailed knowledge about a brand, consumers rely on different sources such as product reviews, expert opinion, word-of- mouth referrals and brand/ corporate websites. As consumers move closer to the actual purchase, they begin to rely on more personal sources of information such as recommendations from friends and relatives or the advice of sales representatives.Srinivasan,N., \\"Pre-purchase External Search Information,\\" in Valarie A. Zeithaml (ed), Review of Marketing 1990, Marketing Classics Press (AMA), 2011, pp 153-189 For example, the opinion of an influential blogger might be enough to shore up preference/conviction while a salesperson might be necessary to close the actual purchase. The Purchase Funnel indicates that awareness is a necessary precondition for purchase All hierarchical models indicate that brand awareness is a necessary precondition to brand attitude or brand liking, which serves to underscore the importance of creating high levels of awareness as early as possible in a product or brand life-cycle. Hierarchical models provide marketers and advertisers with basic insights about the nature of the target audience, the optimal message and media strategy indicated at different junctures throughout a product's life cycle. For new products, the main advertising objective should be to create awareness with a broad cross-section of the potential market. When the desired levels of awareness have been attained, the advertising effort should shift to stimulating interest, desire or conviction. The number of potential purchasers decreases as the product moves through the natural sales cycle in an effect likened to a funnel.Court, D. Elzinga, D., Mulder, S. and Vetvik, O.J., \\"The Consumer Decision Journey\\", McKinsey Quarterly, June 2009, Online: http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/marketing-and-sales/our- insights/the-consumer-decision-journey Later in the cycle, and as the number of prospects becomes smaller, the marketer can employ more tightly targeted promotions such as personal selling, direct mail and email directed at those individuals or sub-segments likely to exhibit a genuine interest in the product or brand.  Creating and maintaining brand awareness  Brand advertising can increase the probability that a consumer will include a given brand in his or her consideration set. Brand-related advertising expenditure has a positive effect on brand awareness levels. Virtually anything that exposes consumers to a brand increases brand awareness. ‚ÄúRepeat brand exposure in stores improves consumers' ability to recognize and recall the brand.‚Äù Increased exposure to brand advertising can increase consumer awareness and facilitate consumer processing of the included information, and by doing this it can heighten consumers brand recall and attitude towards the brand. To increase the probability of a product's acceptance by the market, it is important to create high levels of brand awareness as early as practical in a product or brand's life-cycle. To achieve top-of-mind awareness, marketers have traditionally, relied on intensive advertising campaigns, especially at the time of a product launch.Belch, G, Belch, M.A, Kerr, G. and Powell, I., Advertising and Promotion Management: An Integrated Marketing Communication Perspective, McGraw-Hill, Sydney, Australia, 2009, p.126 To be successful, an intensive campaign utilises both broad reach (expose more people to the message) and high frequency (expose people multiple times to the message). Advertising, especially main media advertising, was seen as the most cost efficient means of reaching large audiences with the relatively high frequency needed to create high awareness levels. Nevertheless, intensive advertising campaigns can become very expensive and can rarely be sustained for long periods. Alhaddad (2015) indicates that advertising awareness plays as a good source of meaning and identity for a brand by enhance brand awareness and brand image in social media Alhaddad, A. A.(2015). The Effect of Advertising Awareness on Brand Equity in Social Media. IJEEEE, 5(2), pp.73-84. As new products enter the market growth stage, the number of competitors tends to increase with implications for market share. Marketers may need to maintain awareness at some predetermined level to ensure steady sales and stable market share. Marketers often rely on rough and ready 'rules-of-thumb' to estimate the amount of advertising expenditure required to achieve a given level of awareness. For instance, it was often held that to increase brand awareness by just one per cent, it was necessary to double the dollars spent on advertising.See for instance, Jones, J.P, The Ultimate Secrets of Advertising, Sage Publications, Thousand Oaks, CA, 2002 When a brand becomes established and attains the desired awareness levels (typically outlined in the marketing plan), the brand advertiser will shift from an intensive advertising campaign to a reminder campaign. The objective of a reminder campaign is simply to keep target audiences aware of the brand's existence and to introduce new life into the brand offer.Business Dictionary (online), http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/reminder-advertising.html A reminder campaign typically maintains broad reach, but with reduced frequency and as a consequence is a less expensive advertising option. Reminder advertising is used by established brands, often when they are entering the maturity stage of the product lifecycle. In the decline stage, marketers often shift to a caretaker or maintenance program where advertising expenditure is cut back. The rise of digital media and social networks is changing the way that consumers search for product information While advertising remains important for creating awareness, a number of changes in the media landscape and to consumer media habits have reduced the reliance on main media advertising. Instead, marketers are seeking to place their brand messages across a much wider variety of platforms. An increasing amount of consumer time and attention is devoted to digital communications devices - from computers and tablets through to cellphones. It is now possible to engage with consumers in a more cost efficient manner using platforms such as social media networks that command massive audiences. For example, Facebook has become an extremely important communications channel. Moreover, social media channels allow for two-way, interactive communications that are not paralleled by traditional main media. Interactive communications provide more opportunities for brands to connect with audience members and to move beyond simple awareness, facilitating brand preference, brand conviction and ultimately brand loyalty. The rise of social media networks has increased the opportunities for opinion leaders to play a role in brand awareness.Malaska, M., Saraniemi, S., & Tahtinen, J. (2010, September). Co-creation of Branding by Network Actors. Paper presented at 10th Annual EBRF Conference: Co-Creation as a Way Forward, (pp. 15-17), Nokia, Finland. In theory, anyone can be an opinion leader e.g. celebrities, journalists or public figures, but the rise of the digital environment has changed our understanding of who is a potentially useful influencer. Indeed, the digital environment has created more opportunities for bloggers to become important influencers because they are seen as accessible, authentic and tend to have loyal followings.Paul McIntyre, ‚ÄúIndependent bloggers overtake celebrities as key social media influencers‚Äù, Australian Financial Review , 22 June 2015 Online:http://www.afr.com/business/independent-bloggers-overtake-celebrities- as-key-social-media-influencers-20150528-ghbovu Bloggers have become key influencers in important consumer goods and services including fashion, consumer electronics, food and beverage, cooking, restaurant dining and bars. For example, a recent survey by Collective Bias, showed that when it comes to product endorsements digital influencers are more popular than celebrities. Findings showed that only 3% of participants said they would consider buying a celebrity-endorsed item, in comparison to 60% who said they had been influenced by a blog review or social media post when shopping.Singh, N., \\"Celebrity Vs Shopper\\" Harper's Bazaar (Australia), 2 April 2016 Online: http://www.harpersbazaar.com.au/news/fashion-buzz/2016/4/bloggers-are-more- popular-than-celebrities/ For marketers, the digital landscape has made it somewhat easier to identify social influencers. Popular examples of brand advertising and promotion The following examples illustrate how brand awareness and brand advertising are used in practice. =Coca-Cola \\"Share a Coke\\" campaign= The \\"Share a Coke\\" campaign received multiple \\"Creative Effectiveness\\" awards at the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity. Coca-Cola is a well-established brand with a long history and one that has achieved market dominance. For any brand, such as Coke, that controls some 70 percent of market share, there are relatively few opportunities to enlist new customers. Yet Coca-Cola is always on the lookout for novel communications that not only maintain its brand awareness, but that bring the brand to the attention of new audiences. The company launched a campaign which became known as \\"Share a Coke\\", with the campaign objectives; \\"to strengthen the brand‚Äôs bond with Australia‚Äôs young adults ‚Äì and inspire shared moments of happiness in the real and virtual worlds.\\" The campaign, originally launched in Australia, became so successful that it was subsequently rolled out to other countries. The concept was to introduce personalized Coke bottles or cans. Popular names were written in a 'look-alike Spencerian script' which is part of the Coke brand's distinctive brand identity. The campaign organisers seeded social media by targeting \\"opinion leaders and influencers to get them to [‚Ä¶] lead the conversation and encourage others to seek out 'Share a Coke' for themselves\\". Within days celebrities and others with no connection to Coke were spreading the concept across social networks. The campaign extended the audience reach as more people were exposed to the messages. According to Coke's creative team, \\"That [Australian] summer, Coke sold more than 250 million named bottles and cans in a nation of just under 23 million people\\". This campaign helped Coke extend its awareness across a broader age profile as they interacted with each customer on a personal level. =Ronald McDonald and other anthropomorphic brand characters= Ronald McDonald is an anthropomorphic brand character that has become part of McDonald's brand identity. Consumers experience few difficulties assigning a personality to a brand and marketing communications often encourage consumers to think about brands as possessing human characteristics.Puzakova, M., Kwak, H. and Rocereto, J., \\"Pushing the Envelope of Brand and Personality: Antecedents and Moderators of Anthropomorphized Brands\\", in Advances in Consumer Research, Vol. 36, Ann L. McGill and Sharon Shavitt, Duluth (eds), MN: Association for Consumer Research, 2007, pp. 413‚Äì420 (online). When brands are infused with human-like characteristics, it can assist in communicating a brand's values and creating distinctive brand identities that serve to differentiate an offering from competing brands.Smith, A. C., Graetz, B. R. and Westerbeek, H. M., \\"Brand personality in a membership‚Äêbased organisation\\", International Journal of Nonprofit and Voluntary Sector Marketing, Vol. 11 No. 3, 2006, pp. 251‚Äì266. \\"In an increasingly competitive marketplace, [some] companies rely on brand characters to create awareness, convey key product/service attributes or benefits, and attract consumers\\" (Keller, 2003). The use of anthropomorphic characters has a long history. For example, the Michelin man, employed as a memorable character to sell Michelin car tyres, was introduced as early as 1894. These characters benefit the brand by creating memorable images in the consumer's mind while conveying meanings that are consistent with the brand's values. McDonald's created a similar anthropomorphic brand character known as Ronald Mcdonald as part of its brand identity. For younger consumers, Ronald McDonald injects a sense of fun and mystery into the McDonald's brand. For parents, the character clearly signals that McDonald's is a family friendly venue. Characters help to carry the brand's identity and can be seen as non- human \\"spokes-character\\", contributing to a strong brand differentiation. The likeability of the brands character can \\"positively influence attitudes towards the brand and increase [consumers'] purchase intention\\"Hosany, S., Prayag, G., Martin, D., & Lee, W., \\"Theory and Strategies of Anthropomorphic Brand Characters from Peter Rabbit, Mickey Mouse, and Ronald McDonald, to Hello Kitty. Journal of Marketing Management, vol. 29, no 1/2, 2013, pp. 48‚Äì68. =Mini= The well-known automotive manufacturer, Mini, investigated its brand perception in the UK by carrying out 55 in-depth interview designed to elicit key feedback about the brand's values. Consumers felt that the symbolic elements which represented the brand were that it was \\"fun, stylish and sporty image\\".Simms, C. D., & Trott, P. (2006). \\"The perceptions of the BMW Mini brand: the importance of historical associations and the development of a model,\\" Journal of Product & Brand Management, pp. 228‚Äì238. Customer engagement with the MINI brand on a Facebook fan-page, promoted \\"positive effects on consumers‚Äô brand awareness, through WOM activities and the purchase intention was achieved\\".Hutter, K., Hautz, J., Dennhardt, S., & Fuller, J. (2013), \\"The impact of user interactions in social media on brand awareness and purchase intention: the case of MINI on Facebook,\\" Journal of Product & Brand Management, pp. 342‚Äì351. The brand, therefore, connected with users at an emotional level.

'Mi Buenos Aires querido' () is a tango with music by Carlos Gardel and lyrics by Alfredo Le Pera, released in 1934. It is featured on the soundtrack of its eponymous movie directed by Julio Irigoyen. Background and Composition As one of Carlos Gardel's most popular songs, this piece reflects on the beauty of Buenos Aires, Argentina. The lines of the song describe and compare the city to the feelings of love and luck, as well as getting rid of the sorrow present in the city when Gardel returns. The entire song is in a 2/4 time signature and starts in the key of B minor. As the song progresses, the key signature changes to the key of B major. In the beginning tango was associated to the low income population, performed in the poor neighborhoods (Arravales). Actually, learning to perform and swing tango has become a sign of richness and style. Uses in popular culture This tango song has appeared in multiple movie soundtracks, lending its title to two films; the 1936 film Mi Buenos Aires querido directed and written by Julio Irigoyen, which is a drama film about the Argentine tango. and a 1961 film of the same name directed by Francisco Mugica Carlos Gardel-Mi Buenos Aires querido (1934) References External links  Category:Carlos Gardel songs Category:Buenos Aires Category:1934 songs Category:Songs with lyrics by Alfredo Le Pera Category:Tangos Category:Songs about Buenos Aires Category:Songs with music by Carlos Gardel ","title":"Mi Buenos Aires querido (song)"},{"id":"14914956","text":"St Lawrence's Church Barton is a village in Warwickshire, England, on the Avon, near Bidford-on-Avon, it forms part of the civil parish of Bidford-on-Avon.

Career A native of Blankenburg am Harz, Hartmann studied medicine and sciences in Berlin, and in 1865 was an instructor of comparative zoology and physiology at the agricultural academy in Proskau. In 1873 he became a professor of anatomy at the University of Berlin. During his career, he performed ethnographical and geographical research in Africa, and conducted studies on the anatomy of marine species while working in Sweden and Italy. In 1859-60 he accompanied Adalbert von Barnim (1841-1860), the son of Adalbert of Prussia (1811-1873), on a mission to northeastern Africa (Egypt, Sudan and Nubia). Here he performed ethnographical, zoological and geographical studies in the region. On the journey, Adalbert von Barnim became ill and died on June 12, 1860 at Roseires in the Sudan. translated biography @ Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie, Barnim, Adalbert Freiherr von Hartmann wrote about his experiences regarding the expedition in a book titled Reisen des Freihern von Barnim durch Nordostafrika in den Jahren 1859 und 1860 (1863).

He served as secretary of the Berliner Gesellschaft f√ºr Anthropologie, Ethnologie und Urgeschichte (Berlin Society for Anthropology, Ethnology and Prehistory) and was general secretary of the Anthropologischen Gesellschaft (Anthropological Society).

Transport is provided by Southern Vectis community service route 39 to the town centre and standard service routes 8 and 9 to Sandown and Ryde, which run close by. Barton was built around 1844 to the east of Newport town centre; the first houses to be built were in Barton Road itself and are on the right hand side leading from Coppins Bridge. Virtually all of the original Victorian terraced houses still remain today, as well as St. Paul's Church which lies in Staplers Road. The architectural style of the original Barton houses is very typical of Victorian houses in the Newport area, with red brick facades and grey slate roof tiles. Barton Primary School dates from around the same period. Original Barton roads include Barton Road itself, St. Pauls View Road, Bellmeade Lane, Halberry Lane, Harvey Road, Cross Lane, Victoria Road, School Lane, Royal Exchange, John Street and Green Street. In the mid-1930s, the first council properties were built in Barton Road, School Lane and Highfield Road. In around 1955, the initial Pan Estate development began, which is built around Barton and continues toward Pan Lane. The estate was further developed in the late 1960s and mid-1970s to take in the growth of the local population. An additional school was built for the local area in 1970 when Downside Middle School opened. This initially took children in from all over the west and north of the Island. The school closed as part of the 2011 Island schools reorganisation; the building now houses the Downside Community and Learning Centre. During the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, a team called Barton was represented in the Isle of Wight Football League and were quite successful challenging for honours against the other notable sides of the time Parkhurst and Seaview. Notable Barton players included Willie Creighton, who was actually brought up in Barton Road itself.

The busts are displayed as bronze portraits mounted on polished granite pedestals. It attracts thousands of visitors annually. The 28th Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, was the most recent Prime Minister to be added to the Avenue. He attended the unveiling on 5 June 2017. History Richard Crouch, the original donor of the first six busts, was born in Ballarat in 1868. He was MP for Corio, representing the Protectionist Party from 1901 to 1909 and the Commonwealth Liberal Party from 1909 to 1910, and was at the time the youngest member of the House of Representatives. He was also a Labor Party MP for Corangamite from 1929 to 1931. The first six busts were unveiled on 2 March 1940 by the Governor of Victoria, Winston Dugan. Crouch also bequeathed funds for maintaining the project. It is claimed that Crouch's motivation for starting the collection was \\"his patronage and love of fine arts, which he supported and endowed in many other ways, and the influence of two parliamentary terms under the statesmen Barton, Deakin, Watson, Fisher and Scullin prompted him to return to Ballarat something of what it had given him\\". Sculptors * The busts of Barton, Deakin, Watson, Reid, Fisher, Cook, Hughes, Bruce, Scullin, Lyons, Page, Menzies, Fadden and Curtin were created by Wallace Anderson (1888‚Äì1975), born at Dean near Ballarat. He is best known for his work \\"Simpson and His Donkey\\" located at the Melbourne Shrine of Remembrance. * The creator of Forde's bust is unknown. * The bust of Chifley was created during Chifley's election campaign in 1946 by Ken Palmer, born in 1925 at Ballarat. * The busts of Holt, McEwen, Gorton, McMahon and Whitlam were created by Victor Greenhalgh (1900‚Äì1983), born at Ballarat. He is best known for his large statue of King George V which dominates the Sturt Street plantation in Ballarat. Greenhalgh was commissioned to create eight of the busts. * The busts of Fraser, Hawke, Keating, Howard, Rudd and Gillard were created by Peter Nicholson, born in 1946 in Melbourne. He is best known for his cartoons in the Nation Review, Financial Review and The Age. Nicholson's works have followed his philosophy that the busts should impart an expression of the character of the individual. * The bust of Abbott was created by Linda Klarfeld, born in 1976 in Prague, Czechoslovakia. In creating the bust she attempted to impart a sense of Abbott's perspective, including the \\"stamina to cope with day to day criticism\\". Criticisms Fraser's bust was originally created by Victor Greenhalgh. However, Greenhalgh and others were critical of the final casting. Following Greenhalgh's death in 1983, Peter Nicholson was asked to create a new bust for Fraser, which was completed after the bust of Fraser's successor Hawke had been installed. Nicholson believes that John Howard was dissatisfied with the size of his lower lip,Nicholson Cartoons ‚Äì Portrait Gallery, nicholsoncartoons.com.au and it is said that Paul Keating was unhappy with his bust's weak chin and pointy nose. Future With the cost of each bust ranging from $45,000 to $65,000, historic bequeathed funds for the construction of busts for future Prime Ministers ran out after Julia Gillard's bust. The bust of Tony Abbott, the most recent addition, was funded by the Ballarat council in 2017. The project is a part of the City of Ballarat's Arts & Culture Public Art Program and work has substantially advanced on the bust of Malcolm Turnbull. The Ballarat council has repeatedly and unsuccessfully lobbied the federal government for funding in perpetuity, and has also called for expressions of interest from sculptors.Ballarat Council offers $30,000 for Tony Abbott's head: Power FM Ballarat Busts Image:Edmund Barton bust.jpg1st Edmund Barton Image:Alfred Deakin Ballarat.jpg2nd Alfred Deakin Image:Chris Watson bust.jpg3rd Chris Watson Image:George Reid bust.jpg4th George Reid Image:Andrew Fisher bust.jpg5th Andrew Fisher Image:Joseph Cook bust.jpg6th Joseph Cook Image:Billy Hughes bust.jpg7th Billy Hughes Image:Stanley Bruce bust.jpg8th Stanley Bruce Image:James Scullin bust.jpg9th James Scullin Image:Joseph Lyons bust.jpg10th Joseph Lyons Image:Earle Page bust.jpg11th Earle Page Image:Robert Menzies bust.jpg12th Robert Menzies Image:Arthur Fadden bust.jpg13th Arthur Fadden Image:John Curtin bust.jpg14th John Curtin Image:Forde.jpg15th Frank Forde Image:Ben Chifley bust.jpg16th Ben Chifley Image:Harold Holt bust.jpg17th Harold Holt Image:John McEwen bust.jpg18th John McEwen Image:John Gorton bust.jpg19th John Gorton Image:William McMahon bust.jpg20th William McMahon Image:Gough Whitlam bust.jpg21st Gough Whitlam Image:Malcolm Fraser bust.jpg22nd Malcolm Fraser Image:Bob Hawke bust.jpg23rd Bob Hawke Image:Paul Keating bust.jpg24th Paul Keating Image:John Howard bust.jpg25th John Howard File:Kevin rudd pm bust.jpg26th Kevin Rudd Image:Bronze bust of PM Julia Gillard.png27th Julia Gillard File:Tony abbott bust.jpg28th Tony Abbott See also * Prime Ministers' Corridor of Oaks ‚Äì Faulconbridge, New South Wales References External links *Prime Ministers Avenue Brochure, Ballarat Botanical Gardens *Prime Ministers Avenue, Monument Australia * *Prime Ministers Avenue, Ballarat, 1958, victorianplaces.com.au Category:Buildings and structures in Ballarat Category:Monuments and memorials in Victoria (Australia) Category:Outdoor sculptures in Australia Category:Prime Minister of Australia ","title":"Prime Ministers Avenue"},{"id":"14915121","text":"Disodium malonate is a sodium salt of malonic acid.

She made her first on-screen appearance on 17 October 2006. Character development In 2006 Chapnik secured the role of Sam by chance. In 2008, it was announced that Chapnik was leaving Home and Away to pursue a career in the United States. Chapnik said Sam was an interesting character to play because she was \\"full of self-loathing and was so misunderstood\\". Sam was \\"doomed to fail from the beginning\\" and her \\"decline made sense\\" because she was always \\"quite tragic\\". Sam's \\"heaviness\\" made it hard for Chapnik to defend her actions, Chapnik also felt she had never experienced this with any other character. Sam is involved in a love triangle storyline through her relationship with Jack Holden (Paul O'Brien) and his ex-wife Martha MacKenzie (Jodi Gordon). Martha feels low after an abortion and kisses Jack, while Sam watches. O'Brien stated in an interview with Yahoo, \\"I think Jack felt like \\"Oh this is nice, but I've moved on, I've finally moved on and found someone, but deep down he still wants Martha.\\" O'Brien added that he believes Jack was always in love with Martha, even whilst with he was in a relationship with Sam. Martha later tries on Sam's wedding dress, causing more trouble. Gordon said that viewers would have rather seen Jack with Martha. In one storyline Sam becomes involved in a feud with Johnny Cooper (Callan Mulvey). He physically attacks Sam and threatens her son, Rory Tolhurst (Jack Rickard), to force her into helping with his plan to kill Sally Fletcher (Kate Ritchie). Johnny begins blackmailing Sam and she decides to attack him with a cricket bat. Johnny survives and is taken to hospital where Sam murders him by administering a srynge of drugs. Despite her actions Jack reads a letter that Johnny wrote detailing the truth about Sam's past. Sam's exit storyline was played out in secret. Viewers were kept in suspense when a unidentified body washes up on the beach. It is eventually revealed to be Sam's. However, Sam had killed herself and attempted to frame Jack and Martha for her \\"murder\\".  Storylines  Sam attends to Jack after he loses the use of his legs. They form a bond and begin training. Jack quizzes Sam about her love life and she is evasive. One night, Sam opens up about her husband, Shane (Mike Duncan) and the breakdown of their marriage after the death of their daughter, Jessica. Sam and Jack grow closer together and they begin a relationship. Shane later kidnaps Rory (Ed Wills) but he dies in the ensuing police chases and Rory is returned unharmed. Sam and Rory leave the bay but return and settle in the area. Jack proposes and Sam accepts but there is an obstacle; Jack's ex-wife, Martha. Things are not helped when Sam catches Martha in her wedding dress. Martha tries to stop the wedding but she is too late. Several weeks later, Johnny Cooper (Callan Mulvey), a cellmate of Shane escapes and blackmails Sam into helping him track down and kill Sally Fletcher. After Johnny attacks her, Sam hits him over the head with a cricket bat when he is about to stab Ric Dalby (Mark Furze). Johnny is left brain damaged and Sam kills him by giving him an overdose of medication. Jack finds a letter Johnny has hidden and attempts to arrest Sam but she tells him she is pregnant. Sam is unwilling to go quietly and suffers a miscarriage in a struggle with Jack. Sam leaves for the city with Rory but he refuses to leave with her. Sam, having lost everything decides to commit suicide and in one final act of revenge, she frames Jack and Martha for murder. The evidence is overwhelming and Martha and Jack are looking at a prison sentence until Morag Bellingham (Cornelia Frances) theorises that Sam had killed herself, which is proven at the last minute when Jack tracks down the drug dealer, Joe Stephens (Terence Hepburn) who'd sold Sam the heroin and been forced to bruise her. Sam's funeral is held in the city. Rory, who blames Jack for Sam's death, orders Jack not to attend. Reception Eleven Magazine opined that Sam caused \\"quite a bit of chaos in the sleepy town of Summer Bay\\". Scott Ellis of the Sun-Herald said Sam was like a \\"murderous psycho\\". Carolyn Stewart writing for TV Week said that following Sam's \\"erractic behaviour\\" and murder of Johnny, that it \\"was only a matter of time before karma caught up with her\\" and she died. While Inside Soap said that Sam's \\"cock-up\\" was not expecting that Morag would uncover the truth behind her death. They also opined that Sam should not have killed herself, because \\"revenge doesn't taste quite so sweet if you're not around to savour it.\\" Critics writing for the Daily Record have branded Sam as a \\"moralising physiotherapist\\" and a \\"meddling physiotherapist\\". A fellow disappointed critic bemoaned Sam's murder technique because killing Johnny with the cricket bat would have been \\"far more impressive\\".

Founded and initially edited by George Caragonne and Horatio Weisfeld, it ran 32 issuesGrand Comics Database: Penthouse Comix cover index plus one special edition.Grand Comics Database: Penthouse Comix #1 Special Edition 1995 Foreign versions of Penthouse Comix were still published as of 2011.  Publication history  Penthouse Comix began as a series of short segments in Penthouse Magazine. After 3 of these sections were printed (featuring artwork by Adam Hughes, Kevin Nowlan and Garry Leach), publisher Bob Guccione dictated that Penthouse Comix become its own stand-alone magazine, something which he envisioned competing in both US and European magazine markets. Guccione agreed to a budget that was designed to cherry pick art talent from both American comic book companies and non-US publishers and this resulted in Penthouse Comix offering a per-page rate among the highest ever paid to freelance comic book artists. The first issue of the stand-alone Penthouse Comix was a 96-page, color, glossy magazine with cover price of $4.95 US. It appeared in spring 1994 and featured work by Adam Hughes, Garry Leach, Kevin Nowlan, Mike Harris, Arthur Suydam, Jordan Raskin, Horacio Altuna, and Milo Manara. Subsequent issues contained work by artists such as Roberto Baldazzini, Richard Corben, Tony Salmons, Bart Sears and Gray Morrow. The magazine's early issues avoided hardcore sex in favor of \\"soft-core erotica\\" and satiric humor that poked fun at various popular genres and popular culture. Sold on newsstands, the periodical debuted in a squarebound magazine format 10¬æ\\" x 8¬º\\" (27.5 cm x 20.7 cm). With issue #11, the size was reduced to 10¬Ω\\" x 8\\" (26.7 cm x 20.4 cm). From issue #26 to the end of its run, Penthouse Comix was published at standard modern comic-book size, with saddle-stitching, card- stock covers, and glossy interior pages. Issues #6-7 were published in both a magazine-size newsstand edition and a comic-book sized direct-market edition for sale in comic-book stores. Two additional titles were later added to the line: The seven-issue Men's Adventure Comix (cover-titled Penthouse Men's Adventure Comix) (April/May 1995 - April/May 1996),Grand Comics Database: Men's Adventure Comix and the three-issue (March/April 1995 - Oct./Nov. 1995) Omni Comix,Grand Comics Database: Omni Comix the latter a companion to the science magazine Omni.

After Weisfeld's departure, some top-line artists began abandoning assignments, to be replaced by lesser talents, while overall quality and sales declined. In 1995, Caragonne was accused of embezzlement by Penthouse, was fired, and later committed suicide.Lambiet, Jose, Laurie C.

The Penthouse Comix line was then whittled to only the original magazine and Elliott edited the remainder of the magazine's run, largely printing sub-par material which had been contracted by Caragonne. General Media went bankrupt a few years later.\\"Guccione files for bankruptcy: Creditors shove pornster up against the wall,\\" Media Life Magazine (Aug. 11, 2003).

Some European countries also altered a story that featured Adolf Hitler (under laws which prohibited depiction of the Nazi leader). Editor Carragonne then went out of his way to inflame the issue by prominently featuring a swastika on the cover of Penthouse Comix #3. Although the cover had clearly been modeled on 1960s men's pulp magazine covers (which routinely featured Nazi villains), for foreign markets the swastika was altered to become an \\"X,\\" and depictions of Hitler's head and swastika ring (in one story written by Caragonne) were replaced with a smiley face. Merchandising In 1996, RC Cards issued a boxed set of Penthouse Comix trading cards. The 27 standard cards were accompanied by a chase card of Penthouse Pet Emerald Heart; a 1,000-limited- edition Alphonso Azpiri autograph card; and an Adam Hughes Hericane promotional card.

Foreign editions of Penthouse Comix continued publishing long after the American version ceased. Overseas editions of Penthouse Comix have been published in England, France, Greece.

The survivors drifted for 21 days in an open boat and were forced into cannibalism to survive. Ship history Earnmoor was built by Palmers Shipbuilding and Iron Company of Jarrow in 1887, and although owned by the Earn-Line Steamship Company of Philadelphia, was registered in England. At , she was 280 feet long and 26 feet in the beam. Engaged in the tramp trade, she did not sail on fixed routes, but rather relied on brokers to find cargoes. On 10 January 1889 Earnmoor struck a submerged rock in the Delaware River, and was stranded. An official Board of Trade hearing held at the British Consulate in Philadelphia placed the majority of the blame for the incident on the American pilot, but also criticized the master for allowing the pilot to leave the bridge, and for poor records keeping. The helmsman was also fined $22.16 for ignoring a summons and failing to attend the hearing. =Sinking= Earnmoor sailed from Baltimore on 29 August 1889 under the command of Captain Richard J. Gray. She was bound for Rio de Janeiro carrying 86,000 bushels of wheat and a large quantity of miscellaneous cargo, valued at $70,700. On 4 September, the ship encountered a severe cyclone and at 12:30 a.m on the next day gave a sudden lurch and sank. One lifeboat floated free and eleven men from the crew of 24 managed to scramble aboard. Lacking food and water the survivors suffered from intense thirst and hunger, as for 21 days the boat drifted in the Gulf Stream. They saw eleven ships, one of which, a British bark, they were convinced had seen them, but sailed away. Finally, on 25 September the survivors were picked up off Cape Hatteras by the schooner Mosquito of Salem, Massachusetts. They were so weak they that they were barely able to climb aboard, and one fell into the sea and had to be rescued by the Mosquitos cook. One man subsequently died as they were being taken to Santiago de Cuba. The remaining seven survivors were returned to the United States via Nassau, Bahamas aboard the steamship Santiago on 19 October. Two of the survivors, seaman Ludwig Loder and fireman Carl Graves, later admitted that the survivors had been driven by hunger to cannibalism. In the first 15 days they had only a single fish and a few small sea birds to eat, shared between 11 men. On the 16th day seaman William Davis, encouraged by another, August Plagge, attacked Loder with a knife and had to be restrained. That night Plagge committed suicide by jumping overboard. The next day seaman William Robinson died, and the survivors decided to eat him. The cook William Wright was ordered to dismember the body. Thomas Hunt, the 3rd Engineer, died two days later and was also eaten.

Some scholars who question if the work was actually written by a woman have even argued that the name is a distortion of the male name \\"Alberic\\". (from Bietris, also Beatriz or Beatritz; English: \\"Beatrice\\") was a trobairitz of the first half of the thirteenth century. Her birthplace was Romans near Mont√©limar.Bogin, 132-133. Other than her name, which includes her place of birth, nothing is known of the details of her life, which has led to a significant gap in knowledge for scholarship analyzing her work. She left behind one canso, \\"Na Maria, pretz e fina valors\\" (\\"Lady Maria, in your merit and distinction\\"), addressed to another woman named Mary. The poem is written in the typical troubadour style of courtly love and has been consequently analyzed as a lesbian poem.Sankovitch, 122. Bieiris may, however, be simply writing from the masculine point of view, fully immersing herself in the masculinity of the genre. Nonetheless, the certain ascription of the poem to a woman makes it unlikely that there was any attempt to \\"fool\\" the audience: the poem is consequently emasculated. The Na Maria of the poem has even been interpreted as the Virgin Mary, and the sincerity and innocence of the lyrics do not disqualify it. Fran√ßois Zufferey has argued that Bieiris' composition is in fact a work by Gui d'Ussel.Poe, 208. Joining him in ascribing the poem of Bieiris to a man are Oskar Schultz- Gora, Gianfranco Folena, and Elizabeth W. Poe.Pendle, 31. The early French medievalist Jean-Baptiste de Lacurne de Sainte-Palaye believed it to have been written on behalf of a man. Bieiris' lesbianism, too, has its defenders: Pierre Bec, Magda Bogin, Renat Nelli, and John Boswell.Pendle, 32. Angelica Rieger, on the other hand, has forcefully defended her authorship but denied her lesbianism, saying that modern readers are imposing their biases onto the text.Harvey, 333. She has sought to show that Bieiris is in fact employing the language of affection popular among noblewomen of the period.Paterson, 198. The last stanza of her canso goes like this: {  :Bella doman, cui pretz e joi enansa :e gen parlar, a vos mas coblas man, :car en vos es gajess' e alegranssa, :e tot lo ben qu'om en domna deman.  :Lovely woman, whom joy and noble speech uplift, :and merit, to you my stanzas go, :for in you are gaiety and happiness, :and all good things one could ask of a woman. } Notes Sources *Bogin, Magda.

Following the foundation of the Second Polish Republic, Berbecki served in the Polish Army.  Early life  Peter Leon Berbecki, born on a farm in Kalinowszczyzna in what is now Lublin, was one of four children. After graduating from grammar school, Berbecki enlisted in the army in 1891.  Military career  After a short stint as an enlisted man in the 44th Infantry Regiment, Berbecki was sent to a Junkers military school, returning to his regiment in 1893. After serving as a junior officer, including a stint as quartermaster of his regiment, he left the army in 1901 to study at the Kharkiv Institute of Technology. In early 1903, he was drafted into the Imperial Russian Army as an officer. He later joined the Polish Legions during World War I (commander of a regiment, battalion, member of headquarters), distinguishing himself in the Battle of Ra≈õna in 1915. After the Oath crisis in 1917, he headed the Polish Auxiliary Corps and was the training inspector of the Polnische Wehrmacht. After Poland regained its independence in 1918, he joined the Polish Army. Promoted to general in June of that year, Berbecki fought in the Polish-Ukrainian War and Polish-Soviet War, commanding the 3rd Polish Legions Division. During the interwar period, he held various functions in the Polish Army and retired in March 1939.

The distillery was latterly owned by Distillers Company through its subsidiary Mitchell Brothers. History Brothers David, John and Alexander Guthrie, members of a local farming family, founded the North Port Distillery in 1820 under the name Townhead Distillery and created the holding company, Townhead Distillery Company, as owner. The distillery was renamed Brechin Distillery in 1823, and in 1825, the holding company became Guthrie, Martin & Company. The Glencadam Distillery was founded in 1825, a few hundred yards from the North Port, and in a likely bid to avoid confusion, the Guthries changed the name of their facility from Brechin Distillery to North Port Distillery in 1839. Guthrie, Martin & Company became a limited company in 1893, and changed names to reflect this as Guthrie, Martin & Company Limited. Distillers Company (DCL) and W.H. Holt & Company Limited purchased the distillery and its extensive stock in 1922 and around 1928, transferred it to DCL subsidiary Scottish Malt Distillers. Production at the distillery ceased for a period from about 1926‚Äì28 and lasting until 1937 when it resumed only to be halted again at the onset of World War II due to the fuel and barley rationing instituted by the government. Production resumed in 1948 and continued until the distillery closed permanently in 1983. The owners sold the site for re-development in 1990 and shortly afterwards, Safeway constructed a supermarket the site. Somerfield purchased the store in October 2004 as part of a larger sale.

She performed mainly convoy escort duties during the French Revolutionary Wars, though she did capture three privateers. She foundered and was lost with all hands early in 1802. Design Between 1766 and 1780 the Admiralty had 25 vessels of her class built to a design by Sir John Williams. On 1 August 1775 the Admiralty ordered her built at Sheerness Dockyard, and she was the sixth one ordered. Her keel was laid in January 1776, she was launched on 14 September, and completed on 19 October. The Swan class sloops were unusually attractive for the class of vessel. Not only did they have sleek hull lines but they also carried an unusual amount of decoration for their size. They were built just before the Admiralty issued orders that all vessels (especially lesser rates and unrated vessels) have minimal decoration and carvings to save on costs, due to the seemingly ever- continuing war with France and other nations. 1776-1783 Fly was commissioned under Commander Edward Garner in July 1776 and he remained in command until 1778. In December 1776 she sailed for the Leeward Islands, though by 1779 she was in the North Sea. In October 1779 Commander Billy Douglas took command for the North Sea. His replacement, c. August 1781, was Timothy Kelly. On 6 September 1782 Fly encountered and captured L'Escamoteur, a 14-gun French privateer. The privateer was accompanied by two vessels that she had taken as prizes, a merchant brig and a sloop. Fly escorted all three vessels to Yarmouth where they were transferred to Admiralty control. Fly was paid off in May 1783. French Revolutionary Wars In June 1794, five days after the capture of Port-au-Prince, she came under the command of Richard Hussey Moubray, previously first lieutenant of , who had assisted in the landing of troops. Moubray then took Captain Rowley and Lieutenant Colonel Whitelocke, who were carrying the dispatches, to England. In December 1794 Fly escorted the Duke of York from Helvoetsluys to Harwich. Later, she took part in the seizure of Dutch ships in Plymouth Sound: two line-of-battle ships, one frigate, two sloops-of-war, nine East Indiamen and about sixty other vessels. Afterwards, Fly escorted merchant vessels in the Channel and between Britain and Gibraltar.Marshall (1823), Vol. 1, Part 2, p.805-6. On 22 August 1796 Fly captured the French privateer Furet some seven leagues off Portland. Furet was a small privateer armed only with five swivels and carried a crew of 27 men. In January 1796 Commander Henry S. Butt took command, followed in May 1797 by Commander William Cumberland, and in November 1798 by Commander Zachary Mudge. On 4 February 1799 Fly pursued and captured the French privateer cutter Gleneur off Portland. Gleneur carried six 4-pounder guns and 32 men and was under the command of Emanuel Tone. She had sailed from Cherbourg the night before, where British frigates had chased her two days earlier. On her previous cruise Gleneur had successfully cut out of Torbay Anna of Hull, Hopwell of Lisbon, and Lucy of Whitehaven. Hopewell was later recaptured.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 1, p.258. On 21 May 1800 Fly arrived at Portsmouth from Halifax with dispatches from the Duke of Kent. She made the crossing in three weeks, having narrowly escaped hitting an immense island of ice on the edge of the Newfoundland Banks. Fly had been sailing in a thick fog at dusk when lookouts suddenly spotted the iceberg about 120 yards (\\"a cable's length\\") in front of her. Fly was moving at about nine knots but a swift turn of the helm enabled her to clear the south end of the iceberg by half a cable's length.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 3, p.416. Fly sailed on 28 June 1800 and returned to Portsmouth on 7 July together with . They brought with them a Prussian vessel carrying a cargo of salt.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 4, pp.164-5. Fly then sailed again, returning on 26 July from a cruise off Cherbourg. Two days later she set off again for Cherbourg. Gales forced her to quit Cherbourg. She cleared La Hogue with difficulty but nevertheless captured the French privateer cutter Trompeur there. Trompeur had been out two days and taken nothing. In November 1800 Fly came under the command of Commander Thomas Duvall. She sailed from Portsmouth on 7 January 1801 with a convoy of 13 vessels for the coast of Africa.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 5, p.158. On the way they encountered a French squadron of five sail of the line and two frigates, leading Fly to order the convoy to scatter.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 4, p.162. On 19 March a letter arrived in Plymouth from Fly reporting that ten of the vessels had made it safely to Africa. (The Naval Chronicle reported that the three others had aborted their voyage, returning safely to Britain.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 5, p.275.) Fly herself returned on 20 August.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 6, p.158. Five days later, Mr William McLeod, Flys purser faced a court martial on board in Portsmouth Harbour. The charges were drunkenness, neglect of duty, and failure to supply Fly with stores. The court martial board found McLeod guilty and ordered him dismissed from the Navy.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 6, p.244. Fate On 17 September 1801 Fly left Portsmouth as escort to a convoy for Newfoundland.Naval Chronicle, Vol. 6, p.258. She foundered and was lost with all hands off Cape Flattery, Newfoundland in January 1802. Postscript The original plans of Fly still exist.

After sacking Ani and Caesarea in 1063 and 1067, respectively (some sources suggest as early as 1064), the Byzantine army in the East was in too poor a shape to resist the advance of the Turks. Had it not been for the efforts of the emperor Romanos IV Diogenes the Byzantine Empire would have suffered her \\"Manzikert\\" disaster sooner. From Syria, a successful counter-attack drove the Turks back. After the attack on Iconium was repelled, Romanos IV launched his second campaign. Further campaigning was met with some success by Romanos, despite the ill nature of his army which had been poorly led since the death of Basil II. The victory was a short respite - sometime after Manzikert, in the midst of civil conflict, Iconium fell to the Turks. The city saw a brief return to Christendom during the First Crusade, possibly under Byzantine rule but the Turks counter-attacked at the Crusade of 1101 and Konya would form the capital of Byzantium's most dangerous opponent.

On June 11, 1838, James Morreau led a rebel raiding party of 26 Hunter Patriots across the Niagara River into Upper Canada. Morreau was aided by Samuel Chandler, a wagon maker from the village of St Johns in Thorold Township, Upper Canada. The party soon reached Pelham Township where they camped in the woods. Their intention was to get the locals to rise up in rebellion. The night of June 21/22 the Patriots, in three groups, attacked a detachment of Queen's Lancers lodged at John Osterhout's tavern in St Johns. After a brief fire fight, the raiders attempted to set fire to the building - persuading the Lancers to surrender. Realizing the threat of imminent capture, the Patriots then fled westward towards Hamilton. At dawn, the Lincoln Cavalry, militia volunteers, Queen's Lancers, and Natives from the Grand River were deployed to hunt down the Patriots. In short order, 31 Patriots were captured, bringing an end to the invasion. The leaders were gaoled at Niagara, and the rest at Drummondville (Niagara Falls, Ontario). Among the Patriots arrested were Chandler and Morreau. Chandler was later tried and sentenced to banishment to Tasmania for life, while Morreau was executed on July 30 in Niagara.

Ashanti (also called Ashanti, Land of No Mercy) is a 1979 action adventure film directed by Richard Fleischer and starring Michael Caine, Peter Ustinov, Kabir Bedi, Beverly Johnson, Omar Sharif, Rex Harrison, and William Holden. It is based on the 1977 novel √âbano by Alberto V√°zquez-Figueroa, with a screenplay written by Stephen Geller and an uncredited George MacDonald Fraser. The story is set against the background of modern-day slave trading, with a man who determinedly takes on a perilous journey in order to find his beautiful wife, who has been kidnapped by brutal slave traders. Despite its impressive cast and setting (on location in the Sahara, and in Kenya, Israel, and Sicily), Ashanti was widely panned by critics upon release. Michael Caine was reportedly very disappointed with the project and claims it was the third worst film along with his previous films The Magus and The Swarm (despite appearing in other failures in the 1980s). It was one of Holden's final films, and the final film of cinematographer Aldo Tonti. Plot summary David and Anansa Linderby are doctors with the World Health Organization. On a medical mission carrying out an inoculation programme, they visit a West African village. While David takes photographs of tribal dancers, Anansa goes swimming alone. She is attacked and abducted by slave traders led by Suleiman, who mistake her for an Ashanti tribeswoman. The police can do nothing to find her and David has almost given up hope when he hears rumours that Anansa has been kidnapped by Suleiman to be sold to Arab Prince Hassan. The African authorities deny that the slave trade even exists. So David must find help in a shadowy world where the rescuers of slaves are just as ruthless as the traders themselves. As David tracks her across Africa and the Sahara desert, he is helped by a member of the Anti-Slavery League, a mercenary helicopter pilot, and Malik, a tribesman who is seeking revenge on Suleiman.https://filestubealternative.wordpress.com/ Cast Production The project was announced in January 1978 with Richard C. Sarafian to direct, Michael Caine, Omar Sharif, Peter Ustinov and Telly Savalas to star. Ken Norton was offer a role in the film but turned it down. The film was shot on location in Kenya starting in April. Two weeks into filming, director Richard Sarafian was sacked and replaced by Richard Fleischer. The female lead and cinematographer were fired. Telly Savalas who was in the cast had to drop out. Fleischer arranged for the script to be rewritten. George MacDonald Fraser, who had recently adapted Tai Pan for the producers, was commissioned to work on the script to help boost Sharif's part.George MacDonald Fraser, The Light's On at Signpost, HarperCollins 2002 p205-206 Director Fleischer and co-star Beverly Johnson were supposedly both removed from filming two-thirds of the way through the shoot due to sunstroke.Citizen Caine film review However, an interview with Ms. Johnson included on the 2013 Severin Films Blu-ray edition of Ashanti makes no reference to these \\"removals\\", suggesting that they may belong to myth.

It serves the MBTA Middleborough/Lakeville Line and is a stop on the CapeFLYER seasonal line. The station consists of a single full-length high-level platform which is fully handicapped accessible. It is located adjacent to the BAT Centre, the primary hub for Brockton Area Transit Authority local bus service. The first station in the town (then called North Bridgewater) opened in 1846 on the Fall River Railroad. The railroad helped Brockton grow into a major manufacturing center. In the 1890s, Brockton was the site of the state's first major grade crossing elimination program, which included the construction of a massive stone viaduct and a pair of station buildings designed by Bradford Gilbert. Passenger service ended in 1959, and the station was demolished during an urban renewal program in the 1960s. After two decades of planning, the modern station was opened for commuter rail service by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) in 1997. History =Early history= The one-story Brockton station around 1880 The Fall River Railroad opened from Myricks to South Braintree on December 21, 1846, including a stop at the town of North Bridgewater. The line went through several mergers and became part of the Old Colony and Fall River Railroad system in 1854. Unusually among larger cities in Massachusetts, Brockton was never a railroad junction; east-west branches were built from Bridgewater proper before North Bridgewater became a major manufacturing area. A charter for a branch from Stoughton to North Bridgewater was applied for in 1845 ‚Äì before the railroad had even been completed ‚Äì but nothing became of the plan. The first North Bridgewater station was a one-story structure located south of Center Street on the west side of the railroad tracks. (Until 1895, most railroads in southeastern Massachusetts had left-hand running, with Boston- bound trains on the western track). It was replaced by 1878 by a Victorian- style station located close by at Church Street, also west of the tracks. Commuting from North Bridgewater to Boston on the railroad was possible after 1854, and North Bridgewater was the outer terminus of some trains in the late 1850s and early 1860s. The railroad became the Old Colony and Newport Railroad in 1863, and finally the Old Colony Railroad in 1872. The town was renamed Brockton in 1874, with the railroad station changing its name on May 7. The railroad was a key part of the town's burgeoning shoe industry and rapid growth, which caused Brockton's population to double from 1877 to 1887. =Grade crossing elimination= The Victorian-style Brockton station before it was replaced in the 1890s On June 21, 1890, the Massachusetts General Court passed An Act to Promote the Abolition of Grade Crossings, which allowed town officials or a railroad company to petition the state superior court to create an independent commission to determine whether a grade crossing could and should be eliminated. The costs of such eliminations were to be paid 65% by the railroad, not more than 10% by the town, and the remainder by the state. The small local cost provided towns incentive to petition for crossing eliminations to prevent public thoroughfares from being blocked by trains. Numerous municipalities soon agitated for crossing eliminations, with Brockton's April 1891 petition the first of the lot. Shortly before then, the Old Colony Railroad announced plans to replace the aging and undersized Brockton station with a more appropriate structure. The station design was well-received, but its at-grade design ‚Äì which would have precluded crossing eliminations ‚Äì was seen as a threat to the economic future of the city. Brockton then had no fire station east of the railroad, adding fire safety concerns to the more widespread issue of pedestrian safety. Frequent delays for fire engines responding to calls caused higher insurance rates and lower land values in the eastern part of the city. The 1890 law had only authorized municipalities to eliminate crossings with public roads; however, many crossings in Brockton were private roads that the city did not have the right to modify. On June 15, 1892, the General Court authorized Brockton to include private roads in its grade separation project. The bridge over Court Street, one of five massive stone arch bridges built during the grade crossing elimination project As the petition to consider elimination of all grade crossings in the city was under way, city engineer F. Herbert Snow prepared a preliminary plan. The proposal called for tracks to be raised and streets lowered through the city center, and the tracks lowered and streets raised in the Campello village to the south. Brockton station and Montello station to the north would be completely replaced and relocated, while Campello station would be replaced on its existing site. The railroad was initially opposed to the expense of the plan; however, city engineers made a convincing case that grade separation would only be more expensive in the future, and the two parties reached an agreement in June 1893. The New Haven Railroad leased the Old Colony Railroad in 1893 and continued with the project. The Massachusetts Board of Railroad Commissioners approved the grade separation project on April 21, 1894, allowing construction to proceed. A later postcard view of the new stations Snow oversaw the design and construction of the project until its completion. The final quadruple-tracked stone viaduct was long, with stone arch bridges spanning five downtown streets; seven new bridges over the railroad were built near Montello and Campello. A total of of track was raised up to ; an additional was lowered up to . A pair of massive stone passenger stations were constructed north of Centre Street in Brockton, with a smaller station pairs at Campello and Montello ‚Äì each with a pedestrian tunnel connecting the two buildings. The stations were designed by Bradford Gilbert, who had previously designed a number of other Old Colony stations including those still standing at Bridgewater, Canton Junction, and North Abington. The pair of Brockton stations was built of Milford pink granite with brown trim and slate roofs in the Richardsonian Romanesque style then common for railroad stations in the area. A platform next to each building served the outer tracks, while the inner pair of tracks was fenced off to allow express trains to safely pass at speed. The western two tracks and stations were constructed first, allowing service to continue without interruption on existing tracks until that half of the modified tracks were completed. A massive new freight yard was constructed just north of downtown Brockton; smaller yards were built at Montello and Campello to handle local freight. The grade separation and station construction were completed by early 1897. The finished project, with its stone stations and bridges, was well-received; a number of other cities modeled their grade separation efforts on Brockton's success. However, the work cost $2,236,411 (), of which the railroad paid the majority. Despite the operational benefits, railroads thereafter became much more wary of large grade separation projects: =Closure and revival= Several of the 1890s-constructed retaining walls and staircases remain intact Passenger rail service around Boston began declining in the 1920s, starting with branch lines. By 1954, Brockton was served by 13 daily round trips, for six of which it was the outer terminus. Only two of the four tracks remained at the station. After the completion of the parallel Southeast Expressway, remaining passenger service on the Old Colony Division was ended by the New Haven Railroad on June 30, 1959. The bridge over the Neponset River was destroyed by fire in 1960; the need for a replacement bridge drastically increased the cost of restoring passenger service. The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) was founded in 1964 to subsidize suburban commuter rail service; the agency restored service on several other lines, but southeastern Massachusetts remained without passenger service. The line continued to be used for freight service by the New Haven and its successors Penn Central and Conrail. The station buildings were torn down in the late 1960s during an urban renewal project. A new police station, which lacked the grandeur of both the former railroad buildings and the former police station, was constructed on the eastern site in 1967. It was built atop the retaining walls of the former station; the walls and several stone stairwells to the street remain intact. The modern station has a full-length high-level platform that is handicapped accessible In the 1970s, calls began to restore service on the former Old Colony Division. On January 27, 1973, the MBTA purchased most of Penn Central's commuter rail rights-of-way in southeastern Massachusetts, including the Middleborough main line from Braintree to Campello. A 1974 state analysis of restoring commuter rail service indicated that the Brockton platforms were still extant, but would need refurbishing for use. From 1984 to 1988, Cape Cod and Hyannis Railroad seasonal commuter and excursion service stopped in Brockton at the former station site. In 1984, a state-directed MBTA study found that restoration of commuter rail service would be feasible. A Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) was released in May 1990, followed by a Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) in 1992. Both the DEIS and FEIS included conceptual plans placing Brockton station between Crescent Street and Lawrence Street, south of the former location and just outside the downtown core. However, the station was instead constructed at the previous site, accessed behind the police station. The accessible full-length island platform occupies the former inner track spaces, with the line's two current tracks location where the outer tracks originally were. The Middleborough/Lakeville Line and Kingston/Plymouth Line opened for commuter service on September 29, 1997. On February 15, 1999, the Brockton Intermodal Centre (BAT Centre) opened one block away as a terminal for Brockton Area Transit Authority local bus service. The $4 million bus station was designed to imitate the architecture of the former railroad station. The project also included a 250-space surface parking lot. In December 2001, the state congressional delegation secured $1 million to support construction of a parking garage at the bus terminal. The garage opened on April 30, 2004. The seasonal weekend CapeFLYER service to Cape Cod began stopping at Brockton in 2015.

Telavi was first elected to parliament in 2006 and was re-elected in 2010. He became prime minister on 24 December 2010 and the Telavi Ministry retained government until August 2013. The refusal of prime minister Telavi to recall the Parliament of Tuvalu after the 2013 Nukufetau by-election resulted in a constitutional crisis when he adopted the position that, under the Constitution of Tuvalu, he was only required to convene parliament once a year, and was thus under no obligation to summon it until December 2013. The opposition then requested the Governor-General of Tuvalu, Sir Iakoba Italeli, to intervene against the Telavi‚Äôs decision. On 3 July, Governor-General Italeli exercised his reserve powers in ordering parliament to convene, against the prime minister Telavi's wishes, on 30 July. On 1 August 2013 Governor-General Italeli again exercised his reserve powers and dismissed Telavi as Prime Minister of Tuvalu and appointed the opposition leader Enele Sopoaga as Tuvalu‚Äôs caretaker prime minister. A day later, on 2 August 2013, Telavi's government was successfully brought down through a vote of no confidence in parliament. He resigned from parliament in August 2014. He was absent for much of the parliamentary year tending to his sick wife in Hawaii, and he resigned in order to remain at his wife's side. Background Telavi is from Nanumea. His career in the Tuvalu police force culminated in his appointment as police commissioner in 1993, a position he held for thirteen years. He earned a degree in legal studies from the University of the South Pacific in 1999 and a master's degree in international management from Northern Territory University in 2000. Willy Telavi was appointed to his current position in May 1993, he has served more than 16 years in various positions with the Tuvalu police force. Ministerial office Telavi stood for the Parliament of Tuvalu in 2006 and was elected to serve the constituency of Nanumea. The government of prime minister Apisai Ielemia came to office following the election. Telavi was appointed minister for home affairs in the Ielemia administration.Tuvalu: Cabinet, Central Intelligence Agency He retained his seat in parliament in the 2010 general election, and was appointed minister for home affairs in the cabinet of the new prime minister, Maatia Toafa. Prime Minister In December, just four months after the new government took office, Telavi crossed the floor, joined the opposition and enabled it to bring down the government through a motion of no confidence, carrying it by eight votes to seven. The motion was reportedly initiated due to MPs' concerns over certain aspects of the budget, in particular the prospect that the government may no longer fully fund patients' medical costs abroad. On 24 December Telavi was elected as the prime minister, defeating foreign affairs and environment minister Enele Sopoaga by another 8‚Äì7 vote.

Telavi delayed calling a by-election after the death of Lotoala Metia, an MP from Nukufetau, until ordered by the High Court to call the by-election. On 28 June 2013, the Telavi government lost a crucial by-election in Nukufetau, which gave the opposition a majority of one in parliament. The opposition immediately called for the government to reconvene parliament.\\"Tuvalu‚Äôs Opposition waiting to hear from GG\\", Islands Business, 1 July 2013 Prime Minister Telavi responded that, under the Constitution, he was only required to convene parliament once a year, and was thus under no obligation to summon it until December 2013.\\"Parliament needs one yearly meeting only says defiant Tuvalu PM\\", Radio New Zealand International, 2 July 2013 The opposition turned to the governor- general, Iakoba Italeli.

He was not the first government member to vacate or temporarily leave office: Lotoala Metia had died (and an opposition member had been elected at the resulting by-election), education minister Falesa Pitoi had become ill and had been outside the country since December 2012. Tanukale's resignation therefore left Telavi with only three active government members other than himself: deputy prime minister Kausea Natano, foreign affairs minister Apisai Ielemia, and home affairs minister Pelenike Isaia (there were no government backbenchers). He also had the support of the Speaker.\\"Tuvalu govt bombshells\\", Islands Business, 30 July 2013 The following day, the reason for Tanukale's resignation became apparent. The speaker, Kamuta Latasi, rejected the opposition's attempt to table a motion of no confidence, on the grounds that there was now a vacant seat in parliament. Latasi adjourned parliament, and ruled that it would not reconvene until a by-election had been held ‚Äì thus prolonging Telavi's minority government once more.\\"Tuvalu in constitutional crisis, says opposition\\", Radio New Zealand International, 31 July 2013 However, a day later, on 1 August 2013, the governor-general sent out a proclamation removing Telavi as the prime minister of Tuvalu. He was subsequently replaced by opposition leader Enele Sopoaga, who becomes caretaker prime minister. Opposition member Taukelina Finikaso alleged that the prime minister had attempted to remove Sir Iakoba Italeli as governor-general of Tuvalu, prompting Telavi's removal described as 'upholding' the Tuvaluan constitution. His government was successfully removed from office a day later by Parliament, on 2 August 2013. Willy Telavi defended his actions in not calling the by-election or recalling parliament, and placed the responsibility for the constitution crisis with the governor general, who he says intervened only five days after the by-election, ‚ÄúThough he got the power to do that, we are a small country where we can consult each other without resorting to this kind of exercising of powers‚Äù.

He is one of the drivers with the most titles in the history of Turismo Carretera: seven. Biography After having some success in football (he played for homecity's Club Sports Salto until 5th division and was champion once) he started his career in motor racing. His father, Hugo, bought him a go-kart when he was 16 years old so he could compete in the Buenos Aires Province kart tournament. He was vice-champion in the series with rivals as Norberto Fontana. His talent was worthy of an invite by Tulio Crespi to drive for Argentine Formula Renault. The two-year period in Formula Renault meant an opportunity to drive a Tulio Crespi's Ford Escort XR3 in TC2000 series. He also started his career in Turismo Carretera (TC), the most popular car racing category in Argentina. In 1998, he became the youngest TC champion. He was distinguished by Clar√≠n and Olimpia Awards that year. He got his second TC championship in 2000, assisted by Jorge Pedersoli and Sandro Crespi. He was also vice-champion in Top Race that year. The conflict between ACTC and CDA (ACA) meant that he could not compete in TC2000 (he was planned to partner Juan Mar√≠a Traverso and Lucas Armelini in Toyota team). He managed to win both the 2001 Top Race and TC Championships to Omar Mart√≠nez in the very last race of each season. After the ACTC-ACA conflict came to an end, he could return to TC2000 at the wheel of Honda partnering Juan Manuel Silva and Oscar Larrauri. In 2002, he was recruited by Tango Racing to drive for ARCA series. He took part of one race at the wheel of Chevy Monte Carlo but did not finish. He returned to Argentina and crowned himself again as Turismo Carretera champion. Guillermo Ortelli in 2012 He returned to new-born Top Race V6 in 2005, driving a Chevrolet Vectra sponsored by Club Atl√©tico Boca Juniors. He snatched away with the title at the end of the season. From 2006 to 2008, Ortelli continued in TC2000 in the works Chevrolet squad, finishing 6th, 4th, and 2nd respectively. In 2009 he switched to Chevrolet, where he resulted 8th that year and 11th the next year. Therefore, he returned to Renault for 2011. In 2010 he won the Konex Award as one of the five best Racing Drivers from the last decade in Argentina. It continues to the present in TC. He was champion again in 2016, but has not won a race since that year. Ortelli has statistics close to 400 races, 30 victories, 30 poles and 100 podiums. Between 2012 and 2014 he raced with Renault in S√∫per TC 2000 and between 2014 and 2017 in Turismo Nacional.

It was released only in Japan on March 8, 2002. It is the first Game Boy Advance title that uses a tilt-sensor chip.  Gameplay  In Koro Koro Puzzle Happy Panechu!, the basic strategy is to first fill the screen with colored blocks called Panechus and then make them disappear by making a group of Panechus in one color come together to fill up the bomb meter. Then combine the bombs into mega bombs to blow up the screen big time. The bomb meter is the blue dotted field in the bottom right. When you make Panechus disappear, you get black spots in this field, which will be turned into bombs the next time you press A. Try to make long combos for higher bomb scores. A combo is when you make Panechus disappear in a row without interruption. You can hear how good you're doing by the shouts from the Panechus as they disappear. For some instances, a 1 combo will make them say \\"HAPPY\\", a 2+ combo will make them say \\"SO HAPPY\\", a 6+ combo will make them say \\"MEGA HAPPY\\" and so on. You can see at the top of the bomb meter how many bonus bomb points you get (1+, 2+, 3+, 5+ etc.). If the field gets filled up a \\"DANGER!!\\" alert will come up, and you get 10 seconds to clear things up or it is game over. = Modes = There are five different play modes to choose from. * Block Battle ‚Äì Set off bombs to send blocks to the AI opponents screen. The first one to get a completely cluttered screen loses. The left side will show you the opponent's status. * Knock-Out Game ‚Äì Blow up bombs next to the enemy platform in the middle to harm him, bigger bombs means more harm. The status bar to the left shows how much energy the enemy got left. The enemy will send magic blocks into the playing field to hinder you. * IQ Puzzles ‚Äì Clear the screen of Panechus in the least possible number of moves. Any panechus left on the screen and you lose. Unlike the other modes you can't make more Panechus appear with the A button and there are no bombs or bomb meter. * High Score Game ‚Äì Gather as many points as possible in the set time by blowing up big bombs. * Time Challenge ‚Äì Clear the screen in as short time as possible. The top right meter ticks up, when it fills, new blocks falls onto the screen. = Items = Screenshot showing the Panechus in Koro Koro Puzzle Happy Panechu! * Panechus ‚Äì The cute little creatures with big lips. They come in four colors: pink, yellow, blue and green. When three or more of them in the same color come together, they vanish. * Bombs ‚Äì These black objects are important in the game. When they get together they stick to each other. Two or more sticking together can be blown up with the B button, erasing blocks or hurting enemies. Stick four up in a square to make a big bomb, stick two big bombs together to make an even bigger bomb, and two of those will get you the largest bomb to create. Bigger bombs means more firepower. * Hindering Blocks (Grey) ‚Äì These are mainly in the way. They can be single blocks, or longer rows. They don't stick together, and you can blow them up with bombs. The bombs need to touch the block directly to blow it up. * Magic Blocks (Transparent) ‚Äì These are pretty much the same as the Hindering Blocks, except they are nice and transparent looking. These only appear in the Knock-Out mode. * Diamonds ‚Äì These are rare objects. When blown up with the B button, they make all blocks on screen vanish. You can make them appear by shutting a Panechu up inside a big bomb (make a 3√ó3 bomb with a Panechu in the middle). * IQ Mode Blocks ‚Äì There are three kinds of blocks in this mode: IQ- Panechu (Big nose), which works like a normal Panechu; Wall Block (Nostrils), which forms a rigid block when stuck together; and IQ-Hinder Block (Grey Sleeping), which gets in the way. = Reversing the Tilt Sensor = It is possible to reverse the tilt sensor to be able to properly play it on a GBA SP. In the menu, go to \\"option\\" (rightmost green panechu) then choose the blue \\"tilt sensitivity\\" one. On this screen, press and hold first UP, then L, then R, and finally B. After this, you should get a confirmation message accompanied by a little chime. You might want to reconfigure your sensitivity back to where it was since pressing up changed it.

Plot summary David Garth, M.D., has fallen in love with the beautiful widow Betty, Lady Calder. Detective-Inspector Twigg of Scotland Yard tries to warn Dr. Garth about the chequered past of Lady Calder, but it takes all the nerve of Garth's friend Cullingford Abbot, assistant to the Commissioner of Scotland Yard, to state that, among other things, Betty danced for three seasons at the Moulin Rouge and is thought to have joined a Satanist group in Paris. She is also reputed to be a blackmailer responsible for at least two suicides. However, Betty herself raises the possibility that she is being mistaken for the machinations of her sister Glynis. When Glynis is found dead on the beach near a bathing-pavilion, in the middle of a stretch of unmarked sand, Betty is suspected of arranging the death (although no one can suggest how it might have happened).

Constituency background Italeli was elected to represent Nui in the Parliament of Tuvalu on a non-partisan basis; this lack of alignment is not unusual in the politics of Tuvalu; unusually for Tuvalu, Italeli represented a constituency where trilingualism is a feature, since many inhabitants of Nui originate from Kiribati, and thus speak Gilbertese, in addition to Tuvaluan and English, the fluency of which varies among local people. His younger brother, Isaia Italeli, was elected to Parliament, also as MP for Nui, in the September 2010 general election, and subsequently became Speaker, then Minister for Works and Natural Resources.Tuvalu: 2010 general election, Inter-Parliamentary UnionTuvalu: Cabinet , Central Intelligence Agency Governor-General In 2010, Italeli was appointed Governor-General of Tuvalu by Elizabeth II, Queen of Tuvalu. In 2013, Italeli faced a political crisis when Prime Minister Willy Telavi's government lost a crucial by-election on 28 June and thereby lost its majority in parliament. The opposition thereafter held a majority of seats (eight to seven) and immediately called for the Prime Minister to advise that parliament be reconvened.\\"Tuvalu‚Äôs Opposition waiting to hear from GG\\" , Islands Business, 1 July 2013 Telavi responded that, under the constitution, parliament was required to convene only once a year and he was thus under no obligation to advise the Governor-General to summon it until December 2013.\\"Parliament needs one yearly meeting only says defiant Tuvalu PM\\", Radio New Zealand International, 2 July 2013 The opposition turned to Italeli and, on 3 July, he exercised his reserve powers by summoning parliament, against the Prime Minister's wishes, on 30 July.\\"Tuvalu‚Äôs parliament convenes July 30\\" , Islands Business, 3 July 2013 With only five members of the governing party and eight members of the opposition party in the legislature, the Speaker of the Parliament, Kamuta Latasi, still refused to allow a vote of non-confidence and Taom Tanukale, a member of Telavi's party, resigned his seat in parliament, prompting Telavi to assert that no confidence vote should be held until a by-election was conducted in Tanukale's district, but without giving a date for such an election. The opposition subsequently appealed again to the Governor-General, who then, on 1 August, replaced Telavi with the former opposition leader Enele Sopoaga as prime minister and ordered that parliament sit until 2 August to allow for the vote of non-confidence regarding Telavi's government to take place. On the same day, Telavi declared he had written to Elizabeth II, the Queen of Tuvalu, advising her to replace Italeli as governor general and that Italeli \\"had been fired\\". The Queen gave no indication of her reaction to Telavi's letter, leaving Italeli's position secure.

What is known is that his grandfather Yang Xu (Ê•äÁ∫å), a member of Tang Dynasty's predecessor Sui Dynasty's imperial clan, was a brother of the early Tang chancellors Yang Gongren and Yang Shidao. As Wu Zetian's mother Lady Yang was a cousin of Yang Xu, she viewed him as a member of her mother's household and treated him well. As of 692, he was serving as the minister of defense (Â§èÂÆòÂ∞öÊõ∏, Xiaguan Shangsu), when she gave him the designation of Tong Fengge Luantai Pingzhangshi (ÂêåÈ≥≥Èñ£È∏ûËá∫Âπ≥Á´†‰∫ã), making him a chancellor de facto.Yang's biography in both Old Book of Tang and New Book of Tang indicated that he received the higher chancellor de facto designation of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Sanpin (Âêå‰∏≠Êõ∏ÈñÄ‰∏ã‰∏âÂìÅ), but this appeared to be erroneous, as it conflicts with the chronicles of her reign in both of those sources, the table of chancellors in the New Book of Tang (see New Book of Tang, vol. 61 ), and also did not match the chancellor titles during the times of her reign. See Old Book of Tang, vol. 6 and New Book of Tang, vol. 4. When doing so, she commented that she wanted the members of both her father's and mother's clans to be chancellors (and by that time, her nephews Wu Chengsi and Wu Youning were chancellors). Seven months later, as part of a major reorganization of her administration, he was removed from his chancellor position along with Wu Chengsi and Wu Youning, and made the minister of public works (Âú∞ÂÆòÂ∞öÊõ∏).

That year 243 students attended the school. There were 19 teachers on staff and the school had a student-teacher ratio of between 12 and 12.9 students per teacher. History The school was named for General William Tecumseh Sherman, and shared its name with nearby Sherman Avenue, which today is called North 16th Street. In 1948 the nearby Beechwood School District was incorporated into Sherman School. Students from Pershing School, which was once located near Eppley Airfield, were sent to Sherman in 1976. At its peak in 1965 the school served 560 students in grades kindergarten through eight. In 1976 seventh and eighth grade students were transferred to McMillan Junior High School, and the school was paired with Miller Park Elementary School. In 1995 Sherman became one of the first Title I recipients in the Omaha Public Schools system. Students from the community surrounding Sherman attended Sherman for kindergarten and first grades, went to Miller Park for grades two through four, and then returned to Sherman for grades five and six. They were bussed to McMillan for junior high, and then went to North High School. In 2002 the school was the site of protests by Omaha's Lao-Hmong immigrant community after the Omaha Police Department and Omaha Public Schools was accused of floundering during a physical abuse investigation.

He last served as head coach of Adler Mannheim in the Deutsche Eishockey Liga (DEL) in Germany. As a player, Simpson played two AHL seasons before embarking upon a career playing in Europe. Playing career Simpson played major junior briefly for the Kingston Canadians and then for four seasons with the Ottawa 67's. Drafted by the Chicago Blackhawks in the 7th round in the 1980 NHL Entry Draft, he played a season with the New Brunswick Hawks. He then played the following season for the Springfield Indians, also of the AHL. Simpson joined Tilburg Trappers in 1983, for whom he played four seasons. In 1988, he joined Rotterdam Panda's (sic). He was the Eredivisie's top scorer in both 1983‚Äì84 and 1988‚Äì89. In 1989, he joined Nationalliga A club EHC Olten. He played the following season in Serie A with HC Fiemme Cavalese. Coaching career Simpson began his coaching career in 1992 as an assistant coach to Bj√∂rn Kindling and later Jim Koleff at EV Zug in the Swiss elite league National League A. Prior to the 1997-98 season, Simpson was promoted to the head coaching position and guided Zug to the NLA championship in his first year at the helm. Zug had also finished the regular season on top of the NLA table. Simpson served another year as Zug head coach and then joined the M√ºnchen Barons of the German top-flight Deutsche Eishockey Liga (DEL) for the 1999-2000 season and won the DEL title his first year. The following season, he coached the Barons to another finals appearance, where they lost 3 games to 1 to Mannheim. In 2001-02, Simpson led the Barons to the semifinals, where they lost to K√∂lner Haie. The franchise was relocated to Hamburg in 2002 and renamed the Hamburg Freezers. Simpson coached the Hamburg team in its inaugural season (2002‚Äì03) and led the Freezers to a playoff berth. He left Hamburg after the season to return to EV Zug. In 2003-04, he guided EVZ to the NLA playoffs, where they fell short in the quarterfinals (4-1 against Bern), despite having former NHL star Claude Lemieux on the team, who had signed with Zug in February 2004 for the remainder of the season. In 2004-05, Simpson guided Zug to the NLA semifinals but did not manage to get past the ZSC Lions. The following season, Simpson's team was held off by Rapperswil-Jona in the quarterfinals and reached the semis one year later. In his final year at the Zug helm (2007‚Äì08), Simpson coached EVZ to another playoff appearance but did not get past the quarterfinals. Simpson inked a deal with reigning Swiss champs ZSC Lions in 2008. In his two years at ZSC, Simpson guided the Lions to the Champions Hockey League title and the Victoria Cup title in 2009. In the NLA, the Lions dropped out in the playoff quarterfinals both years. During his tenures at EV Zug and ZSC, Simpson was named to the coaching staff of Team Canada for the Spengler-Cup five times (three times as assistant coach, twice as head coach) and guided the team to the title in 2007. Simpson was named head coach of the Swiss national team prior to the 2010 World Championships and remained in that job until 2014. At the 2010 World Championships, Simpson's team defeated Canada in the preliminary round and made it to the quarterfinals, before falling short to host Germany. In 2011 and 2012, the Swiss team failed to qualify for the quarterfinals at the World Championships. In 2013, Simpson led the Swiss national team to its greatest ever success, a silver medal at the World Championships in Sweden. At the 2014 Olympic Games, Simpson's squad missed the quarterfinals and finished in ninth place. In April 2014, he became the head coach of KHL team Lokomotiv Yaroslavl, but was sacked after nine games. In December 2014 he became the head coach of the Kloten Flyers in the Swiss National League A. In May 2016, after the club had been sold to Hans-Ueli Lehmann and after budget cuts had been announced, Simpson's contract with Kloten was terminated by mutual consent. He was named head coach of Adler Mannheim of the Deutsche Eishockey Liga (DEL) on May 11, 2016. In the 2016-17 season, he led the team to a second-place finish in the regular season, before falling short to Eisb√§ren Berlin in the playoff quarterfinals. After the final loss, Simpson grabbed the headlines by threatening a TV reporter. He later apologized for the incident. On December 4, 2017, Simpson was relieved of his duties as Mannheim head coach due to the team's poor results. The Adler team was in seventh place, when Simpson was sacked.

She is the younger sister of Jacques Foccart, who joined the Legion as the second Invisible Kid. Fictional character biography Danielle is a native of Earth, from what was once the francophone African nation of C√¥te d'Ivoire. As a preteen, Danielle was afflicted with a life-threatening neurological disorder which had baffled the best medical experts of the 30th century. As a last resort, her older brother Jacques brought her to Brainiac 5 of the Legion of Super-Heroes for treatment. Brainiac 5 rashly decided to utilize a piece of circuitry from the dismantled machine Computo, a highly advanced supercomputer he had created years earlier which rebelled against its creator and murdered one of Triplicate Girl's bodies.Adventure Comics #340-341 (January‚ÄìFebruary 1966) Still surviving as an artificial intelligence, Computo promptly possessed Danielle's body, and took control of Legion headquarters and the city of Metropolis, nearly killing several Legionnaires. In order to save Danielle and the others, Jacques drank Lyle Norg's invisibility serum and gained the original Invisible Kid's powers. Although the A.I.'s control of Legion HQ was broken, it maintained possession of Danielle's body.Legion of Super-Heroes (vol. 2) Annual #1 (1982) Brainiac 5 devoted most of his free time for at least a year to curing Danielle's disorder and exorcizing Computo. Eventually, he succeeded at both tasks.Legion of Super-Heroes (vol. 2) #311 (May 1984) A healthy and apparently normal Danielle returned to the Foccart home in C√¥te d'Ivoire. =\\"Five Years Later\\"= During the \\"Five Year Gap\\" following the Magic Wars, the Legion disbanded and Earth's government fell under the covert control of the Dominators, who had attempted to conquer the planet in the 20th century. Earth withdrew from the United Planets, and the government gradually became more repressive. At some point, Danielle was kidnapped by the Dominators, along with other humanoids possessing superpowers. Eventually she was freed and reunited with Jacques, who had become the leader of a resistance cell which included himself, Tyroc, and the former members of the Legion of Substitute Heroes. Soon thereafter, Danielle (now a teenager) became associated with the members of the Dominators' highly classified \\"Batch SW6\\". This was a group of teenage Legionnaire clones, created from samples apparently taken just prior to Ferro Lad's death at the hands of the Sun-Eater. By that time, Danielle had acquired the ability to communicate with and control computers by psionically interfacing with them. It is unclear if this ability developed as a result of her possession by the Computo A.I., experimentation by the Dominators, or the metagene possessed by many natives of Earth. In a demonstration of deliberate irony, Danielle appropriated the code name Computo for herself. Although the Dominators were eventually defeated, Earth was destroyed just days later in a disaster reminiscent of the destruction of Krypton over a millennium earlier.Legion of Super-Heroes (vol. 4) #38 (Late December 1992) A few dozen cities and their inhabitants survived, and the planet was reconstituted as New Earth. The SW6 Legionnaires remained on New Earth, and Danielle joined their ranks. She soon became deputy leader, under Cosmic Boy.Legionnaires #1 (April 1993). Post-Zero Hour After Legion continuity was completely rebooted by the events of Zero Hour, Jacques was recast as a close childhood friend of Lyle Norg, who spent much of his time with the Foccart family. A young girl who is presumably Danielle appears in one panel in Legionnaires #66 (December 1998). She does not exhibit any superpowers. Danielle made no further appearances in the Post-Zero Hour or \\"Threeboot\\" eras of Legion continuity. Post-Infinite Crisis The events of the Infinite Crisis miniseries have restored a close analogue of the Pre-Crisis Legion to continuity, as seen in \\"The Lightning Saga\\" story arc in Justice League of America and Justice Society of America, and in the \\"Superman and the Legion of Super-Heroes\\" story arc in Action Comics. While an adult Jacques has been depicted, Danielle has yet to be seen. However, the original Danielle (in her guise as Computo) was seen briefly when multiple versions of the Legion battled Superboy-Prime, the Time Trapper and the Legion of Super-Villains.Final Crisis: Legion of 3 Worlds #5 (September 2009) References Category:DC Comics superheroes Category:Fictional technopaths Category:Characters created by Keith Giffen Category:Comics characters introduced in 1982 ","title":"Computo (Danielle Foccart)"},{"id":"14916776","text":"The Pennyhooks Project is a farm-based program for children with autism spectrum disorders in Shrivenham, United Kingdom.

Tonopah crashes included those due to P-39 engine limitations at the airfield's altitude and temperatures. In June 1943, a B-24 group transferred to Tonopah from Mountain Home Army Airfield. In September 1943 the base was shut down to expand for Consolidated B-24 Liberator training. By October 1943, about half of the personnel were moved temporarily to Bishop Army Air Field, California, in order to provide housing at Tonopah for construction contractors on a $3,000,000 project. Most construction was complete by the beginning of November 1943, and training facilities included a rifle range, pistol range, skeet ranges, turret trainers, bomb trainers equipped with Norden or Sperry sights, flexible gunnery trainers, navigation trainers, and schools for gunners and radio operators. Personnel at Bishop returned on November 1, 1943, and the 458th Bombardment Group arrived for training.

Murray was subsequently removed from command for his indecisive and contradictory leadership. Background Murray's Anglo-Sicilian-Spanish army, based on Alicante, inflicted a sharp check on Marshal Louis Gabriel Suchet's corps at the Battle of Castalla in April. After this action, General Arthur Wellesley, Marquess of Wellington ordered Murray to attack Tarragona, which is on the east coast of Spain. The port is about 65 miles southwest of Barcelona. Wellington planned to launch his summer 1813 offensive against King Joseph Bonaparte's French armies. By attacking Tarragona, Wellington wished to prevent Suchet from reinforcing Joseph. On June 2, Rear-Admiral Benjamin Hallowell Carew's squadron put Murray's 16,000 men ashore at Salou Bay, six miles south of Tarragona. They soon met General Francisco Copons' division of 7,000 Spanish soldiers. On June 3 the Allied army laid siege to the town. Forces Murray organized his army into one Spanish and two British infantry divisions, some cavalry, 2 British and 1 Portuguese field artillery batteries, plus some unassigned units. General William Clinton's 1st Division was made up of the 1/58th Regiment of Foot and 2/67th Regiment of Foot, the 4th King's German Legion and 2 battalions of the Sicilian Estero Regiment. General John Mackenzie's 2nd Division was made up of the 1/10th Regiment of Foot, 1/27th Regiment of Foot and 1/81st Regiment of Foot, De Roll's Swiss and the 2nd Italian Regiment. The cavalry force included two squadrons each of the 20th Light Dragoons and the Brunswick Hussars. The Calabrian Free Corps and the 1st Italian Regiment were unbrigaded.Smith 1998, p 425 Murray's 18 heavy siege guns were the same ones that Wellington used to breach the walls during the Siege of Ciudad Rodrigo and at the Battle of Badajoz in 1812.Glover 2001, p 274 Rufane Shaw Donkin served as Murray's chief-of-staff. Bertoletti's garrison included a battalion each from the French 20th Line Infantry and the 7th Italian Infantry regiments, two companies of artillerymen and some French sailors. The defenses had not been restored since Suchet had captured the town in the first Siege of Tarragona in 1811. In any case, the 1,600 men were too few to man the outer walls, so Bertoletti abandoned the walls and pulled his men back into the old town. He left small garrisons in two outworks, the Bastion of San Carlos and Fort Royal.Glover 2001, p 271 Siege Copons and his division were sent to the north to block the road from Barcelona. A British force occupied a fort to the south at Balaguer. Instead of immediately storming the two weak outworks, Murray insisted on establishing breaching batteries. By June 7, Fort Royal lay helpless under the bombardment. Yet, Murray decided to wait until June 11 before mounting an assault on the outwork. When he heard Tarragona was attacked, Suchet and 8,000 men began to march north from Valencia. From Barcelona, General of Division Charles Decaen sent General of Division Maurice Mathieu and 6,000 men southward. Suchet planned for the two columns to rendezvous at Reus, 10 miles inland from Tarragona. Murray became increasingly anxious about the twin French threats. On June 9 he issued secret orders to withdraw from the siege. On June 11, he rode to Copons and found that Mathieu was approaching. Promising to reinforce Copons with British troops, he hastened back to his siege lines. Hearing fresh rumors that both Suchet and Mathieu were bearing down on him, Murray panicked. He abandoned the planned assault and ordered the stores to be sent back aboard ship. Late that night, Murray ordered that the heavy guns to be withdrawn at once. His chief gunner told him it was impossible to bring off the guns in less than 30 hours. It was all unnecessary. Suchet heard of a Spanish threat to Valencia and retreated. Mathieu brushed with Copons' outposts, found he was facing a combined army of 23,000 men and fell back northward. Meanwhile, Murray issued a flurry of often contradictory orders. These only added to the confusion and infuriated Hallowell. By the night of June 12, the entire force was taken on board the ships, leaving the 18 siege guns spiked and many stores left behind. Copons was advised to flee into the mountains. An amazed Bertoletti sent a messenger to Mathieu that the coast was clear. Soon, Murray decided to land his army at Balaguer, which was accomplished on June 15. He convinced Copons to support the second landing, which the Spanish general loyally did.

When Murray heard that French soldiers were at hand he immediately ordered that his army be re- embarked, to Hallowell's disgust. Copons was left in the lurch once more. On June 18, the Mediterranean Fleet hove over the horizon. Lord William Bentinck relieved Murray of command and the thwarted expedition sailed back to Alicante. Results Aside from the 18 lost siege guns, the Anglo-Allies lost 15 killed, 82 wounded and five missing. French losses were 13 killed and 85 wounded. The Tarragona fiasco did not affect Wellington's 1813 campaign, which ended in a decisive Anglo-Allied victory over King Joseph at the Battle of Vitoria on June 21. In 1814, Murray was court-martialled for his conduct before Tarragona. He was acquitted of all charges except that of abandoning his guns without just cause, for which he was admonished by the court.Glover 2001, p 275 References * Chandler, David.

Musical background After starting college as a science and engineering major, Haskell Small began his musical education at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music and earned a BFA in music from Carnegie-Mellon University in 1972, where he studied piano under Harry Frankin and composition under Roland Leich. Subsequently, he studied composition privately under Vincent Persichetti, and studied piano privately under Theodore Lettvin, Leon Fleisher and William Masselos. Masselos continued as Small's teacher until his death in 1992. In addition to his mastery of the standard classical repertoire, including works by Beethoven, Scarlatti and Schubert, Small played in rock and roll bands during his college years, and he integrates blues, jazz and other modern and postmodern idioms into his compositions. Pianist Small has given concerts in major European capitals, South America, Japan and China, and was hailed for his \\"dazzlingly prodigious technique\\" by England's venerable Musical Times in 1976. In the United States he has performed in such venues as Carnegie Hall, the Kennedy Center and the Spoleto Festival. He was featured in the PBS special ‚ÄúA Celebration of the Piano\\" and on NPR's \\"All Things Considered\\" in 1988. In 21st-century seasons, he has played recitals in Japan, Paris and London and participated in the 2007 Festival of American Music in Poland. Small has recorded an extensive discography, including a George Gershwin disc, a Children‚Äôs CD with narrator Robert Aubry Davis,OCLC 43475038 and Bach‚Äôs Goldberg Variations, in addition to many of his own compositions. He is a champion of 20th century Catalan composer Frederic Mompou and in 2008 released a recording of Mompou's iconoclastic, more than hour-long M√∫sica Callada (\\"Quiet Music\\"). Haskell Small is a Steinway Artist. Composer Small follows in the tradition of 18th- and 19th-century pianist/composers. In addition to music for the piano, he has written works for woodwinds and other instruments, ensembles and the symphony orchestra, as well as choral pieces and music with narration. He has received commissions from such organizations as the Washington Ballet, Three Rivers Piano Competition, Georgetown Symphony and Paul Hill Chorale, and he was the winner of the 1999 Marin Ballet Dance Score Competition. From 2000 to 2003, he was composer-in-residence with the Mount Vernon Orchestra. In 2005 Small completed \\"Renoir's Feast,\\" a piano piece commissioned by the Phillips Collection to celebrate the return of Renoir's painting Le D√©jeuner des Canotiers (Luncheon of the Boating Party) to the Washington gallery. Small approached the endeavor in a manner reminiscent of Moussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition. He studied biographical information on each of Renoir's friends and acquaintances who were pictured in the boating party in order to create a portfolio of musical portraits, then established continuity among them with a recurring theme representing the flowing of the river. In 2006 Small composed a suite of miniature blues and jazz pieces, \\"Scraps,\\" for Dutch pianist Marcel Worms's multi-national Blues Project. In 2007 he was commissioned by pianist Soheil Nasseri to write \\"Lullaby of War,\\" an emotionally charged series of piano accompaniments and interludes for the recitation of several poems about war from various eras. Although the piece expresses a powerful anti-war sentiment, a preview performance featured readings by a U.S. Air Force general and his wife. Nasseri performed the world premiere of the composition in Carnegie Hall's Weill Recital Hall, and was soon invited to perform it in Berlin, with Small narrating. Renoir's Feast and Small's own orchestral transcription of Scraps have been published by PeerMusic. Teacher Small is a member of the piano faculty and former Piano Department Chair at the Washington Conservatory of Music, where he has taught since 1984. Reviews According to \\"A Golden 'Silence' From Haskell Small\\" by Stephen Brookes of the Washington Post, \\". . . . [A]s pianist Haskell Small showed in an unusual recital Sunday at the Phillips Collection, Mompou's music is worth attention. ... Much of the credit goes to Small, who may be better known to Phillips audiences for fine performances of his own works.\\" Small has also been praised by other Washington Post reviewers, including Mark Carrington, Sunil Freeman, Joseph McLellan, Tim Page, Cecilia Porter, Joan Reinthaler and Bob Waters, and New York Times writers Bernard Holland, Anna Kisselgoff and Edward Rothstein. Of the premiere of Small's Symphony for Solo Piano (1999), Washington Post reviewer Tim Page wrote, \\"If a first-time listener was occasionally reminded of other composers (particularly Prokofiev and Messiaen) along the way, the overall impression left by the \\"Symphony\\" was decidedly‚Äîtriumphantly‚ÄîSmall's alone.\\" He has also received favorable reviews from Die Welt, Der Tagesspiegel, the Washington Times, Music & Vision, Piano and Keyboard Magazine, Fanfare Magazine, 20th Century Music Magazine, Ovation Magazine, the American Record Guide, Records International, The Sioux City Journal, the Montgomery County Gazette and independent reviewer Donald Satz. Go Small is a 4-dan Go player (amateur rating scale) and is the leader of the Greater Washington Go Club. Under the auspices of the American Go Association, he organized the first U.S. Go Congress in 1985, an event that continues to be held annually. One of his musical compositions is titled A Game of Go (1987) and is included on the eponymously titled CD released by piano duo Quattro Mani on Klavier Records (2000).

Early life Simonton was a two-sport (football and baseball) star for the Pittsburg High School Pirates. As a sophomore, Simonton rushed for 1,135 yards in 10 games on 105 carries for an average of 10.8 yards per carry. In his junior year, he rushed for 785 yards in eight games on 47 carries for an average of 16.7 yards per carry. For his senior season, Simonton rushed for 960 yards on 92 carries for a 10.4 yard average and scored 23 touchdowns. Simonton was a three-time all-league selection as a running back and he was also named all-league as a defensive back in his senior year. He was a first-team All-Northern California selection, a first-team all-region selection by the Contra Costa Times and was named Offensive Player of the Year in the region by Sports Focus. Simonton played outfield for the Pirates baseball team and was all-league as a sophomore, junior and senior. He was listed in Parade Magazine in 1996 as one of the top 100 college baseball prospects in the nation. College career Simonton always wanted to attend USC and was recruited to come to the Trojans by assistant coach Mike Riley. That same Mike Riley was hired as the head coach of the Oregon State Beavers football program in 1997. Simonton chose to follow Riley to Oregon State instead of going to USC. In his freshman season (1998), Simonton had 1,028 rushing yards, only the second time a freshman running back had rushed for over a 1,000 yards in the Pac-10. He became the first freshman to ever rush for over 100 yards in his first game for Oregon State and then the first freshman to have back-to-back 100-yard rushing games. Simonton finished fourth in the Pac-10 in rushing with an average of 93.5 yards per game and was fourth in scoring with 78 points and 7.1 average points per game. In the final game of the season, Simonton scored the winning touchdown in overtime as Oregon State upset archrival Oregon 44-41. The Beavers named him a co-winner of their Rookie of the Year award. Simonton's sophomore season built upon the success of his freshman year. He set an OSU single-season scoring record with 118 points, single-season rushing record with 1,486 yards, and all-purpose running mark with 1,705 yards. For his success, he was named second team All-Pac-10, first team All-Pac-10 by the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, first team All-Pac-10 by the Football News, honorable mention All-American by the Football News, and he was selected OSU‚Äôs MVP of the Oahu Bowl vs. Hawaii. He established a Beaver record by rushing for over 100 yards in five straight games. Firmly entrenched as one of the premier tailbacks in the Pac-10, Simonton rushed for 1,559 yards in his junior season, again a school record at the time. His efforts earned him a spot on the first team All-Pac-10 Conference and first team All-American rosters as well as being named the College Football News Pac-10 Conference Player of the Year and finishing ninth on the Heisman Trophy Ballot. Simonton was chosen to serve as one of OSU's captains during the 2000 season, which concluded with a 41-9 victory over Notre Dame in the 2001 Fiesta Bowl, an 11-1 record, a 4th-place ranking in the country. After a 1st place pre-season ranking by Sports Illustrated and cover photo on the magazine, Simonton's senior season did not quite go as expected. There was a strong belief through Beaver Nation and in the Pac-10 that Simonton had a legitimate shot at the Heisman Trophy. With a 1,000 yard season, he would become only the fifth player in the NCAA (1st in the Pac-10) to have a 1,000 yards rushing in each of their four seasons. Simonton totaled 971 rushing yards on 239 carries with 8 touchdowns in his senior year, coming within 29 yards of his 4th consecutive 1,000 yard season. He left Oregon State with 5,044 rushing yards, which is still the school rushing record. Simonton majored in liberal studies at Oregon State. Professional career Simonton was undrafted in the 2002 NFL Draft, mainly due to questions of his size and durability and how that would translate into an NFL running back. He signed a free agent contract with the San Francisco 49ers on April 26, 2002 but was released shortly thereafter. Simonton next signed with the Buffalo Bills January 23, 2003. The Bills allocated him to the Scottish Claymores of NFL Europe on March 1, 2003. As a player for the Scottish Claymores, Simonton set a team record for rushing touchdowns in a season with 8. He was selected as the NFL Europe Offensive MVP after having a league-high 841 rushing yards as well as 39 receptions, which was 4th in league. Feeling good from his success in NFL Europe and hoping for an increased role in the NFL, Simonton returned to Buffalo September 2, 2003. He hung on with the team for the season, getting minimal playing time. He was released September 9, 2004 Simonton was again signed by the San Francisco 49ers in November 2004 by former college coach Dennis Erickson. After signing with the Detroit Lions in early 2005, he chose to retire from the NFL on April 5, 2005. Simonton signed with the Calgary Stampeders on May 5, 2007. He played in only one game, and was released on July 14, 2008. Personal life Simonton's family has a history of baseball. His father, Ken Simonton II played in the Boston Red Sox farm system in 1975. His brother Benji Simonton spent eight seasons in the San Francisco Giants and Anaheim Angels organizations and his cousin Cy Simonton played three seasons in the Seattle Mariners organization. Simonton originally intended to play both baseball and football at Oregon State.

It was named a National Historic Landmark in 1978. It is significant for its role in the history of gold mining in Alaska, in particular the Nome Gold Rush that began in 1899. with Four sites are included within the NHL District: *Anvil Creek Gold Discovery Site, which is separately listed on the National Register with *Snow Creek Placer Claim No. 1, which is separately listed on the National Register with *Erik Lindblom Placer Claim, which is separately listed on the National Register with *Nome Beach, a area The three Swedes reported they discovered the Erik Lindblom Placer Claim on Mountain Creek on September 19, 1898, the Snow Creek Claim on September 20, and the Anvil Creek Discovery Claim on September 22. Gold mining in the Nome mining district continues to this day. Anvil Creek Gold Discovery Site The site by Anvil Creek about north of what became the city of Nome, in a valley to the west of low, treeless Anvil Peak. It was one of the richest placer claim sites ever found in Alaska and yielded more than $5 million during its first five years. By 1965 the site was \\"largely returned to nature\\". Erik Lindblom Placer Claim The Erik Lindblom Placer Claim is on Mountain Creek, which is an often dry tributary that joins the Snake River about inland from the Snake River's outlet, at Nome, into Norton Sound on the Bering Sea. The claim is on the \\"Third Beach\\", about above sea level, which is the furthest inland former seafront in the Nome area. Geologically, a high concentration of gold was produced by ocean waves, similar to the later production of gold concentration on Nome's beach. The site was the first of three gold discovery sites by the three miners. Oddly, ownership of the claim site could not be determined at the time of its NRHP nomination in 1975; the last known owner was \\"Pioneer Mining Company\\", more than 50 years before then. In 1975, the area was back to a \\"natural state\\", although debris in the form of mining equipment and domestic implements remained. Nothing on the land then distinguished the Erik Lindblom Placer Claim from the surrounding area. Snow Creek Placer Claim No. 1 The Snow Creek Placer Claim No. 1 is a -wide strip running along Snow Creek, up from its confluence with Glacier Creek, which joins the Snake River about further down. Snow Creek is often dry. Placer mining on Snow Creek was nearly exhausted by 1903. Nome Beach In 1899, about 1,000 miners in Nome were idle due to the fact that the entire Anvil Creek had been claimed, (and presumably so had all other known placer mining sites in the area). It was fortuitously discovered that the beach at Nome was itself gold-laden, and rockers could garner $20 to $100 each day.

It is not known when Cui was born, but it is known that his family was from Bei Prefecture (Ë≤ùÂ∑û, part of modern Xingtai, Hebei). His father Cui Yixuan (Â¥îÁæ©ÁéÑ) had served as a general and official under Tang's first three emperors -- Emperor Gaozu, Emperor Taizong, and Emperor Gaozong (Wu Zetian's husband) and had been created by Emperor Gaozu as the Duke of Qingqiu. When Wu Zetian was a favorite concubine of Emperor Gaozong, Cui was part of a court faction that supported her in her effort to displace Emperor Gaozong's first wife Empress Wang and later, after she did become empress, assisted in her effort to take vengeance on officials who opposed her ascension, including Emperor Gaozong's uncle Zhangsun Wuji. After Wu Zetian became \\"emperor\\" in 690, she remembered his contributions to her and further posthumously honored him. After Cui Yixuan's death, Cui Shenji inherited his title.

Queen of Nations site lies approximately 70 metres off Corrimal Beach opposite the outlet of Towradgi Creek, 4 kilometres north of Wollongong. The cargo on this final, fatal journey consisted almost entirely of wine and distilled spirits, a fact which combined with the enthusiasms of the newly installed captain and mate for those self-same beverages, led to the captain to become confused by a fire in the hills and order a turn to port facilitating his entry into Sydney Harbour. There was no harbour, only sand and rocks, and the Queen ran aground. Her crew made their way to shore with the loss of only one sailor, despite threats from the drunken mate, armed with a pistol. The Queen broke up and her cargo drifted ashore over the next several months, inspiring the establishment of a long-lived and very cheery beachside campground. The wreck of the Queen is being studied by Florida State University. Approximate Position . In her more respectable days, in 1879, the Queen Of Nations received international attention for having gallantly rescued Captain Lewis Gerhardt Goldsmith and his ailing wife from their tiny lifeboat, in its last moments, after a storm on the Grand Banks, and carrying them safely to England.

The current church was built in 1894, probably on the site of an 1826 church, and likely using timbers and other elements (including one iconostasis) from the older church. It is one of the oldest churches in Alaska, and is significant as the site from which missionaries brought their religion to the local Aleut people. This evangelization effort was so successful that today's Aleut population is still strongly Orthodox. The church was declared a National Historic Landmark for its architecture, and for its role in the history and culture of Alaska. and It is the second cathedral church of the Orthodox Church in America Diocese of Alaska, after St. Michael's Cathedral in Sitka (which is also a National Historic Landmark). Description The Church of the Holy Ascension is located in Unalaska, a community of about 4,000 on the north side of Unalaska Island, the largest of the western Aleutian Islands. It stands roughly midway on a peninsula dividing the Ililiuk River and Ililiuk Bay, west of the main part of the community. The church stands on a property known as the \\"Russian Greek Mission Reserves\\", a area on which the bishop's residence also stands. The church is a wood-frame structure, cruciform in shape, with a belltower at its western end. The tower is tall, starting as a square structure, which rises to a cornice with shallow center gables on each cornice, and an octagonal cupola topped by a green onion dome, which is capped by an Orthodox cross. The tower is connected to the nave of the church by a gable-roofed narthex. The nave is rectangular, with a hip roof capped by a cupola similar to, but smaller than, that on the tower. Hip-roofed wings containing chapels extend north and south from the near the eastern end of the nave. The apse is at the far eastern end of the structure, with a hip roof that rises only to the level of the cornice of the nave. All of the roofs are covered in wooden shingles painted red; the domes are covered in tarpaper which is painted green. The interior of the church has a fairly uncomplicated layout. The first floor of the tower acts as a vestibule, while the narthex area provides spaces for storage and stairs leading to the choir loft and the belfry, the latter occupying the tower's second level. The floors of the church are wooden, and painted red throughout. A red carpet leads through the nave to the eastern end of the building, where the main iconostasis and altar are located. The chapel to the north is dedicated to Saint Innocent of Irkutsk; that to the south is dedicated to Saint Sergius of Radonezh. The structure has undergone only modest alterations since its construction in 1894-96, and underwent a major restoration in 1998. =Bishop's house= The bishop's house stands several hundred feet from the church. It is a modest two-story wood-frame structure, by , clad in shiplap siding. Single-story wings extend to the east and west of the main block. The cornices of the second story roofline have elaborately carved friezes and carved wooden corbel blocks. History The Aleutian Islands were discovered by Russian fur hunters in the mid-18th century, and a Russian establishment existed at Unalaska as early as 1778, when British Captain James Cook explored the area. The first known religious building, a small chapel, was built in Unalaska in 1808, but there was no regular priest. The first significant effort by the Russian Orthodox establishment to evangelize the local Aleut population began in 1795, when a monk named Macarius arrived at Unalaska and baptized most of the native population. In 1824 Reverend Ivan Veniaminov arrived in Unalaska as its first permanent priest, and led the construction of a church not far from the site of the 1808 chapel. Veniamov, later canonized as Innocent of Alaska, was an energetic force in the growth of the church in western Alaska. He developed an alphabet for the Aleut language, and established a school to teach the natives to read and write. Veniaminov spent ten years in Unalaska before being assigned to Sitka, where he engaged in similar activities with respect to the Tlingit people. He was, during his long career in Alaska, a significant ethnographic resource, noted even by modern historians for the quality of his observations. By 1858 the church Veniaminov built was failing due to the harsh climate, and a new church was built, using timbers from the older one. In the 1880s, after a period of decline in the church, Bishop Nestor commissioned the construction of the bishop's house after a visit to Unalaska in which his accommodations were in the living quarters of the local cannery workers. As part of this work a school building was also erected, to which the bishop's house was originally attached; this survived until it was destroyed by fire in 1960, singing the walls of the house in the process. The present church was built in 1894-96, after the arrival of Reverend Alexander Kedrovsky. By this time Unalaska had achieved its place as the major port in the western Aleutians, and had grown into a small town. The district Kedrovsky oversaw extended to include the Fox and Pribilof island groups, and to communities on the Alaskan peninsula. It is believed that the north chapel of the present church is on the location of the original 1826 church, and that timbers were used from the old structure in construction of the new one. There is also evidence suggesting that the iconostasis in that chapel is Aleut craftsmanship dating to 1824. During World War II, the native population of the area was evacuated to southeastern Alaska. The valuables of the church were preserved, despite the use of the church facilities by the nearly 60,000 troops stationed at Dutch Harbor. Although the population returned, the effects of the relocation were profound, and the church has declined in the region since the war. Icons from smaller community churches are now displayed in the chapel of St. Sergius.

He moved to the private sector following almost two decades in public service for the city of Chicago. He is the former chief executive officer and superintendent of Chicago Public Schools (2009‚Äì2010), the third-largest school system in the United States. In that role, he oversaw a system of 675 schools and more than 400,000 students with a budget of upwards $6 billion. Prior to heading to CPS, Huberman served as president of the Chicago Transit Authority. He also headed the city's Office of Emergency Management and Communications, bringing rapid change to that agency following the September 11 attacks on America.  Early life and education  Born in Tel Aviv, Israel, on November 26, 1971, Huberman is the son of Holocaust survivors. He and his family moved to Oak Ridge, Tenn., when his father, a cancer researcher, began working at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Huberman attended the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, graduating with a Bachelor's Degree in psychology and English in 1994. After graduation, he joined the Chicago Police Department where he initially served as a beat officer. While working full-time as a Chicago police officer, Huberman attended night classes at the University of Chicago and earned two advanced degrees in 2000, a Master of Social Work from the School of Social Service Administration and a Master of Business Administration from the university's Graduate School of Business (now the Booth School of Business). Huberman was a recipient of The Paul & Daisy Soros Fellowships for New Americans and an Albert Schweitzer Fellow while attending the University of Chicago.  Career in public service  = Chicago Police Department = Upon his graduation in 1994 from the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, Huberman entered the Chicago Police Academy and began his career in public service. He was initially assigned as a patrol officer in Chicago's Rogers Park neighborhood, and also served as a bicycle officer and as a tactical gang team officer. In partnership with the Illinois State Police, Huberman created and implemented the department's Citizen and Law Enforcement Analysis and Reporting (CLEAR) system, a unique and progressive technology-based criminal data and intelligence gathering system. In 1995, Huberman was promoted to Assistant Deputy Superintendent, becoming one of the youngest officers to reach exempt rank in the history of the Chicago Police Department. In this role, he led more than 600 sworn and civilian personnel who were charged with systematically improving the operations and strategic capacity of the department. As Assistant Deputy Superintendent, he commanded the following CPD divisions: Research and Development, Information Services, Records Services, and the Office of Information and Strategic Services. He also pioneered a pilot program for the installation and use of Police Observation Devices, also known as \\"blue-light cameras,\\"which gave the department a powerful new technological surveillance tool in its crime-fighting arsenal. = Office of Emergency Management and Communications = In 2004, Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley appointed Huberman as Executive Director of the city's Office of Emergency Management and Communications. Tasked with protecting the city from terrorist attacks, public health crises, natural disasters, and responding to the city's 21,000-plus daily 911 emergency calls, Huberman developed the Operations Center within OEMC to help city services conduct a coordinated response to disaster scenarios and established Chicago as a leader in emergency preparedness. While at OEMC, Huberman greatly expanded the blue- light camera system throughout the city, which he had launched as a ranking police officer, to further boost the crime-fighting capacity in some of the city's high-crime areas. He also initiated the city's Traffic Management Authority, replacing sworn officers with civilian employees to manage high- traffic areas, thereby freeing needed police resources for law enforcement duties. Huberman supplemented the Traffic Management Authority with additional programs aimed at relieving congestion on busy urban streets, such as a \\"quick-tow\\" system, street sensors, smart signal timing and message boards. While at OEMC, Huberman also implemented a Performance Management system as a method of improving the organizational efficiency and outcomes of the agency. He would also use Performance Management, coupled with relevant data, as a key tool in later career assignments in identifying key issues and bringing effectiveness and employee growth and development to government. = Mayor Richard M. Daley's Chief of Staff = In 2005, Mayor Daley brought Huberman to City Hall to serve as his Chief of Staff, delegating to him supervision of the city's day-to-day operations and instructing him \\"first and foremost ‚Ä¶ to help restore taxpayers' confidence in the integrity of city government\\" in the wake of wrongdoing in Chicago's Hired Truck Program. Huberman quickly instituted a hiring freeze while implementing new screening policies to prevent applicants from using political clout to get city jobs. He removed seemingly entrenched senior staff who failed to measure up to the standards required in securing and maintaining the public's trust. As Chief of Staff, he also oversaw settlement of the Shakman Decree, a decades-old federal court order, which governed political hiring for city jobs. Huberman implemented a Performance Management system for each of the city's 49 departments and agencies. Borrowing heavily from the private sector, Huberman's Performance Management system created a process for city management and service delivery. Similar to the New York City Police Department's COMPSTAT system, Huberman conducted weekly sessions that required each department to report on their key metrics. = Chicago Transit Authority = Following his role as Chief of Staff, Huberman was named by Mayor Daley to be President of the Chicago Transit Authority in 2007. His appointment to head the second largest public transit system in the U.S. was greeted as a \\"breath of fresh air\\" as Huberman pledged to press for better system-wide performance, employee accountability and an emphasis on customer service. Huberman addressed customer communication, oversaw investment in new rail-car and bus technology, and brought his Performance Management process to the agency. He mothballed a project that was running $100 million over budget, negotiated new labor contracts that saved the system more than $100 million and improved operations by significantly reducing \\"Slow Zones\\" on the system's rail lines, the \\"L\\", while increasing ridership. He also oversaw negotiations for long-term agreements with the CTA's 21 collective bargaining units which included pension and health care savings. Huberman, an avowed \\"L\\" rider during his tenure at the CTA, once removed an unruly and disorderly passenger from a train he was riding on after the rider verbally harassed a female passenger. = Chicago Public Schools = After President Barack Obama appointed then-CPS Chief Executive Officer Arne Duncan to be U.S. Secretary of Education, Mayor Daley selected Huberman to head CPS on January 28, 2009. Upon appointing Huberman, Mayor Daley stated, \\"I have utmost faith in him. I can go to sleep at night, and just close my eyes. I don't have to worry about Ron Huberman.\\" His appointment was applauded for bringing to CPS an \\"innovative, creative and a hard-nosed manager who uses data to hold people and institutions accountable.\\" In his first few months leading the nation's third-largest school district, Huberman announced a shake-up of top management and warned that the system would have to drastically trim Central Office staff to cope with a financial deficit as high as $600 million. His determination to cut fat from the district's budget to cope with the deficit drew praise for \\"taking on its flabby bureaucracy ‚Äì cutting the waste that anyone familiar with the school system can see.\\" Huberman also met regularly with educational experts early in his tenure and developed a set of strategic priorities ‚Äì among them teacher retention and recruitment, safety and security, strengthening middle management, and pushing available resources to the local school level. He spelled out these priorities in a speech to the City Club of Chicago, avenue at which civic leaders gather once a month to hear from top figures in government, politics or business. An advocate of year-round education, Huberman greatly expanded the number of schools that followed the district's \\"Track E\\" calendar which, among its benefits, helped curtail the traditional summer \\"learning loss\\" experienced by many students. During his tenure at CPS, he launched a pilot project to add 90 minutes of on-line learning at selected elementary schools. He also expanded virtual classrooms for students throughout the school system. Huberman announced his signature safety and security initiative, which became known as \\"Culture of Calm,\\" in early September 2009. It included establishing Safe Passage routes for students going to and from selected schools, mentoring for the most at-risk youth who were identified through a unique data-driven process, and boosting anti-violence supports at the local school level. The mentoring component and process for identifying the at-risk students were highlighted in Paul Tough's 2012 book, \\"How Children Succeed: Grit, Curiosity and the Hidden Power of Character.\\" Following the recorded beating and tragic death of CPS high school student Derrion Albert later that month, the multi- dimensional approach was given top priority and drew widespread attention and praise as a \\"powerful idea on youth violence.\\" Before the end of the 2009-10 school year, Huberman was able to announce promising trends from the program to the district's Board of Education. Student achievement progressed during Huberman's term as the CPS CEO. Elementary school students showed continued to show improvement in meeting or exceeding state standards on annual assessments. Additionally, the percentage of Chicago Public Schools graduates going on to college continued to increase and the composite score of CPS high school students meeting or exceeding state standards in 2010 rose 1.5 percentage points from the previous year, from 27.9 percent to 29.4 percent, that gain amounting to a more than 5 percent increase in the meets/exceeds composite. When reports surfaced that some CPS schools may have falsified or otherwise changed student test scores or their attendance rates, Huberman created safeguards within the district's overall record-keeping system to ensure the integrity of school-based data. Huberman also oversaw the end of a long-standing federal consent decree that governed student admissions to its elite selective enrollment schools. He implemented a system that utilized U.S. Census data to construct socio-economic tiers of communities. Instead of race- based admission goals, a designated number of students from those socio- economic tiers would be admitted to the district's top schools in roughly equal numbers. The complex system guaranteed that students from all of the city's communities would be fairly represented in those schools. Huberman also launched an investigation into how students were admitted into the district's highly competitive selective enrollment schools when reports surfaced that some students may have been admitted to those schools outside of the authorized process.  Resignation from Chicago Public Schools  Huberman announced that he would resign as the CPS Chief Executive Officer on October 6, 2010. He said his decision was driven by the earlier announcement by Mayor Daley that he would not seek re-election in 2011. Huberman stepped down from the CEO post prior to the end of 2010. He was succeeded as CEO on an interim basis by Terry Mazany, president of the Chicago Community Trust. = City Council recognition = On January 13, 2011, Chicago City Council members unanimously approved a resolution honoring Huberman for his service to the citizens of Chicago. The resolution called Huberman \\"a dynamic leader who demonstrated a widely admired commitment to improving the city's public school system ‚Ä¶\\" and described his successes at his other public service assignments: \\"A veteran public servant, Ron Huberman previously served from 2007 to 2009 as President of the Chicago Transit Authority where he instituted reforms at the agency and presided over a growth in ridership;\\" and \\"From 2005 to 2007, Huberman served as Chief of Staff for Mayor Richard M. Daley and was responsible for directing the operations of the City of Chicago's forty-nine departments and 39,000 employees;\\" and \\"From 2004 to 2005, Huberman served as Executive Director of the City of Chicago Office of Emergency Management and Communications and during his tenure expanded the number and types of technologies used to reduce crime and increase public safety;\\" and \\"Prior to his appointment as Executive Director at OEMC, Ron Huberman served for nine years at the Chicago Police Department, rising from a beat officer to Assistant Deputy Superintendent for Administration.\\" The resolution also states that \\"the hard work, sacrifice and dedication of Ron Huberman serve as an example to all.\\"  Move to private sector  In January 2011, Huberman joined Prairie Capital, a private equity firm with more than $2 billion under management. Huberman also founded and chairs Teacher Match, a first-of-its- kind company that delivers on-line predictive hiring tools for the elementary and secondary schools and which utilizes a broad range of data sources to build its product.

English caricature by Isaac Cruikshank. The Incroyables (, \\"incredibles\\") and their female counterparts, the Merveilleuses (, \\"marvelous women\\"), were members of a fashionable aristocratic subculture in Paris during the French Directory (1795‚Äì1799). Whether as catharsis or in a need to reconnect with other survivors of the Reign of Terror, they greeted the new regime with an outbreak of luxury, decadence, and even silliness. They held hundreds of balls and started fashion trends in clothing and mannerisms that today seem exaggerated, affected, or even effete (decadent, self-indulgent). They were also mockingly called \\"incoyable\\" or \\"meveilleuse\\", without the letter R, reflecting their posh accent in which that letter was lightly pronounced, almost inaudibly. When this period ended, society took a more sober and modest turn. Members of the ruling classes were also among the movement's leading figures, and the group heavily influenced the politics, clothing, and arts of the period. They emerged from the muscadins, a term for dandyish anti-Jacobin street gangs in Paris from 1793 who were important politically for some two years; the terms are often used interchangeably, though the muscadins were of a lower social background, being largely middle-class. Social background Th√©r√©sa Tallien, a leading Merveilleuse, in Neoclassical style Ornate carriages reappeared on the streets of Paris the day after the execution (28 July 1794) of Maximilien Robespierre, which brought an end to the Jacobin-era Committee of Public Safety and signaled the commencement of the Thermidorian Reaction. There were masters and servants once more in Paris, and the city erupted in a furor of pleasure-seeking and entertainment. Theaters thrived, and popular music satirized the excesses of the Revolution. One popular song of the period called on the French people to \\"share my horror\\" and to send \\"these drinkers of human blood\\" back amongst the monsters from which they had sprung. Its lyrics rejoiced that \\"your tormentors finally grow pale at the tardy dawn of vengeance\\". Le Reveil du peuple, \\"The Awakening of the People'\\", written by Jean-Marie Sourigui√®res de St Marc and set to music by Pierre Gaveaux Passez Payez Many public balls were bals des victimes at which young aristocrats who had lost loved ones to the guillotine danced in mourning dress or wore black armbands, greeting one another with violent movements of the head as if in decapitation. A ball held at the H√¥tel Thellusson on the rue de Provence in the 9th arrondissement of Paris restricted its guest list to the grown children of the guillotined.Alain Rustenholz, Les travers√©es de Paris, Parigramme, September 2006, Evreux, Clothing and fashion Cafe des Incroyables The Merveilleuses scandalized Paris with dresses and tunics modeled after the ancient Greeks and Romans, cut of light or even transparent linen and gauze. Sometimes so revealing they were termed \\"woven air\\", many gowns displayed cleavage and were too tight to allow pockets. To carry even a handkerchief, the ladies had to use small bags known as reticules. They were fond of wigs, often choosing blonde because the Paris Commune had banned blonde wigs, but they also wore them in black, blue, and green. Enormous hats, short curls like those on Roman busts, and Greek-style sandals were the rage. The sandals tied above the ankle with crossed ribbons or strings of pearls. Exotic and expensive scents fabricated by perfume houses like Parfums Lubin were worn both for style and as indicators of social station. Th√©r√©sa Tallien, known as \\"Our Lady of Thermidor\\", wore expensive rings on the toes of her bare feet and gold circlets on her legs. The Incroyables wore eccentric outfits: large earrings, green jackets, wide trousers, huge neckties, thick glasses, and hats topped by \\"dog ears\\", their hair falling on their ears. Their musk- based fragrances earned the derogatory nickname muscadins for them and their immediate predecessors, a more middle-class group of anti-Jacobins. They wore bicorne hats and carried distinctive knobbled bludgeons or canes, which they referred to as their \\"executive power.\\" Hair was often shoulder-length, sometimes pulled up in the back with a comb to imitate the hairstyles of the condemned. Some sported large monocles. They frequently affected a lisp, allegedly to avoid the letter R as in revolution - and sometimes a stooped hunchbacked posture or slouch, as caricatured in numerous cartoons of the time. In addition to Madame Tallien, famous Merveilleuses included Mademoiselle Lange, Juliette R√©camier, and two very popular Cr√©oles: Fortun√©e Hamelin and Hortense de Beauharnais. Hortense, a daughter of the Empress Josephine, married Louis Bonaparte and became the mother of Napoleon III. Fortun√©e was not born rich, but she became famous for her salons and her string of prominent lovers. Parisian society compared Germaine de Sta√´l and Mme Raguet to Minerva and Juno and named their garments for Roman deities: gowns were styled Flora or Diana, and tunics were styled √† la Ceres or Minerva.Alfred Richard Allinson, The Days of the Directoire, J. Lane, (1910), p. 190 The leading Incroyable, Paul Fran√ßois Jean Nicolas, vicomte de Barras, was one of five directors who ran the Republic of France and gave the period its name. He hosted luxurious feasts attended by royalists, repentant Jacobins, ladies, and courtesans. Since divorce was now legal, sexuality was looser than in the past. However, de Barras' reputation for immorality may have been a factor in his later overthrow, a coup that brought the French Consulate to power and paved the way for Napoleon Bonaparte. Representation in the arts The fictional nouveau riche social climber Madame Angot, awkwardly wearing ridiculous Greek clothing, parodied the Merveilleuses in many plays of the period. Carl Vernet's caricatures of the wardrobes of the Incroyables and Merveilleuses met with contemporary popular success. =Images of the period= File:charles-vernet-top-hat.jpgPainting Un Incroyable, by Carle Vernet, perhaps the first image of a top hat (1796) File:Directoire fashion caricature 1797.jpgFrench caricature of Merveilleuse transparent dresses File:Boilly incroyable parade.jpg Boilly Incroyable parade File:Barras1797.jpgJames Gillray's caricature of 1805.

Background  It is not known when Cui Yuanzong was born, but it is known that his family was from Zheng Prefecture (ÈÑ≠Â∑û, roughly modern Zhengzhou, Henan), and that his clan had produced many officials throughout Northern Wei, Northern Zhou, and Tang's predecessor Sui Dynasty. His grandfather Cui Junsu (Â¥îÂêõËÇÖ) as a mid-level official under Tang Dynasty's founder Emperor Gaozu.That Cui Yuanzong's grandfather was Cui Junsu was per his biographies in the Old Book of Tang and the New Book of Tang. See Old Book of Tang, vol. 90 and New Book of Tang, vol. 114. However, the table of chancellors' family trees in the New Book of Tang listed Cui Yuanzong's grandfather as Cui Junsu's brother Cui Junzhou (Â¥îÂêõÂÆô), and neither Cui Junzhou nor Cui Yuanzong's father Cui Qianli (Â¥îÂçÉÈáå) was listed with any offices or titles. See New Book of Tang, vol. 72, part 2.  During Wu Zetian's reign  As of Wu Zetian's Tianshou era (690-692), Cui Yuanzong was serving as the minister of justice (ÁßãÂÆòÂ∞öÊõ∏, Qiuguan Shangshu). In 692, Wu Zetian made him Luantai Shilang (È∏ûËá∫‰æçÈÉé), the deputy head of the examination bureau of government (È∏ûËá∫, Luantai), and gave him the designation Tong Fengge Luantai Pingzhangshi (ÂêåÈ≥≥Èñ£È∏ûËá∫Âπ≥Á´†‰∫ã), making him a chancellor de facto. It was said that Cui was diligent while serving in office, and whenever he was on duty, he would stay late and take few breaks. He was also said to be careful in his actions, and did not have any gourmet foods for over 20 years. However, he was also said to be, while appearing to be lenient on the outside, actually very harsh as a judge, and he picked faults with people and gave them heavy punishments, and therefore was feared. In 694, he was accused of crimes and exiled to Zhen Prefecture (ÊåØÂ∑û, roughly modern Sanya, Hainan), and it was said that there was much rejoicing among other officials of his exile. At a later point, after a general pardon, he was recalled and served as imperial censor (Áõ£ÂØüÂæ°Âè≤, Jiancha Yushi).  During Emperor Zhongzong's reign  Wu Zetian was overthrown in a coup in 705, and her son Li Xian, formerly emperor, was restored to the throne (as Emperor Zhongzong). During Emperor Zhongzong's reign, Cui successively served as Shangshu Zuo Cheng (Â∞öÊõ∏Â∑¶‰∏û) -- a secretary general of the executive bureau (Â∞öÊõ∏ÁúÅ, Shangshu Sheng), and as the prefect of Pu Prefecture (Ëí≤Â∑û, roughly modern Yuncheng, Shanxi), before retiring on account of age and illness. After retirement, he was said to be much involved in Taoist alchemist practices to try to prolong life. He lived to his 90s, but the date of his death is not known.

He received the United States military's highest decoration for bravery, the Medal of Honor, for his actions during the Indian Wars. He tried to convince Geronimo to surrender peacefully on behalf of the United States government and remained friends with Geronimo until his death. After the wars were over he returned home to his wives and became a rancher and was active in Indian affairs. Biography He was born May 17, 1853 in a part of the Arizona Territory known as Limestone Canyon. He joined the Indian Scouts at Camp Verde December 2, 1872 and served under General George Crook in actions against an uprising of the Chiricahua Apache in the winter of 1872-1873, holding the rank of Sergeant. He was cited for gallantry, and acted as an envoy from Crook to Geronimo, trying to convince him to surrender peacefully. Crook's aide (and fellow Medal of Honor recipient) John G. Bourke described Alchesay as \\"a perfect Adonis in figure, a mass of muscle and sinew of wonderful courage, great sagacity, and as faithful as an Irish hound.\\" He was an adviser to Indian agents and to President Grover Cleveland. He fought again under Crook in the campaign against the Chiricahua Apache in the Sierra Madre of Mexico in 1883 and his last military duty was as an advisor during the pursuit of Geronimo in Mexico in 1885. The Apache Wars officially ended with the surrender of Geronimo in 1886 and Alchesay returned to his family and his home. He became a successful cattleman and farmer, living for a while in Forestdale and later in North Fork. Plural marriage was an Apache custom, and was recognized by the U.S. government and he had two wives, Tah-jon-nay whom he married in 1871 and her sister, Anna in about 1881. However Chief Alchesay's first wife was a young girl named Apache who bore him a son. As the leader of the Tribe, Alchesay sought better conditions for his people, and In 1887 traveled to Washington D.C. to speak to President Grover Cleveland. He met with President Theodore Roosevelt in 1909, and with Warren G. Harding in 1921. The military left Fort Apache, and in 1923, the Theodore Roosevelt Indian Boarding School was built for Navajo children. Alchesay traveled to Navajo county to welcome Navajo children to the White Mountain Apache reservation. He was instrumental in getting federal compensation for the families that were removed because of the school. He and Geronimo remained close friends until Geronimo's death in 1909. He filed for an Indian Wars pension under the name William Alchesay and resigned from active chieftainship in 1925. Alchesay died August 6, 1928 at North Fork, Arizona and is buried on the Fort Apache Indian Reservation in Whiteriver, Arizona.

Ecology  This plant is native to western North America as far south as New Mexico where it grows in foothills up to alpine slopes. It thrives in the rocky soil of alpine climates where the snow never melts. It is a perennial herb growing from a tuber one to three centimeters wide. It produces a short, erect stem reaching a maximum height of 15 centimeters. At its smallest the plant bears only its first two rounded leaves before flowering and dying back. Its thick leaves are helpful for storing water. If it continues to grow it produces thick, lance-shaped leaves further up the stem. The star-shaped flowers come in inflorescences of three to 15 blooms and they are white or pink, often with veiny stripes and yellow blotches near the base of each petal. The fruit is a small capsule containing 2 seeds, which are black and shiny. The genus Claytonia was moved in 2009 from the purslane family (Portulacaceae) with adoption of the APG III system, which established the family Montiaceae.  Uses  The Okanogan-Colville, Okanogan, and Thompson Native American peoples used the tuber of this plant for food and for animal fodder. Native Americans ate the roots and pods, which can be cooked and eaten like potatoes. The leaves can be eaten raw or cooked.

In initial testing, the aircraft proved unpopular with test pilots, who raised concerns about the design's aerodynamic stability . The initial prototypes were also plagued with a variety of manufacturing defects and malfunctions. Though corrections were made to improve initial design and stability problems, the performance of the aircraft was considered no better than the existing Nakajima Type 91 fighter, and as the Japanese Army Air Force had no use for two-seat fighters, the project was cancelled in 1934, after five prototype aircraft had been produced, and before the start of full production.

It was created by Administrative Order 9 in December 1941, with Maj. Gen. John F. Curry as the first CAP national commander. The organization was originally formed to provide civilian air support to aid the war effort of World War II through border and coastal patrols, military training assistance, courier services and other activities. These efforts were recognized and, after the close of the war, Civil Air Patrol was transferred from the United States Army to the newly formed U.S. Air Force. Through the enactment of Public Law 79-476 by the U.S. Congress and signed by President Harry S. Truman, Civil Air Patrol was incorporated as a nonprofit organization of \\"volunteers and declared to be of a benevolent nature, never again to be involved in direct combat activities.\\" Since that time, Civil Air Patrol has carried out three congressionally mandated objectives: emergency services (including search and rescue operations), aerospace education for youth and the general public, and cadet programs for teenage youth. In addition, it has been tasked with assisting the United States Department of Homeland Security, and also performs non-auxiliary missions for various governmental and private agencies, such as local law enforcement and the American Red Cross.  Origin  The general idea of Civil Air Patrol (CAP) originated with a collective brainstorm of pilots and aviators before the start of World War II. In the later half of the 1930s, the Axis powers became a threat to the United States, its allies and its interests. As the Axis steadily took control of the greater part of Europe and South-East Asia, aviation-minded Americans noticed a trend: in all of the conquered countries and territories, civil aviation was more or less halted in order to reduce the risk of sabotage. Countries that were directly involved in the conflict strictly regulated general aviation, allowing military flights only. American aviators did not wish to see the same fate befall themselves, but realized that if nothing was done to convince the federal government that civil aviation could be of direct and measurable benefit to the imminent war effort, the government would likely severely limit general aviation. The concrete plan for a general aviation organization designed to aid the U.S. military at home was envisaged in 1938 by Gill Robb Wilson. Wilson, then aviation editor of The New York Herald Tribune, was on assignment in Germany prior to the outbreak of World War II. He took note of the actions and intentions of the Nazi government and its tactic of grounding all general aviation. Upon returning, he reported his findings to the New Jersey governor, advising that an organization be created that would use the civil air fleet of New Jersey as an augmentative force for the war effort that seemed impending. The plan was approved, and with the backing of Chief of the Army Air Corps General Henry H. \\"Hap\\" Arnold and the Civil Aeronautics Authority, the New Jersey Civil Air Defense Services (NJCADS) was formed. The plan called for the use of single-engine aircraft for liaison work, as well as coastal and infrastructure patrol. General security activities regarding aviation were also made the responsibility of the NJCADS. Other similar groups were organized, such as the AOPA Civil Air Guard and the Florida Defense Force. During this time, the Army Air Corps and the Civil Aeronautics Administration initiated two separate subprograms. The first was the introduction of a civilian pilot refresher course and the Civilian Pilot Training Program. The motive behind this step was to increase the pool of available airmen who could be placed into military service if such a time came. The second step was concentrated more on the civil air strength of the nation in general and called for the organization of civilian aviators and personnel in such a way that the collective manpower and know-how would assist in the seemingly inevitable all-out war effort. This second step was arguably the Federal government's blessing towards the creation of Civil Air Patrol. It was followed by a varied and intense debate over organizational logistics, bureaucracy and other administrative and practical details. Thomas H. Beck, who was at the time the Chairman of the Board of the Crowell-Collier Publishing Company, compiled an outline and plan to present to President Franklin D. Roosevelt that would lead up to the organization of the nation's civilian air power. Beck received peer guidance and support from Guy Gannett, the owner of a Maine newspaper chain. On 20 May 1941, the Office of Civilian Defense was created, with former New York City mayor and World War I pilot Fiorello H. La Guardia as the director. Wilson, Beck, and Gannett presented their plan for a national civil air patrol to La Guardia, and he approved the idea. He then appointed Wilson, Beck, and Gannett to form the so-called \\"blueprint committee\\" and charged them with organizing the national aviation resources on a national scale. By October 1941 the plan was completed. The remaining tasks were chiefly administrative, such as the appointment of wing commanders, and Wilson left his New York office and traveled to Washington, D.C. to speak with Army officials as Civil Air Patrol's first executive officer. General Henry \\"Hap\\" Arnold organized a board of top military officers to review Wilson's final plan. The board, which included General George E. Stratemeyer (presiding officer of the board), Colonel Harry H. Blee, Major Lucas P. Ordway, Jr., and Major A.B. McMullen, reviewed the plan set forward by Wilson and his colleagues and evaluated the role of the War Department as an agency of the Office of Civilian Defense. The plan was approved and the recommendation was made that Army Air Forces officers assist with key positions such as flight training and logistics.  World War II  The Subchasers of CAP Coastal Base 3, Lantana, Florida With the approval of the Army Air Corps, Director La Guardia formalized the creation of Civil Air Patrol with Administrative Order 9, signed on 1 December 1941 and published 8 December 1941. This order outlined Civil Air Patrol's organization and named its first national commander as Major General John F. Curry. Wilson was officially made the executive officer of the new organization. Additionally, Colonel Harry H. Blee was appointed the new operations director. The very fear that sparked the Civil Air Patrol \\"movement\\" ‚Äì that general aviation would be halted ‚Äì became a reality when the Imperial Japanese Navy attacked Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941. On 8 December 1941, all civil aircraft, with the exception of airliners, were grounded. This ban was lifted two days later (with the exception of the entire West Coast) and things went more or less back to normal. Earle E. Johnson took notice of the lack of security at general aviation airports despite the attack on Pearl Harbor. Seeing the potential for light aircraft to be used by saboteurs, Johnson took it upon himself to prove how vulnerable the nation was. Johnson took off in his own aircraft from his farm airstrip near Cleveland, Ohio, taking three small sandbags with him. Flying at , Johnson dropped a sandbag on each of three war plants and then returned to his airstrip. The next morning he notified the factory owners that he had \\"bombed\\" their facilities. The Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) apparently got Johnson's message and grounded all civil aviation until better security measures could be taken. Not surprisingly, Civil Air Patrol's initial membership increased along with the new security. With America's entrance into World War II, German U-boats began to operate along the East Coast. Their operations were very effective, sinking a total of 204 vessels by September 1942. Civil Air Patrol's top leaders requested that the War Department give them the authority to directly combat the U-boat threat. The request was initially opposed, for the CAP was still a young and inexperienced organization. However, with the alarming numbers of ships being sunk by the U-boats, the War Department finally agreed to give CAP a chance. On 5 March 1942, under the leadership of the newly promoted National Commander Johnson (the same Johnson that had \\"bombed\\" the factories with sandbags), Civil Air Patrol was given authority to operate a coastal patrol at two locations along the East Coast: Atlantic City, New Jersey, and Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. They were given a time frame of 90 days to prove their worth. The CAP's performance was outstanding, and before the 90-day period was over, the coastal patrol operations were authorized to expand in both duration and territory. By the end of the war, CAP pilots had flown over 500,000 mission hours. However, more than 90 aircraft were lost, and between 59 and 64 CAP pilots were killed, including 26 who were lost while on coastal patrol. = Coastal Patrol = At its height, Civil Air Patrol operated 21 coastal bases in 13 states along the Eastern Seaboard and the Gulf of Mexico. The Coastal Patrol was originally meant to be unarmed and strictly reconnaissance. The air crews of the patrol aircraft were to keep in touch with their bases and notify the Army Air Forces and Navy in the area when a U-boat was sighted, and to remain in the area until relieved. This policy was reviewed, however, when Civil Air Patrol encountered a turkey shoot opportunity. In May 1942, a CAP crew consisting of pilot Thomas Manning and observer Marshall \\"Doc\\" Rinker were flying a coastal patrol mission off Cape Canaveral when they spotted a German U-boat. The U-boat crew also spotted the aircraft, but not knowing that it was unarmed, attempted to flee. The U-boat became stuck on a sandbar, and consequently became an easy target. Rinker and Manning radioed to mission base the opportunity and circled the U-boat for more than half an hour. Unfortunately, by the time that Army Air Force bombers came to destroy the U-boat, the vessel had dislodged itself and had escaped to deep waters. As a result of this incident, CAP aircraft were authorized to be fitted with bombs and depth charges. Some of CAP's larger aircraft had the capability of carrying a single depth charge, however, most light aircraft could only carry a bomb. In some cases, the bomb's flight fins had to be partially removed so they would be able to fit underneath the wing of a light aircraft. One squadron's insignia of the time was a cartoon drawing of a small plane sweating and straining to carry a large bomb. This insignia became popular throughout CAP. The CAP's alleged first kill was claimed by one of the larger aircraft on 11 July 1942. The Grumman G-44 Widgeon, armed with two depth charges and crewed by Captain Johnny Haggins and Major Wynant Farr, was scrambled when another CAP patrol radioed that they had encountered an enemy submarine but were returning to base due to low fuel. After scanning the area, Farr spotted the U-boat cruising beneath the surface of the waves. Unable to accurately determine the depth of the vessel, Haggins and Ferr radioed the situation back to base and followed the enemy in hopes that it would rise to periscope depth. For three hours, the crew shadowed the submarine. Just as Haggins was about to return to base, the U-boat rose to periscope depth, and Haggins swung the aircraft around, aligned with the submarine and dove to . Farr released one of the two depth charges, blowing the submarine's front out of the water. As it left an oil slick, Farr made a second pass and released the other charge. Debris appeared on the ocean's surface, seemingly confirming the U-boat's demise and CAP's first kill. Postwar research has proven that there was no kill, much less any submarine attacked by Civil Air Patrol on 11 July 1942. CAP's Coastal Patrol operated for about 18 months (from 5 March 1942 to 31 August 1943) before being officially retired. During this time, the Coastal Patrol reported sighting 173 U-boats and dropping 82 bombs or depth charges. Overall, the Coastal Patrol flew 86,685 missions, logging over 244,600 hours. Coastal Patrol aircraft reported 91 ships in distress and played a key role in rescuing 363 survivors of U-boat attacks. 17 floating mines were reported and 5,684 convoy missions were flown for the Navy. = Border Patrol = Between July 1942 and April 1944, the Civil Air Patrol Southern Liaison Patrol was given the task of patrolling the border between Brownsville, Texas, and Douglas, Arizona. The Southern Liaison Patrol logged approximately 30,000 flight hours and patrolled roughly of the land separating the United States and Mexico. Southern Liaison Patrol tasks included looking for indications of spy or saboteur activity and were similar to counterdrug missions executed by Civil Air Patrol today. Aircraft piloted by the Southern Liaison Patrol often flew low enough to read the license plates on suspicious automobiles traveling in the patrol region. During its time of operation the Southern Liaison Patrol, more commonly known as the \\"CAP Border Patrol\\", reported almost 7,000 out-of-the-ordinary activities and 176 suspicious aircraft' descriptions and direction. During the entire operating period, only two members lost their lives. Considering the fact that the Border Patrol was one of the most dangerous missions CAP flew (along with Coastal Patrol), this is an exceptionally low number. = Target towing = In March 1942, CAP aircraft began towing targets for air-to-air (fighters) and ground-to-air (anti-aircraft batteries) gunnery practice. Targets would be trailed behind the aircraft (similar to the way an aircraft trails a banner) to simulate strafing attacks. CAP aircraft would also climb to various altitudes and would trail two targets for heavy AA guns to use for practice. Although uncommon, an antiaircraft round would occasionally hit the aircraft. Surprisingly, no deaths resulted from errant shots. Similarly, CAP aircraft also flew night missions to provide tracking practice for the crews of searchlights and radar units. These missions were dangerous in the sense that the pilot ran the risk of accidentally looking into the glare of a searchlight while performing evasive maneuvers, which would blind and disorient him. Such was the case of Captain Raoul Souliere, who lost his life after he went into a steep dive; witnesses surmised that he looked into the glare of a spotlight that had locked on to him, became disoriented, and did not realize he was in a dive. Despite the dangerous nature of these missions, fatalities and accidents were rare. CAP flew target missions for three years with 7 member fatalities, 5 serious injuries and 23 aircraft lost. A total of 20,593 towing and tracking missions were flown. = Search and Rescue operations (SAR) = During the period between 1 January 1942 and 1 January 1946, Civil Air Patrol pilots flew over 24,000 hours of federal- and military-assigned search and rescue missions in addition to thousands of hours of non-assigned SAR missions. These missions were a huge success, and in one particular week during February 1945, CAP SAR air crews found seven missing Army and Navy aircraft. Civil Air Patrol had several decisive advantages over the Army Air Forces in terms of SAR ability. First, because CAP was using civilian aircraft, they could fly lower and slower than the aircraft of the AAF. Second, unlike AAF pilots, CAP pilots tended to be local citizens and therefore knew the terrain much better. Third, CAP utilized ground teams which would travel to the suspected crash site (often by foot, although some wings had other ways of reaching a wreckage). = Courier service and cargo transportation = In the spring of 1942, the Pennsylvania Wing conducted a 30-day experiment with the intention of convincing the AAF that they were capable of flying cargo missions for the nation. The Pennsylvania Wing transported Army cargo as far as Georgia, and top Army officials were impressed. The War Department gave CAP permission to conduct courier and cargo service for the military. Although not generally remembered as one of CAP's \\"glamorous\\" jobs, cargo and courier transportation was an important job for the organization. From 1942 to 1944, Civil Air Patrol moved around of mail and cargo and hundreds of military passengers. = Pilot training and the cadet program = In October 1942, CAP planned a program to recruit and train youth with an emphasis on flight training. The CAP cadets assisted with operational tasks and began indoctrination and training towards becoming licensed pilots. Cadets were not exempt from being conscripted; however, the military atmosphere and general setting around them would provide an advantage to cadets who were subsequently called into service. To become a cadet, one had to be between the ages of 15 and 17, and be sponsored by a CAP member of the same gender. The cadet program called for physical fitness, completion of the first two years of high school and satisfactory grades. It was open only to native-born American citizens of parents who had been citizens of the United States for at least ten years. These restrictions were intentionally imposed to hold down membership levels until a solid foundation could be established. Perhaps the most astonishing fact of the cadet program's 20,000-plus initial membership was the lack of cost; it cost the Office of Civilian Defense less than US$200 to get the program underway, and this was to cover administrative costs. = Other wartime activities = CAP pilots were called on to provide a variety of missions that were not necessarily combat- related but still of direct benefit to the country. Some of the most notable of these missions were: flying blood bank mercy missions for the American Red Cross and other similar agencies; forest fire patrol and arson reporting; mock raids to test blackout practices and air raid warning systems; supporting war bond drives; and assisting in salvage collection drives. In the Northwestern states, Civil Air Patrol members, armed with shotguns, flew patrols hoping to spot Japanese balloon bombs. Perhaps the most curious job for CAP was \\"wolf patrol\\". In the southwestern United States, the native wolf population had been disrupting ranching operations. One rancher alone lost over 1,000 head of cattle due to wolf predation. This represented a huge monetary loss to ranchers and an added restriction to the already low supply of beef due to wartime rationing. By the winter of 1944, Texas ranchers lobbied the Texan governor to enlist the aid of Civil Air Patrol to control the wolf populations. CAP pilots, armed with firearms, flew over wolf territory and thinned the population to lower levels. CAP even had its own airbase during the war. A Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) auxiliary landing field, northwest of Baker, California, was given to Civil Air Patrol. Used primarily for training, Silver Lake boasted a hangar, barracks, mess hall and even a swimming pool and bath house. = Results of wartime activities = J-3 aircraft with CAP markings on display at the National Museum of the United States Air Force Civil Air Patrol's success with the cadet program, along with its impressive wartime record, led the War Department to create a permanent place for it in the department. On 29 April 1943, by order of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, the command of Civil Air Patrol was transferred from the Office of Civilian Defense to the War Department and given status as the auxiliary to the Army Air Forces. On 4 March 1943, the War Department issued Memorandum W95-12-43, which assigned the AAF the responsibility for supervising and directing operations of the CAP. One of the direct outcomes of this transfer was the loaning of 288 Piper L-4 \\"Grasshopper\\" aircraft from the AAF to the CAP. These aircraft were used in the cadet recruiting program. By 1945 there was an oversupply of cadets and CAP took over the responsibility of administering cadet mental screening tests.  Postwar  With the close of World War II, CAP suddenly found itself looking for a purpose. It had proved its worthiness and usefulness in wartime, but the ensuing peace had reduced CAP's scope of activities since the USAAF assumed a great many of the tasks that the CAP had performed. The very existence of CAP was threatened when the AAF announced that it would withdraw financial support on 1 April 1946, due to massive budget cuts. General \\"Hap\\" Arnold called a conference of CAP wing commanders, which convened in January 1946 and discussed the usefulness and feasibility of a postwar Civil Air Patrol. The conference concluded with the plan to incorporate Civil Air Patrol. On 1 March 1946, the 48 wing commanders held the first CAP/Congressional dinner honoring President Harry S. Truman, the 79th United States Congress, and over 50 AAF generals. The purpose of the dinner was to permit CAP to thank the President and others for the opportunity to serve the country during World War II. On 1 July 1946, Public Law 79-476 was enacted. The law incorporated Civil Air Patrol and stated that the purpose of the organization was to be \\"solely of a benevolent character\\". In other words, Civil Air Patrol was to never participate in combat operations again. With the creation of the United States Air Force on 26 July 1947, the command of Civil Air Patrol was transferred from the United States Army to the newly created Air Force. In October 1947, a CAP board convened to meet with USAF officials and plan the groundwork of Civil Air Patrol as the USAF auxiliary. After several meetings the USAF was satisfied and a bill was introduced to the United States House of Representatives. On 26 May 1948, Public Law 80-557 was enacted and CAP became the official auxiliary to the United States Air Force. Civil Air Patrol had been subordinate to Air Education and Training Command to fulfill the Aerospace Education mission. On June 24, 2016, Civil Air Patrol was transferred from the Air Education and Training Command (AETC) to the Air Combat Command (ACC) as part of the US Air Force Total Command, in recognition of CAP's Emergency Services role, which includes approximately 8,000 missions flying 20,000 hours a year. CAP members often volunteer at airshows, and the CAP provides a program to educate young children called Aerospace Connections in Education. Civil Air Patrol often assists in Air Force search and rescue missions under the orders of the Air Force Rescue Coordination Center. Civil Air Patrol's search and rescue missions save an average of 100 lives per year. Civil Air Patrol cadets can enlist in the Air Force as E-3 (Airman First Class) if they achieve the grade of Cadet 2nd Lieutenant.

Initially established to provide study scholarships to Agricultural Scientists, the Trust became responsible in 1941 for the annual presentation of the Farrer Memorial Oration and awarding the Farrer Medal. William Farrer and the Farrer Memorial Trust William Farrer was a surveyor who turned his hand to farming in 1886 near where Canberra now stands. Initially he planted grape vines but the conditions were not suitable, so he then decided to plant wheat. Due to weather conditions his first two harvests where damaged by rust, which spurred Farrer to develop strains that were resistant to rust. In 1900, he was successful with a variety he named Federation after the imminent Federation of Australia. When Farrer died suddenly in 1906 a committee was created to raise funds needed to establish a Memorial Trust. On 16 October 1911, the Trust received the funds with a set of instructions, enabling it to provide research grants and scholarships to further Agricultural Science in Australia. Farrer Medal In 1935, Frank Gallagher formed a committee to create the Farrer Memorial Oration, to be given by a person with an agricultural background. The first oration was by Tasmanian farmer and Australian Prime Minister Joseph Lyons at the Star Theatre, Queanbeyan on 3 April 1936, the birthday of William Farrer. At the end of the oration children from the Queanbeyan Intermediate High School presented Lyons with a silver medallion, which is now on display at Adolph Basser Library, Canberra. In 1941, Gallagher handed over the organisation of the Farrer Memorial Oration to the Farrer Memorial Trust. =Recipients= Source: NSW Department of Primary Industries See also * List of agriculture awards * List of prizes named after people References Category:Agriculture awards Category:Australian awards Category:History of agriculture in Australia Category:Australian science and technology awards Category:Awards established in 1936 ","title":"Farrer Memorial Trust"},{"id":"14918134","text":"The church of St Barbara T√†rbena (, ) is a municipality in the comarca of Marina Baixa, Alicante, Valencia, Spain. History It had been subjected to religious de-population and later re-population by an entirely different race of people. At the time of the Inquisition it was abandoned when the mostly Moorish population ran away. It was re-populated by impoverished natives of Mallorca, who took over the tumbledown ruins and turned it into a village. A Valencian shipping magnate in whose Ducal domain the mountain territory of Tarbena belonged, was involved in considerable livestock trade between the mainland and the Balearic islands. Ferrying pigs on the outboard journey, he often brought back the offal produced for a profit. Mallorcan black pudding was a sought after delicacy in Valencia, being quite distinct from local varieties. Then it occurred to him that if he put Mallorcans in one of his abandoned villages and got them to make the black pudding there, he could save the cost of transport and collect rents as well. So he then shipped a cargo of pigs out and a cargo of sausage-maker artisans back, took them up into the hills, showed them the empty village and gave it to them for free. They were a hardy lot and soon a cottage industry producing all manner of pig puddings and sausages; black, red and white, was flourishing. They still exist today, making Butifarras, Blanquets and Sobrasada.

He did pioneering work in statistical signal processing, and its application to speech analysis, synthesis and coding, including the development of the linear predictive coding (LPC) and line spectral pairs (LSP) methods. Biography Itakura was born in Toyokawa, Aichi Prefecture, Japan. He received undergraduate and graduate degrees from Nagoya University in 1963 and 1965, respectively. In 1966, while studying his PhD at Nagoya, he developed the earliest concepts for what would later become known as linear predictive coding (LPC), along with Shuzo Saito from Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT). They described an approach to automatic phoneme discrimination that involved the first maximum likelihood approach to speech coding. In 1968, he joined the NTT Musashino Electrical Communication Laboratory in Tokyo. The same year, Itakura and Saito presented the Itakura‚ÄìSaito distance algorithm.Itakura, F., & Saito, S. (1968). Analysis synthesis telephony based on the maximum likelihood method. In Proc. 6th of the International Congress on Acoustics (pp. C‚Äì17‚ÄìC‚Äì20). Los Alamitos, CA: IEEE. The following year, Itakura and Saito introduced partial correlation (PARCOR) to LPC. Itakura completed his D.Eng. degree in speech processing in 1972, writing his dissertation on \\"Speech Analysis and Synthesis based on a Statistical Method.\\" From 1973 to 1975, he worked at the Acoustics Research Department of Bell Labs, having been invited to work there on fundamental problems by James Flanagan, who had been impressed by one of Itakura's papers on low bit-rate encoding. In 1975, Itakura developed the line spectral pairs (LSP) method for high-compression speech coding, while at NTT. From 1975 to 1981, he studied problems in speech analysis and synthesis based on the LSP method. In 1980, his team developed an LSP-based speech synthesizer chip. LSP is an important technology for speech synthesis and coding, and in the 1990s was adopted by almost all international speech coding standards as an essential component, contributing to the enhancement of digital speech communication over mobile channels and the internet worldwide. In 1981, he was appointed as Chief of the Speech and Acoustics Research Section at NTT. He left this position in 1984 to take a professorship in communications theory and signal processing at Nagoya University. He currently teaches at Meijo University. Itakura's work on spectral and formant estimation laid the foundation for much of the early progress in speech signal processing. His work on autoregressive modeling of speech is used in nearly every modern low- to-medium, bit-rate speech transmission system, and the line spectral pair representation he developed is now found in nearly all cellular telephone systems. Awards His awards include the IEEE ASSP 1975 Senior Award, an award from Japan's Ministry of Science and Technology in 1977, the IEEE 1986 Morris N. Liebmann Award (with B. S. Atal), the IEEE Signal Processing 1996 Society Award, the IEEE Third Millennium Medal, the IEICE 2002 Distinguished Achievement and Contributions Award, and the 2003 Purple Ribbon Medal from Japanese Government. In 2005, he received the Asahi Prize and the IEEE Jack S. Kilby Signal Processing Medal. In 2009, he received the NEC C&C; Prize for his pioneering research and the development of highly efficient voice-coding technology with analysis-synthesis methods for speech.

Due to the school's pioneering status and the quality of several of its early buildings, the Stonewall Jackson Training School Historic District has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places. This designation includes 71 acres and 50 buildings. It was previously operated by the North Carolina Department of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention. History Established to provide a place for troubled youths separate from adult prisoners, this was considered a progressive institution. Its founding was the result of twenty years of organizing by white women's groups in North Carolina. They lobbied for construction of a reformatory for white boys as part of prison reform. Particularly influential were the King's Daughters (North Carolina) from 1902 on, and the Women's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU). The North Carolina Federation of Women's Clubs (NCFWC) and the United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC) also participated in campaigning strongly to raise funds and influence the legislature. When the King's Daughters promised to name the school after General Stonewall Jackson, many Confederate veterans in the legislature finally approved the project, which was authorized in 1907. As a sign of their influence, four women were named to the board of the school.Anastasia Sims, The Power of Femininity in the New South, Columbia, SC: University of South Carolina Press, 1997, pp.119-122 Boys were generally incarcerated for relatively minor scrapes with the law, including school truancy. > At the school, the young men lived in a series of dormitory style buildings, > and received an academic education as well as learning a trade.

Such facilities were not constructed for several years: the first, for white girls, was built in 1918 in Moore County and called Samarcand.Anastasia Sims, The Power of Femininity in the New South, Columbia, SC: University of South Carolina Press, 2006, pp.119-122 Post-World War II In 1948 as part of continuing statewide efforts to limit \\"feeblemindedness\\" and improve the population, the Stonewall Jackson Training School was the site of sterilization by vasectomy of six teenage white males, in operations authorized by the state Eugenics Board. Most sterilizations were performed on girls and women rather than boys or men. North Carolina was one of the last states that continued to perform sterilizations on people under state care.John Railey and Kevin Begos, \\"DETOUR: In '48 state singled out delinquent boys\\", JournalNow/Winston-Salem Journal, 2002, accessed 8 Jan 2009 During the decades of its existence, the School was criticized for abuses common in many detention facilities, such as overcrowding and prisoner violence. At its peak the facility held about 500 youths. At times there were inhumane conditions in which youths were attacked and raped by other inmates. Prison activist Russell Smith stated he suffered such attacks there when imprisoned in the 1960s from age 13-15. As an adult (and after time in state and federal prisons), Smith became an activist against prison violence, founding both the \\"National Gay Prisoner Coalition\\" (NGPC) and in 1980 People Organized to Stop Rape of Imprisoned Persons (POSRIP). In the 1970s, ideas about treating youths changed, and they were seldom incarcerated for offenses as minor as delinquency. The state reduced the population at the facility. The size of the campus had been reduced earlier when the extensive agricultural program was dropped. Later called the Stonewall Jackson Youth Development Facility, it was used for serious offenders involved in drug abuse and weapons-related charges. About 150 young men were generally held there. Sixty acres of the facility were enclosed by a -high fence. Starting in 1992 the center had a Pet Therapy Program, in which youth learned to care for dogs. Animals were sometimes made available for adoption outside the center.Stonewall Jackson Youth Development Center, Petfinder, accessed 9 Jan 2009 Architectural historian Peter Kaplan, speaking to a 2014 meeting of the Historic Cabarrus Association, called the historic campus \\"which I understand is now completely vacant ... a remarkable collection of Colonial Revival buildings and one of Cabarrus County‚Äôs most impressive architectural groupings.\\" As of 2015 23 of the 60 structures were used, and most of them were used for storage purposes.\\"Youth Development Centers .\\" North Carolina Department of Public Safety.

The latest figures show 107 residents. In 2020, North Carolina State Senator Paul Newton sponsored a bill transferring the historic campus to Cabarrus County along with Frank Liske Park, which was a farm used by the school and became a park in 1979, leased to the county since then. Demolition of the historic buildings would cost $3.8 million but selling the buildings increases the chance for preservation. This bill has become law.

It is also the term used in linguistics for the most common phonation of vowels. The term \\"modal\\" refers to the resonant mode of vocal folds; that is, the optimal combination of airflow and glottal tension that yields maximum vibration. In linguistics, modal voice is the only phonation found in the vowels and other sonorants (consonants such as m, n, l, and r) of most of the languages of the world, but a significant minority contrasts modal voice with other phonations. Among obstruents (consonants such as k, g, tÕ° É/ch, dÕ° í/j, s, and z), it is very common for languages to contrast modal voice with voicelessness, but in English, many supposedly-voiced obstruents do not usually have modal voice. In speech pathology, the modal register is one of the four identifiable registers within the human voice. It is above the vocal fry register and overlapping the lower part of the falsetto register. That view is also adopted by many vocal pedagogists, but some vocal pedagogists may view vocal registration differently. In singing, the modal register may also overlap part of the whistle register. A well trained singer or speaker can phonate two octaves or more within the modal register with consistent production, beauty of tone, dynamic variation, and vocal freedom. The modal register begins and ends in different places within the human voice. The placement of the modal register within the individual human voice is one of the key determining factors in identifying vocal type. Physiological process In the modal register, the length, the tension, and the mass of the vocal folds are in a state of flux which causes the frequency of vibration of the vocal folds to vary. As pitch rises, the vocal folds increase in length and in tension, and their edges become thinner. If a speaker or singer holds any of the three factors constant and interferes with the progressive state of change, the laryngeal function of the voice becomes static and eventually breaks occur resulting in obvious changes in vocal quality. While some vocal pedagogists identify such breaks as register boundaries or transition areas between registers, other vocal pedagogists maintain that the breaks are a result of vocal problems caused by a static laryngeal adjustment that does not permit the necessary changes to take place within the modal register. Vocal fold, scheme Glottal cycle, modal voice On the lower pitches in the modal register, the vocal folds are thick and wedge-shaped. Because of the thickness, large portions of the opposing surfaces of the vocal folds are brought into contact, and the glottis remains closed for a considerable time in each cycle. The glottis opens from the bottom first before it opens at the top, which imparts a fluid, wavelike motion to the cords. The modal voice has a broad harmonic spectrum, rich in overtones, because of the rolling motion of the cords. It is comparatively loud to the other vocal registers because of the vibratory energy present, but it is capable of dynamic variation. For the lowest tones, only the thyroarytenoid muscles are active, but as the pitch rises, the cricothyroids enter the action, which begins to lengthen the folds. As longitudinal tension increases, the glottis tends to develop a gap in the middle. To counteract the tendency, the lateral cricoarytenoids are brought into action, pulling forward on the muscular process of the arytenoids. The process is sometimes referred to as medial compression. In addition to the stretching of the vocal folds and the increasing tension on them as the pitch rises, the opposing surfaces of the folds, which may be brought into contact, becomes smaller and smaller, as the edges of the folds become thinner. The basic vibratory or phonatory pattern remains the same, with the whole vocal fold still involved in the action, but the vertical excursions are not as large and the rolling motion is not as apparent as it was on the lower pitches of the modal register. The physical limits of muscular strength of the internal thyroarytenoids or vocalis muscle are being approached. To sing or speak above this pitch level the voice must adopt a new phonatory pattern to change registers.

It also belongs to the subcomarca of Alta Garrotxa. It includes the villages of Arnera, Les Creus, Les Mines, Les Salines, Tapis, Els Vilars, and Oliveda. It is situated at the foot of the Eastern Pyrenees, with the Rivers Arnera and Frausa. It has numerous springs, which makes it attractive for tourism, the largest source of revenue, together with dryland farming and animal husbandry. It has a water bottling facility. The center (370 m) is located in a valley between the two highest points of the municipal territory, the Puig de Les Salines (1331 m) and the roc de Frausa (1445 m). History Last century, near the river Arnera there were found neolitical axe, together with the menhir called La Pedra Dreta. Those findings show that the valley of the Arnera was populated from prehistoric periods. The first documented mention of the place appears in the precept of Louis the Pious in 814, in which it says that C√©ret limits south with villam quae dicitur Macanetum. In 954 count Guifr√© II of Besal√∫ gave to the monastery of Sant Pere of Camprodon the allodium of Tapis, to build the sanctuary of Les Salines. During the Medium Age it was fortified, and there are still remains of the wall with three covers of the 15th century. In 1440 they added de Cabrenys to Ma√ßanet, because the village happens to belong to the barony of Cabrenys, a line of the lineage of the Rocabert√≠. In 1553 the black plague annihilates half of the population. In July 1675 lieutenant-general Le Bret, David Steward: Assimilation and acculturation in seventeenth-century Europe: Roussillon and France 1659-1715 with 1,500 men, plunders the village.

The story, which begins sometime around 1984 or 1985, is told in flashback form by the protagonist, Vernon Dibbs. The middle child of five in his family, Vernon has two sisters and two brothers. The Dibbs family is a single-parent household; the family patriarch is a functionally illiterate widower whose wife died sometime earlier from a stroke suffered while at work as a seamstress. Vernon's two older siblings, sister Steph and brother Tony, have moved away; Steph is married and Tony received a full scholarship to attend college. The flashback portion of the story. begins in 1981, as Vernon starts junior high school. He is a year older than the rest of his classmates, due to being held back one grade earlier in his schooling. He is in danger of being held back again, because his schoolwork is suffering and so are his grades. Vernon also does not have any resources to help him get tutoring, as his father is usually working and none of his siblings are able to take him. Vernon spends most of his time hanging out with his friends Bobby, Chris, and Jerry, and they get their kicks by causing trouble in town and harassing Maxine Flooter, an alcoholic dubbed the \\"Crazy Lady\\" by everyone in the neighborhood. Maxine is often seen dressed eccentrically and dragging her intellectually disabled son, Ronald, around with her wherever she goes. Ronald is also a target for the boys' ridicule, which further infuriates his mother as she is his only caregiver. One day, things begin to change. On a trip to the local grocery store for potatoes, Vernon sees the store owner, an old man named Milt, arguing with a customer over the price of the potatoes. Vernon has the same argument with Milt, as Steph had gone to his store a few days before and bought potatoes for the same price. Milt kicks Vernon out of the store, and the customer interrupts him on the way out to tell him he had done well. Vernon turns to look at her and discovers that the customer was Maxine. The two of them get to talking, and Vernon lets it slip about how much trouble he is having in school. Maxine decides to try to get Vernon help and enlists the help of Miss Annie, who is her neighbor. She agrees to help Vernon pull up his English grade, but eventually insists that as payment, Vernon must help Maxine out around the house and help with Ronald as well. While it is not easy for him, as Maxine is usually drunk and sometimes ends up in jail as a result, Vernon begins spending more and more time around Maxine and Ronald and begins to form a friendship with the young man. Eventually Vernon is all but ignoring his family, which does not help his already tense situation at home. He finds himself up late at night on several occasions talking with his father, who likes to come home and sit in the kitchen listening to oldies (which he claims help him think about the past), and those conversations help to form a bond between the two. (Later in the story, Vernon's father asks him to teach him how to read, which is an important moment in their relationship.) After a few weeks, Vernon meets Ronald's teacher, who suggests to Maxine that Ronald sign up for the local Special Olympics. Vernon decides to take charge of the efforts to send Ronald to the games, getting the help of his friends in the process‚Äîespecially Jerry, who has an intellectually disabled brother that he visits on the weekends and that he never tells anyone about. Things start to come to a head when Vernon organizes a block party to help raise funds for Ronald. It ends when Maxine, drunk as usual, storms onto the block in a drunken rage and tells everyone off. Vernon's frustrations finally boil over after Maxine interrupts a Sunday Mass at the local church and begins telling all the people in the church exactly what she thinks about them‚Äîspecifically telling Vernon that he does not have \\"the brains God gave a stump.\\" After that, he refuses to have anything to do with her, only going in and out of the house to check on Ronald. Maxine, however, makes several attempts to get in contact with Vernon as she has something important to tell him. The day of the Special Olympics arrives, and Ronald and Vernon win several ribbons as a team in walking races. They run into Ronald's teacher at the games, who offers them a ride home and reveals to Vernon what Maxine had been trying to tell him‚Äîthat Ronald was going to be moving to North Carolina to live with one of Maxine's family members who can better take care of him. Vernon is shaken by the news and storms out of the car on the side of the road. He then confronts Maxine about what she is about to do, with her telling him that she tried to help Ronald but that he will be better off in North Carolina. Finally the day comes for Ronald to leave, and everyone in the neighborhood comes to bid him farewell (except for Maxine, who cannot bear to see her only child leave her). After everyone says their goodbyes, Ronald's new family drives away. The sight of Ronald leaving is too much for Vernon to handle, and he begins chasing after the car as fast as his legs can carry him. Unfortunately, not only can he not catch up to the car, he trips over a curb and is sent sprawling into a wall. As he lies on the hard ground, severely injured, his father comes over to him. The book ends with him saying to his middle son: \\"Vernon, I'm here.\\" Notes Category:1993 American novels Category:1993 children's books Category:American children's novels Category:Disability in fiction Category:HarperCollins books Category:Newbery Honor-winning works Category:Novels about alcoholism Category:Novels set in Baltimore Category:Special Olympics Category:Works about parasports ","title":"Crazy Lady!"},{"id":"14918442","text":"Sant Climent Sescebes is a municipality in the comarca of Alt Empord√†, Girona, Catalonia, Spain.

In Italian he wrote lyric poetry and in Occitan he penned the famous Doctrina de cort, basically a condensed form of the Razos de trobar of Raimon Vidal. Because his Doctrina is composed in verse, and conjecturing from his surviving Italian lyrics, he is sometimes classified as a troubadour, though none of his Occitan lyrics survive. His Occitan name was Teramayguis or Teramaygnis de Piza, as he himself recorded in his Doctrina, addressed to Nino Visconti, Judge of Gallura. This was probably not a first name, as some scholars have thought, but rather an indicator that he came from Pisan territory, which suggests his birthplace was in peninsular Italy (near Pisa), yet his home to be in Sardinia, where he undoubtedly composed his main work. This work, however, was badly handled by copyists, with the result that the surviving manuscripts of the Doctrina are riddled with errors, unclear, and inaccessible. What can be gleaned, however, suffices to demonstrate that Terramagnino's work lacked originality. His Occitan, too, is not he best and there are Italianisms. Italian cities (like Pisa, Lucca, Florence, Genoa, and Piacenza) also appear often. Terramagnino also alludes to Paolo Lanfranchi de Pistoja and Dante da Majano, proving a connexion with peninsular Occitan poets. Terramagnino may be the same person as the author of an obscure sonnet, \\"Poi dal mastro Guitton latte tenete\\", addressed to a Guidonian of the \\"Tuscan school\\". The Guidonian scholar replied with an even more obscure poem of his own, following Terramagnino's rime, but citing the authority of Saint Jerome. This has led to some speculation that Terramagnino's Christian name was Girolamo or Gerolamo.

Their family estates included Nevesinje and Popovo Polje in what is today Herzegovina and Konavle in southern Dalmatia. Early history The earliest known ancestor of the Sankoviƒá family, Dra≈æen Bogopenec, was first mentioned in 1306. He was from Nevesinje, and was mentioned as having led raids into Hum, stealing from Ragusan subjects. Nevesinje was at the time part of the Kingdom of Serbia. According to Fine, in 1326, the Dra≈æivojeviƒá (the next generation of Bogopenec), along with other nobility, were sent by Bosnian Ban Stephen II into Hum to oust the Branivojeviƒá family, which served Serbia, to annex most of Hum. Serbian Hum fell to Bosnia after the War of Hum (1326‚Äì29). Milten Dra≈æivojeviƒá, the first notable representative of the family, was mentioned in 1332. History Sanko, the son of ≈æupan Milten, was first mentioned in 1335 and on 22 October 1348, the Republic of Ragusa granted citizenship to Sanko as an aristocrat of the Bosnian Ban. From 11 August 1366 on, Sanko was mentioned as a judge. He left the ranks of Ban Tvrtko I and joined Serbian magnate Nikola Altomanoviƒá for a brief period. When Altomanoviƒá campaigned against Ragusa in 1370, Sanko is said to have led the Bosnian army that aided Ragusa, and died in battle. He had four sons and a daughter: Beljak, Radiƒç, Budelja, Sanƒçin and Dragana. His sons knez Beljak, primarily, and vojvoda Radiƒç Sankoviƒá, inherited his holdings. Immediately after Tvrtko I's death in 1391, Beljak and Radiƒç decided to sell the family estate of Konavle to Ragusa. A council meeting, however, was convoked as a result by the nobility who objected the sale. Vlatko Vukoviƒá and Pavle Radenoviƒá revolted against Radiƒç in December 1391 after receiving the council's blessings. They captured Konavle and occupied it, dividing it up for themselves, despite protests from Ragusa. When Vukoviƒá died, his nephew, Sandalj Hraniƒá, succeeded him, continually struggling against Radiƒç after being released in late 1398. In 1399, Radiƒç became a member of the Great Council of the Republic of Ragusa. Radiƒç participated in the Bosnian‚ÄìRagusan War in 1403‚Äì04, leading the attacks on Ragusa in the name of Bosnian king Stjepan Ostoja. However, Hraniƒá sent Sankoviƒá back to prison in 1404, blinding him and taking his estates. Sankoviƒá died while in prison that same year, marking the end of the Sankoviƒá family.

In 1388, he and fellow nobleman Vlatko Vukoviƒá led the Bosnian army against the Ottomans at Bileƒáa.Finkel, Caroline, Osman's Dream, (Basic Books, 2005), pp. 20-21 In 1392, Radiƒç and Beljak tried to sell Konavli to the Republic of Ragusa. The same year on May 15, he issued a charter to Dubrovnik merchants enabling them to trade on his territories. However, a council meeting was convoked by the king and nobility who objected the sale. Grand duke Vlatko Vukoviƒá (of Kosaƒçe) and knez Pavle Radinoviƒá (of Pavloviƒái) were sent against Radiƒç in December 1391 after receiving the council's blessings. The two captured Radiƒç and occupied Konavli, dividing it between themselves, despite protests from Ragusa. Vukoviƒá died shortly after this, and was succeeded by his nephew Sandalj Hraniƒá, who continued to struggle against Radiƒç. Radiƒç regained freedom in 1398, immediately seeking to restore his lost lands, becoming an important ally of Stephen Ostoja. In 1399, he sold the Lisac field to Ragusa for 500 perpers.Glasnik Zemaljskog muzeja u Bosni i Hercegovini, Vol. 20, 1908, p. 422 He also became a member of the Ragusan Great council. Radiƒç participated in the Bosnian-Dubrovnik War in 1403-1404, leading the attacks on Dubrovnik in the name of Ban Stjepan Ostoja. Hraniƒá captured and blinded Radiƒç, and held him in prison until his death in 1404. The area of Nevesinje to the coast was taken by Hraniƒá. References =Sources= * * John V.A. Fine. (1994).

He developed his philosophy throughout the course of his life after being deeply moved and concerned by the Metaphysics of Aristotle and studying it for over a year. According to Henry Corbin and Seyyed Hossein Nasr, there are two kind of Avicennism: Islamic or Iranian Avicennism, and Latin Avicennism. According to Nasr, the Latin Avicennism was based on the former philosophical works of Avicenna. This school followed the Peripatetic school of philosophy and tried to describe the structure of reality with a rational system of thinking. In the twelfth century AD, It became influential in Europe, particularly in Oxford and Paris, and affected some notable philosophers such as Thomas Aquinas, Roger Bacon and Duns Scotus. While the Latin Avicennism was weak in comparison with Latin Averroism, according to √âtienne Gilson there was an \\"Avicennising Augustinism\\". On the other hand, Islamic Avicennism is based on his later works which is known as \\"The oriental philosophy\\" (ÿ≠⁄©ŸÖÿ™ ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ¥ÿ±ŸÇ€å€åŸÜ). Therefore, philosophy in the eastern Islamic civilization providing became close to gnosis and tried to provide a vision of a spiritual universe. This approach paved the road for the Iranian school of Illuminationism (ÿ≠⁄©ŸÖÿ™ ÿßŸÑÿßÿ¥ÿ±ÿßŸÇ) by Suhrawardi. Corbin referred to divergences between Iranian Avicennism and Latin Avicennism. Besides he showed that we can see three different schools in Avicennism, which he called Avicennising Augustinism, Latin Avicennism and Iranian Avicennism. The philosophical programme of Avicenna and his students was criticised by the Mu øtazilƒ´ ·∏§anafƒ´ scholar Ibn al-MalƒÅ·∏•imƒ´ (d. 1141), who argued that philosophy in the Greek tradition would be used to justify false beliefs and dilute the prophetic character of Islam. He put forward Christianity as an example of a prophetic religion corrupted by Greek abstract thought..

The primary purpose of the studio audience is to provide applause and/or laughter to the program's soundtrack (as opposed to canned laughter). Additionally, live studio audiences produce an energy off of which the actors can feed, as well as push actors to perform to the best of their abilities. Unlike relying on the ideal chuckles that a laugh track consistently provides, actors have to work for the laughs. A studio audience can also provide volunteers, a visual backdrop and discussion participants. On some game shows, contestants are taken from the studio audience, such as with The Price Is Right. In some cases, a studio audience can be called upon to vote, to help a contestant(s) (such as with Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?) or pass judgment on a politician (such as with Question Time). In the United States, tickets to be a part of a studio audience are usually given away. However, as an enticement to attend, one or more members of the audience may be selected to win a prize, which is usually provided by a manufacturer in exchange for an advertisement, usually at the end of the show. For sitcom/sketch comedy shows like All in the Family, Saturday Night Live and Happy Days (for indoor scenes), the use of a live studio audiences essentially turns them into de facto stage productions while shooting individual scenes, with minor problems like the audience applauding or uproariously whooping (the latter since becoming a satirical clich√© in shows which mock the format and tropes of traditional sitcoms) when their favorite performers enter the stage. Shows like The Red Green Show, meanwhile, actually make the audience a part of the show, since that show is supposedly a television broadcast made from the (fictional) Possum Lodge, cast members react and speak directly to the audience as if they were talking to the viewers at home.  Brief history  Most early radio shows in the United States were recorded in the presence of a studio audience, including comedies such as The Jack Benny Program, The Phil Harris-Alice Faye Show, and Fibber McGee and Molly, as well as anthology series like The Mercury Theatre and Lux Radio Theatre. In its earliest days, most television broadcasts stemmed from the world of New York theater. Stage veterans were experienced in performing for a crowd. Starting in the 1940s, these plays were broadcast live. Thus, these plays were now directed towards both the live audience and those watching from home. Premiering in 1951, I Love Lucy was the first television series to be filmed in front of an audience. This was made possible by the idea of Desi Arnaz to use multiple cameras. This implementation allowed the show to benefit from the strengths of both stage plays (live audience) and film (camera angle options, point of view, etc.). This approach produced a marriage between cinema and theater; television and plays. Shows that subsequently adopted this concept include All in the Family, Cheers, The Jeffersons, Seinfeld, Friends and Full House. Although radio broadcasts for a studio audience have for the most part ended for commercial radio programs (outside of special \\"road show\\" episodes), public radio shows such as A Prairie Home Companion, Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me!, Says You!, Tent Show Radio and Whad'Ya Know? are mainly performed in front of live audiences in theaters or art centers, if not a confined studio setting. As the COVID-19 pandemic got worse, many TV shows had to suspend the admission of live audience and air without a live audience in order to slow the spread of the coronavirus.

The specific epithet uniflora means \\"one-flowered\\", a characteristic that distinguishes this species from others in the genus Clintonia. For this reason, it is also known as the single-flowered clintonia. Description Clintonia uniflora is a perennial herbaceous plant that spreads by means of underground rhizomes. It is the smallest plant in the genus, only tall. It has two or three leaves located at the base of a hairy stem. Each leaf is wide and long. A plant typically bears a single flower but occasionally there will be an inflorescence of two flowers. The small flower has six white tepals, each approximately long, and six protruding white stamens with pollen-dusted anthers. After pollination, the flower is replaced by a round blue berry approximately in diameter. File:Clintonia uniflora, by Mary Vaux Walcott.jpgWatercolor painting by Mary Vaux Walcottalt=Watercolor painting of Clintonia uniflora, by Mary Vaux Walcott File:Clintonia uniflora 15272.JPGThe solitary flower has six tepals and six stamens.alt=The solitary flower of Clintonia uniflora has six tepals and six stamens. File:Clintonia uniflora 26301.JPGThe fruit is a single round blue berry up to a centimeter in diameter.alt=The fruit of Clintonia uniflora is a single round blue berry up to a centimeter in diameter. Taxonomy In 1829, Josef August Schultes described the plant variety Smilacina borealis var. uniflora, which was later segregated into species Smilacina uniflora. The latter was to become a synonym for Clintonia uniflora, first described by Carl Sigismund Kunth in 1850. Distribution Clintonia uniflora is native to western North America, from southern Alaska to central California, extending eastward into southwestern Alberta and northwestern Montana. It prefers cool montane coniferous forests, typically at elevations from . C. uniflora occurs in many forest types but it prefers a cool moist coniferous forest consisting of western red cedar (Thuja plicata), western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla), grand fir (Abies grandis), subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa), and Pacific silver fir (Abies amabilis). It is also associated with western white pine (Pinus monticola), Alaska cedar (Chamaecyparis nootkatensis), and noble fir (Abies procera). Companion species in the understory include threeleaf foamflower (Tiarella trifoliata), twinflower (Linnaea borealis), and Canadian bunchberry (Cornus canadensis). The range of C. uniflora overlaps with that of C. andrewsiana in Humboldt County and Del Norte County in northwestern California and Curry County in southwestern Oregon, but the two species are readily distinguished by their overall size and their flowers. C. uniflora has a single flower with white tepals while C. andrewsiana has multiple flowers arranged in one or more umbels. The tepals of the latter are a deep claret red. Ecology Clintonia uniflora is a perennial geophyte that can live up to 30 years (or more). The plant flowers between late May and July, and thereafter the fruit matures from late July to September. Citizen scientists observe flowering plants uniformly throughout June and July. The plant is not considered palatable but it is of at least minor importance as food for some wildlife species including birds, elk, and deer. Frugivorous birds are the only reported dispersers of the seeds, which remain viable in the ground for at least a couple of years. Uses The indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest, including the Nuxalk, the Cowlitz, and the Haisla peoples, used the plant as a dermatological aid and eye medicine. The Nlaka'pamux (also known as the Thompson people) mashed the ripe blue fruit and used it as a dye or stain. Today Clintonia uniflora is used as a garden ornamental.

Examples of petitions for which a RFE may be issued are Form I-129 (alien worker authorization), Form I-140 (immigrant worker authorization), and Form I-130 (family visas).  Situations where it is used  The RFE is intended for use in cases where the adjudicator (the person evaluating the petition) believes that there is not enough evidence to approve the petition, but also believes that the petition may be redeemable, and that there is no clear factual or statutory basis for denial. The RFE, when used, should be as clear as possible about what types of additional evidence are needed to fill in the gap, and what inconsistencies or problems have been found in the evidence submitted so far. It is not intended for use for the adjudicator's reassurance in cases where there is enough evidence to approve the petition. The RFE is sent to, and the response must be sent by, the petitioner (or the attorney representing the petitioner, in cases where the petition is filed through an attorney) rather than the beneficiary.  Related communications  = Differences with NOID = The following are some key differences between the RFE and the Notice of Intent to Deny (NOID): * Likelihood of denial: The RFE is issued when there is significant uncertainty about whether the petition will be approved, whereas the NOID is generally used when a denial is quite likely. * Accompanying information: A RFE comes with a list of additional types of evidence needed. A NOID comes equipped with a list of reasons for denial. While the two lists are somewhat related (insofar as a reason for denial translates to a piece of evidence that could overturn the denial) they have different framings. * Time given to respond: The time given to respond to a RFE is generally greater than that for a NOID. = Request for clarification = In cases where the USCIS simply needs answers to a few specific questions (such as a complete translation), it simply issues a Request for Clarification instead of a RFE.  Tips for avoiding RFEs  Submitting clear and complete documentation in the petition itself can minimize the need for RFEs. The USCIS website offers the following tips to avoid RFEs: * Inconsistencies in documents should be explained and evidence to reconcile the inconsistencies should be included. * Unavailability of documents should be explained with clear evidence. * Probative value: Some kinds of documents are considered more authoritative and have more probative value. For instance, income tax returns have more probative value than letters from family or friends. * Incomplete translations should be avoided. Any documents being submitted in a language other than English must be translated in their entirety.  Types of evidence requested  RFEs typically request one or more of the following types of evidence: * ability of employer to pay * periods of current or prior stay in the United States * prior work experience * educational details or evaluation * documents supporting claims of exceptional ability or outstanding research  Response protocol  The time within which the response to a RFE must be sent is indicated on the RFE. It generally varies between 30 and 90 days. If no response is received within the time indicated on the RFE, the USCIS will process the application without considering the additional evidence, which in most cases means a denial (because petitions where there was enough evidence to accept should not have RFEs in the first place). The petitioner has only one chance to respond to a RFE, * The petitioner can submit all the requested evidence. * The petitioner can \\"partially respond\\" by submitting some of the requested evidence. The USCIS will use the partial submission along with the earlier submission to evaluate the petition. * The petitioner can choose not to respond, so a final decision will be based on the original petition. This usually means a denial. * The petitioner can withdraw the petition. When responding to a RFE, the petitioner may attach additional pieces of evidence over and above those explicitly requested in the RFE.  Relation with processing timeline  The expected processing time for petitions is generally defined as the time till an approval, denial, RFE, or NOID is issued. Therefore, the time taken while waiting for a response from the petitioner is not counted as part of the processing time. After the petitioner responds, the expected additional processing time is comparable with the processing time for a complete first application. For petitions that request the Premium Processing Service, the expected processing time to a first response (approval, denial, RFE, or NOID) is 15 days, and the time after receiving a response to the RFE is another 15 days.

Documentary Summaries  = A Blank on the Map (1971) = The central area of New Guinea was thought to be uninhabited until aerial photographs showed signs of human habitation. Attenborough accompanies an expedition into the interior to find and make contact with these people and map the area. = Attenborough in Paradise (1996) = Attenborough achieves a childhood ambition of finding and filming the birds-of-paradise described by Alfred Russel Wallace in his book, The Malay Archipelago. He visits New Guinea and surrounding islands to track down these breath-takingly beautiful birds. Their plumage, colours and mating dances are spectacular. The environment is so benign that the female birds can build their nests and raise their young without the help of males, so the females choose a mate on the basis of his beauty and dancing ability alone. As a result, sexual selection has produced the most incredible variety of extravagant displays imaginable.... =The Lost Gods of Easter Island (2000) = A carved wooden idol that Attenborough purchased in an auction room is traced back to its origin: Easter Island. It was cheap because the seller believed it was a forgery. During the course of this programme its whole history is discovered: carved on Easter Island while there was still wood of the Toromiro tree (now extinct on the island), to represent the god Makemake, traded with the crew of captain Cook's ship, transported to Tahiti, probably traded by the Tahitians with the crew of an American whaling ship and ended up in the US. = Bowerbirds: The Art of Seduction (2000) = Attenborough heads to Australia and New Guinea. Like the Birds of Paradise, Bowerbird females build their nests and raise their young alone so the male has all day to gather his treasures and create his bower. There seems to be a bowerbird rule: the more elaborate the bower the plainer the bird ‚Äì the simpler the bower, the more vivid the plumage. David mischievously moves a leaf or a piece of lichen to see what the bird will do, then moves away. The bird flies back scoldingly and fussily returns his artistic display to its former perfection. Fascinating. = The Song of the Earth (2000) = This natural history of music begins with Attenborough playing the piano. Searching for the origins of human music, he traces its connections to the musical sounds that other animals make: the beauty of the wolf's howl, the complexity of the bat's cry, the deep rumble of the elephant's signals, the acoustically sophisticated sounds the dolphin produces and the songs of whales and birds. Why do these animals produce this amazing variety of sounds? It's all tied up with sex and territory. = Life on Air: David Attenborough's 50 Years in Television (2002) = This BBC documentary traces David Attenborough's career. It is presented by Michael Palin and was first transmitted in 2002. It takes an in depth look at Attenborough's career in television: from his earliest application for a job with BBC radio, through his elevation to BBC Director of Programmes where they were kind enough to let him out of his suit every now and then to go and be intrepid, his rejection of the job of BBC Director General so that he could film Life on Earth. = The Amber Time Machine (2004) = Amber washed up on the shores of the Baltic Sea was given to Attenborough when he was 12 years old. He travels there to find out what that piece of amber has to tell about life in the forest where it bled from some sort of pine tree, trapping a community of insects as it oozed down the bark. Then a trip to the Dominican Republic, where amber reveals astonishing details about life up to 150-million years ago. In addition to insects, amber traps things like lizards, tadpoles, mammal hairs and seeds. Some of the perfectly preserved creatures have been scanned, X-rayed and tested for traces of DNA. The stories they tell are quite remarkable.

The mission was led by US Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara and General Maxwell D. Taylor, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The mission came in the wake of the Krulak‚ÄìMendenhall mission in which United States Marine Corps General Victor Krulak and State Department official Joseph Mendenhall gave diametrically differing outlooks on the military and political situation in Vietnam. Upon their return, McNamara and Taylor recommended measures intended to restrict the regime of President Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Di·ªám, feeling that Di·ªám was pre-occupied with suppressing dissent rather than fighting the communists. The measures also sought to pressure Di·ªám to respect human rights more. Background In May, civil unrest broke out in South Vietnam following the Hu·∫ø Ph·∫≠t ƒê·∫£n shootings. Nine Buddhists were gunned down by the minority Catholic regime of President Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Di·ªám after defying a government ban on the flying of Buddhist flags on Vesak, the birthday of Gautama Buddha and marching in an anti-government protest. Following the shootings, Buddhist leaders began to lobby Di·ªám for religious equality and compensation and justice for the families of the victims. With Di·ªám remaining recalcitrant, the protests escalated. The self-immolation of Buddhist monk Th√≠ch Qu·∫£ng ƒê·ª©c at a busy Saigon intersection was a public relations disaster for the Di·ªám regime, and as protests continued, the Army of the Republic of Vietnam Special Forces loyal to his brother Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Nhu, raided pagodas across the country on August 21, killing hundreds and causing extensive damage under the declaration of martial law. Universities and high schools were closed amid mass pro-Buddhist protests. In the meantime, the fight against the Viet Cong insurgency had begun to lose intensity as rumours spread of sectarian infighting among ARVN troops. This was compounded by coup plotting by various ARVN officers which distracted attention from fighting the insurgency. In the aftermath of the pagoda raids, the Kennedy administration sent Cable 243 to its embassy in Saigon, ordering it to explore alternative leadership possibilities. Authorization of mission thumb US President John F. Kennedy gave the following instructions to McNamara regarding the purpose of the mission: > I am asking you to go because of my desire to have the best possible on-the- > spot appraisal of the military and paramilitary effort to defeat the Viet > Cong. . . . The events in South Vietnam since May have now raised serious > questions both about the present prospects for success against the Viet Cong > and still more about the future effectiveness of this effort unless there > can be important political improvement in the country. It is in this context > that I now need your appraisal of the situation. If the prognosis in your > judgment is not hopeful, I would like your views on what action must be > taken by the South Vietnamese Government and what steps our Government > should take to lead the Vietnamese to that action. The US ambassador in Saigon, Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. reacted immediately to the proposed mission, pointing out to Kennedy that such a high level visit would require McNamara and Taylor to visit Di·ªám. Since the pagoda raids, the Americans had been snubbing Di·ªám to show their disapproval of the conduct of his family in recent times. A visit by senior military figures such as Taylor and McNamara would be construed by the Ngos as a return to normal business. Since Lodge had been deliberately pursuing a strategy of official aloofness, he wondered whether such a high level delegation was desirable. Lodge worried that Di·ªám would use the visit as a propaganda move to claim that it was a restoration of US support. Kennedy recommended a strategy aimed at encouraging rebel generals in the ARVN to act. The White House and the Saigon embassy were to publicly state that the visit did not signify approval of Di·ªám's policies. McNamara was to \\"speak some home truths\\" and emphasize that the administration was not \\"open to oriental divisive tactics\\" and that the advancement of the military campaign was the sole objective. In addition the missions was to coincide with the National Assembly elections on September 27. A visit during such a time could only be construed as an indication of the lack of importance that the United States attached to the poll. Kennedy insisted on the trip, so Lodge acquiesced, suggesting that the public press release state that Lodge had requested the visit. After an exchange of proposed phraseology, it was agreed that the release would say that Kennedy had decided to send the mission after consulting Lodge. Kennedy instructed Lodge to \\"clear the air\\" by convincing Di·ªám to make the \\"dramatic, symbolic move\\" of removing Nhu and refocusing the nation on the war effort. Objective The stated purpose of the trip was fourfold: #To appraise the war effort #To assess the impact on that effort of recent political developments #To recommend a course of action for the Government of Vietnam and for the US #To examine with Lodge ways of tailoring our aid to achieve our foreign policy objectives. In a statement to the media at Andrews Air Force Base just before leaving for Vietnam on September 23, McNamara said that the purpose of the trip was \\"to determine whether that military effort has been adversely affected by the unrest of the past several weeks\\". Privately, other White House officials contended that there were other reasons for the trip. Arthur Schlesinger and Assistant Secretary of State Roger Hilsman, contended that Kennedy sent McNamara and Taylor to Vietnam to convince them of the negative effect on the counterinsurgency that the protracted Buddhist crisis was having, and of the need to apply sanctions to the Di·ªám regime to bring about change. According to this hypothesis, Kennedy believed that he could not afford a major policy rift in the administration over the question of applying sanctions. He felt that this was particularly the case if any policy shift attracted the opposition of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and concluded that only McNamara, if convinced, could convert the US military. Whatever the real purpose of the trip, McNamara and Taylor's party left Washington on September 23 and returned ten days later after an exhausting trip and a comprehensive review of the situation on the ground. They were accompanied by National Security Adviser Michael Forrestal, the CIA's William Colby, William Bundy and William Sullivan from the State Department. An objective analysis of the situation in Vietnam was unlikely given the prejudice apparent on the journey to Vietnam. During the flight, Bundy and others received binders of materials, including a draft of the report that they were to prepare afterwards. Years after the mission, Forrestal asserted that the observations had already been \\"carefully spelled out, [with] all the statistics to back them up\\". He described it as a \\"dreadful visit\\" where the members attempt to accumulate \\"phony statistical\\" evidence of success. Expedition The timing of the mission was crucial due to the pessimistic military forecasts and the widespread rumours of an imminent coup. Di·ªám's Presidential military adviser D∆∞∆°ng VƒÉn Minh had recently informed Lodge that 80 percent of Vietnamese people had no motive for supporting Di·ªám and that the recent lifting of martial law was \\"eyewash for Americans\\". Despite his title, Minh had no command power and was confined to primarily ceremonial duties. Di·ªám feared that Minh had become too popular after his success in the Battle for Saigon against the criminal B√¨nh Xuy√™n and his campaigns to quell the private armies of the H√≤a H·∫£o and Cao ƒê√†i religious sects in the 1950s and had removed him from commanding troops. The two guardhouses outside Minh's headquarters at Tan Son Nhut Air Base were filled with political prisoners, many of them student protestors. Minh was widely believed to be seeking a coup against Di·ªám. He frequently railed against Di·ªám in his meeting with Lodge, decrying the police state that was being created by the C·∫ßn Lao Party of the Ng√¥ family. Harkins reported that Minh \\"has done nothing but complain to me about the government and the way it is handled since I have been here\\". Harkins also put scepticism onto Minh's claims of widespread public disenchantment. The differing views of the members of the U.S. mission about the progress of the war against the Viet Cong, and how it was affected by the Buddhist crisis were immediately manifested in the first session that McNamara and Taylor held in Saigon with embassy officials on September 25. General Paul D. Harkins and his MACV staff generally presented a favourable picture of military progress, emphasizing the progress of the Strategic Hamlet Program, and the improved ARVN position. This was in spite of a recent surge in communist initiated incidents and a decline in ARVN operation due to the increased number of troops used to quell dissidents. McNamara and Taylor prompted the presenters with questions in an attempt to get comparative indicators of the evolution of the situation over the last two years. McNamara in particular probed for details about the military situation in the Mekong Delta. American civilian officials sharply disagreed with the assessment of their military colleagues in their reading of the situation. Lodge and John Mecklin of the United States Information Service viewed things more grimly. Lodge stressed the more political and intangible aspects of the war and cast doubt on the \\"hardness\\" of the statistical data provided by the MACV. With the Mission's division of opinion exposed, McNamara left to tour the countryside. McNamara met for two hours with John H. Richardson, head of the CIA's mission in Saigon. Richardson argued that the situation was quickly deteriorating and stated that the country was engulfed in a \\"climate of suspicion.\\" Richardson felt that there was a Catch-22 situation in that there was nobody who commanded Di·ªám's respect yet Di·ªám's continual hold on power would ensure disaster. Richardson felt Di·ªám's loyalty to family was handicapping him. Richardson reported that many cabinet ministers had wanted to resign in the wake of the pagoda raids but were afraid of being jailed or unwilling to go into exile. McNamara's itinerary took him throughout the country, interviewing Americans and Vietnamese at both headquarters and in the field. In Saigon, during the last few days of the trip, he was given extensive briefings by the civilian side of the mission and, since he stayed at Lodge's residence, McNamara had ample opportunity for discussions with the Ambassador. McNamara was shown first hand accounts of negative diagnoses of the military progress which contradicted the optimistic statements that he had been accustomed to giving. At one point during a military inspection tour, he visited a government \\"open arms\\" camp near Tam K·ª≥. He pointed to a weapon from a pile of arms captured from Viet Cong insurgents and triumphantly asked \\"Is this Chinese?\\" only to be told by his embarrassed Vietnamese guide that it was an American rifle which had been earlier captured by the communists. Following a briefing from senior army officers which glossed over the capture of two towns in An Xuy√™n Province by the communists, Taylor and McNamara asked a major stationed at C·∫ßn Th∆° to assess the situation. The young officer did not toe the line of his senior officers and gave a detailed and gloomy account of the situation before encouraging his colleagues to comment. According to Forrestal, \\"all hell broke loose.\\" By the end of the trip, Bundy conceded that the evidence was eye opening, commenting that \\"I was left, as I think McNamara was, with a lasting skepticism of the ability of any man, however honest, to interpret accurately what was going on.\\" Negative reports continued to reach the American delegation through a variety of Vietnamese civilian figures. A group of university professors complained to McNamara that Di·ªám had transformed the country into a police state with widespread use of torture. They asserted that this had prompted people to turn to the Viet Cong. The mission was also informed by the French embassy and the Canadian and Indian members of the International Control Commission that was charged with enforcing the Geneva Accords that Nhu was pursuing a peace agreement with North Vietnam and that an agreement would be reached in the next three or four months. =Meeting with Di·ªám= President Ng√¥ ƒê√¨nh Di·ªám of South Vietnam On September 29, McNamara, Taylor, Harkins, and Lodge visited Di·ªám, having decided against delivering a bluntly worded letter from Kennedy. Di·ªám was accompanied by his Secretary of State Nguy·ªÖn ƒê√¨nh Thu·∫≠n. Di·ªám spoke passionately in defense of his government and chain smoked as he walked around the room pointing to maps. After a two-hour monologue by Di·ªám, McNamara was finally able to speak. He stressed American concerns that political unrest was undermining anti-Viet Cong military operations. McNamara emphasized the difficulties being caused by anti-Buddhist repressions were creating for Kennedy's support of South Vietnam due to the arousal of negative public opinion against Di·ªám. He pointed out that Di·ªám's foreign minister V≈© VƒÉn M·∫´u and his ambassador in Washington Tr·∫ßn VƒÉn Ch∆∞∆°ng had resigned, and that Saigon University was closed. McNamara fell short of asking Di·ªám to remove the Nhus; this was a matter Washington had left to his and Lodge's discretion. McNamara went on to say that Washington did not see value in supporting a government which could not command the confidence of its citizens, but his comments seemed to have little impact on Di·ªám. Di·ªám cut off McNamara and asserted that \\"Vietnam will be a model democracy\\" in a few years time. He asserted that this had been facilitated by the Strategic Hamlet Program and was shown in the high turnout in the recent legislative elections. Lodge became irritated at this point and derisively pointed out that Di·ªám's legislators had achieved increased votes because ARVN troops had been bussed around to vote multiple times at various polling booths. Di·ªám himself had risen to power in a fraudulent referendum supervised by Nhu in which he was credited with 133% of the vote in Saigon. The awkward silence was broken when McNamara raised the issue of Madame Nhu. Di·ªám was a bachelor so Madame Nhu was the de facto First Lady, living in the palace. Dubbed the Dragon Lady due to her acerbic nature, she had a long history of anti-American remarks. McNamara complained about her \\"ill-advised and unfortunate declarations\\". He removed a newspaper clipping from his pocket in which she was quoted as calling some US officers as \\"acting like little soldiers of fortune\\" which she claimed had caused the Americans to pursue a \\"confused policy\\". McNamara said that such comment hurt the bilateral relationship and that the American public would be less generous in sending their officers to support the anti-communist counterinsurgency. One of the Americans lost his composure and asked Di·ªám whether \\"there was not something the government could do to shut her up.\\" Di·ªám appeared to be shocked and demoralised by the stinging question. Lodge pointedly claimed that Madame Chiang Kai-shek had been pivotal in the defeat of the Chinese Nationalists by the communists of Mao Zedong in 1949 and alluded that Madame Nhu could have a similar effect. Di·ªám dismissed this and said that US policy was being undermined by failures in analysis of the situation that he claimed were fuelled by distorted attacks by American journalists in Saigon. He asserted that Madame Nhu's membership in the National Assembly as a citizen of a \\"free country\\" allowed her to express her sentiments, alleging that \\"one cannot deny a lady the right to defend herself when she has been unjustly attacked.\\" Di·ªám went on to make sensational claims against the Buddhist majority that had his visitors taken aback. He asserted that his kindness towards Buddhists had helped to cause the civil unrest by encouraging them to seek what he felt were special rights. He claimed that the number of Buddhist pagodas in the country had doubled during his rule and said that it was due to his government's funding. For twenty minutes he repeatedly charged the Buddhists of partaking in orgies in the pagodas on a regular basis, without offering proof. He then alleged that \\"some American services in Saigon\\" were plotting against him. Taylor later noted that Di·ªám had not realised the seriousness of the meeting and the warnings of the American delegation, recalling that \\"You could just see it bouncing off him.\\" Di·ªám asked Taylor for his appraisal of the war, and after being approved by McNamara, a long letter from the general was delivered to Di·ªám on October 2. The letter outlined the major military problems in the Delta, warned of the danger that the Buddhist crisis posed to the war effort, and listed many of the specific steps needed to improve the military effort that later appeared in the report presented to Kennedy. The letter summarised with a terse, tough statement of the American view: =Coup speculation= The mission took a diversion into investigating a possible coup by ARVN officers when General D∆∞∆°ng VƒÉn Minh expressed an interest in meeting McNamara and Taylor, either alone or together. After an extensive series of discretionary arrangements were made, Taylor joined Minh in a game of doubles on the tennis court of the Saigon Officers Club. McNamara watched on as Taylor played with Minh, waiting anxiously for any signals from Minh to \\"broad hints of our interest in other subjects which we gave him during breaks in the game\\". Minh revealed nothing of his thoughts about a possible coup, leaving his guest bewildered to his intentions in inviting them. McNamara later grumbled to Kennedy that \\"I sat on a sideline two feet from Big Minh for over an hour and I couldn't get a damn thing out of him.\\" Taylor got one of the tennis players, Colonel Raymond Jones, to contact Minh about the situation, to which Minh replied with a complaint about a perceived lack of support from Washington for a coup. Minh claimed that he thought McNamara and Taylor were seeking nothing but a match of tennis and offered to discuss military affairs at any time. =Meeting with civilian officials= On September 30, Taylor and McNamara's last day in Vietnam, together with Lodge, the trio met with South Vietnamese Vice President Nguy·ªÖn Ng·ªçc Th∆°. Tho thanked the US for its continued support and response to the recommendations outlined in a report by Taylor prepared in 1961. However, he asserted that the Americans had failed in recent times in using their strength and influence to prevent the political deterioration in South Vietnam. Tho did not offer any methods to rectify this and went on to sharply question the success of the Strategic Hamlet Program. Tho said that increased Viet Cong strength had to be attributed to widespread rural discontent with the Di·ªám regime. According to the Pentagon Papers \\"these views, from the man most often mentioned in U.S. circles as an alternative to Di·ªám, coming at the end of the visit as they did, must have had an important influence on McNamara's conclusions.\\" The delegation left Saigon to return to Washington at the end of the day. =Meetings with Lodge= During the briefings that Lodge made to McNamara and Taylor, the ambassador repeated his previously expressed doubts about the potential effectiveness of aid suspension as a lever against Di·ªám. He also expressed his concern that the foreign aid bill that was being tabled in US Congress could be halted due to negative sentiment over Di·ªám's repressions of the Buddhists. During the visit, Lodge reiterated in his cables to Washington that he felt that an aid suspension could backfire on the United States by alienating the population as well as the regime. Aware that an aid suspension was a potential recommendation of the mission's report, the USAID director Brent also openly expressed his concerns over such move. Both opinions were regarded as important because McNamara and Taylor had been specifically charged by the Kennedy with examining ways to make American aid better facilitate US foreign policy goals objectives. Lodge and Brent tabled papers which included a program-by-program consideration of the impact of an aid suspension. Drafting the report After a one-day stopover in Honolulu to prepare their report, McNamara and Taylor arrived back in Washington on October 2. The report was written hurriedly on the plane trip back to Washington. Forrestal described the report as a \\"mishmash of everything.\\" During the 27-hour flight, Bundy managed only to get two hours of sleep between his writing and later opined that \\"neither their draftsmanship nor judgment is likely to be at its best under such working conditions. They promptly met with the President and the National Security Council. Their report concluded that the \\"military campaign has made great progress and continues to progress.\\" On the other hand, it warned that the serious political tensions in Saigon due to the Buddhist crisis and the increasing unpopularity of Di·ªám and Nhu as a result of their anti-Buddhist activities could stoke the dissent of some ARVN officers and erode what they believed was favourable military progress. Taylor and Maxwell reported to having seen no evidence of a successful coup being prepared, and felt that American pressure would probably only further harden the Ng√¥ family's attitudes. Nevertheless, \\"unless such pressures are exerted, they [Di·ªám-Nhu] are almost certain to continue past patterns of behavior.\\" Recommendations The military recommendations of the report were that General Harkins should review the military effort with Di·ªám with an eye toward its successful conclusion in I, II, and III Corps by the end of 1964 and in the IV Corps in the Mekong Delta by the end of 1965. This would necessitate: #A shift in military emphasis and strength to the Mekong Delta #An increase in the intensity of military activity throughout the country #An emphasis on \\"clear and hold operations\\" #A consolidation of the Strategic Hamlet Program with the emphasis on security; #The fleshing out of combat units and better training and arms for the hamlet militia. The report further proposed that an announcement be made of the planned withdrawal of 1,000 American troops by the end of 1963 in connection with a program to train Vietnamese to replace Americans in all \\"essential functions\\" by 1965. It noted mild progress in the war but saw little wisdom in maintaining the present level of US forces. The report concluded that the ARVN must focus on \\"clear and hold operations\\" rather than broad sweeps and that an improvement in Vietnamese performance would permit \\"the bulk of US personnel\\" to withdraw by the end of 1965. The report set out three alternative policies: reconciliation with the Di·ªám regime, \\"selective pressures\\" and active promotion of a coup. The second option was the one which the report concluded was the best option. Reconciliation would signify approval of Di·ªám's repressive policies and alienate the ARVN, while initiating a coup was inadvisable \\"at the present time\\" in light of the apparent lack of willingness of the ARVN to act. Thus, the report concluded that the only choice was a program of \\"selective short- term pressures\\" that were economic and were conditioned to improving the performance of the regime. In order to exert political pressure on the Di·ªám regime to end its repressive anti-Buddhist policies, the McNamara Taylor report recommended the following measures: #Continued withholding of funds in the Commercial Import Program, but without a public formal announcement #Suspension of approval of AID loans for the Saigon-Cholon Waterworks and the Saigon Electric Power Project #Suspension of support for Colonel L√™ Quang Tung's Army of the Republic of Vietnam Special Forces unless they were transferred to the field under the command of Joint General Staff instead of being used for repressing political dissidents under the direct control of Nhu #Maintenance of purely \\"correct\\" relations between Lodge and Di·ªám. Harkins, on the other hand, was to continue meeting Di·ªám at Gia Long Palace The report called for scrutiny of the effectiveness of the sanctions, hinting that alternative leadership would have to be explored in the event that Di·ªám did not improve his performance: > the situation must be closely watched to see what steps Di·ªám is taking to > reduce repressive practices and to improve the effectiveness of the military > effort. We should set no fixed criteria, but recognize that we would have to > decide in 2-4 months, whether to move to more drastic action or try to carry > on with Di·ªám even if he had not taken significant steps. The report recommended against active American encouragement of a coup, but it recommended seeking \\"urgently to identify and build contacts with an alternative leadership if and when it appears\\". It opined that a successful coup appeared to be unlikely, although the assassination of Di·ªám or Nhu was possible. Forrestal also noted that the proposed suspension of the USD 200,000 monthly salary for the Special Forces would encourage a coup, saying \\"It was the first sign the generals had . . . that maybe the United States was serious about this\\". According to the Pentagon Papers, the report was a \\"curiously contradictory document\\". The report was regarded as a compromise between General Taylor and Harkins' optimistic view of the military, McNamara's increasing conviction of the gravity of the political crisis and its potential to derail the anti-communist war effort. The recommendations for aid suspensions and the announcement of US troop withdrawals were designed as measures that would foster doubt within the Di·ªám regime about American intentions and incentives for policy changes. The fact that such sanctions would be seen by the ARVN generals as a signal of American willingness to accept alternative leadership, in other words, a coup, was not recognized in the recommendation, since the report specifically ruled out American encouragement of \\"a change of government\\". This was a notable oversight in view of the ARVN generals' clear statement in August that they regarded an aid suspension as a green light for a coup. Implementation The recommendations of the McNamara‚ÄìTaylor mission were swiftly approved at the NSC meeting on October 2, and later in the day, McNamara made the Presidentially approved media statement that included the announcement of the 1,000 man troop withdrawal by year's end. The press release reiterated America's commitment to the struggle against the Viet Cong insurgency in South Vietnam, stated the progress of the war, announced the troop withdrawal, and dissociated the Kennedy administration from Di·ªám's anti-Buddhist activities. It avoided any reference to economic aid suspensions or other sanctions against the regime, thereby allowing the Ng√¥ family to change policy without a public loss of face. On October 5, Kennedy approved the military recommendations of the McNamara-Taylor report, but \\"directed that no formal announcement be made of the implementation of plans to withdraw 1,000 U.S. military personnel by the end of 1963\\". The details of how the new policy would be applied were detailed in a lengthy cable to Lodge after this meeting. The objective of the new course of action was described at the beginning: > Actions are designed to indicate to Di·ªám Government our displeasure at its > political policies and activities and to create significant uncertainty in > that government and in key Vietnamese groups as to future intentions of > United States. At same time, actions are designed to have at most slight > impact on military or counterinsurgency effort against Viet Cong, at least > in short term. > The recommendations on negotiations are concerned with what U.S. is after, > i.e., GVN action to increase effectiveness of its military effort; to ensure > popular support to win war; and to eliminate strains on U.S. Government and > public confidence. The negotiating posture is designed not to lay down > specific hard and fast demands or to set a deadline, but to produce movement > in Vietnamese Government along these lines.

As a result, it noted that when the negative effects begin to manifest itself that \\". . . further major decisions will be required\\". The specific actions to be implemented as a result of the report included: #Suspension of the Commodity Import Program without public declaration #Selective suspension of PL 480, on an individual and sometimes monthly basis after referral to Washington for review #Suspension of the loans for the Saigon-Cholon Waterworks (USD 9m) and the Saigon Electric Power Project (USD 4m) #Private notification to Saigon that funding of Colonel Tung's Special Forces would be conditional on their commitment to field operations under the command of the Joint General Staff control, again without public announcement. Lodge was instructed to maintain a strategy of \\"cool correctness in order to make Di·ªám come to you\\", but to be ready to re- establish contact with Gia Long Palace if this strategy did not work. Lodge was specifically told to seek improvements in the ARVN military effort, domestic reforms by Di·ªám that would restore public belief in the South Vietnamese administration and its image. As a result of the mission and the preceding Krulak Mendenhall mission, the Kennedy administration made a decision that was described in the Pentagon Papers as \\"a far-reaching decision on American policy toward South Vietnam\\".

ORM is a broadly used term that encompasses elements of organizational structure, management strategy and information technology infrastructure.  Origin  Outsourcing gained prominence as a business strategy in the early to mid-1980s, and was originally driven by the desire to reduce costs in labor-intensive business processes. Outsourcing relationship management appeared as a specific management discipline in 1999 after an industry consortium, the Sourcing Interests Group, began developing guidelines for its member companies. Following this introduction, the theories of outsourcing relationship management have been developed by numerous global industry groups, universities, consulting/advisory firms and software companies.  ORM in the enterprise  * Enterprise Business Relationships, including ORM ORM is complementary to other established enterprise management strategies in its relationship to established enterprise resource planning (ERP) tools and the linkage to important business constituents. *Supply chain management and procurement systems linking to suppliers, *Human resource management and payroll management systems linking to employees, *Customer relationship management and sales force automation linking to customers, and *Outsourcing relationship management linking to external service providers In his 2004 book \\"The Outsourcing Revolution\\", author Michael Corbett discusses the challenges of integrating two separate business entities (the client and the external service provider) across the different organizational boundaries and differing motivations and objectives. More recently, Gartner has launched an outsourcing specialty which has conducted research in this area. In a 2006 study, IBM identified business model innovation as the most important success factor cited by the 765 global CEOs surveyed. The survey noted that \\"fully 65 percent of chief executives and other leaders say they will have to make fundamental changes in their businesses over the next two years. New products and services remain a priority, but they‚Äôre placing increasing emphasis on differentiating themselves through innovation in the basics of their business models. They believe that external collaboration across their business ecosystems will yield a multitude of innovative ideas.\\" There are three aspects of ORM which companies typically pursue as part of their outsourcing strategy: * Management Strategy - determining the most appropriate combination of contractual terms (service level agreement) and relationship management techniques * Organizational Structure - building the appropriate in-house management/oversight structure and mechanisms * IT Infrastructure - the supporting infrastructure to enable the monitoring and management of a network of external service providers =Management strategy= A 2002 Computerworld article documented the need for managers skilled in ORM for managing IT outsourcing. A 2007 article in DM Review pointed out that there was still a need for specialized outsourcing relationship managers and cited this as a career opportunity. Carnegie Mellon University developed a Sourcing Capability Model to measure the maturity and skills required for effective outsourcing relationship management. The University of Michigan sponsors research and events focused on the challenges and management strategies for successful outsourcing. In early 2007, a CIO Magazine article explores this trend. One study by Vantage Partners (Boston, MA) found that at least 15 percent of the total outsourcing contract value is at stake if outsourcing governance is not managed well. In the book, \\"Multisourcing,\\" Gartner analysts point out that successful outsourcing is built on \\"a network of relationships, not transactions,\\" and outsourcing governance is the most important factor in determining the success of an outsourcing engagement. Gartner found that fewer than 30 percent of enterprises have formal sourcing strategies and appropriate outsourcing governance mechanisms in place. In a 2004 survey of 130 CIOs, 42 percent said they were dissatisfied with their outsourcing relationships, according to outsourcing advisory company EquaTerra, primarily due to poorly developed, underbudgeted and undersourced governance models.

The market was designed by the Borough Surveyor, William Harpur, and opened in May 1891. A farmers' market is known to have existed at the site since the 18th century. The market consists of two shopping levels, a ground floor and a balcony level which wraps around the market exterior walls on the interior.

Desert Plants. 4(1-4): 145‚Äì155. spiny, perennial, soft wooded shrub, native to the deserts of the southwestern United States.Mojave Desert Wildflowers, Pam MacKay, p18, 252Canyon Country Wildflowers, Damian Fagan, p 3, 105 It is called blackbrush because the gray branches darken when wet by rains. It is in the rose family (Rosaceae), and is the only species in the monotypic genus Coleogyne. Growth pattern It has dense, intricate branches (\\"ramosissima\\" means \\"many branched\\"). Its dense branches form spiny tips. This plant forms vast pure stands across the desert floor and on scrubby slopes, giving the landscape a uniform dark-gray color. Vegetative types in which it dominates or is a codominate are called blackbrush scrub. It drops most of its leaves and becomes dormant in conditions of severe dryness (drought-deciduous), but some leaves are usually retained at the end of the branches. The thickly branched plant forms thickets which may spread across the ground in clumps or grow erect to approach six feet in height in the Mojave Desert, and 4 feet in the Canyonlands desert region. Flowers Flowers have 4 yellowish sepals, many yellow stamens, and may have 4 or no petals. It is atypical of members of the rose family in that the flowers have no petals, have four rather than five sepals, and the leaves are opposite (occur in pairs on the twig), rather than alternate (occurring one at a time going up the twig.California Desert Flowers, Sia Morehardt, Emil Morehardt, p 232, 264 The sepals may persist on the plant. It flowers between April and July. Leaves The leaves are inversely lanceolate, up to 3/8\\" long, have a small point at the tip, and are arranged in opposite pairs along the stem, which is uncommon in members of the rose family. It forms vast communities in the Canyonlands region, and in the Mojave Desert. Flowering is triggered by a heavy spring rain in this desert-adapted species. The leathery flowers grow at the ends of small stems. They are encased in thick, fuzzy sepals which are yellow inside and reddish or orange on the outer surface. There are no petals, but the sepals remain after the flower opens, surrounding the patch of whiskery stamens and the central pistil. The fruit is an achene a few millimeters long. The plant reproduces from seed, but very rarely. The seeds do not disperse well and seedlings do not survive in large numbers. A narrow range of temperature and moisture is required for the reproduction of this species, so it is sporadic, but the plants are hardy and long-lived.

Biography  = Origins and education = James Henry Higgins was born on January 22, 1876 in the village of Saylesville in Lincoln, Rhode Island. His parents, Thomas F. and Elizabeth Ann Mather died while he was young. James attended Pawtucket High School, and put himself through Brown University, earning a Bachelor of Arts in 1898. He studied law at Georgetown University Law Center and graduated in 1900, before returning to Rhode Island. = Political career = In 1901, Higgins was elected to the Rhode Island General Assembly, representing Pawtucket. The next year, at the age of 26, he was elected to the first of four consecutive terms as mayor of Pawtucket.  1906 gubernatorial campaign  In 1906, Higgins was nominated as the Democratic candidate for Governor of Rhode Island, challenging incumbent Republican Governor George H. Utter. The New York Times attributed the popularity of the \\"boy Mayor of Pawtucket\\" to \\"his personality and private character. He does not drink or smoke.\\" His acceptance speech echoed the Democratic convention platform, attacking corruption and the \\"boss system\\" of government, pledging an eight-hour workday for state and municipal workers, and endorsing the election of Rhode Island's United States Senators by direct vote. (Popular election of U.S. Senators eventually came to pass through the ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1914.) Higgins' candidacy was endorsed by Colonel Robert Hale Ives Goddard and the short-lived Lincoln Party, which had been organized around Goddard's bid to succeed George P. Wetmore in the U.S. Senate and \\"smash the state machine\\". After a campaign which seized on public discontent with the influence of lobbyist and Rhode Island Republican Party Central Committee chairman, General Charles R. Brayton, Higgins was elected over Utter by a margin of 1,238 votes, becoming Rhode Island's youngest governor, and its first Catholic governor.  Governor of Rhode Island  Higgins was sworn into office on January 3, 1907. In his inaugural speech, he built upon the themes of his campaign, warning that \\"the evils of lobbying\\" had compromised the state government to \\"a disgraceful extent,\\" and that the power of lobbying had become \\"an exclusive and oppressive monopoly\\" in the hand of Brayton, a \\"coarse and venal boss\\" who was operating out of the Rhode Island State House offices of High Sheriff of Providence County, General Hunter C. White. Higgins' attacks on \\"Braytonism\\" were echoed in The New York Times, which in February published an article on \\"Rhode Island's Despot,\\" alleging that \\"for forty years Brayton's control over the General Assembly, and consequently over all legislation, has been practically absolute\\". In March 1907, Higgins wrote an open letter about Brayton to White: \\"Year in and year out he has occupied and used your office for his vile purposes, with your knowledge and consent ... clean this moral and political pest out of your office.\\" White took no action, but in July Brayton resigned from the Executive Committee of the State Central Committee of the Republican Party. In November 1907, Higgins won a second one-year term over a challenge by Republican Lieutenant Governor of Rhode Island, Frederick H. Jackson. Higgins declined to seek a third term as governor. = Later life = In November, 1908, Higgins married Ellen F. Maguire of Pawtucket. In 1912, he ran unsuccessfully as a Democratic candidate in the United States Senate election in Rhode Island. Higgins died September 16, 1927. He is buried at St. Mary's Cemetery in Pawtucket, Rhode Island.

Early life Oelrichs was born on June 8, 1850 in Baltimore, Maryland. He was the son of German-born Henry Ferdinand Oelrichs (1810‚Äì1875), a senior partner in the firm of Oelrichs & Lurman, and Julia Matilda (n√©e May) Oelrichs (1819‚Äì1879), who was born in Washington, DC. His siblings included Charles May Oelrichs and Henry Oelrichs. Oelrichs was the grandson of Gesche Catharina (n√©e Holler) Oelrichs and Johann Gerhard Oelrichs, a German merchant in Bremen. The Oelrichs came to America from Bremen around 1830. His grandfather later married a daughter of statesman Harrison Gray Otis. His maternal grandparents were Julia Matilda (n√©e Slacum) May and Frederick May, who was a member of the May family, prominent in Virginia and Maryland during the American Revolutionary War. He graduated from Yale University, where he was on the rowing team. Career The Oelrich's Newport estate, Rosecliff. His firm, Oelrichs & Co., became the U.S. agent of the Norddeutsche Lloyd (\\"North German\\") shipping company. Oelrichs was also a member of the Democratic Party and active in New York City politics, even declining to run for Mayor of New York City, before moving to San Francisco, California. The Oelrichses played a role in the rebuilding of San Francisco following the 1906 earthquake as part of the Committee of Fifty. In the 1890s, the Oelrich's purchased Rose Cliff on Bellevue Avenue in Newport, Rhode Island from the estate of George Bancroft and his wife commissioned architect Stanford White to build them a new residence. The resulting Rosecliff was modeled after the Grand Trianon at Versailles, and was completed in 1902 with a final cost of $2.5 million. Personal life In 1889, the almost forty year old Oelrichs met Theresa Alice Fair (\\"Tessie\\"), daughter of United States Senator and Comstock Lode millionaire James Graham Fair, while playing tennis at the Newport Casino. They married a year later in 1890. Her younger sister Birdie was married to William K. Vanderbilt II, son of Alva and William K. Vanderbilt and brother of Consuelo Vanderbilt, Duchess of Marlborough, in a wedding that was extensively covered in the society pages. In New York, they lived at 1 East 57th Street in \\"the big house at the northeast corner of Fifth Avenue and Fifth-seventh Street,\\" which was later occupied by the New York Trust Company. Together, they were the parents of one child: * Hermann Oelrichs Jr. (1891‚Äì1948), who married Dorothy Haydel (1893‚Äì1961) in 1925. After his death, she married Prince Ferdinand von Liechtenstein (1901‚Äì1981) in 1950. He served as a lieutenant (junior grade) in the U.S. Navy during the First World War. Oelrichs died on September 1, 1906 aboard SS Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse while sailing across the Atlantic Ocean. After his body was returned to the United States, his remains were interred in Woodlawn Cemetery in New York City. He left his full estate to his brother Charles May Oelrichs, thinking that Tessie would be content with her own fortune, but Tessie contested the will. Eventually, they settled the dispute and she received half of the estate.Gavan, Terrence. The Barons of Newport: A Guide to the Gilded Age. Newport: Pineapple Publications, 1998.

De Mayr√©na was born in Toulon. He fled Paris for Java in June 1883, fearing prosecution for embezzlement. The next year, he was expelled from the Dutch East Indies. He returned to Paris and organized an arms shipment to Aceh. While returning to the East Indies, he stopped in Vietnam and started a plantation. In 1888, the King of Siam began claiming territory west of French territory. Anxious, the Governor-General of French Indochina agreed to a proposal from Mayr√©na to lead an expedition into the interior in order to negotiate treaties with the local tribespeople. Once there however, he convinced some tribal chiefs to form a new Kingdom of Sedang with himself as king. Mayr√©na, his supporters and some tribespeople claimed that the tribes were not vassals of the Annamese (Vietnamese) emperor and therefore could form their own kingdom. The Kingdom of Sedang was founded when Mayr√©na was elected King by the chiefs of the Bahnar, Rengao, and Sedang tribes in the village of Kon Gung on June 3, 1888. He then assumed the style and title Marie the First, King of Sedang.The Imperial Collection - The Kingdom of the Sedang  Reign  King Marie declared Roman Catholicism to be the official tribal religion. However, he did not try to force the conversion of his subjects, most of whom were Muslims; instead, he announced his own adoption of Islam. He designed a national flag Sedang Kingdom (Vietnam) and an honorary insignia‚Äîthe Order of Marie the First‚Äîwhich he had cast by goldsmiths in Hong Kong. He also sought to obtain official diplomatic recognition of his kingdom, and offered to cede his kingdom to France in exchange for monopoly rights, and hinted that the Prussians were interested if the French were not. When the French government became chilly, Mayr√©na approached the English at Hong Kong in 1889. When he was rebuffed there, Mayr√©na went to Belgium. In 1889, a Belgian financier named Somsy offered arms and money to Mayr√©na in exchange for mineral rights. However, the French Navy blockaded Vietnamese ports to prevent his return, and his arms were seized as contraband at Singapore. Mayr√©na retired to British Malaya.Footnotes to History- S There, on November 11, 1890, Marie I died under mysterious circumstances (various reports claim by poisoning, snakebite or as the result of a duel) at Tioman Island. The Kingdom of the Sedang was subsequently conquered by the French Republic and her protectorate, Annam, without the consent of the government or people of Sedang.The Kingdom of Sedang  Legacy  French writer and statesman Andr√© Malraux wrote an unpublished novel about Mayr√©na while Malraux' friend and character in La Condition Humaine, Baron de Clappique, wrote a movie script about him.Cf. Andr√© Malraux, Antim√©moires (Paris: Gallimand 1967), translated as Anti- Memoirs (New York: Holt Rinehart Winston 1968), chapter \\"The Royal Way\\" at pp. 253-322. Therein Malraux discusses Mayr√©na (pp. 258--259). Malraux also references his novel (p. 255) La Voie royale (Paris: Bernard Grasset 1930), whose character Perken was said to be somewhat based on Mayr√©na (p. 321). Most of Malraux's chapter loosely narrates Clappique's film script The Devil's Kingdom [English title] about Mayr√©na through Clappique's voice (pp. 259-320).

(2005) Mobile Entertainment: Review and Redefine. Paper published in IEEE 4th International Conference on Mobile Business, July 11‚Äì13, Sydney, Australia Wong and Hiew examine multiple perspectives from various players of the value web as well as researchers to bridge the gaps found in various definitions in order to reach a common understanding. The authors consider the following as key considerations in determining whether a mobile service falls under mobile entertainment category: a form of leisure activity, interaction with service providers, utilization of wireless telecommunication networks, and transaction which incur a cost upon usage. To understand mobile entertainment, three different segments are suggested in the following figure. Each segment suggests a specific set of theories. It is implicit throughout the study that mobile entertainment is any type of leisure activity on the move. Segment 1 consists of intersection between mobile commerce and mobile entertainment, sitting on top of wireless telecommunication networks. In other words, mobile entertainment services in segment 1 must be a subset of mobile commerce, which involves exchanges of monetary value and interaction with service providers. Segment 2 covers mobile entertainment services which utilize wireless telecommunication networks, but do not incur a cost upon usage and do not interact with service providers. For example, one may play multiplayer mobile games with friends via Bluetooth. Segment 3 involves mobile entertainment which does not require wireless connection and transaction of an economic value. For example, one may play preinstalled single player games on a handheld device such as a mobile phone.  Transmission of mobile entertainment  Mobile entertainment via SMS has expanded rapidly in Europe and Asia and it is still the main technology-bearer to send mobile entertainment messages to consumers. Because SMS is the main messaging technology used by young people, it is still the most effective way of reaching this target market. SMS is also ubiquitous, reaching a wider audience than any other technology available in the mobile space (MMS, bluetooth, mobile e-mail or WAP). More important than anything else, SMS is extremely easy to use, what makes adoption increase day by day. What enhances the consumer confidence in using SMS for mobile entertainment applications is the reliability of the service. This means, if a consumer has ordered a new wallpaper or ringtone, this has to work properly, in a speedy and reliable way. Therefore, it is important to choose the right SMS gateway provider in order to ensure quality-of-service along the whole path of the entertainment SMS until reaching the consumer's mobile.  Scenarios  A mobile user connects to the Internet via his WAP-enabled mobile phone, searches for a particular ringtone and downloads it onto his mobile phone. This falls under Segment 1 where this activity utilizes wireless telecommunication networks, incurs a cost upon file download, interacts with the service provider and is a form of leisure activity. If he transfers the ringtone to his friend via Bluetooth or infrared, this falls under Segment 2 where such activity still utilizes the wireless network yet does not incur a cost upon file transfer or involves any interaction with service providers. However, if he composes a ring tone (provided if the mobile device supports composing ring tone) and sets it as default ringtone, such activity is still considered as mobile entertainment but it does not utilize the wireless network or incur a cost upon usage. Therefore, this activity falls under Segment 3. Hence, in this scenario, the players in the value web differ in all three scenarios. The definitions for all three cases vary as well. Hence, the model in the above- mentioned framework aids the industries to determine the appropriate business model to adopt in order to target the right audience.

It was first demo-ed at the Leipzig Games Convention in August 2007 and was afterwards in a so-called Prologue phase which objectives were similar to a beta testing. It was downloadable and playable free of charge, although one could spend money on optional items in the title. In April 2016 the game was shut down permanently. Gameplay Empire of Sports combined role-play and competitive sports games in a persistent world. The player controlled a single character, or avatar, which they played with through the game. This was capable of increasing in ability with playing. The following sports were available for competitive play (friendly and official mode): football, tennis, skiing, basketball, bobsleigh and track & field. There were also a series of training/fitness games. There were plans for this list to be expanded post- launch. Players were able to compete against AI (artificial intelligence) controlled characters or other players. For team sports they could team up with AI or other players as well. Players were able to form their own teams and clubs, and tournaments and competitions were organized. Critical reception Eurogamer examined the Empire of Sports preview and found it prone to bugs, with a sluggish interface and unfinished NPCs and shops. However, the sports events themselves were considered slick and playable.

Description The device connected to the expansion bus on the ZX Spectrum. The ZX Spectrum ran software that was used to program rhythm patterns, and chain these into songs. Patterns and songs could then be loaded and saved onto cassette tape. The SpecDrum was an 8-voice machine (i.e. it allowed the user to load 8 different percussion samples). However it only had 3 output channels (i.e. maximum polyphony of 3 samples at a time) - the first channel could trigger the 'bass drum' voice, the second channel was used for the three snare/tom voices, and the third channel for the remaining four samples. The standard kit consisted of bass drum, snare drum, mid and low tomtoms, cowbell, hi-hat open and closed and hand claps. The sound has been compared to that of a LinnDrum.Music Thing: The ZX Spectrum SpecDrum module Cheetah also sold 'electro', 'afro' and 'Latin' kits on cassette, which could be loaded into the ZX Spectrum in place of the standard one. In addition, software was available enabling the user to sample and build their own custom kits. The SpecDrum could also, in principle, be synchronized to other musical equipment, using a sync pulse sent and received from the ZX Spectrum's \\"ear\\" and \\"mic\\" audio input/output sockets.Crash 27: Specdrum Artists who have used it includes Nigel Powell who used for a 1987 demo with The Illiterate Hands that also featured Jonny Greenwood (of Radiohead) on keyboards and harmonica and vocals by Andy Yorke (of Unbelievable Truth).On A Friday - The Demos The SpecDrum was followed by the Cheetah MD8, which did not require a separate computer.

The family moved to Ramat Gan when he was four years old. Both he and his twin brother, Jonathan (Yoni) Gerstein, showed artistic talent from an early age. David's teacher, Batya Uziel, encouraged him to study painting. At the age of thirteen he was sent to a camp for the arts in Jerusalem, which he attended for several summers in a row. In high school, he took classes at the Beit Zvi Art Center in Ramat Gan with Rina Balktovsky Arnon. During his military service in the paratroopers he was stationed at Ein Gev for one year, where he painted a series of oils of fishing docks, boats and kibbutz landscape. While there, he met the artist Aharon Giladi, who encouraged him to pursue art. Upon completion of his military service, David applied to the Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design, Jerusalem, where he met Avraham Ofek, who had a marked influence on Gerstein's style. Art career Baby Twins, depicting Gerstein and his brother In the mid-1960s, Gerstein left Bezalel and enrolled at the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris,Yona Fisher, Balconies, Domino Pub., 1984, p.3 where he studied under Chaplain Midy. After two years in Paris, he moved to New York and attended classes of the Art Students League, where he learned portrait painting and printmaking. Gerstein returned to Israel at the age of twenty six and began teaching at Bezalel. At first, he taught drawing and then became a faculty member of the Department of Jewelry Design, which was then undergoing a process of renewal under the direction of Aryeh Ophir; evolving from the outmoded, tradition style of \\"Bezalel\\" to introducing innovative concepts influenced by modern art. Due to his background in the fine arts, as opposed to jewelry design, Gerstein was responsible for closing the gap between jewelry design and the world of modern art. He exposed his students to contemporary movements, such as Danish design, expressionism, conceptual art, minimalism, and other forms.Naomi Aviv, David Gerstein Sculptures, Catalogue, Rosenfeld Gallery, pub., 1997 He wanted jewelry design to be considered in the same light as contemporary art, no less inferior for being decorative; equal to other forms of art. Years later, Gerstein remarked that his involvement in teaching in the department influenced his transition from painting to sculpture. In 1973‚Äì1974 Gerstein earned an M.A. in graphic arts at Saint Martin's School of Art in London. Having learned lithograph and silkscreen printing in that framework, he sought to combine the two media, which had not as yet been integrated. Upon completing his studies he was awarded first prize and two awards for excellence in an end of year competition at St. Martin's. Gerstein returned to Bezalel and applied some of the ideas he had formulated during his M.A. studies. He used silkscreen techniques, prevalent in modern art at the time, to the medium of enamel. Already then, his tendency to integrate different mediums and advanced technologies in creating art was discernable; a tendency that was reflected more strongly in his use of laser in the '90s. He continued in his position as senior lecturer at Bezalel until 1985. David Gerstein - Fortress, depicting a typical Tel Aviv balcony Gerstein's first exhibition in Israel was held in 1971 at the Engel Gallery in Jerusalem, comprising figurative drawings and watercolors.Amnon Barzel, Ha'aretz, Feb. 19, 1971 Thereafter, he exhibited at Jerusalem's Artist's House in 1972 with large oil paintings dealing with interiors and the seaside, work that received enthusiastic reviews. Among others, Gerstein was compared to David Hockney due to the fact that \\"like Hockney, he, too, had been first and foremost a master drawer with an excellent color sense\\".Meir Ronen, The Jerusalem Post, March 13, 1978 During those years, Gerstein led a struggle to legitimize figurative art, anomalous in the mainly conceptual Israeli art scene.See for example: David Gerstein, Long Live Pluralism\\", Yediot Achronot, March 2, 1978 The conceptual art trend was irrelevant for him and he chose the less accepted orientation at the time, figurative painting. Gerstein numbered among the few artists, such as Avraham Ofek, Ivan Schwebel, Avishai Ayal, Uri Lifschitz, and others, who focused on narrative-figurative painting. At the same period, parallel to conceptualism, an opposite trend developed: hyper- realism, inspired by Israel Hirschberg. Here, too, Gerstein did not find his place. He aspired to creating figurative paintings informed by a personal, free style; an \\"accessible\\" art. Gerstein later explained his approach by comparing it to a literary work whose greatness lay in its different levels, so that it could be enjoyed both as a story as well as on a \\"deeper reading\\". Gerstein sought to make statements about the world and life, inter and intra- relationships and interactions with the environment, and less about statements concerning the language of art, per se. Gerstein painted memories from his past such as his mother riding a bicycle, or a childhood painting by him and his brother. Among his main inspirations was the work of Hanoch Levin who presented life's vanities in a vein of comic irony. Gerstein aspired to do the same in painting: \\"I tried to express in painting what Levin wrote: relationships between men and women, within families‚Ä¶a sort of grotesque painting\\".David Gerstein, Balconies, Domino Pub., 1984 Another inspiration at the time was the painter George Gross, to whom he felt an affinity and who also dealt with what Gerstein termed \\"the human comedy\\". In addition, he was influenced by David Hockney, Fernando Botero and Jos√© Luis Cuevas, who all dealt with the human experience and people' interactions. Figurative painting In the 1970s, Gerstein explored the integration of personal statement with figurative painting, particularly in his watercolors and gouache on paper. At first, these works were intended as sketches for large canvas oil paintings. With time, though, he found interest in working in watercolors on paper, only, and they became his main medium. Gerstein created a series of paintings concerning his childhood based on photographs and memories. Another series dealt with the memory of freedom: his mother riding a bicycle in the streets of Ramat Gan, a motif that developed into a series of bicycle riders in the '90s and afterward. A repetitive motif in work describing home interiors was that of the cat and the vase, which, for the artist, expressed, \\"the placidity of daily routine\\". Both the cat and the flower vase continued to accompany his work decades later. While involved with these motifs Gerstein wanted \\"to escape the Israeli political reality to an Olympian turbulent-free, tranquility\\". In the mid-'70s, he made a series of paintings of people at the beach, influenced both by the artist's childhood memories and observation. Another series of paintings included the landscape of the Ein Kerem neighborhood, where the artist lived at the time, used as a backdrop for compositions abundant with interacting figures in groups and couples. Sculpture David Gerstein - Vehicle, one the artist's first sculptures in the early 1980s Gerstein's aim to portray the daily experience of Israeli life came to fruition in the 1980s. Gerstein figuratively describes chapters from the Israeli experience, derived, among others, from childhood memories in Tel Aviv. The first series depicts Tel Aviv with its Bauhaus-style balconies, with a humoristic irony.Avraham Eilat, Sea, Mud and Salt, National Maritime Museum, Haifa, pub., 2010 This series was based on Gerstein's memories of his parents' generation of \\"little Tel Aviv\\"; people whom he regarded with wonder and humor. These paintings express the tension between the sabra generation of the children and the relatively \\"exilic\\" generation of the parents. The series contain elderly people, the \\"old world\\" reflected in their faces, as seen from the eyes of a sabra child looking at the \\"generation of the desert\\"; the generation that founded the country, having had immigrated at a young age, yet still marked by the heritage of the \\"exile\\". The origins of this series can be found in Gerstein's watercolors and gouache on paper from the '70s, parts of which were adapted to canvas oil paintings. In the '80s, Gerstein developed this into another series of paintings, those of bathers in the Dead Sea, about which Avraham Eilat wrote,\\"the residents of the balconies have gone down to the Dead Sea where they lie about on the shore, covered in mud, exposing their pinkish bodies to the mercy of the sun's rays and the salt and get slowly fried\\".Irena Gordon, Boundless Painting, David Gerstein Sculptures, Gerstein Pub., 2008 Despite the positive response his paintings evoked, both from the critics and the art world, Gerstein felt the need to renew, find new directions and expand his artistic boundaries. During 1980‚Äì1987, while continuing to paint, Gerstein experimented with wood sculptures, which were \\"three-dimensional while preserving a two-dimensional quality\\". Gerstein sought to \\"expand the borders of painting\\" to the domain of the third-dimension. Dissatisfied with his few sculpting experiments, the artist discovered that he could cut and assemble the elements into a type of sculpture in space. The idea came to him during reserve duty while dismantling cardboard boxes containing cartridges. He painted on the inner partition of a box and then reassembled it. From this evolved the idea of painting on large- scale cardboard constructed into sculpture. Following a number of sculptures from cardboard, Gerstein used wood and thin aluminum. Gerstein defines those years as a \\"struggle\\" between painting and sculpture, comparing his relationship to painting as that to a wife, as opposed to his relationship to sculpture: a captivating, but forbidden, affair.Ruti Rubin, \\"From Eli Ohana To Marcel Duchamp\\", Hadashot, March 24, 1987 Gerstein first exhibited these sculptures at the Horace Richter Gallery in 1981. This was a bold step for the thirty-six-year-old painter who had not been known for, or exhibited, sculpture previously. The works were of aluminum and wood, and the subject matter was a continuation of that of the '70s: his mother riding a bicycle, cats, flower vases and various still life elements. In the following years, Gerstein exhibited at two main galleries of the time, Sara Gilat and Ruth Debel, with work reflecting the artist's continued \\"search\\" for a new language integrating painting and three-dimensionality. In 1984 Gerstein traveled to New York, the first time since the conclusion of his studies there, and began working with the art dealer Marilyn Goldberg, who ordered the production of six limited edition aluminum prints titled \\"Art Cats\\". The series included cutouts of cats inspired by those of twelve known artists, from van Gogh to Picasso and Lichtenstein. In the wake of these works, Gerstein was invited to exhibit at the Youth Wing of the Israel Museum in Jerusalem. The exhibit in 1987 was presented under the heading, \\"From Dudu to 3-D\\", comprising sculptures that were \\"colorful, cheerful, amusing and reminiscent of toys or paper cutouts\\".Dana Gilerman, \\"True to the Original\\", Ha'aretz, Nov. 14, 2008 The exhibit was a summary of Gerstein's three-dimensional work of the previous seven years and was a breakthrough for the artist. Most of the exhibited work was purchased by museums abroad and Gerstein was subsequently invited to exhibit in the United States and Canada. Stylistic development David Gerstein - Claustrophobia, created in Paris during Gerstein's residency at the Cit√© internationale des arts, 1990‚Äì1991 While continuing to develop his sculpture in the '90s, Gerstein returned to painting in the style that constituted a direct link to the balconies and the Dead Sea, depicted in the '70s and '80s. The series of automobiles created during this period presents people traveling in a car from the perspective of the spectator \\"peeping\\" in at the passengers through the front windshield. Similar to the motif of peeping into Tel Aviv balconies, here too, Gerstein chooses the perspective of the outsider looking at the driver through the windshield, while at the same time reflecting the surroundings. The series was created in Paris during Gerstein's residency at the Cit√© Internationale des Arts, 1990‚Äì1991. In 1995, after years of woodcutting, Gerstein discovered the use of laser and began cutting metals and painting them in shiny colors taken from the car industry. He worked with Tzaki Rosenfeld, son of Eliezer Rosenfeld, owners of the mythological Rosenfeld Gallery, for seven years. David Gerstein - Infinity Rally He has produced a line of work influenced by sports, such as marathon running, swimming and bicycling (exemplified by the works \\"Tour de France\\", \\"Yellow Shirt\\" and \\"Armstrong\\", after Lance Armstrong). Other motifs are urban landscapes, nature (cows, birds, and flower vases) and human behavior (\\"Heads\\", Jazz Players). His workshop and gallery are located in Jerusalem's Talpiot industrial zone. He is the owner of two galleries, in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. Outdoor Sculptures Momentum, Singapore Ladder of Motifs Gerstein is known for his outdoor sculpture, many of them decorating city squares. His sculptures can be found at the entrance to the Rehovot Mall, Ra'anana Park, Avdat and on the campus of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. His sculpture of a Roman warrior is in Bromford, London. His sculpture in the Singapore business district is 18.5 meters high. Artistic concepts thumbright The Last Great Smoker From the 1970s, Gerstein aspired to create art that spoke to the art world while remaining accessible to the man in the street. His bold use of color came from a desire to \\"copy nature.\\" Gerstein explained that just like the brightly colored fruit or flower in nature attracts insects, so, too, his work was intended to be attractive to the observer. And as the fruit is not solely an object of attraction, but is also a source of vitamins, so, too, his works contain added value. \\"I expressly deal with images of consumerism and the lure of the color is strategic\\". His work \\"Shoe Mania\\", portraying a woman whose hair is composed of shoes is colorful but expresses criticism of Western consumerism. Gerstein maintains that \\"not everything needs to be heavy\\" in art, and that \\"there can be art for pleasure's sake\\", in which its deeper message, if there be, is hidden. Another guiding principle in Gerstein's work is leaving the boundaries of the gallery. In 2002, he began working on unnumbered editions of small-scale, silkscreen sculptures for sale in museum stores at modest prices. According to the artist, \\"High art and low art go together and I want to break the unnatural divide between the museum and the street.\\" Criticism A sculpture by David Gerstein in a Sculpture garden in Ramat Hasharon, Israel Gerstein's use of vibrant, bright colors has been called \\"decorative\\" and \\"commercial.\\" Gerstein says: \\"The forms and colors in my work are my way of communicating. Those who taste the fruit will discover that it is not only beautiful, but also replete with vitamins. My work \\"The Human Circle\\" resembles a huge flower or bouquet, but beneath the surface is a tacit criticism of human life; the insight that we come from nowhere, are going nowhere, and in the meantime, are going around in circles, chasing our tails. Whoever chooses to see the work as a decorative bouquet, is welcome. But if you look at the characters comprising the \\"Human Circle\\", you will see that they are not pretty. In fact, they are even ugly. But the overall picture is beautiful and seductive\\". On his use of serial, as opposed to individual works, Gerstein replies, \\"Warhol made silkscreens\\". It does not really matter if an artist paints a work with his own hands, or if they are painted by assistants or printed. Gerstein believes that \\"everyone deserves art, even art on the level of a silkscreen that's bought the way one would buy a quality wine\\". There are different levels. I don't choose to brand myself as an artist for only the top decile, but for all. It's only right that everyone gets to enjoy art\\".

It is a typical substance secernated in the kidney.  Occurrence  The highest natural concentration of 1-methylnicotinamide found so far is in the alga Undaria pinnatifida. 1-Methylnicotinamide is also present in the Judas Ear fungus and in green tea.  Extraction and production  1-methylnicotinamide can be produced in the liver by nicotinamide N-methyltransferase. The reaction takes place during the metabolism of NAD (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide). NNMT (Nicotinamide N-methyltransferase) is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the NNMT gene. NNMT catalyzes the methylation of nicotinamide and similar compounds using the methyl donor S-adenosyl methionine (SAM-e) to produce S-adenosyl-L- homocysteine (SAH) and 1-methylnicotinamide. NNMT is highly expressed in the human liver.  Use  For a long time, 1-methylnicotinamide was considered a biologically inactive metabolite of nicotinamide. However, various studies show antithrombotic, anti-inflammatory, gastroprotective and vasoprotective properties. 1-Methylnicotinamide is an endogenous activator of prostacyclin synthesis and can therefore regulate trombolytic and inflammatory processes in the cardiovascular system. It inhibits platelet-dependent thrombosis through a mechanism involving cyclooxygenase-2 and prostacyclin and increases nitric oxide bioavailability in the endothelium. Animal experiments with diabetic rats have shown that 1-methylnicotinamide has a positive effect on degenerative changes in the brain and cognitive performance can be thus longer maintained. Experiments with the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans showed that the addition of 1-methylnicotinamide can extend their lifespan. This may possibly be attributed to increased free radical binding and the resulting reduced oxidative stress. 1-Methylnicotinamide is used in cosmetic products such as hair and skin care products and as a dietary supplement.

In 1948, IULA's secretariat moved from Ghent to The Hague in the Netherlands, where it remained until 2004. The United Towns Organisation (UTO) (French: F√©d√©ration mondiale des cit√©s unies (FMCU)) was set up in 1957 in Aix-les-Bains, France. It was initially known as the World Federation of Twin Cities (French: F√©d√©ration mondiale des villes jumel√©es). In 1984, then President of the Regional Council of Ile-de-France, Michel Giraud, convened the first Metropolis Congress. The constituent Congress of Metropolis was held in Montreal in April 1985, and was attended by 14 founding member cities:UCLG delegation led by Kadir Topba≈ü meeting with UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon at UN, 23 April 2012. Abidjan, Addis Ababa, Barcelona, Buenos Aires, Cairo, Colombo, Ile-de-France, London, Los Angeles, Mexico, Montreal, New York, Tokyo and Turin. The Metropolis secretariat was initially established in Montreal, moving to Barcelona under the presidency of then Mayor of Barcelona, Joan Clos, in 2000. In 2004, three international associations of local and regional governments ‚Äì the International Union of Local Authorities (IULA), United Towns Organisation (UTO), and Metropolis ‚Äì agreed to come together to form a single organization at UCLG's founding congress. The united organization started under the leadership of its founding President Bertrand Delano√´, mayor of Paris, serving two three-year terms (2004-2010) and continued under Kadir Topba≈ü of Istanbul (2010-2016).  Organization and membership  UCLG is a membership organization with a democratic, federal structure. Its members include individual local and regional governments and their national associations. UCLG's governing bodies are made up of locally elected leaders, chosen by their peers in elections by UCLG members. = Sections = FLACMA-organized Latin American Congress of Local Authorities in Santiago de Chile (March 27‚Äì29, 2019).LATIN AMERICAN LOCAL AUTHORITIES CONGRESS Overview slide with participants of 2014 Metropolis World Congress in Hyderabad, 6-10 Oct. 2014 UCLG Euroasia President Mayor Metshin of Kazan speaking at UN GA Local and Regional Governments‚Äô Forum NYC 24‚Äì25 September 2019 # Africa Section (UCLG Africa)UCLG Africa # Asia Pacific Section (UCLG-ASPAC)UCLG-ASPAC # Eurasia Section (UCLG Eurasia) # Europe Section - Council of European Municipalities and Regions (CEMR) # Middle East and West Asia Section) # Latin American Coordination of Local Authorities for Unity in Diversity (CORDIAL, co-hosted by FLACMA & Mercosur Cities Network) # North America Section (UCLG - Noram, hosted by Federation of Canadian Municipalities) # Metropolitan Section (Metropolis) # Forum of Regions (UCLG Regions) = Governing Bodies =  General Assembly   World Council  2018 UCLG World Council meeting in Madrid, 5-8 Nov. 2018.Madrid - World Council 2018 UCLG's main policy-making body is the World Council.

It was the first standardized format for industrial/non-broadcast VTRs using a helical scan system employing open reel tape. Previously, each manufacturer of machines in this market used a different proprietary format, with differing tape speeds, scanner drum diameters, bias frequencies, tracking head placement, and so on, although most used 1/2\\" wide tape. As a result, video tapes recorded on one make and/or model of VTR could only be interchanged with other machines using that specific format, hampering compatibility. For example, a reel of tape recorded on a Panasonic machine would not play on a Sony machine, and vice versa. The EIAJ-1 standard ended this incompatibility, giving those manufacturers a standardized format, interchangeable with almost all VTRs subsequently brought to market around that time. The format offered black-and- white (and later colour) video recording and playback on 1/2‚Ä≥ magnetic tape on a 7‚Ä≥ diameter open reel, with portable units using smaller 5‚Ä≥ diameter reels. Uses The EIAJ-1 standard paved the way for consumer oriented non- professional analog video recording technology to become more affordable and widespread, with many businesses, schools, government agencies, hospitals, and even some consumers adopting the format in the early 1970s. Some of the first public-access television cable stations that started up around that time used EIAJ-1 equipment extensively, due to its portability, low cost, and versatility. The original Sony Portapak, model CV-2000, used a proprietary format, but was later superseded by an EIAJ-1 compatible version, the AV-3400. Panasonic 1/2 inch VTR, Model NV3130 at DC Video, , Variations When EIAJ-1 was standardized, no videocassette recorders had yet been introduced. One of the main drawbacks to the format was the need to carefully thread the end of the tape around the head drum, through a gap between the capstan and pinch roller, and around a variety of guides and tensioners. If the user made any errors in doing this, the machine would malfunction and the tape could become damaged. So, another version, EIAJ-2, was released later on that used a single-reel cartridge (with the take-up reel being built into the VTR) instead of an open take up reel. Otherwise, the recording specifications were exactly the same. Successors By 1971, Sony introduced the first successful videocassette system, the U-matic format. The U-Matic system offered many advantages over EIAJ-1, including color recording as standard, stereo sound, and automatic tape threading. However, EIAJ-1 equipment remained popular for a number of years as it was less expensive than U-Matic machines or tape, EIAJ-1 equipment was lighter and more compact, and portable battery operated EIAJ-1 machines with companion video cameras were already available (such as the AV-3400, mentioned above). It was not until the mid-1970s that portable U-Matic machines and compatible portable color cameras were introduced. Neither the EIAJ-1 nor the U-Matic format were ever used in a camcorder (one piece) camera recorder unit, because of the size and weight of the mechanism involved. The recorder and camera were always separate units, connected by a multi conductor cable. The advent of the camcorder did not occur until the introduction of smaller, lighter cassette formats, such as Betamax and VHS.

DMAN calculates the Target Take Off Times (TTOT) and the Target Startup Approval Times (TSAT) taking multiple constraints and preferences into account. As a result, the DMAN provides a planned departure flow with the goal to maintain an optimal throughput at the runway, reduce queuing at holding point and distribute the information to various stakeholders at the airport (i.e. the airline, ground handling and Air Traffic Control (ATC)). EUROCONTROL have defined DMAN as follows: \\"DMAN is a planning system to improve departure flows at airports by calculating the Target Take Off Time (TTOT) and Target Start-up Approval Time (TSAT) for each flight, taking multiple constraints and preferences into account.\\"  Benefits  The DMAN has several benefits which may vary depending on the local conditions at an airport. Generally the main benefits are: =Environmental= Reduced emissions since the Target Startup Approval Times (TSAT) from a DMAN calculation results in reduced queuing at the holding point at the runway. Aircraft can therefore reduce their overall taxi time from their gate/stand to their actual take off from the runway and minimise their fuel emissions. =Predictability= DMAN adds predictability to the departure flow resulting in optimised resource management for ground handling, airline operators etc. The DMAN builds upon the EUROCONTROL A-CDM process and is an enabler for improving the quality of the information shared by the stakeholders at the airport. By creating a stable departure sequence the different operators can plan their work more efficiently. =Reactivity= DMAN enables an improved reactivity of unforeseen events and can therefore reduce the negative impact of such an event (e.g. instantaneous runway closure due to suspected debris, weather changes etc.). By constantly monitoring and distributing information the DMAN can support the ATC in an airport to make a new plan based on the current situation and quickly distribute the information to the different operators and stakeholders at the airport. =Safety= During peak hour operations the DMAN have shown a positive impact on ATC workload since the DMAN holds aircraft at gate and as a result reduces the amount of traffic taxiing simultaneously.

History Thirty years after the penal colony was established at Sydney, John Oxley, the colony's surveyor-general surveyed the Hastings and Manning River valleys for settlement. Soon after, woodcutters in search of the highly prized red cedar, pushed into the Stewarts River valley and the densely wooded valley that subsequently become known as Hannam Vale. The first recorded selection of land was by Thomas Crossingham in the Stewarts River area in 1866. G.A Scott chose a block of in 1873, but was unable to complete the purchase, so the block was regazetted in 1886 and purchased by J. H. Lambert. The first permanent settler in the valley was John Haydon who purchased along the Stewarts River in 1882. Haydon's son Bill became known locally as the 'Cedar King'. He was the first woodcutter to use a truck as a hauler during the 1930s. Other settlers followed the woodcutters into the valley, clearing land for growing crops such as maize, arrowroot, potatoes and vegetables. Most of the early settlers also planted a variety of fruit trees, especially oranges, and kept cattle for dairy farming. By the mid-1930s, dairy farming and logging had become the principal activities in the larger Hannam Vale area of Stewarts River, Hannam Vale and Waitui. Hannam Vale was given its name by Francis Redman, who operated the post office. When he found that the name \\"Upper Stewarts River\\" was too long to fit on the mail stamp, he used his farm's name, \\"Hannam Vale\\", instead. Redman was also instrumental in having the Hannam Vale School's first teacher appointed by providing a residence on his property. Redman's son subsequently provided a half acre block of land on which the Hannam Vale Community Hall was erected. The primary school was first established as a one-teacher \\"provisional\\" school in 1899. It was afforded permanent status and its original buildings erected in 1907; since then a number of other buildings have been added. Most recently, a small building used as a church in Waitui was donated to the School and is now used as a school hall. Present day As dairy farming has become less lucrative, so more people have begun to use the valley purely for residential purposes, either working close by, or commuting to jobs in the nearby towns of Taree and Port Macquarie. More recently, following deregulation of the dairy industry in 2001, a number of the older dairy farms have ceased to operate; this has been closely associated with growing numbers of city-based people purchasing smaller lots for recreational farming, as well as the establishment of bed and breakfast accommodation in the area. The region's high rainfall and dairy farming legacy, along with associated planting of grasses such as kikuyu, is the reason for the present day lush-green landscape. The epicentre of Hannam Vale is the junction of Hannam Vale Road and Deep Creek Road, ten minutes from the Pacific Highway at either John's River or Moorland. The most prominent features of this area are the public school, general store, Salvation Army chapel and community centre. Opposite the Public School is the Hannam Vale General Store. Built in 1914, the store is a social centre of the wider Hannam Vale area. Just east of the Public School is the Rural Fire Service Brigade Shed and further east again, off Hannam Vale Road, is the entrance way to the Hannam Vale Recreational Reserve. Just two to three hundred metres to the north-west of the School on Hannam Vale Road is the Hannam Vale Community Hall, the home of community meetings in the area, as well as special events such as dances, art exhibitions and fundraising activity. Around the corner from the Public School in Deep Creek Road is the original (1914) Salvation Army Chapel and newer (2002) larger Church Hall. Present day farming activities include beef cattle, small-scale dairying, and macadamia nuts. Commercial forestry also continues, with the Lansdowne State Forest bordering the village. Several national parks border the area. In particular, Coorabakh National Park has waterfalls, and panoramic views from lookouts such Flat Top Rock, Vincent's and Newby's lookouts.

A well-known member of this family was Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P√©rigord (1754‚Äì1838), who achieved distinction as a French statesman and diplomat. The family name became extinct in 2003 upon the death of Violette de Talleyrand-P√©rigord. Origins A cadet branch of the family of sovereign counts of P√©rigord, they took their name from the estate of P√©rigord owned by these counts, and date back to Boso I, count of la Marche. The first to have borne this name was H√©lie de Talleyrand, who lived around 1100. Their motto was \\"Re que Diou\\" (\\"Nothing But God\\"): their ancestor was one of the great men of the kingdom of France and participated in the election of Hugh Capet as king of France. An anecdote reports that Capet asked Boson \\"Mais qui donc t'as fait comte?\\" (\\"But who then made you a count?\\") to which he replied \\"Ceux l√† m√™me qui t'ont fait Roi\\" (\\"The same ones who made you King\\"). The P√©rigords considered their entitlements to emanate from the same power that entitled the French kings themselves to govern.
